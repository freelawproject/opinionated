He served from 1973 until his honorable discharge in 1977. While in the Navy, Mr. Maddick completed the requirements for the status of Diver Second Class and participated in numerous diving activities. The Navy discharged Maddick with a clean bill of health.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Maddick now suffers from idiopathic avascular necrosis of the right femoral head \u2014 a degenerative bone disease. Believing this ailment to be a result of his Navy diving activities, Maddick brought this pro se action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the United States and- against two individually-named Naval officers, W.R. Patterson, LCDR, and Gregory R. Kusic, LCDR.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maddick alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by (1) exposing him to conditions which increased his risk of contracting the disease; (2) discharging him without either detecting the condition or warning him of his increased risk; and (3) failing to warn him of or monitor him for the condition after his discharge. The district court construed his claim against the United States to state a cause of action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA); it construed his claim against the Naval officers to state a cause of action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). It then dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, stating that Maddick\u2019s claims were for injuries incident to his military service and therefore were barred by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), and <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987). We agree that <em>Feres </em>and <em>Stanley </em>bar Maddick\u2019s claims and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Walden v. Bartlett, </em>840 F.2d 771, 772-73 (10th Cir.1988). The Supreme Court has long held that \u201cthe FTCA does not waive the United States\u2019 immunity for \u2018injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaw v. United States, </em>854 F.2d 360, 361 (10th Cir. 1988) (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159). In <em>Stanley, </em>the Supreme Court held that the military enjoys an immunity to <em>Bivens </em>claims that is coextensive with its <em>Feres </em>immunity. <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. at 684, 107 S.Ct. at 3064. We therefore review' the record to determine whether Maddick\u2019s claims are for injuries incident to his military service. If we find that they are, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine applies, and the federal judiciary is without subject matter jurisdiction to hear any of the claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">It is clear that Maddick\u2019s diving activities and his military medical treatment were activities incident to his military service. <em>See Madsen v. United States ex rel. United States Army, Corps of Engs., </em>841 F.2d 1011, 1013-14 (10th Cir.1987) (military medical care is incident to service). Thus, <em>Feres </em>bars Maddick\u2019s first and second-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>claims and the district court did not have jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Maddick\u2019s third claim is more esoteric. Maddick argues that the Navy had a separate duty to warn him or monitor him after his discharge, and that this duty is inherently not incident to his service, thus precluding a <em>Feres </em>defense. In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>348 U.S. 110, 112-13, 75 S.Ct. 141, 143-44, 99 L.Ed. 139 (1954), the Supreme Court held that <em>Feres </em>was inapplicable to torts that arose <em>after </em>the completion of an individual\u2019s military service. We recognize that some courts have embraced this rationale in permitting post-discharge \u201cfailure to warn\u201d claims against the military. <em>See Everett v. United States, </em>492 F.Supp. 318 (S.D.Ohio 1980); <em>Thornwell v. United States, </em>471 F.Supp. 344 (D.D.C.1979). We do not reach the viability of a post-discharge failure to warn theory, however, because Maddick does not present us with such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A duty to warn \u201carises only at the time when the Government first knew or should have known of the hazardous condition, and any breach of that duty begins and ends at that time.\u201d <em>Heilman v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 1104, 1107 (3d Cir. 1984). The District of Columbia Circuit itself explained that <em>Thornwell </em>holds only that a second, post-discharge tort survives <em>Feres </em>where it occurs \u201cin its entirety\u201d after discharge. <em>Lombard v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 215, 220 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1118, 103 S.Ct. 3086, 77 L.Ed.2d 1347 (1983). Where a claimant alleges only a post-discharge continuation of that in-service tort, it too is barred by <em>Feres. See Heilman, </em>731 F.2d at 1108-09; <em>Gaspard v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1097, 1101 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 975, 104 S.Ct. 2354, 80 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984); <em>Lombard </em>690 F.2d at 220; <em>Stanley v. CIA, </em>639 F.2d 1146, 1155 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In his pleadings, which we must accept as true, Maddick clearly states that the Navy knew as early as 1945 of the increased risk of degenerative bone disease caused by diving. Maddick states that, although the Navy knew of the danger, \u201cat no time during plaintiff\u2019s enlistment was he advised or warned of the probability of contracting dysbaric osteonecrosis pursuant to his diving duties.\u201d Maddick\u2019s complaint plainly alleges that the Navy breached its \u201cduty to warn\u201d both prior to his diving activities and prior to his discharge. Thus, any post-discharge claim Maddick may have would be a continuation of the original claim and therefore also is barred by <em>Feres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Based on our review of the record, and for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court for the District of Colorado is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-13\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 34(a); 10th Cir.R. 34.1.9. The c\u00e1se is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-17\">. Patterson and Kusic seek dismissal of this appeal against them as individuals, asserting that improper service of process has deprived this court of personal jurisdiction. Because we find this court to be without subject matter jurisdiction over Maddick\u2019s claims, we do not reach the merits of their motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
