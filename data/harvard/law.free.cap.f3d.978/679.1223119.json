He petitioned the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) for review of his suspension, which he alleged was taken by the agency in retaliation for his filing of a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Administrative Judge (AJ) dismissed Spruill\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the filing of such an EEOC complaint was not within the ambit of 5 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u00a7 2302(b)(8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Docket No. DE122191W0104, January 30, 1991). Since Spruill did not file a petition for review with the MSPB, the initial decision of the AJ became the final decision of the MSPB. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Section 2302(b)(8) describes certain activities which have come to be known as \u2018whistleblowing,\u2019 and prohibits adverse personnel actions against federal government employees in reprisal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for such activities. Should an employee believe such a prohibited reprisal action has been taken, Congress has provided a direct appeal route to the MSPB, called the Individual Right of Action (IRA), under \u00a7 1221. Absent the benefit of that special provision for whistleblow-ers, Spruill would have no right to MSPB review of this particular agency sanction. Spruill appeals the MSPB\u2019s determination that he does not have the benefit of the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">During the course of this appeal, the DVA, Spruill\u2019s employing agency, filed a motion requesting that the caption in this case should be reformed to designate the DVA, rather than the MSPB, as the party respondent. This motion has consequences considerably beyond the proper titling of the court papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Spruill\u2019s appeal thus raises two questions of some significance, questions not previously addressed by this court. For the reasons given, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision regarding jurisdiction, and deny the motion of the DVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AYv9\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"AYf\">Spruill is employed by the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona. On November 7, 1989, he filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging discriminatory treatment, based on his supervisor\u2019s decision to shift Spruill\u2019s starting and quitting times back one half hour. Spruill alleged in his complaint that this seemingly innocuous alteration was discrimination based upon his handicapping condition because it would interfere with his physical therapy\u2014 he is a disabled veteran. Furthermore, Spruill alleged discriminatory intent based upon his race \u2014 he is black.- The merits of these allegations are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Almost a year after the EEOC complaint was filed, the DVA on August 28, 1990, proposed a five-day suspension, and on September 18, 1990, suspended Spruill for three days without pay. The DVA stated that the sanction was for Spruill\u2019s abuse of sick leave. Spruill, alleging that the suspension was in reprisal for his filing of the EEOC complaint, sought help from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) pursuant to \u00a7 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">The OSC is the office specifically charged with investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices within the Federal Government. That office in a letter to Spruill declined to consider his case, however, referring him instead to the EEOC process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-16\">Your allegation of discrimination and reprisal for filing an EEOC complaint is of a prohibited personnel practice within the investigative jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2302(b)(1) and (b)(9). <em>However, it was not intended that this\u25a0 office duplicate or bypass the procedures established in the agen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>des and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for resolving such discrimination complaints. </em>Therefore it is the general policy of the Special Counsel not to take action on such allegations of discrimination; they are more appropriately resolved through the EEOC process. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1810.1. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Spruill then petitioned the MSPB for review of his three-day suspension pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 1221, the Individual Right of Action (IRA) provision. Ordinarily a three-day suspension would not be appealable to the MSPB. Section 7503. Under the IRA, however, such a personnel action, if taken against an employee \u201cas a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8),\u201d entitles the employee to seek corrective action from the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Spruill argued before the MSPB that filing an EEOC complaint constituted protected whistleblowing activity under \u00a7 2302(b)(8), citing <em>Williams v. Department of Defense (Williams I), </em>45 M.S.P.R. 146 (1990), which had so held, and that the MSPB thus had jurisdiction under the IRA to hear and decide his appeal from the agency\u2019s sanction. However, while Spruill\u2019s appeal was still before the Administrative Judge (AJ), the MSPB reversed its position in <em>Williams I, </em>and adopted the contrary position. <em>Williams v. Department of Defense (Williams II), </em>46 M.S.P.R. 549 (1991). The AJ accordingly dismissed Spruill\u2019s appeal on January 30, 1991, citing <em>Williams II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">B. Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The CSRA, enacted in 1978, set up an extensive framework of merit principles and personnel procedures, designed in large part to \u201cgive agencies greater ability and flexibility to remove or to discipline employees who engage in misconduct ... or whose work performance is unacceptable.\u201d <em>Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>769 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed.Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1108, 106 S.Ct. 1514, 89 L.Ed.2d 913 (1986). At the same time, the Act detailed a host of \u201cprohibited personnel practices,\u201d actions which are prohibited to be taken against an employee. These are spelled out in a number of paragraphs in subsection 2302(b). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)-(11). Paragraph (b)(8) provides protection against agency reprisal for what is known as whistleblowing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">In 1989, after extensive hearings regarding the effectiveness of the CSRA provisions for protection of whistleblowers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA). The WPA substantially changed the role of the OSC, revised the substantive provisions of the whistleblower defense, and created a new route in whistleblowing cases for employees to take in appealing agency discipline\u2014 the Individual Right of Action (IRA). Through the IRA, employees previously excluded from MSPB review gained access both to the MSPB and the- augmented enforcement powers provided through the IRA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">But the benefits of the IRA are only available to Spruill if the prohibited act is one described in \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Thus, if Spruill is to have MSPB review of his three-day suspension, he must demonstrate, contrary to the MSPB position in <em>Williams II, </em>that the activity which triggered the alleged reprisal falls within the statutory definition of the prohibited acts described in \u00a7 2302(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnL\">A. The Caption Issue</p>\n<p id=\"AxN\">We turn first to the DVA motion to reform the caption, that is, to designate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Department of Veterans Affairs as the proper respondent before this court. . The designation of the proper respondent is not simply a question of getting the name of the case right. It determines which agency and whose lawyers \u2014 and therefore whose policies and practices \u2014 are represented in the appeal. The issue is not a new one under the CSRA, although this case raises it in a new context, that of a claim for relief under the IRA provisions. Because in this context the question is one of first impression, \"we examine it at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Central to the dispute- are two different provisions of Title 5, each of which purports to authorize judicial review of MSPB actions. One of these provisions is found in the original CSRA. Section 7703 is entitled \"Judicial review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board.\u201d Subsection 7703(a)(1) states the employee\u2019s general right of judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">Any employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"afl-dedup-0\">The next subsection, 7703(a)(2), then indicates the proper respondent for the appeal pursuant to \u00a7 7703(a)(1). Prior to its amendment in 1989, 7703(a)(2) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">The Board shall be named as respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision issued by the Board under section 7701. In review of a final order or decision issued under section 7701, the agency responsible for taking the action appealed to the Board shall be the named respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">(The reference to section 7701 is to the general provision for MSPB review of agency personnel actions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">While seemingly straightforward, the application of this language to particular cases was subject over the years to some dispute. Prior to 1988, \u00a7 7703(a)(2) had been understood to mean that the proper respondent in this court ordinarily was not the Board itself, but the agency responsible for taking the action which was the subject of the appeal. Thus, in the usual case this meant that the employing agency was the respondent, since it was the agency\u2019s personnel action that triggered the decision on the merits. However, if during the course of the MSPB proceedings the final decision or order turned on the MSPB\u2019s procedures or jurisdiction, on an appeal to this court the MSPB was held to be the proper respondent since the relevant \u201cagency action\u201d was that of the MSPB. <em>See Hopkins v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>725 F.2d 1368, 1372 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Peterson v. Department of Energy, </em>737 F.2d 1021, 1022 (Fed.Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied </em>469 U.S. 1189, 105 S.Ct. 960, 83 L.Ed.2d 966 (1985); <em>cf. Tiffany v. Department of Navy, </em>795 F.2d 67, 69 (Fed.Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">In 1988 the Federal Circuit, in <em>Hagmeyer v. Department of Treasury, </em>852 F.2d 531 (Fed.Cir.1988), sitting <em>in banc, </em>overturned the <em>Hopkins </em>line of cases, and ruled that only the employing agency should be the respondent on review of all decisions rendered under \u00a7 7701. <em>Id. </em>at 539. This was said to be dictated by the plain meaning and legislative history of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">However, the effect of this ruling was promptly overturned by Congress in a 1989 amendment to \u00a7 7703(a)(2). Congress amended the subsection to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">The Board shall be named as respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision <em>on the merits of the underlying personnel action, or on a request for attorney fees, in which case the agency responsible for taking the personnel action shall be the respondent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">(The newly enacted language is emphasized).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>In <em>Amin v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>951 F.2d 1247 (Fed.Cir.1991), the court was called upon to apply the amended \u00a7 7703(a)(2). Two petitioners (whose cases were consolidated) appealed their individual removals to the MSPB. When the petitions for review were filed in this court, the Clerk named the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Postal Service, the respective employing agencies, as the respondents. By letter to the Clerk, the MSPB requested the cases be recaptioned to designate the MSPB as the respondent in each case, citing \u00a7 7703(a)(2). The Clerk did so. The agencies then moved the court to reform the caption to reflect the employing agency as the respondent in each appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Judge Cowen, writing for the court, engaged in a thorough and careful analysis of \u00a7 7703(a)(2) and its troubled history. The court concluded that there was no question that the 1989 amendment was in response to the <em>Hagmeyer </em>decision, and the court had no difficulty in understanding from the amendment and its legislative history what Congress had in mind. <em>Amin, </em>951 F.2d at 1251. The result, said the court, was essentially to reinstate, with a minor exception, the <em>pre-Hagmeyer </em>rule of <em>Hopkins</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cCongress intended that the Board shall be the respondent in all appeals involving its jurisdiction or its rulings on procedural questions, but that in appeals involving underlying personnel actions and attorney fees, the employing agencies should be the respondents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">With regard to a case in which the appeal to this court involved both the merits and the validity of MSPB procedures, the <em>Amin </em>court, citing <em>Hopkins, </em>noted that \u201cthis court has followed the practice of naming the employing agency as the respondent in cases \u2018involving issues both on the merits of an agency\u2019s action and on the MSPB procedures____\u2019 \u201d 951 F.2d at 1252. <em>See, e.g., Howell v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>785 F.2d 282, 285 (Fed.Cir.1986). The <em>Amin </em>court concluded, \u201c[tjherefore, we hold that in cases where, as in this case, the appeal from the Board\u2019s decision presents mixed questions of procedure and the merits of an agency action, the employing agency is the proper respondent.\u201d 951 F.2d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">In cases controlled by \u00a7 7703(a)(2), then, <em>Amin </em>provides the necessary guidelines for determining who is the proper respondent: if only MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, it is the Board; when the underlying merits are involved, it is the employing agency; when both are involved, it is the employing agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">At the beginning of this discussion we noted that there were two statutory provisions in Title 5 central to this dispute. One is \u00a7 7703 and its subsections, which have just been discussed. The other is \u00a7 1221(h)(1), added in 1989 as part of the IRA. It is the presence of this second provision that takes this case out of the <em>Amin </em>context, and requires further consideration of the question of determining the proper respondent. Subsection 1221(h), paragraph (1), parrots \u00a7 7703(a)(1), the general provision, of the CSRA providing for judicial review of MSPB decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-14\">An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Board under this section may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee of applicant reasonably believes evidences\u2014 (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs____ (9) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of\u2014 (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule or regulation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Paragraph (2) of subsection (h) states that the review \u201cshall be filed with such court and within such time as provided for under section 7703(b);\u201d \u00a7 7703(b) specifies, with one exception not relevant here, that review is in the Federal Circuit, and sets a 30-day filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">The DVA argument is premised basically on the proposition that this case comes to us from the MSPB under the special provisions of the IRA, and not under the general review authority of \u00a7 7703(a)(1). The DVA argues that, since this case arises under \u00a7 1221 with its own independent authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>for </em>review in the Federal Circuit provided by \u00a7 1221(h), the provisions for designating the proper respondent set out in \u00a7 7703(a)(2) are not applicable; they are applicable only to cases appealed under the authority of \u00a7 7703(a)(1). Thus, says the DVA, we can decide the correct rule for determining who is the proper respondent free of the strictures of \u00a7 7703(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The MSPB, on the other hand, argues that \u00a7 7703(a)(1) is the basis for <em>all </em>appeals of MSPB decisions, and that the duplicative language of \u00a7 1221(h) providing for review in the Federal Circuit is mere surplusage-cautionary duplication of the pre-existing review authority of \u00a7 7703(a)(1). Since, argues the MSPB, Congress had before it at the same time both the amendment to \u00a7 7703(a)(2) which overturned the <em>Hagmeyer </em>rule and the new provisions of the IRA, Congress would have stated in the IRA a different rule for respondents if it intended one.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We need not decide which of these theories of appellate review is the correct one, that is whether, for purposes of determining the proper respondent, appeals under the IRA come to this court under authority of \u00a7 1221(h)(1) or under authority of \u00a7 7703(a)(1). Clearly, if the appeal is authorized under \u00a7 7703(a)(1) the rules for determining the proper respondent are governed by \u00a7 7703(a)(2), as explicated in <em>Amin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">If, on the other hand, the case comes here under the authority of \u00a7 1221(h) of the IRA, there is no provision in that section of the statute comparable to \u00a7 7703(a)(2). In other words, in absence of Congressional instruction, the DVA is correct that this court is left to determine as a matter of first impression what should be the governing rule for designating the respondent. Given this, says the DVA, the correct rule is to name the employing agency. As a matter of policy, in the DVA\u2019s view, the MSPB should be kept in its role of neutral adjudicator and not advocate, whatever the issue is on appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">We do not agree with the DVA\u2019s view of the matter. Even if we were to consider that the appeal came to us under \u00a7 1221(h) in isolation from \u00a7 7703(a)(1), we have no difficulty in following the lead of the <em>Amin </em>court in applying the principle of <em>Hopkins. </em>Admittedly that rule was announced as an interpretation of \u00a7 7703(a)(2), which subsection does address the question of who should be the respondent. The IRA in \u00a7 1221 does not expressly address the question at all. However, there are good reasons for applying the <em>Hopkins/Amin </em>rule nevertheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The question of what are the controlling criteria for determining the proper party respondent is the same question whether the appeal comes to us under the authority of \u00a7 7703 or \u00a7 1221. Congress, when faced with the rule of <em>Hagmeyer </em>as the controlling criterion for appeals under the general authority of \u00a7 7703(a)(1), promptly reinstated the <em>Hopkins </em>rule. The same arguments in favor of the <em>Hagmeyer </em>rule made here by the DVA were presented at the Congressional hearings on the issue, and were rejected by Congress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By applying the <em>Hopkins </em>rule here as well, we give full credence to the expressed will of Congress and maintain a consistency of approach regardless of the underlying source of appellate jurisdiction. The language of the two acts supports this, since the grant of jurisdiction language in the one is virtually identical with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Furthermore, application of the <em>Hopkins </em>rule to IRA app\u00e9als produces a functionally sensible process. It gives authority to shape the litigation to the agency most affected by the outcome. In most cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>that will be the employing agency. Identification of the proper respondent will be obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">It is true that a rigid rule such as that invoked in <em>Hagmeyer </em>might be easier to administer in that it would leave no room for question. But such rigidity may have greater risk of causing problems than the more functional rule of <em>Hopkins. </em>The benefit of having in the system some discretion to ensure that the agency with the primary interest in the particular outcome is represented outweighs the possible costs of occasional dispute resolution when the agencies concerned cannot agree on where that primary interest lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In short, then, it does not matter under which of these theories of appellate jurisdiction an appeal reaches this court, the result will be the same. If the issue on appeal is solely one of the procedure or jurisdiction of the MSPB, then the proper respondent is the MSPB. If the issue is solely the merits of the underlying agency action, the agency is the proper respondent. If the case raises a mixture of these issues, <em>i.e., </em>if the merits of the agency action are reached by the MSPB, and at the same time a matter of important MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, <em>Amin </em>teaches that the\u2019 employing agency is the proper respondent. In such a case, the MSPB need not be unrepresented since it may request intervenor status, or as was done in <em>Hagmeyer </em>in absence of a motion to intervene, be- given status as amicus curiae.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Before closing this part of the case, it is important to clarify what is meant by the phrase \u201cthe procedure or jurisdiction\u201d of the MSPB as the governing criteria for designating the proper party respondent. The term \u201cprocedure\u201d is generally well-understood. It is the meaning of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d that may cause misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">\u201cJurisdiction\u201d is a term that is one of the most slippery in the legal lexicon. It takes on different connotations depending upon the context. When we speak here of an issue involving the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the MSPB, we are referring to the power of the MSPB to hear and decide a case\u2014 subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Stokes v. Federal Aviation Admin., </em>761 F.2d 682, 685 (Fed.Cir.1985) (\u201cJurisdiction means the right or power of a tribunal to act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">Sometimes the question of subject matter jurisdiction gets confused with the question of entitlement to relief, that is, whether a cause of action has been stated in the complaint, or later proved. For purposes of this discussion, precision requires that the distinction between these ideas be clearly drawn. In response to plaintiffs complaint, defendant may argue that the plaintiffs chosen forum lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. (This may be raised, for example, by motion under Fed. R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(1)). A decision by the forum that the facts as alleged do not fall within its subject matter jurisdiction is properly characterized as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Defendant may also argue that the complaint\u2019s factual, allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and again this may be raised by motion. Fed. R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(6). Assuming that jurisdiction has not been challenged, or if challenged, jurisdiction has been found to exist on the basis of well-pleaded allegations in the complaint, a decision by the forum that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a decision on the merits of the pleaded cause. By like token, if plaintiff\u2019s later proofs fail with regard to an essential factual allegation, a decision against the plaintiff is a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Confusion may arise when the factual allegations that constitute the cause of action include allegations which are necessary to establish jurisdiction. While the practical result of a dismissal for want of jurisdiction may in some cases be the same as a dismissal for failure to state a claim, the legal consequences can be substantially different.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">This important distinction between lack of jurisdictional power and the failure to state or prove a claim for relief has been drawn in a number of cases. In <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 71 S.Ct. 692, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951), Justice Jackson, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">As frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter, the question whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with the question whether the complaint states a cause of action____ Petitioner asserted a cause of action under the Power Act. To determine whether that claim is well founded, the District Court must take jurisdiction, whether its ultimate resolution is to be in the affirmative or the negative. If the complaint raises a federal question, the mere claim confers power to decide that it has no merit, as well as to decide that it has.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 249. The Court quoted from Justice Holmes: \u201c[I]f the plaintiff really makes a substantial claim under an act of Congress there is jurisdiction whether the claim ultimately be held good or bad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting from <em>The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., </em>228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S.Ct. 410, 412, 57 L.Ed. 716 (1913)). The Court concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0l-dedup-0\">We think there was power in the District Court to decide whether the claims so grounded constitute a cause of action maintainable in federal court and, if so, whether it is sustained on the facts. We think a direction [by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals] to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was error and that it should not stand as a precedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-9\"><em>Id. Accord Amgen, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>902 F.2d 1532, 1536, 14 USPQ2d 1734, 1738 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>773 F.2d 313, 316 (Fed.Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1049, 106 S.Ct. 1271, 89 L.Ed.2d 580 (1986). <em>See also Ralston Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>169 Ct.Cl. 119, 340 F.2d 663 (Ct.Cl.), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 950, 85 S.Ct. 1803, 14 L.Ed.2d 723 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In the case of <em>Do-Well Machine Shop, Inc. v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 637, 639-40 (Fed.Cir.1989), the issue was whether a successful affirmative defense of a time bar, raised by the Government against a claim for money due under a contract, went to the jurisdiction of the forum, or was a question of failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. This court held it was not a matter of jurisdiction, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">The distinction between lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon-which relief can be granted, is an'important one: \u201c[T]he court must assume jurisdiction to decide whether the allegations state a cause of action on which the court can grant relief as well as to determine issues of fact arising in the controversy. Jurisdiction, therefore, is not defeated as respondents seem to contend, by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover....\u201d <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">To the extent a successful claim against the government requires compliance with all statutory elements of the claim, failure of proof of an element of the cause of action means the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks. To conclude in such a case that the petitioner loses because the forum is \u201cwithout jurisdiction\u201d is to obscure the nature of the defect. It would be more accurate to conclude that the petitioner has failed to prove the necessary elements of a cause for which relief could be granted. The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed \u2014 as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims. As was said in <em>Ralston Steel, </em>\u201c[wjhere an Act of \u2022 Congress ... or an executive regulation ... arguably confers such rights [to relief] upon the claimant, the court will assume jurisdiction and decide his case on the merits, even though the defendant may ultimately prevail.\u201d 340 F.2d at 667-68. <em>Cf. Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 108 S.Ct. 2166,. 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (under the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint rule,\u201d whether a district court has federal-question jurisdiction over a claim \u201cmust be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiffs statements of his own claim in the bill or declaration____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Unfortunately, in suits against the Federal Government these two notions have not always been kept separate. Failure to prove a claim,- it is sometimes said, means that the claimant did not come within the scope of the authorized waiver of sovereign immunity, and thus the forum must have lacked jurisdiction to hear the cause. Some of the cases coming here from the MSPB illustrate the point. These are the cases in which the facts which establish jurisdiction are intertwined with the facts which determine the merits of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">For example, in a case in which a petitioner before the MSPB alleges that he has been wrongly terminated from Federal employment, the Government\u2019s defense is sometimes that the petitioner voluntarily resigned, in which case there could not be a wrongful removal. The MSPB, after full hearing and upon concluding from the evidence that there was a voluntary resignation, will sometimes dismiss the claim \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lamb v. United States Postal Serv., </em>46 M.S.P.R. 470 (1990); <em>Schumert v. United States Postal Serv., </em>41 M.S.P.R. 350 (1989). The difficulty with this is that obviously the MSPB had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case. The failure was simply petitioner\u2019s inability to establish a key factual element of his cause of action. The MSPB correctly concluded that it could not grant relief on those facts, but it was not for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">This mislabelling of the result is not entirely the MSPB\u2019s alone. Language in cases decided in this court has not always been consistent with the basic principle discussed above, or with the language of other Federal Circuit cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the recent case of <em>Cruz v. Department of Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240 (Fed.Cir.1991) <em>(in </em>banc), there is language to the effect that a failure by the employee to prove that his resignation was voluntary means that the Board never had jurisdiction to hear the case in the first instance: \u201cHere the Board never had jurisdiction____ That Cruz\u2019 resignation was not <em>found </em>to be voluntary until November 25, 1988 does not change its voluntary nature at its birth on February 16, 1988. The Board had no jurisdiction at that point and did not acquire jurisdiction thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Obviously this cannot be taken literally for all purposes, since the outcome turns on a state of facts that cannot be known until after the Board, and on appeal, this court, has taken jurisdiction and decided them. In <em>Cruz, </em>the question being addressed by the court when it made that statement was whether a pendent claim of discrimination could be decided by the MSPB when the principal issue \u2014 whether there was an involuntary removal \u2014 had already been decided, both by the MSPB and by this court, against the employee. The court correctly concluded that, absent proof of a cause of action for involuntary removal, there was nothing to which the discrimination claim could append.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As <em>Cruz </em>illustrates, the nicety with which the result is characterized does not necessarily affect the correctness of the outcome. However, when determining the agency primarily affected by a decision for purposes of identifying the proper party respondent, correct legal characterization of the result is essential. For such purposes, when we refer to cases involving the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the MSPB, we do not include eases the merits of which turn on the existence of a state of facts when those facts happen also to be the factual predicate for jurisdiction. When a nonfrivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board, and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board. The respondent in such a case is the employing agency, not the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">In the case before us, the Board did not purport to decide the merits of the underlying factual issues, but applying the well-pleaded complaint rule and assuming the facts as alleged, it determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The issue we are here to judge is whether the MSPB\u2019s jurisdictional call was correct. The MSPB is the proper party respondent. <em>See Amin v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>951 F.2d 1247, 1251-52 (Fed.Cir.1991). The motion of the DVA to recaption the case is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">B. The Jurisdictional Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">The jurisdictional issue in this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation. The question is whether the filing of an EEOC complaint which alleged discriminatory treatment by the employer in violation of Title VII constitutes \u2018whistleblowing\u2019 within the scope of \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Spruill argues that his EEOC claim is a \u201cdisclosure of information by an employee ... which the employee ... reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law____\u201d (Title VII) within the meaning of those phrases in \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and therefore the MSPB has jurisdiction under the IRA. In contrast, the MSPB argues that the filing of the EEOC claim is \u201cthe exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law\u201d within the terms of \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A), which section does not carry with it MSPB jurisdiction under the IRA. EEOC complaints must be excluded from \u00a7 2302(b)(8), the MSPB argues, for to do otherwise would eviscerate \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A). The text of these two subsections is set out for the reader\u2019s convenience in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajq7\">(8) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Spruill\u2019s argument is that his EEOC complaint, facially coming under \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A), necessarily is based upon allegations of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, thus facially coming under \u00a7 2302(b)(8). But this superficial reading does not withstand closer analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">First, in enacting the CSRA Congress chose in these two subsections to differentiate between reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain. Only the former \u2014 described in \u00a7 2302(b)(8) \u2014 was termed \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d in the debates, although that term was neither employed nor defined in the original statute itself. This understanding of the term was subsequently formalized in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Congress in the Findings and Purpose section of the Act noted that one of the functions of the CSRA and the OSC was \u201cto protect <em>whis-tleblowers </em>(those individuals who make disclosures described in such section <em>2302(b)(8)) </em>from reprisal;\u201d 103 Stat. 16, \u00a7 2(a)(3) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, note (Supp. II 1990) (emphasis added)). <em>See also </em>135 Cong.Rec. H750 (daily ed. March 21, 1989) (joint explanatory statement of S. 508, reintroduced in support of S. 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Spruill argues that we should not read too much into this use of two distinct subsections since many of the subsections of \u00a7 2302(b) clearly overlap amongst themselves and with provisions of other statutes, and Congress was well aware of this.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This argument is not persuasive. Unless Congress makes it evident that one provision is intended to subsume another parallel provision, we construe the statute to give meaning to each part.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">Second, in crafting the IRA provision of the WPA, Congress clearly intended that it be available to only <em>some </em>victims of reprisal, not all victims. We know this from the express language of \u00a7 1221(a) of the IRA, limiting its reach to allegations falling within \u00a7 2302(b)(8) and <em>not </em>\u00a7 2302(b)(9). And we know it from the title of \u00a7 1221 itself \u2014 \u201cIndividual right of action in <em>certain </em>reprisal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">This selectivity was intended. The initial House and Senate versions of the WPA extended the IRA to <em>all </em>victims of the prohibited personnel practices listed in \u00a7\u00a7 2302(b)(1) through (11). H.R. 25, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. \u00a7 1221 (1987); S. 508, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. \u00a7 1221 (1987). That broad grant of jurisdiction was later changed to eliminate not only the non-reprisal based prohibited personnel actions, but reprisal stemming from \u00a7 2302(b)(9) prohibited actions as well. Testimony of the unwieldiness of the proposed system preceded the amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To read the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u00a7 2302(b)(8) as including activities squarely within \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A) would have the effect of reversing this carefully considered Congressional decision, <em>see INS v. Cardo-zar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 442-43, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1218-19, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 392-93, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1742, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980) (Stewart, J., dissenting)), and would render \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A) largely irrelevant, if not completely superfluous. <em>Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>815 F.2d 668, 674 (Fed.Cir.1987) (citing <em>Colautti v. Franklin, </em>439 U.S. 379, 392, 99 S.Ct. 675, 684, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979)). <em>See also Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Serv., </em>486 U.S. 825, 837, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2188-89, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988), <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Santa Ana, </em>472 U.S. 237, 249-50, 105 S.Ct. 2587, 2594, 86 L.Ed.2d 168 (1985) <em>and United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 520, 99 L. Ed. 615 (1955) (\u201cIt is our duty \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\u2019 ... rather than to emasculate an entire section____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AFLl\">This distinction between the two subsections has been recognized in the case law as well. In <em>In re Frazier, </em>1 MSPB 159, 1 M. S.P.R. 163 (1979), <em>aff'd sub nom. Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>672 F.2d 150 (D.C.Cir.1982), four officials complained to the OSC that they had been transferred in reprisal for whistleblowing and also for the filing of EEOC complaints. The OSC, the MSPB, and the D.C. Circuit all agreed that the disclosures to two Congressmen of general mismanagement, harassment, and discrimination constituted whistleblowing under \u00a7 2302(b)(8). On the other hand, the EEOC complaints were treated as falling <em>solely </em>within \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A), despite the phrasing of \u00a7 2302(b)(8). 1 M.S.P.R. at 190-92; 672 F.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Spruill argues that since filing EEOC complaints fits within the terms of \u00a7 2302(b)(8), we should go no further unless we are convinced that that interpretation leads to \u201cabsurd results.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Demarest v. Manspeaker, </em>498 U.S. 184, 111 S.Ct. 599, 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 608 (1991) and <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 242-43, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1031, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). And, he argues, to determin\u00e9 whether a result is \u201cabsurd,\u201d one must test it against the known intent of Congress regarding that statutory provision. <em>Id. </em>Essentially, then, Spruill argues that we must accept his interpretation unless the legislative history proves a negative \u2014 that Congress did <em>not </em>intend for EEOC complaints to be within the plain language of \u00a7 2302(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">We find that a crabbed approach. When the CSRA was enacted in 1978, it provided whistleblower protection not only through \u00a7 2302(b)(8), but also through the creation of the OSC. This provided protections for whistleblowers for the first time, protections thought necessary to encourage potential whistleblowers to come forward since prior to the CSRA they did so only at their peril. <em>See </em>133 Cong.Rec. E30 (daily ed. Jan. 7 1987); 133 Cong.Rec. S10640 (daily ed. Aug. 2 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">At that same time, however, the issue of discrimination was a known and abhorred evil that had long been of concern to Congress. Years before, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to combat discrimination. That Act set up the EEOC, Pub.L. 88-352, Title VII, \u00a7 705(a)-(d), (f)-(j), July 2, 1964, 78 Stat. 258, 259 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-4 (1988)), and established procedures to encourage the disclosure of discriminatory practices. Upon passage of the CSRA, enforcement and related functions regarding discrimination in Federal employment were placed with the EEOC. Exec. Order No. 12106, 44 F.R. 1053 (1978) (reprinted in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-4, Note 1 (West 1981 &amp; Supp.1992)). This executive action \u201cplace[d] the Commission at the center of equal employment opportunity enforcement ... [giving] coherence and direction to the government\u2019s efforts by developing strong uniform enforcement standards to apply throughout the government: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>standardized data collection procedures, joint training programs, programs to ensure the sharing of enforcement related data among agencies, and methods and priorities for complaint and compliance reviews.\u201d Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 F.R. 19807, 92 Stat. 378 (message of the President) (reprinted in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-4, note (West 1981 &amp; Supp.1992)). Employees who filed EEOC complaints were protected from reprisal. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (1988); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.261. Thus, when Congress enacted the CSRA with a provision in it to protect whistle-blowers, the deficiencies as far as reprisal for discrimination complaints were concerned had already been addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Congress\u2019 pervasive references to whis-tleblowers whose disclosures saved Government funds or short-circuited potential health and safety hazards bolster the conclusion that reprisal for filing EEOC complaints falls exclusively within \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A). <em>See, e.g., </em>135 Cong.Rec. E98 (daily ed. Jan. 4, 1989); 135 Cong.Rec. S2805 (daily ed. March 16, 1989). Such references were even more pointed and pervasive in the legislative history of the 1989 amendment which added the WPA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And that Act itself stated: \u201cFederal employees who make disclosures described in section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code, serve the public interest by assisting in the elimination of fraud, waste, abuse, and unnecessary Government expenditures.\u201d 103 Stat. 16 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 note (Supp. II 1990)). This is a description of the results of the type of public disclosure generally evoked by the term \u201cwhistleblow-ing,\u201d not a description of the results of an individual\u2019s complaint about the discriminatory behavior of a particular supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">There is good reason for Congress to have structured the act in the manner it did. As the OSC noted in its response to Spruill, investigative and remedial measures are available to Spruill through the EEOC.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The OSC policy of avoiding duplication of effort by referring discrimination matters to the EEOC conserves governmental resources and avoids potentially conflicting procedures or outcomes. It acknowledges the EEOC role as an expert agency in discrimination matters, facilitates EEOC consolidation of important statistical data, and provides an efficient division of decisionmaking labor. In short, it promotes efficiency and economy. Our conclusion today reinforces Congress\u2019 efforts to provide the MSPB with a workload that is within its resources and to provide the EEOC with a continuing leadership role in the ongoing battle to eradicate discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">The DVA motion to reform the caption is denied.
