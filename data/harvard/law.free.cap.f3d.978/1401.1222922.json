Allie contends that the district court erred by permitting the government to depose the illegal aliens and by admitting the depositions into evidence. Allie also argues that the court below erred by admitting hearsay statements into evidence and by misinstructing the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>\n<em>Facts and District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">On April 17, 1991, Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) agents searched Allie\u2019s residence and found three Mexican citizens, Reyes Sifuentes-Espinoza, Alfonso Lares-Arevalo and Juan Francisco Lares-Mongaray, working and living on Allie\u2019s property. As the men did not possess documents permitting them to be in the United States, a criminal complaint was filed against Allie for harboring illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-6\">The government requested that the three aliens be detained as material witnesses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8144.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unable to post the $25,000 bond set as a condition for their release, the witnesses were incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-7\">On June 10, 1991, fifty-four days into the alien witnesses\u2019 incarceration, the government filed a motion to extend the detention of the witnesses or alternatively for permission to depose them. The government\u2019s motion was prompted by the Western District\u2019s standing order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, which mandates the release of detained witnesses after sixty days of incarceration unless further detention is necessary to prevent \u201ca failure of justice.\u201d The sixtieth day of the alien witnesses\u2019 detention would have occurred ten days before the trial, set for June 24, 1991. The Magistrate denied the government\u2019s request to extend the detention of the alien witnesses but permitted the government to depose the witnesses. The depositions were videotaped and transcribed on June 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-8\">After being deposed, the witnesses were released with- a subpoena to appear at Allie\u2019s trial, which had been rescheduled for July 22, 1991. The alien witnesses were given the option of remaining in the United States with a work permit pending trial, or returning to Mexico. All three witnesses chose to return to Mexico but stated that they would return to the United States to testify at Allie\u2019s trial. The witnesses were apprised of reentry procedures into the United States and given letters to be presented at the United States inspection station on the Mexican border to aid their reentry. The aliens were told that the government would pay them a witness fee for testifying- as well as reimburse them for their travel expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-10\">On June 20,1991, the witnesses appeared before an immigration judge for their deportation hearing. At the hearing, the witnesses again gave their assurances that they would return for Allie\u2019s trial. The witnesses were again given reentry instructions and told about the witness fees and the travel reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-11\">INS agent Andrade instructed the witnesses to meet him at a specified port of entry on July 19, 1991. Andrade recorded the witnesses\u2019 addresses and telephone numbers in Mexico. After the aliens returned to Mexico, agent Andrade called the witnesses several times to confirm that the witnesses would return as promised and to verify the date, time and place of reentry. Although Andrade was unable to contact Reyes Sifuentes-Espinoza, he did contact Alfonso Lares-Arevalo and Juan Francisco Lares-Mongaray. Both men promised to return to testify and to contact Reyes Si-fuentes-Espinoza about returning with them. Andrade arranged for checks to be issued to the aliens upon their arrival at the border. Andrade also contacted the authorities at the designated port of entry to apprise the inspectors of the expected arrival of the aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-12\">Despite the government\u2019s efforts, the alien witnesses did not show up. Allie filed a pretrial motion to preclude the government from introducing the depositions of the alien witnesses at trial. The district court denied Allie\u2019s motion, finding that the witnesses were \u201cunavailable\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>government made a good faith effort to procure their presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-4\">At trial, the videotaped depositions of the three aliens were admitted over Allie\u2019s renewed objections. Also over Allie\u2019s hearsay objection, the government played a videotape made during the search of Allie\u2019s property, showing one of the aliens indicating that he slept in Allie\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-5\">The jury, after deliberating for several hours, sent a note to the judge asking what Allie\u2019s duties were as an employer hiring alien laborers. Over Allie\u2019s objection, the court issued a supplemental instruction answering the jury\u2019s question. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-6\">On appeal we face two questions concerning the depositions of the alien witnesses. The first is whether it was appropriate to permit the government to take the depositions. The second is whether the depositions were properly admitted into evidence at trial. The remaining questions concern the alleged hearsay violation and the supplemental instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-7\">\n<em>Rule 15(a) and \u00a7 3144</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGX\">Allie challenges the district court\u2019s decision permitting the government to depose the alien witnesses. The permissibility of deposing witnesses in a criminal trial is generally governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a). Rule 15(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1496-8\">Whenever due to <em>exceptional circumstances </em>of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved for use at trial, the court may upon motion of such party and notice to the parties order that the testimony of such witness be taken by deposition ... If a witness is detained pursuant to section 3144 of Title 18, United States Code, the court on written <em>motion of the witness </em>and upon notice to the parties may direct that his deposition be taken. After the deposition has been subscribed the court may discharge the witness, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-1\">Allie contends that no \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d as required by Fed.Crim.P. 15(a), existed in this case to justify deposing the alien witnesses. Before addressing Allie\u2019s argument, we must first consider the government\u2019s suggestion that no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d need be established before deposing a detained witness. The government relies on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144, which requires that detained material witnesses be deposed \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time\u201d if \u201cfurther detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"asa-dedup-0\">The government\u2019s argument is facially supported by the fact that. \u00a7 3144 does not state that a showing of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is required. However, in light of Rule 15(a), the government\u2019s position is plausible only if \u00a7 3144 is interpreted as modifying Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement by establishing that the detention of a witness constitutes a <em>per se </em>exceptional circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-13\">This interpretation of Rule 15(a) and \u00a7 3144 is not tenable. Rule 15(a) plainly establishes that \u00a7 3144 modifies its \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement with regard to motions for depositions made by detained witnesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Rule 15(a)\u2019s explicit and limited reference to depositions taken pursuant to a motion of a detained witness indicates that a motion for the deposition of a detained witness made by a <em>party </em>(either the government or the defendant) is subject to Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>cause the government, as opposed to the witnesses, requested the depositions of the detained witnesses in the instant case, Rule 15(a) requires that the government establish exceptional circumstances warranting the depositions,</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">The district court held that exceptional circumstances existed in this case because the Western District\u2019s standing order mandated the release of the detained witnesses before the date of Allie\u2019s trial. The district court\u2019s finding of exceptional circumstances was supported by additional factors such as the aliens\u2019 illegal presence in the United States, their lack of ties to San Antonio, and the government\u2019s inability to make its case against Allie without their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s Rule 15(a) findings of exceptional circumstances only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Farfan-Carreon, </em>935 F.2d 678, 679 (5th Cir.1991). <em>See also United States v. Fuentes-Galdino, </em>929 F.2d 1507, 1509 (10th Cir.1991). The district court has \u201cbroad discretion in granting rule 15(a) motions, and in considering the particular characteristics of the case to determine whether the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 requirement has been met.\u201d <em>United States v. Farfan-Carreon, </em>935 F.2d at 679. <em>See also United States v. Bello, </em>532 F.2d 422, 423 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist in this case. The trial court\u2019s holding is consistent with our decision in <em>US. v. Farfan-Carreon, </em>935 F.2d at 679-680. In <em>Farfan-Carreon </em>we found \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d when an alien witness was unlikely to return to the United States from Mexico to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. Similarly, in the case before us, the fact that the witnesses would be released in compliance with the Western District\u2019s standing order, and the indications that they were likely to return to Mexico, constituted exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-8\">Allie argues that the Western District\u2019s standing order is invalid and thus the district court\u2019s reliance on the standing order to find exceptional circumstances is misplaced. Allie maintains that the standing order is violative of Rule 15(a) and the Due Process clause because it deprives a defendant of an individualized judicial determination regarding the appropriateness of a deposition in- the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-10\">Contrary to Allie\u2019s argument, the Western District\u2019s standing order merely implements 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144. The order provides that upon a motion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-11\">\u201c[t]he deposition procedure [for detained witnesses] must be pursued <em>unless further detention is necessary to prevent a failure of justice </em>... In the absence of a District Court ruling that further detention is necessary, any material witness in custody shall be released by the Attorney General of the United States after Sixty days of incarceration ...\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1497-12\">The standing order\u2019s time limitation gives meaning to the \u00a7 3144 requirement that depositions of detained witnesses be taken within a \u201creasonable period of time.\u201d The Western District\u2019s standing order defines \u201creasonable time\u201d as sixty days. Except for the time limitation, the standing order provides the trial court with essentially the same degree of discretion in the resolution of individual cases as \u00a7 3144, i.e., determining whether a failure of justice would result if the depositions were taken and the witnesses released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-13\">We recently noted in <em>Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </em>973 F.2d 411 (5th Cir.1992), in discussing the Southern District\u2019s standing order which was modeled after the standing order at issue in this case, that the \u201cdistrict court order established a procedural framework for implementing [\u00a7 3144]. Other than commanding that the material witnesses be released after forty-five days and specifying certain time limitations, the district court\u2019s standing order ... tracked the requirements of \u00a7 3144 and Rule 15(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-14\">We hold that the Western District\u2019s standing order is a valid implementation of \u00a7 3144 and that the trial court did not abuse it discretion in finding \u201cexceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>circumstances\u201d warranting the taking of the depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-4\">\n<em>The Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aqah\">Allie argues that the trial court erred by admitting the deposition testimony of the three alien witnesses into evidence because the introduction of the depositions violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The Supreme Court explained in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), that the Confrontation Clause envisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aix-dedup-0\">a personal examination and cross examination of the witness, in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief. <em>Id. </em>at 63-64 [100 S.Ct. at 2538] (quoting <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242 [15 S.Ct. 337, 339, 39 L.Ed. 409] (1895).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1498-7\">The Court, however, has recognized that the right to confrontation is not absolute and that some circumstances justify dis-' pensing with confrontation at trial. Out of court statements, like the depositions at issue in this case, may be introduced against a criminal defendant if the government can \u201cdemonstrate the unavailability of the declarant whose statements it wishes to use,\u201d and that the out of court statements bear adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. As the reliability of the alien witnesses\u2019 depositions is not contested, we need only address the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-9\">A witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes if the \u201cprosecutorial authorities have made a <em>good-faith effort </em>to obtain his presence at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 100 S.Ct. at 2543 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 724-725, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1322, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Attempting to elaborate on the \u201cgood faith\u201d standard, the <em>Roberts </em>Court suggested that \u201c[t]he length[] to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness ... is a. question of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>448 U.S. at 74, 100 S.Ct. at 2543 (quoting <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 189 n. 22, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1951 n. 22, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970)). <em>See also Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </em>973 F.2d 411, 418 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cdeposition testimony is admissible only if the government has exhausted reasonable efforts to assure that the witness will attend trial\u201d). The inevitable .question of precisely how much effort is required on the part of the government to reach the level of a \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d effort eludes absolute resolution applicable to all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-10\">In <em>United States v. Martinez-Perez, </em>916 F.2d 1020 (5th Cir.1990), we applied the <em>Roberts </em>\u201cgood faith\u201d standard in reversing the conviction of a defendant who had been convicted on the basis of deposition testimony. We held that the government did not demonstrate a good faith effort because \u201c[t]he government adduced no evidence that the [witness] was unavailable to testify at trial; it introduced no evidence of any efforts to procure [the witness\u2019] presence; [and] the district court made no finding on the record that [the witness] was in fact was unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-11\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Guadian-Salazar, </em>824 F.2d 344 (5th Cir.1987), we reversed a conviction obtained with deposition testimony of alien witnesses, finding that the witnesses were not \u201cunavailable.\u201d Prior to being returned to Mexico, the alien witnesses were given subpoenas written in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>English only, and notices in English and Spanish informing the aliens that the INS would make provisions for them to reenter the United States. An INS agent instructed the aliens to come to a specified port of entry on a specified date. However, no attempt was made to contact the witnesses in Mexico in the intervening months before trial, and no one awaited the witnesses at the port of entry on the designated date. <em>Id. </em>at 346. Under these facts we accepted the government\u2019s concession that the depositions introduced at trial were inadmissible. <em>Id. at </em>347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">The government\u2019s effort in obtaining the witnesses\u2019 attendance at trial in the instant case is significantly greater than the effort exhibited by the government in <em>Guadian-Salazar </em>and in <em>Martinez-Perez. </em>The government\u2019s efforts in this case, as described earlier, included giving the witnesses the option of remaining in the United States with work permits, telling the witnesses about the payment of witness fees and travel cost reimbursement, giving the witnesses a subpoena and a letter to facilitate their reentry into the United States, calling the witnesses in Mexico, getting the witnesses\u2019 repeated assurances that they would return, apprising the border inspectors of the witnesses\u2019 expected arrival and issuing checks to be given to the witnesses upon their reentry in to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">The fact that the witnesses did not ultimately show up does not diminish the government\u2019s considerable effort. In <em>Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </em>973 F.2d 411 (5th Cir.1992), we noted that \u201c[t]he ultimate success or failure of [the government\u2019s] efforts is not dispositive. So long as the government has employed reasonable measures to secure the witness\u2019 presence at trial, the fact that the witness has nevertheless failed to appear will not preclude the admission of deposition testimony. Such a witness will be deemed unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. <em>See also United States v. Eufracio-Torres, </em>890 F.2d 266, 270 (10th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1008, 110 S.Ct. 1306, 108 L.Ed.2d 482 (1990) (\u201cThe fact that the means utilized were unsuccessful does not mean that the government\u2019s efforts were not made in good faith\u201d). Given the government\u2019s efforts in this case, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding that the government exhibited a good faith effort in attempting to obtain the witnesses\u2019 presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-9\">Allie argues that the government\u2019s efforts were not in good faith because the government contributed to the aliens\u2019 unavailability. According to Allie, the government encouraged the witnesses\u2019 unavailability by offering them the option of leaving the United States. Allie emphasizes that the government had means at its disposal to keep the alien witnesses from leaving the United States, citing the administrative controls available to the INS under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 215.2(a)-(b) and 215.3(g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1499-10\">Allie principally relies on the First Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Mann, </em>590 F.2d 361 (1st Cir.1978), in which the court held that the admission of a deposition of a witness permitted by the government to leave the United States violated the Confrontation Clause. The <em>Mann </em>court explained that implicit \u201cin the duty to use reasonable means to procure the presence of an absent witness is the duty to use reasonable means to prevent a witness from becoming absent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-11\">We agree with.the <em>Mann </em>court that the government\u2019s good faith efforts to assure the witnesses\u2019 availability at trial should include efforts aimed at keeping the witnesses in the United States. In the instant case, the government attempted to keep the witnesses in the United States by offering them work permits. Although such efforts are important, we refuse to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule, as suggested by Allie, precluding a finding of good faith unless the government attempts to coercively detain the witnesses in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>The Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Eufracio-Torres, </em>890 F.2d 266 (10th Cir.1989), upholding the admission of deposition testimony of aliens permitted to leave the country, is instructive. Like Allie, the defendant in <em>Eufracio-Torres </em>argued that the government did not act in good faith because it permitted the alien witnesses to leave the United States. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, explaining: \u201cWhat the government did not do, and what [the defendant] urges should be a precondition to the finding of unavailability, is to ask the trial court to impose executive restraints on the witnesses to keep them in this country to testify before being deported by the INS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271. The court refused to adopt this \u201cprecondition\u201d and held that the governments\u2019 actions were \u201creasonable\u201d and in \u201cgood faith\u201d despite permitting the witnesses to depart. <em>Id. See also United States v. Rivera, </em>859 F.2d 1204, 1207-1208 (4th Cir.1988), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1020, 109 S.Ct. 1743, 104 L.Ed.2d 180 (1989) (holding that \u201cthe illegal alien witnesses, who had been deposed and had left the country rather than awaiting deportation were unavailable,\u201d and that the government was \u201creasonable\u201d in its effort to produce the witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">There is no doubt that a \u201c[t]rial by deposition steps hard on the right of criminal defendants to confront their accusers.\u201d <em>Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </em>973 F.2d 411, 419 (5th Cir.1992). Because of the importance our constitutional tradition attaches to a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation, the \u201cgood faith effort\u201d requirement demands much more than a merely perfunctory effort by the government. Under the facts of this case, we agree with the district court that the efforts made by the government to obtain the attendance of the alien witnesses at Allie\u2019s trial were reasonable and in good faith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-9\">\n<em>The hearsay claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-10\">Allie argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence a silent videotape showing one of the alien witnesses getting into and out of a bed in Allie\u2019s garage. Allie claims that the tape constituted inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-11\">The trial court allowed the videotape into evidence, over Allie\u2019s objection, under the catch-all hearsay exception, Fed.R. of Evid. 803(24). In finding that the videotape was admissible under Rule 803(24) the trial court had to determine that (a) the statement was of a material fact, (b) the statement was more probative on the point for which it was offered than any other evidence which the proponent could procure through reasonable efforts, and (c) the general purposes of the rules and the interests of justice were best served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-12\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>873 F.2d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1989). Allie does not argue, and nothing in the record indicates, that the court\u2019s ruling constituted abuse of discretion. Even if we were to find abuse of discretion, the admission of the videotape would be a harmless error. The government introduced the videotape to establish the fact that Allie harbored the aliens in his house. However, in addition to the videotape, the government introduced the deposition testimony of two aliens testifying that they lived in Allie\u2019s garage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>en this testimony, the videotape was merely cumulative evidence and its introduction constitutes harmless error. \u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d Fed.R. of Evid. 103(a). <em>See Foster v. Ford Motor Co., </em>621 F.2d 715, 721 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-4\">\n<em>The supplemental instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">After several hours of deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court, asking: \u201cIs it possible to find out what Mr. Allie\u2019s responsibilities were when seeking alien laborers to work on his place? What does the law expect?\u201d Even though Allie was not charged with improper hiring, the judge provided a supplemental instruction regarding an employer\u2019s obligation when hiring aliens. Allie claims that the supplementary instructions misled the jury as to the legal issues before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-6\">\u201cA determination of the prejudicial nature of a supplemental charge can only be made after reviewing both the original and supplemental charges as a whole, (citation omitted) Reversible error does not occur so long as the combined charges viewed as a whole accurately reflect the legal issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>680 F.2d 378, 381 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-7\">The instructions in this case, read as a whole, accurately reflected the legal issues involved. Although in responding to the jury\u2019s question the supplemental instructions addressed a legal question not before the jury, the possibility of confusing the jury was precluded by the supplemental instruction\u2019s restatement of the elements of the offense as set forth in the original instructions. The supplemental instructions emphasized that \u201cthe defendant is not on trial for any act, conduct, or offense not alleged in the indictment.\u201d The supplemental instructions also reminded the jury that \u201cyou are here to decide whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crimes charged.\u201d We hold that the district court\u2019s instructions did not mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-9\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1495-13\">. Section 3144 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-14\">If it appears from an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding, and if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena, a judicial officer may order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 3142.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1495-16\">. <em>In Re Material Witnesses, </em>entered on June 2, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1496-9\">. Section 3144 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1496-10\">No material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release of a material witness may be delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witnesses can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1496-14\">. In <em>Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </em>973 F.2d 411, 413 (5th Cir.1992), we explained that \u201c[r]ead together, Rule 15(a) and \u00a7 3144 provide a detained witness with a mechanism for securing his own release.\u201d Material witnesses \"detained under \u00a7 3144 are explicitly excepted from demonstrating exceptional circumstances to effectuate their own depositions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1498-8\">. The Confrontation Clause\u2019s requirement of unavailability is the same requirement embodied in Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(e), governing the use of depositions at criminal trials. <em>United States v. Martinez-Perez, </em>916 F.2d 1020, 1023 (5th Cir. 1990). <em>See also United States v. Kehm, </em>799 F.2d 354, 360 (7th Cir.1986). Thus, cases discussing '\u2018\u2018unavailability\u2019\u2019 under Rule 15(e) are applicable to the instant analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">. Section 215.2(a) states that \"[n]o alien shall depart, or attempt to depart, from the United States if his departure would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States. Matters \"prejudicial to the interests of the United States\u201d are defined in \u00a7 215.3(g) to include \u201c[a]ny alien who is needed in the United States as a witness in, or as a party to, any criminal case\u201d unless the alien has the \"consent of the appropriate prosecuting authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1500-5\">. Allie also alleges that his Fifth Amendment Due Process rights were violated by the introduction of the depositions. The right to confront adverse witnesses has been recognized as an essential component of due process of law. <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). Allie argues that Due Process was violated because, absent a showing of unavailability, there was no legitimate government interest in'using the depositions at trial. As we hold that the government did establish the witnesses\u2019 unavailability, Allie\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1500-13\">.
