Johnson filed this habeas corpus petition, his second in federal district court, alleging (1) prose-cutorial misconduct for failure to comply with a discovery request, and (2) ineffective assistance of his prior federal habeas counsel for failing to raise the prosecutorial misconduct claim in Johnson\u2019s first federal habeas petition. The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s second habeas petition as an abuse of the writ. Johnson timely appealed, claiming that his prior federal habe-as counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness excuses the failure to raise the prosecutorial misconduct claim in the first federal habeas petition. We disagree and, for the reasons set forth below, affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In 1981, a Mississippi jury convicted Johnson of armed robbery. His first prosecution ended in a mistrial. In the second trial, as in the first, Johnson took the stand and testified that he had been convicted previously of \u201carmed robbery.\u201d In truth, he had never been tried for or convicted of that crime; he had merely acquiesced in the revocation of his parole following an arrest for armed robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evidence of the nature of a parole violation would have been inadmissible under Mississippi law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But because Johnson\u2019s trial counsel had not obtained a copy of Johnson\u2019s arrest and conviction record (his so-called \u201crap sheet\u201d) \u2014 despite having made an express discovery request for it \u2014 counsel did not know that Johnson was mistaken about his prior criminal history and thus could not have known that such erroneous testimony was inadmissible. Johnson did testify truthfully that he had been convicted of aggravated assault, possession of marijuana, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">After Johnson\u2019s conviction, his trial counsel obtained the rap sheet and discovered that Johnson had never been convicted of armed robbery. Nevertheless, trial counsel did not argue prosecutorial misconduct, under <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on direct appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which affirmed Johnson\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">After the Mississippi Supreme Court denied his motion for leave to proceed in error <em>coram nobis, </em>Johnson filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The district court appointed new counsel to represent Johnson. In this ha-beas petition Johnson alleged that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to obtain the rap sheet \u2014 but, as on direct appeal, never raised prosecutorial misconduct. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied this petition, and a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, in his petition for rehearing, Johnson asserted that the panel opinion did not address the prosecutor\u2019s affirmative duty to produce his rap sheet \u2014 a claim never before raised, either in district court or before this court on appeal. Nonetheless, the rehearing motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">In May of 1987, Johnson filed a <em>pro se </em>petition with the Mississippi Supreme Court to vacate his conviction under Mississippi\u2019s Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act raising the claim of prosecutorial misconduct for failure to produce his rap sheet. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>July of 1987, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied Johnson\u2019s petition without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In November of 1987, Johnson filed the instant habeas petition, his second, alleging (1) prosecutorial misconduct for failure to comply with the discovery request for his rap sheet, and (2) denial of right to counsel at a pretrial lineup.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court held that Johnson\u2019s second petition constituted an abuse of the writ and that, because Johnson had been represented by counsel in his prior federal habeas proceeding, his new petition was barred by Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases for failure to bring a claim that could have been asserted in a prior federal habeas petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">On appeal of the denial of Johnson\u2019s second petition, this court vacated the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and remanded the case to the district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We found that the district court had erred in failing to give notice to Johnson that it was considering dismissal under Rule 9(b) and in failing to give him an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">On remand, the Magistrate Judge notified Johnson that dismissal under Rule 9(b) was being considered. The Magistrate Judge afforded Johnson an opportunity to respond by providing him with Model Form #9 promulgated for use in section 2254 cases involving a Rule 9 issue. The form directed Johnson to explain why his successive petition should not be dismissed under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">After considering Johnson\u2019s response to Form- # 9, the Magistrate Judge assumed without finding that Johnson\u2019s second ha-beas petition presented a new claim under Rule 9(b), but determined, citing <em>Jones v. </em>Estelle,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that Johnson had not provided a justifiable excuse for failing to raise the prosecutorial misconduct claim earlier. Objecting to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, Johnson argued that his prior federal habeas counsel was ineffective for failing to argue the prosecutorial misconduct claim in his first federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The district court accepted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, and, in its order dismissing the petition, noted that Johnson had argued ineffective assistance of prior federal habeas counsel in response to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation. The district court summarily dismissed Johnson\u2019s argument. Citing Johnson\u2019s admission that the prosecutorial misconduct claim existed at the time of trial, the district court dismissed the petition under Rule 9(b) as an abuse of the writ because Johnson failed to explain why he could not have raised the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in his first federal habeas petition. Further, the district court, citing Judge Wisdom\u2019s dissent in <em>Johnson I, </em>noted, in the alternative, that Johnson\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim may have been considered and rejected in his first federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">Within the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal, Johnson filed a motion seeking a writ of mandamus, which a panel of this court construed as a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">In this appeal Johnson asserts that the reason his <em>Brady </em>claim was not included in his first habeas petition is that his counsel on first habeas was ineffective. As a result, argues Johnson, the first-time presentation of his <em>Brady </em>claim in this, his second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>federal habeas petition, could not be an abuse of the writ. He bases his claim of ineffective assistance of prior federal habe-as counsel on the contention that a competent habeas counsel would have raised the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in Johnson\u2019s first federal habeas petition. For purposes of this case, we assume without deciding that the rap sheet withheld from Johnson was in fact <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">After we heard this appeal, the Supreme Court held, in <em>McCleskey v. Zant,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the standard for determining whether a habeas petitioner has abused the writ is the same as that used to decide whether a petitioner\u2019s state procedural default should be excused. Under <em>McCleskey, </em>if the government has met its burden of pleading abuse of the writ,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a petitioner bringing a new claim in a successive or second habeas petition must either show (1) both \u201ccause\u201d for not having raised the claim earlier and \u201cactual prejudice resulting from the errors of which he complains,\u201d or, failing that, (2) that \u201ca constitutional violation probably has resulted in the conviction of one innocent of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">We find that Johnson cannot demonstrate cause for his failure to present his <em>Brady </em>claim in his first habeas petition. \u201cIn order to demonstrate cause, the petitioner must show th$t the failure to raise the claim in his first petition was due to some objective external factor such as interference by officials.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the context of claims that have been defaulted in state court because of a violation of procedural rules \u2014 defaults to which the identical \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test applies \u2014 the Supreme Court has held that \u201ccounsel\u2019s ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an ind\u00e9pendent constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, ineffective assistance of counsel will constitute cause only when counsel is constitutionally required under the Sixth Amendment. But because there is no constitutional right to counsel in federal habe-as,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> under <em>McCleskey, </em>no error by counsel in an habeas proceeding can constitute cause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In summary, therefore, even if Johnson\u2019s first federal habeas counsel were found to have been ineffective, that cannot be cause, under <em>McCleskey, </em>for Johnson\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Brady </em>claim in the first round of federal habeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">Having failed to establish cause for his default, Johnson may nevertheless have his <em>Brady </em>claim considered in this second federal habeas petition if he can show that \u201ca constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of one innocent of the crime.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has made' clear that the term \u201cactual innocence\u201d means <em>factual, </em>as opposed to <em>legal, </em>innocence \u2014 \u201clegal\u201d innocence, of course, would arise whenever a constitutional violation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>itself requires reversal, whereas \u201cactual\u201d innocence, as the Court stated in <em>McCles-key, </em>means that the person did not commit the crime.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\"><em>McCleskey\u2019s </em>discussion of the narrow actual innocence exception derives from the plurality\u2019s discussion of actual innocence in <em>Kuhlmann v. Wilson.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> Kuhlmann, </em>in turn, describes actual innocence as meaning that there is a fair probability that, in light of all the evidence, a reasonable trier could not find all the elements necessary to convict the defendant of that particular crime.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, under this standard, Johnson would actually be innocent of the crime for which he was charged and convicted\u2014 armed robbery as defined under Mississippi law \u2014 if the jury could not have reasonably found that he was armed when he committed the robbery.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Here, we cannot find that a reasonable jury could not have found that Johnson committed armed robbery, even had Johnson\u2019s erroneous testimony about his prior armed robbery conviction been excluded. Johnson testified that he received the stolen automatic teller cards from a friend. This statement conflicts, however, with the victim\u2019s identification of Johnson and testimony that Johnson approached and robbed him of his wallet at gunpoint. Thus, even in the total absence of Johnson\u2019s erroneous testimony of a prior conviction for armed robbery, the eyewitness testimony of Johnson\u2019s use of a gun is more than sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to return a guilty verdict of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">We find that the district court correctly determined that Rule 9(b) bars consideration of Johnson\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct raised for the first time in this, his second, federal habeas petition because that claim could have been raised previously. Ineffective assistance of first habeas counsel cannot be \u201ccause\u201d for Johnson\u2019s failure to assert prosecutorial misconduct in his first habeas petition as there is no constitutional right to counsel in habeas. Neither do we find that Johnson has a claim of actual innocence, which, if established, would allow us to address the merits of Johnson\u2019s new claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Even absent the erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>evidence of Johnson\u2019s prior conviction for armed robbery, a reasonable jury could have based a verdict of armed robbery under Mississippi law on the victim\u2019s testimony that Johnson was armed when he committed the robbery. If true, the acts ascribed to the state prosecutor \u2014 deliberate use of false inculpatory testimony from this undereducated defendant, represented by appointed counsel whose ignorance of the error of his client\u2019s inculpatory testimony resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s purposeful withholding of discoverable evidence\u2014 would probably constitute good cause for reversal. Nevertheless, for Johnson to raise that issue for the first time in his second habeas corpus petition is an abuse of the writ under the circumstances, of this case. Therefore, the judgment of the district court denying Johnson\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. Throughout the protracted history of this case the crime allegedly committed by Johnson while on parole has been variously referred to as armed robbery, strong armed robbery, strong arm robbery, strong-arm robbery, and robbery by assault. Our search of Mississippi law has discovered only the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. 97-3-79 (Supp.1991). Because the formal designation of this alleged crime makes no difference to this case\u2019s resolution, however, we refer to it throughout as simply \"armed robbery.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-8\">.
