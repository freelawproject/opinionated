Upon a jury verdict finding Chick-Fil-A not at fault and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride totally at fault, the court entered judgment that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and its insurer, Old Republic Insurance Company, bear all costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Chick-Fil-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the court properly awarded Chick-Fil-A attorneys\u2019 fees against Pilgrim\u2019s Pride.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties disagree about whether the Louisiana Products Liability Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the Louisiana Civil Code articles on redhibition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> govern the cross-claim. Finding that attorneys\u2019 fees are not allowed under the Act and that redhibition was neither pleaded nor proven, we hold that the fee award was improper,</p>\n<p id=\"AMk\">\n<em>No Fee Under Products Liability Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">The plaintiffs tried their case on a products liability theory of liability. According to the jury verdict, both Chick-FilA and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride are \u201cmanufacturers\u201d within the meaning of the Louisiana Products Liability Act, and the sandwich was unreasonably dangerous. It is undisputed that if Chick-Fil-A\u2019s cross-claim was also under the Products Liability Act, ChickFil-A cannot recover attorneys\u2019, fees. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9:2800.53(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">\n<em>Redhibition not Pleaded or Proven</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">The court allowed a fee award in favor of Chick-Fil-A on the basis of the law of redhibition, a remedy which permits a fee award in certain circumstances. Redhibition is the right of a buyer to rescind a sale on account of a hidden vice or defect in the thing sold. <em>See </em>La.Civ.Code Ann. arts. 2520-21 (West 1952). If the seller cannot repair the vice, it must restore the purchase price and pay expenses of the sale and for the preservation of the thing sold. <em>Id. </em>art. 2531 (West Supp.1992). An award of attorneys\u2019 fees is provided in redhibition by the following article: \u201cThe seller, who knows the vice of the thing he sells and omits to declare it, besides the restitution of price and repayment of the expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, is answerable to the buyer in damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>art. 2545 (West Supp.1992). Jurisprudence permits this additional recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees against manufacturers on the presumption that they \u201cknow the vice\u201d and are' deemed to be in bad faith in selling a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>defective product. <em>E.g., Cox v. Lanier Business Products, Inc., </em>423 So.2d 690, 693-94 (La.Ct.App.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 So.2d 129 (La.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">An intermediate seller may recover its attorneys\u2019 fees from a manufacturer based on this jurisprudential development of article 2545 and the following code article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGn\">In any case in which the seller is held liable because of redhibitory defects in the thing sold, the seller shall have a corresponding and similar right of action against the manufacturer of the thing for any losses sustained by the seller, and ... any ... manufacturer-seller contract ... attempting to limit ... such recoupment by the seller shall not be given any force or effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">La.Civ.Code Ann. art. 2531; <em>see also Cox, </em>423 So.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As evidenced from the qualifying language in article 2531, the seller\u2019s rights against the manufacturer are derivative of the plaintiff/buyer\u2019s action against the seller. That is, only <em>if </em>a seller is liable in redhibition may it \u201crecoup\u201d its liability to a buyer from its manufacturer. <em>See </em>La.Civ. Code Ann. art. 2531; <em>see also Mouillier v. Hallmark Pool Corp., </em>514 So.2d 523 (La. Ct.App.1987) (manufacturer not liable for seller\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees if seller is not \u201cliable because of redhibitory defects\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The judge erred in applying these principles to the cross claim against the manufacturer. Chick-Fil-A was not a \u201cseller ... held liable because of redhibitory defect,\u201d and so can claim no rights under the foregoing code articles and jurisprudence. Plaintiffs were not seeking to avoid a sale and recover the price of the sandwich. No redhibitory claim was pleaded or proven by the plaintiffs or cross-claimant Chick-Fil-A. Accordingly, Chick-Fil-A had no right of recoupment against Pilgrim\u2019s Pride under the redhibition articles and no right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under article 2545.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Chick-Fil-A has cited no contract or other statute providing for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the trial court or this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">There is no reason for remand. We simply amend the judgment to strike the order that Old Republic Insurance Company and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corporation pay reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Chick-Fil-A, Inc. Chick-Fil-A\u2019s request for additional attorneys\u2019 fees in defense of this appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Judgment VACATED in part and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">. The parties also brief a procedural issue: whether Chick-Fil-A\u2019s failure to plead attorneys' fees as an item of special damages bars recovery of fees under Rule 9. We hold that any pleading defect has been cured, because the district court effectively permitted an amendment to the pleading after finding no prejudice to Pilgrim\u2019s Pride. 2R. 250-51. Failure to plead special damages does not bar recovery if the defect can be cured by amendment. <em>See </em>5 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1312 (1990). Because the claim was advanced by Chick-Fil-A during pretrial conferences, the court did not err in considering the merits of the claim as though the pleadings had' been amended. <em>See Sherman v. Hallbauer, </em>455 F.2d 1236, 1242 (5th Cir.1972) (holding that, the district court should have construed a summary judgment memorandum containing a revised theory of the case as a motion to amend pleadings under Rule 15).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\">.
