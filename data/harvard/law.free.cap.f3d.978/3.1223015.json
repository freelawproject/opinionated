CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment in favor of appellee Canon U.S.A., Inc., in a civil antitrust action brought by appellants Aunyx Corporation and Aunyx Business Machines Corporation. Appellants appeal from the judgment as to two of their claims. Because previous proceedings before the International Trade Commission were <em>res judicata </em>in respect to the antitrust claim and because no triable issues remained as to the breach of contract claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Aunyx Corporation (\u201cAunyx Corp.\u201d) and Aunyx Business Machines Corporation (\u201cABM\u201d) (collectively \u201cAunyx\u201d) are Massachusetts corporations located in Hingham, Massachusetts. Robert J. Langone (\u201cLan-gone\u201d) is the president and sole shareholder of both corporations. Appellee Canon U.S.A., Inc., (\u201cCanon\u201d) is a New York corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canon, Inc., a Japanese corporation. Only Canon U.S.A. is a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Among other products, Canon markets a line of photocopy machines known as \u201cNew Process\u201d (\u201cNP copiers\u201d). These NP copiers employ a dry black powder made from resins and other coloring agents called \u201cNP Toner\u201d to print copies of documents onto paper. NP Toner is manufactured by Canon. All NP copiers need toner to make copies and for all practical purposes NP copiers can only use NP Toner. While other companies have attempted to make toner suitable for use in NP copiers, they have not successfully marketed any significant amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">NP Toner is marketed in the United States by Canon through a nationwide network of approximately 500 independent, authorized dealers that sell copiers and toner, and are responsible for repairing and servicing the former.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Three of the dealers were owned by Canon, while the others were independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">In 1977, Canon organized the Copier Dealer Advisory Council (\u201cDAC\u201d). This council consisted of several varying sized and geographically diverse dealers that periodically met with Canon representatives to discuss matters of mutual interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Before 1979, Canon used a form of dealership agreement known as a \u201cManufacturer/Dealer agreement\u201d pursuant to which Canon appoints dealers as non-exclusive dealers of various Canon products. This Manufacturer/Dealer agreement was subject to cancellation upon ninety days notice and did not make any provision relating to the sale of NP Toner or restricting dealers to selling into specific territories. ABM had signed such an agreement with Canon in 1979 (\u201cthe 1979 Agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">In 1983, Canon introduced a new form of dealership agreement (\u201cthe 1983 Agreement\u201d) which assigned dealers of NP copiers and NP Toner to specific territories and provided that each dealer could not market products outside its assigned territory. The alleged purpose of the 1983 Agreement was to prevent a practice known as \u201cskating\u201d which basically involved selling products outside the dealer\u2019s primary marketing area. Canon sent Aunyx a copy of the 1983 Agreement for its signature but Au-nyx did not sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">In the summer of 1985, Aunyx embarked upon a program of selling large amounts of NP Toner, purchased from Canon, to end users throughout the United States. On October 15, 1985, the Vice-President of Canon Copier Division sent a letter to the President of Aunyx, Mr. Langone, advising him that Canon was aware that Aunyx had been purchasing NP Toner from Canon in quantities far in excess of what would be required to maintain the NP copiers it had purchased, and that Aunyx had been selling Canon NP Toner \u201coutside its primary sales area and on a national basis, in violation of Canon\u2019s well-known established poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cy.\u201d The letter informed Aunyx that as \u00f3f October 16, 1985, Canon would limit the amount of NP Toner that Aunyx could buy to no more than 250 cases per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">B. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On July 15, 1986, Aunyx filed its original complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Canon with a myriad of violations. <em>See infra </em>note 2. An amended complaint was filed on June 12, 1987. The original plaintiff was Aunyx Corp., and the original defendants were Canon, Inc., and Canon U.S.A. ABM was added as a plaintiff on the motion of Aunyx Corp. filed on June 12, 1987, and allowed on December 17, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">A further ten-count<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amended complaint was filed on April 14, 1988 (\u201cthe Second Amended Complaint\u201d). The Second Amended Complaint. dropped Canon, Inc., as a party defendant, leaving as defendant only Canon U.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On the same day it filed its original complaint, July 15, 1986, Aunyx commenced proceedings before the International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) in Washington, D.C., against Canon U.S.A. and Canon, Inc., under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930,19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court action was put \u201con hold\u201d awaiting the decision of the ITC.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In the ITC proceedings, Aunyx engaged in extensive discovery which included substantial document production, more than a hundred written interrogatories, and the oral depositions of 33 individuals over a period of 70 days. The entire prehearing discovery lasted almost one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Roughly eight months after its original filing before the ITC, on March 17, 1987, Aunyx moved to amend its ITC Complaint to add a claim that Canon and its retail dealers had entered into a horizontal conspiracy to divide the United States market for NP toner among the dealers in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. In an order entered April 15, 1987, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) denied Aunyx\u2019s motion on the ground of untimeliness. The ALT concluded that the requested amendment \u201cwould impose an impossible burden upon the parties to complete their discovery and prepare for hearing.\u201d Aunyx never sought review of the denial of its motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">The ITC\u2019s proceedings terminated in an order adverse to Aunyx. Aunyx at first sought review of the ITC\u2019s decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but thereafter moved to dismiss its petition for review. Aunyx\u2019s motion to dismiss its petition for review of the ITC proceedings was allowed, and the petition was dismissed on August 2, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">Upon completion of the proceedings before the ITC and the dismissal of its review \u2022 petition before the Federal Circuit, Aunyx reactivated its lawsuit in the district court. On November 22, 1988, Canon filed a motion for summary judgment. Accompanied by exhibits relating to the ITC proceedings, this motion urged that the ITC proceedings had <em>res judicata </em>effect upon the district court proceedings. On June 6, 1989, District Judge McNaught issued a Memorandum and Order ruling upon the motion for summary judgment. Judge McNaught concluded that Counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of the Second Amended Complaint had been fully litigated in the ITC case and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>were barred from further consideration by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>As for counts 3 and 4, which asserted claims under state law,. Judge McNaught concluded that they were also barred from further consideration by the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. He found, however, that the AU\u2019s denial of Aunyx\u2019s motion to add its related horizontal conspiracy theory set forth in Count 8, and the AU\u2019s failure to consider the breach of contract claim presented in Count 10, had deprived Aunyx of the opportunity to fully litigate those claims before the ITC. As a result, he refused to grant summary judgment as to these two counts. The district court entered final judgment on Counts 1 through 7 and Count 9 on August 17, 1989. No appeal to this court has been taken from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">On June 8,1990, Canon filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of Count 8 and of Count 10 to the extent it alleged a breach of contract arising from Canon\u2019s restrictions on Aunyx\u2019s toner purchases. On September 11, 1990, Judge McNaught refused to dismiss Count 8 but allowed the motion for summary judgment in respect to part of Count 10. Due to the anticipated retirement of Judge McNaught, the case was reassigned to Judge Rya W. Zobel on December 5, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A jury trial on Count 8 began on March 11, 1991, and continued for six days. On March 19, 1991, Judge Zobel directed\u2019 a verdict in favor of Canon on Count 8 (horizontal conspiracy), concluding that Aunyx did not present evidence from which a jury could infer antitrust injury. Trial on what remained of Count 10 was scheduled to commence on June 10, 1991. On June 4, 1991, the district court ordered the plaintiffs to notify the defendant and the court of their contentions as to the issues remaining to be tried. The plaintiffs did so the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On June 11, 1991, the district court published a \u201cFurther Order Concerning Count [10]\u201d stating that nothing remained to be tried and ordering that judgment be entered for Canon on Count 10. Final judgment was entered by the district court on Counts 8 and 10 on June 27, 1991. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">A. <em>Count 8: Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Although the district court did not consider the issue of whether the ITC proceedings had <em>res judicata </em>effect on Count 8 when it granted a directed verdict in Canon\u2019s favor, we do so now, mindful that \u201cwe need not limit ourselves to the exact grounds for decision utilized below. We are free, on appeal, to affirm a judgment on any independently sufficient ground.\u201d <em>Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., </em>827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987); <em>see also Medina-Mu\u00f1oz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>896 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1990); <em>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., </em>895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars all parties and their privies from relitigating issues which were raised or <em>could have been raised </em>in a previous action, once a court has entered a final judgment on the merits in the previous action. <em>United States v. Alky Enterprises, Inc., </em>969 F.2d 1309, 1314 (1st Cir.1992). The essential elements of <em>res judicata, </em>or claim preclusion, are (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action; (2) an identity of parties or privies in the two suits; and (3) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and later suits. <em>Kale v. Combined Insurance Co. of America, </em>924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 69, 116 L.Ed.2d 44 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">In <em>Manego v. Orleans Board of Trade, </em>773 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1084, 106 S.Ct. 1466, 89 L.Ed.2d 722 (1986), we adopted the \u201ctransactional\u201d definition of <em>res judicata </em>of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 24 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">(1) When a valid and final judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff\u2019s claim pursuant to the rules of merger or bar ..., the claim extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">(2) What factual grouping constitutes a \u201ctransaction\u201d, and what groupings constitute a \u201cseries\u201d, are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 24 (1982). The fact that different legal theories are presented in each case does not mean that the same transaction is not behind each. <em>Manego v. Orleans Board of Trade, </em>773 F.2d at 6. \u201c[S]o long as different theories of recovery, however prolific, derive from the same cause of action, the requisite identity is achieved if, and to the extent that, all such theories concern \u2018the same operative nucleus of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kale v. Combined Insurance Co. of America, </em>924 F.2d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">Normally, decisions of administrative agencies are entitled to <em>res judicata </em>effect when the agency acted in a judicial capacity. <em>University of Tennessee v. Elliott, </em>478 U.S. 788, 797-798, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 3225, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986); <em>United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 421-422, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 1559-1560, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966); <em>McCuin v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>817 F.2d 161, 172 (1st Cir.1987); <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 83 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has held that ITC decisions in Section 337 proceedings are entitled to <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>Union Manufacturing Co. v. Han Baek Trading Co., </em>763 F.2d 42, 45-46 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">In this case all three requirements for <em>res judicata </em>have been satisfied. First, Aunyx\u2019s failure to appeal from the ITC\u2019s order, which decided Aunyx\u2019s claim on the merits, rendered it final. The identity of parties requirement was also satisfied, even though ABM was not a party to the ITC proceedings. Aunyx had adequate interest in litigating ABM\u2019s interests before the ITC. Moreover, Aunyx explicitly repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sented to the district court that ABM was <em>its alter ego/.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">As for the requirement of identity of the cause of action, we are satisfied that the claims asserted in the ITC action and in the subsequent action in the district court were sufficiently related to satisfy the transactional analysis variant of the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine. The gist of \u25a0 Aunyx\u2019s claim in the district court action was that Canon and its dealers adopted the 1983 agreement to allocate markets for Canon NP Toner. That was the same claim made before the ITC. Both claims were founded upon the same transaction and arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact. They sought redress for essentially the same alleged wrong notwithstanding any differences in remedies sought or theories of recovery pleaded. A second action may be barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>even though a different legal theory or source of law is involved. <em>See </em>18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4411 at 86-87 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The record reflects that Aunyx knew enough about the facts of this case to have been able to assert its horizontal conspiracy claim at the outset before the ITC.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">It is immaterial that the plaintiff in the first action sought to prove the acts relied on in the second action and was not permitted to do so because they were not alleged in the complaint and an application to amend the complaint came too late.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 25 cmt. b (1982). Thus, we hold that Count 8 is barred, as a matter of law, by <em>res judica-ta. </em>Aunyx\u2019s action under Count 8 being barred by <em>res judicata, </em>we need not consider the remaining issues related to that count raised by Aunyx.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">B. <em>Count 10: Pretrial Dismissal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> We turn now to whether Judge Zobel erred in dismissing before trial Aunyx\u2019s claim under Count 10. We think not. After a pretrial conference on May. 23, 1991, the parties submitted memos to the court regarding the issues remaining to be tried under Count 10. Aunyx identified three issues, two of which were based on an alleged right to purchase NP Toner from Canon. Canon disagreed, and on June 4, 1991, Judge Zobel wrote that the claims under Count 10 which related to an alleged right to purchase NP Toner had been dismissed by Judge McNaught on September 11, 1990, leaving only the issue of the lawfulness of Canon\u2019s unilateral termination of the 1979 Agreement. Judge Zobel ordered Aunyx to again notify the defendant and the court of its contentions as to the issues remaining to be tried with respect to Count 10. Specifically, because Aunyx had already admitted that it had failed to pay Canon $70,000 due under the 1979 Agreement, the judge asked Aunyx to provide some evidence that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s failure to pay was attributable to some unlawful conduct of defendant not heretofore tried or resolved.\u201d In response, Aunyx again argued that it had contractual rights to purchase NP Toner under an \u201cextended course of dealings,\u201d and that the prior grant of summary judgment decided only that Au-nyx had no <em>express </em>contractual right to purchase toner under the 1979 Agreement. Judge Zobel rejected this argument and subsequently dismissed what remained of Count 10 because Aunyx failed to offer any evidence to show that Canon unlawfully terminated the 1979 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Aunyx\u2019s sole argument on' appeal is that Judge Zobel misconstrued Judge McNaught\u2019s September 11, 1990, grant of partial summary judgment. Because Judge Zobel\u2019s pretrial order of June 11, 1991, decided all remaining issues in Canon\u2019s favor, we treat the order as a grant of summary judgment. <em>See </em>3 James Wm. Moore et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 16.21, at 16-113 (2d ed. 1992). Aunyx <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>claims that Judge McNaught never decided whether it had an <em>implied </em>right to buy toner, outside of its rights under the 1979 Agreement. In contrast, Judge Zobel interpreted that ruling as holding that Aunyx had no contractual right, express or implied, to purchase toner from Canon, leaving only the issue of whether Canon\u2019s termination of Aunyx\u2019s dealership was a breach of the 1979 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We find no support for Aunyx\u2019s begrudging interpretation of Judge McNaught\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Count 10 in the Second Amended Complaint read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">Canon has breached the terms of its contract with ABM in that it has applied geographic scope limitations not provided in the contract and has applied quantity limitations of ERMT [toner] not authorized by the contract, both of which contributed to monetary losses by ABM and Aunyx and by placing ABM in a financial condition such that it has reduced ABM\u2019s ability to pay for ERMT supplied in limited quantities under the contract. Canon has without cause unilaterally cancelled the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Thus, Count 10 raised two separate claims: (1) Canon breached its contract by limiting ABM\u2019s right to buy unlimited quantities of toner and to distribute the toner without geographic limitation; and (2) Canon breached its contract with Aunyx by terminating Aunyx\u2019s dealership. On June 6, 1990, Canon moved for summary judgment on Count 10 \u201cto the extent it asserts a breach of contract arising from the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to supply plaintiffs with unlimited quantities of Canon-brand toner for use in Canon NP 210-500 Copiers.\u201d Canon argued on the motion that Aunyx had no contract right, either express or implied, to purchase toner from Canon. In response, Aunyx conceded that it had no \u201cexpress contractual right to purchase any particular quantities of NP Toner from Canon (or, for that matter, to purchase any NP Toner at all from Canon).\u201d Aunyx argued, however, that it had a right to purchase toner from Canon in quantities \u201cnot limited by reason of an unlawful combination or conspiracy between Canon and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">On September 11,1990, Judge McNaught granted Canon\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to Count 10. Citing his previous order denying Aunyx\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">there is \u201cno solid basis for the claim in contract that the plaintiff has the right to purchase supplies to be distributed nationwide. There is nothing in the dealings [between Canon and Aunyx] which allows plaintiff to demand to be treated as a wholesaler rather than as a retail dealer of copiers.\u201d Nothing presented by way of affidavit, exhibits or memorandum has persuaded me that my earlier decision was incorrect. The 1979 agreement dealt with copiers, not toner. Defendant\u2019s argument is simply unconvincing that regardless of the absence of an express provision about supplies, the contract embodied the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We interpret Judge McNaught\u2019s ruling as deciding that Aunyx had no contractual right to purchase toner from Canon arising (a) from the 1979 Agreement, (b) from any obligation of good faith and fair dealing in that agreement, or (c) from the dealings between the parties. No objection was made to Judge McNaught\u2019s determination at the time, nor have appellants put forward any argument in the course of this appeal challenging it. Accordingly, we will not review it for error. <em>See Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>891 F.2d 337, 352 (1st Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 937, 110 S.Ct. 3217, 110 L.Ed.2d 664 (1990) (holding that potential issues not supported by argument in appellant\u2019s brief are deemed abandoned); <em>Zanditon v. Feinstein, </em>849 F.2d 692, 702 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that a grant of summary judgment not timely objected to will not be reviewed on appeal); <em>Clauson v. Smith, </em>823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir.1987) (\u201cIn the absence of extraordinary circumstances, ... we have regularly declined to consider points which were not seasonably advanced below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">As Judge McNaught had dismissed all of Aunyx\u2019s claims based on a contractual right to purchase toner, <em>supra, </em>the only issue that remained under Count 10 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>eve of the scheduled trial was whether Canon\u2019s termination of Aunyx\u2019s dealership was, separately, a breach of the 1979 Agreement. Judge Zobel ordered judgment in favor of Canon on Count 10 without a trial on that issue. Despite Judge Zobel\u2019s request, Aunyx offered no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Canon\u2019s termination of the contract was lawful. The only justification offered \u2014 that Canon had violated antitrust laws \u2014 was rendered impotent when Canon won a directed verdict on the antitrust claims. We hold that Canon was entitled to prevail on Count 10 as a matter of law, and that Judge Zobel committed no error in ordering judgment in favor of Canon on Count 10 without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
