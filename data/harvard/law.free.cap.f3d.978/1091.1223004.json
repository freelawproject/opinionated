We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Erma Stites brought an action in the district court pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(b), seeking to abate a jeopardy assessment made against her by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving copies of Stites\u2019 papers filed in the district court, the IRS conceded in a notice to the court that the jeopardy assessment should be abated. The district court entered an order directing the IRS to abate the jeopardy assessment against Stites and to release all liens and levies enforcing the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">Stites subsequently filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430. After a hearing, the district court denied Stites\u2019 motion on the ground that she had not established that her net worth was less than four million dollars, the statutory eligibility cap for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(c)(4)(A)(iii); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 6, 1990, Stites filed a motion for reconsideration in the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), accompanied by evidence supporting her contention that her net worth was less than two million dollars. The district court denied Stites\u2019 motion because the new evidence was known or available to Stites at the time of her original motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Stites now appeals the denial of the motion for reconsideration and the denial of her request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-18\">The government argues that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7429 and 7430 deprive us of jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Section 7429 establishes that \u201c[a]ny determination made by a court under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewed by any other court.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(f). Section 7430 establishes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD7\">[a]n order granting or denying (in whole or in part) an award of reasonable litigation or administrative costs under subsection (a) in a court proceeding, may be incorporated as a party of the decision or judgement in the court proceeding and <em>shall be subject to appeal in the same manner as the decision or judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq7V\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(f)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-19\">We generally have given a broad reading to the prohibition on appellate review contained in \u00a7 7429(f). <em>See Stebco Inc. v. United States, </em>939 F.2d 686, 687-88 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Zuluaga v. United States, 774 </em>F.2d 1487, 1489 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plain language of Section 7430 compels us to treat an appeal of the district court\u2019s attorneys fees determina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>tion arising out of a Section 7429 action m the same manner\u201d as we would treat an appeal of the Section 7429 action itself. The district court\u2019s judgment abating the jeopardy assessment against Stites is not subject to appellate review; therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to award attorney\u2019s fees to Stites not subject to appellate review. <em>Randazzo v. United States, </em>751 F.2d 145, 146 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">This is not a case like <em>Morgan v. United States, </em>958 F.2d 950 (9th Cir.1992), in which we reviewed a district court\u2019s ruling denying the plaintiff standing to bring a section 7429 action. There we held that such a ruling was not a determination \u201con the merits\u201d within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), and that accordingly subsection 7429(f) did not bar us from reviewing it. Here, Stites\u2019 challenge under section 7429 to her tax assessment was decided on the merits by the district court. Subsection 7429(f) consequently deprived us of jurisdiction to review that decision. We must treat Stites\u2019 appeal from the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees as we would an appeal of the district court\u2019s decision on the merits. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430. We therefore must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Nor do we acquire jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of Stites\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. We could not review the district court\u2019s ruling on Stites\u2019 motion for reconsideration without delving into the merits of the district court\u2019s denial of Stites\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Any such review would create a rule-swallowing exception to the prohibition on appellate review of attorney\u2019s fees determinations in actions brought under Section 7429. We do not have jurisdiction to hear Stites\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. <em>Pals v. United States, </em>867 F.2d 1162, 1163 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">. Stites had exhausted her administrative remedies prior to filing this action as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">. The IRS does not dispute that Stites satisfies the other requirements for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a \"prevailing party.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(c)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1184-14\">. Stites\u2019 reliance on <em>Sliwa v. Commissioner, </em>839 F.2d 602 (9th Cir.1988), is misplaced. In <em>Sliwa, </em>we entertained an appeal of a denial of attor-ncy\u2019s fees under Section 7430 after the government had conceded its case in the Tax Court on the merits. While the government had no reason to appeal the resulting judgment against it, there was no statutory bar to appeal as there is in the present case under Section 7429(f). No one in <em>Sliwa </em>contended that the attorney\u2019s fee appeal was barred because the judgment on the merits was not subject to appeal, and we did not rule on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
