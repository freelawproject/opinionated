We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-24\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of federal statutes. <em>Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc., </em>947 F.2d 1341, 1344 (8th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 2305, 119 L.Ed.2d 227 (1992). The district court properly concluded that Tramp\u2019s indictment for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 was appropriate. As we have previously noted, the phrase \u201coffenses against the United States\u201d is used by Congress to denote \u201coffenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>156 F. 897, 900-01 (8th Cir. 1907). As a result, section 371 does not require a conspiracy against the United States, only a conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 901. Because the government sufficiently alleged that Tramp conspired to violate the mail and wire fraud statutes, the indictment under section 371 for conspiracy was valid. <em>Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987), is inapposite because it only applies to an indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-28\">The district court also properly concluded that Tramp did not receive ineffective assistance on any of the grounds alleged. Tramp\u2019s sentencing argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-29\">On October 30, 1984, Congress enacted the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984 (CFEA). Section 10 of the CFEA made sections 2 through 9 of the act apply to \u201coffenses committed after December 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>1984.\u201d Pub.L. 98-596, \u00a7 10, -98 Stat. 3134, 3138 (1984). Section 2 of CFEA, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3623, provides that an individual convicted of a felony may be fined not more than $250,000. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3623(a)(3). On November 1, 1987, the CFEA\u2019s interim measures were superseded by the final SRA fine provisions, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571, which for Tramp\u2019s purposes are identical to the fine provisions of the CFEA, and clearly apply to all crimes committed after November 1, 1987. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 100-182, \u00a7 2(a), 101 Stat. 1266; 130 Cong.Rec. H12,267 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984). As a result, while section 3571 did not apply to Tramp\u2019s convictions, section 3623, which is virtually identical, did. Therefore, Tramp\u2019s counsel properly advised him that if he was convicted on all twenty-eight counts, he could face a fine of up to $7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">Tramp\u2019s claim that he was denied his right to appeal is also meritless. The district court properly concluded that \u201cany error was harmless because Mr. Tramp\u2019s asserted grounds for relief [were] without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">We do not consider Tramp\u2019s argument that he was not indicted by a grand jury because he did not raise this issue below. <em>Burris v. First Financial Corp., </em>928 F.2d 797, 803 (8th Cir.) (failure to raise issue before district court bars attempt to raise issue for first time on appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 195, 116 L.Ed.2d 155 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1147-20\">. The Honorable John Bailey Jones, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
