FRIEDMAN of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b536-12\">LOKEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">After recovering worker\u2019s compensation benefits, Charles Merryman sued Iowa Beef Processors, Inc., for injuries Merry-man sustained while working on a crane retrofit project at IBP\u2019s Dakota City, Nebraska, plant. IBP filed a third party complaint against Merryman\u2019s employer, Allstate Industrial Contractors, Inc., the mechanical contractor on the project. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate on the ground that IBP\u2019s third party claim is barred by the applicable worker\u2019s compensation statute. IBP appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">Merryman, an Iowa resident employed by an Iowa company, was injured at the Nebraska plant when he was struck by a crane being tested by IBP\u2019s employees. IBP\u2019s third party complaint alleges that Merryman\u2019s injury was proximately caused by Allstate\u2019s negligent supervision of Mer-ryman and that Allstate, was contractually liable to indemnify IBP for such negligence. Without resolving choice of law questions, the district court held that IBP failed to come forward with sufficient evidence of a right to indemnity under either Iowa and Nebraska law.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-17\">The worker\u2019s compensation laws of both States bar an action for contribution by a third-party tortfeasor (IBP)' based upon the alleged negligence of an injured employee\u2019s employer (Allstate). <em>See </em>Iowa Code \u00a7 85.-20; <em>Iowa Power &amp; Light Co. v. Abild Constr. Co., </em>259 Iowa 314,144 N.W.2d 303, 306 (1966); Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 48-148; <em>Vangreen v. Interstate Mach. &amp; Supply Co., </em>197 Neb. 29,. 246 N.W.2d 652, 653-54 (1976). Thus, IBP\u2019s third party complaint is barred unless IBP can prove that its relationship with Allstate provides an exception to the principle that worker\u2019s compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy against an injured worker\u2019s employer. <em>Contractual Indemnity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">Both Iowa and Nebraska permit a third party to recover from the employer under an express contract of indemnity, notwithstanding worker\u2019s compensation exclusivity. <em>See Hysell v. Iowa Pub. Serv. Co., </em>534 F.2d 775, 782-83 (8th Cir.1976); <em>Union Pac. R.R. v. Kaiser Agr. Chem. Co., </em>229 Neb. 160, 425 N.W.2d 872, 879 (1988). IBP\u2019s principal argument in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>court and on appeal is that Allstate was contractually obligated to indemnify IBP for Allstate\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The basis for IBP\u2019s contention is buried in the fine print on the back of its standard purchase order form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">15. <em>Certificate of Insurance. </em>Prior to commencing work on the project authorized by this Order, Seller shall have his insurer furnish to [IBP] two copies of a certificate of insurance evidencing his compliance with the insurance requirements listed below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">* * * # * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">c. Worker\u2019s Compensation Insur-ance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">d. Indemnity Agreement reading as follows: \u201cSeller and his insurer agree to indemnify [IBP] from and against all claims [by] Seller\u2019s ... employees ... on account of personal injury ... resulting from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of Seller, its employees and agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">e. Said certificate must state that Seller\u2019s insurer is aware of and agrees to be bound by the above Indemnity Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">IBP sent Allstate a standard purchase order and an acknowledgement form at the start of the project. IBP claims that the presence of the language quoted above on the purchase order form, when considered in the context of the continuing business relationship between IBP and Allstate, demonstrates that an indemnity contract existed between the two parties. However, (i) there was no evidence the acknowledgement was signed by Allstate and returned to IBP; (ii) the purchase order was never signed by Allstate; (iii) no Indemnity Agreement was ever submitted to IBP by Allstate or its insurer, as ostensibly required by par. 15.d; and (iv) there was no other evidence that Allstate understood and intended to be bound by the indemnity provisions in par. 15.d.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Having carefully reviewed the record under our now familiar standards for summary judgment, <em>see, e.g. Get Away Club, Inc. v. Coleman, </em>969 F.2d 664, 666 (8th Cir.1992), and having considered questions of state law de novo, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that IBP presented insufficient evidence of the alleged contract of indemnity to avoid summary judgment in favor of Allstate. \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made ... an adverse party ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). \u201cIf the evidence [presented by the non-moving party] is ... not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). An employer\u2019s agreement to forego its statutory right to limited worker\u2019s compensation liability must be evidenced by something more than boilerplate terms buried on the back of a third party\u2019s purchase order form, containing insurance conditions that the parties obviously ignored in fulfilling their primary contractual undertakings.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">\n<em>Independent Duty.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">IBP also contends that, even absent an express agreement to indemnify, it is entitled to indemnity because Allstate had an \u201cindependent duty\u201d to IBP growing out of a proposal that stated that Allstate would provide \u201ccompetent supervision\u201d and would \u201cprofessionally manage and complete\u201d the project. We disagree. IBP cites no Nebraska law recognizing such a duty to indemnify, and we have grave doubts whether the Iowa authority<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cited by IBP has survived <em>Woodruff Constr. Co. v. Barrick Roofers, Inc., </em>406 N.W.2d 783 (Iowa 1987). But in any event, it is clear that any such duty \u201cmust be of a specific, defined nature,\u201d and not simply the general duty of care owed to each member of society. <em>Hysell, </em>534 F.2d at 782-83. We agree with the district court that IBP failed to present \u201csignificantly probative\u201d evidence of that type of duty in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-19\">.
