The plant owner impleaded the contractor for contractual indemnity and a defense. Before trial on the main demand, the district court granted summary judgment for the contractor. 785 F.Supp. 1236 (M.D.La.1992). The plant owner appeals. Finding a disputed issue of material fact, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">I. <em>The Motion and Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-22\">The contractor, S &amp; S Sprinkler Company, Inc., agreed to defend and indemnify the plant owner, BASF Wyandotte Corporation, against \u201cclaims [or] suits ... for or on account of any injury to ... persons ... which occurs in any way, directly or indirectly, as the result of Contractor\u2019s prosecution of the work.\u201d S &amp; S moved for summary judgment against BASF, based on \u201cthe absence of evidence to suggest that [any release of toxic fumes] was caused by the work being performed by them. Rather, it is evident such a release would have necessarily resulted from the negligence of BASF employees or from a defect in plant equipment owned by BASF.\u201d S <em>&amp; </em>S\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Sum. J. (R. 62-63).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Apparently accepting this argument, the district court found, \u201cThere is no evidence which suggests S &amp; S employees caused the injuries complained of nor is there any evidence in the record to show that the injuries complained of were \u2018the result of the contractor\u2019s prosecution of the work\u2019 under the contract between S &amp; S and BASF.\u201d R. 119. The court granted S &amp; S\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the contract does not provide indemnity against BASF\u2019s negligence or strict liability. R. 120. Yet the court made no finding whether BASF was or was not negligent or at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing the summary judgment, we apply the same standard of review as did the district court. <em>Wattman v. International Paper Co., </em>875 F.2d 468, 474 (5th Cir.1989). Finding that BASF\u2019s negligence is an unresolved issue of fact bearing on the indemnity obligation, we reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">II. <em>BASF\u2019s Negligence is Material</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">The district court recognized (correctly so) that under <em>Polozola v. Garlock, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Soverign Insurance Co. v. Texas Pipe Line Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this contract does not provide indemnification against the consequences of BASF\u2019s own negligence. S &amp; S agreed to defend and indemnify BASF against claims for personal injury \u201cwhich occurs in any way, directly or indirectly, as the result of Contractor\u2019s prosecution of the work.\u201d Because the contract does not express in unequivocal terms the intent to indemnify against losses resulting from the indemnitee\u2019s own negligent acts, such losses are not covered. <em>See Polozola, </em>343 So.2d at 1003; <em>Soverign, </em>488 So.2d at 983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">Thus the question whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are a consequence of BASF\u2019s own negligence is a material fact bearing on whether S &amp; S will owe indemnity. If BASF\u2019s negligence did cause the injuries, the claims are not within the indemnity provision; if BASF is found free from fault, however, S &amp; S will owe costs of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">III. <em>BASF\u2019s Negligence is Genuinely at Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">S &amp; S attempts to show that BASF\u2019s negligence is not genuinely at issue by relying on BASF\u2019s stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agz-dedup-1\">in the event [Plaintiffs] were injured as the result of exposure to toxic fumes, the work performed by S &amp; S [ ] had' no direct or indirect effect on the release of the toxic fumes. Rather, the basis upon which the alleged contractual obligation is triggered is the reality that the plaintiffs would not have been present on the site and exposed to the fumes but for the work S &amp; S was performing at the time of the alleged exposure pursuant to its contract with BASF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">S &amp; S\u2019s Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute (R. 57-58), agreed to in BASF\u2019s Statement of Disputed Facts (R. 96). S &amp; S would have the court infer from this stipulation that, because <em>its work </em>had no effect on the release of fumes, some fault of <em>the indemnitee </em>obviously caused the release of fumes. Even if this stipulation absolves S &amp; S of fault for the injuries, BASF\u2019s negligence is a distinct inquiry that has not been established one way or another by summary judgment evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>has been no determination whether BASF s negligence caused any injuries, or whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims even have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The district court erroneously held that <em>Perkins v. Rubicon, Inc., </em>563 So.2d 258 (La.1990), supports summary judgment for S &amp; S. <em>Perkins </em>decided only that a claim \u201carises out of\u201d performance of work (within the meaning of a contract) if the claimant \u201cwould not have been present at the site to be injured but for [the] performance of the work\u201d. <em>Perkins, </em>563 So.2d at 259. <em>Perkins </em>did not decide the question of fault and indeed noted that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d does not require fault on the part of the contractor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The comparable provision in the contract at issue is the requirement that the injury \u201coccur[ ] directly or indirectly as the result of Contractor\u2019s prosecution of the work.\u201d By analogy to the provision in <em>Perkins, </em>we hold that this provision does not require fault of the contractor. The provision requires only a presence test, a \u201cbut for\u201d causation test, like the provision in <em>Perkins. </em>The district court\u2019s statement that no evidence shows that the injuries were \u201cthe result of the contractor\u2019s prosecution of the work\u201d either misconstrued the stipulation or misconstrued <em>Perkins. </em>The stipulation that the plaintiffs would not have been exposed to the fumes but for the contractor\u2019s work satisfies the presence test required by this provision of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Whether or not BASF negligence caused any injuries bears on BASF\u2019s indemnity claim. No summary judgment evidence was presented on this issue of material fact. Nothing in <em>Perkins v. Rubicon </em>or the stipulations resolves the issue. The judgment dismissing BASF\u2019s indemnity claim is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">. 343 So.2d 1000 (La.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">. 488 So.2d 982 (La.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">. We do not address whether the contract provides indemnity, for the consequences of BASF\u2019s possible strict liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">. Before the non-moving party is required to produce evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the moving party in a motion for summary judgment must demonstrate that there are no factual Issues warranting trial. <em>Russ v.
