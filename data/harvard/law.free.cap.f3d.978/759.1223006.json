We find his contentions without merit and affirm both conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b852-28\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-29\">The basic facts, as demonstrated by the evidence introduced at trial, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>a. On December 19, 1990, Resurrecci\u00f3n, a resident of Los Angeles, arrived at Logan Airport, Boston, on a flight from Germany.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">b. Customs agents found in Resurrec-cion\u2019s possession six cashier\u2019s checks and two demand drafts, all apparently issued by the Bank Utama in Malaysia. The checks and drafts had a total face value of more than $18 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">c. Resurrecci\u00f3n testified that the checks and drafts were to be used \u201cfor discounting,\u201d that he hoped \u201cto get 80 percent of the face amount\u201d of the checks, and that he might \u201caccept as little as 40 percent\u201d of face value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">d. An official of Bank Utama testified that the checks and drafts were forgeries; they were not instruments of the Bank Utama.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The jury convicted Resurrecci\u00f3n. The court sentenced him to a prison term of 51 months to be followed by three years of supervised release. And, as we said, Re-surrecci\u00f3n now appeals his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">\n<em>The Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence. </em>Resurrecci\u00f3n points out that the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, makes it an offense \u201cknowingly\u201d to transport forged or counterfeit instruments. He adds that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to show that he <em>knew </em>the instruments were not genuine. The government, however, pointed out to the jury that Resurrecci\u00f3n intended to obtain 40% to 80% of the checks\u2019 face value, and it asked why Resurrecci\u00f3n would think he could only receive 40% to 80% of the checks\u2019 face value had he believed the checks were genuine. Valid cashier\u2019s checks, after all, are negotiable for full value at the issuing bank. In addition, the government introduced a letter (dated two days after the date on the cashier\u2019s checks), which customs agents found in Resurreccion\u2019s briefcase. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-12\">This is it! Everyone of us is working very hard on this deal. The bank officer has to be take care of; the telecom guy co operation secured. Thesefore it is now vitally important that we would not foul up this time. I will fax you, on another sheet, the detail of fax for verification. Meantime, you must proceed to obtain from N.Y. the verbiage of the confirmation required, date and time settings etc. [sic.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">The government also introduced into evidence a Logan Airport customs form on which Resurrecci\u00f3n had falsely answered \u201cno\u201d to the question asking whether he was \u201ccarrying ... monetary instruments over $10,000 U.S. or foreign equivalent.\u201d Finally, the jury might have disbelieved Resurreccion\u2019s testimony that he had traveled to Germany in order to \u201cbroker between some people who are going to buy and sell cars,\u201d particularly since Resurrec-ci\u00f3n, on his customs form, had stated that the purpose of his trip abroad was not \u201cbusiness,\u201d but \u201cpleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Given the jury\u2019s powers to assess credibility, <em>see United States v. Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d 1169, 1197 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 130, 112 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990), the totality of this evidence is sufficient to permit the jury to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Resurrecci\u00f3n had the requisite knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">2. . <em>The Missing Witness. </em>Resurrecci\u00f3n argues that his conviction is fundamentally unfair and violates the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const, amend. V, because he was unable to summon for his trial a potential witness, Abang Zaidi, a Bank Utama official in Malaysia who lives beyond the reach of compulsory process. He points out that a signature reading \u201cAbang Zaidi\u201d appears on a document found in Resurrecci\u00f3n\u2019s possession, a document that bears Bank Utama\u2019s letterhead and says that certain numbered cashier\u2019s checks \u201care authentic\u201d and \u201cwill be honoured upon presentation at our counters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">The problem with this argument, however, is that Resurrecci\u00f3n did not clearly explain to the court just how calling Zaidi would help him. Another Bank Utama official who appeared at the trial testified that the Zaidi signature was false. And, he identified as genuine other bank documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>containing Zaidi\u2019s signature, which apparently genuine signature does not even faintly resemble the signature on the bottom of Resurreccion\u2019s letter. Under these circumstances, it seems likely that Zaidi, in person, would have hurt, not helped, Resur-reccion\u2019s cause. Resurrecci\u00f3n has provided neither this court, nor the district court, any good reason for believing the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The Constitution does not automatically entitle a criminal defendant to unobtainable testimony. <em>See United States v. Greco, </em>298 F.2d 247, 251 (2nd Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 831, 7 L.Ed.2d 785 (1962) (explaining that the right to compulsory process does not extend to witnesses beyond the subpoena power); <em>United States v. Theresius Filippi, </em>918 F.2d 244, 247 (1st Cir.1990). And, we can find nothing fundamentally unfair about convicting Resurrecci\u00f3n without unobtainable testimony, the potential value of which is so highly speculative. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that defendant must make \u201csome plausible showing\u201d that the lost evidence is \u201cboth material and favorable\u201d to the defense); <em>United States v. Mount, </em>896 F.2d 612, 621 (1st Cir.1990) (\u201cBefore the absence of defense witnesses can be said to violate either the right to compulsory process or due process, the defendant must show that the testimony from the missing witnesses would have been relevant, material, and favorable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>The Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The district court, in calculating Resur-reccion\u2019s sentence, followed the Sentencing Guidelines instructions to' \u201cApply \u00a7 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.2 (\u201cForgery: Offenses Involving ... Counterfeit Instruments Other than ... Obligations of the United States\u201d); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. A, instruction for applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 (the statute of conviction). The court, following the Fraud Guideline, began with a base level of 6, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(a), added fifteen levels for a \u201closs\u201d of between $10 million and $20 million, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(P), and added two more levels for \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). The resulting 23 levels, along with Resurreccion\u2019s criminal history category of I, produced a Guideline sentencing range of 46 to 57 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, sentencing table. The court imposed a mid-range sentence of 51 months imprisonment. Re-surrecci\u00f3n raises four objections to this calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">1. Resurrecci\u00f3n says that the court\u2019s calculation of a $10 million to $20 million \u201closs\u201d was improper because (1) there was no actual loss, (2) there was no known victim, and (3) there was, at most, a \u201crisk of harm\u201d that a court cannot use- to calculate \u201closs.\u201d As to the first point, (and as Resurrecci\u00f3n concedes) a Fraud Guideline \u201closs\u201d includes as a countable \u201closs,\u201d not only an <em>actual </em>loss, but also an <em>\u201cintended </em>loss,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1. comment, (n. 7) (emphasis added), which \u201cneed not be precise,\u201d <em>id. </em>at n. 8, and which \u201cfigure w[ill] be used if it [i]s larger than the actual loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 7. Indeed, the Guideline provides as an illustration that if a defendant \u201crepresentad] that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be treated as $40,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court could reasonably have concluded that Resurrecci\u00f3n had intended to use the forged instruments to obtain between $10 million and $20 million from someone, for Resurrecci\u00f3n testified that he had hoped to \u201cdiscount\u201d the checks at 80% of their face value ($18 million), but that he might have had to accept less. This intention to sell the checks for $10 million to $20 million would have represented an eventual intended \u201closs\u201d of that amount to someone, since Resurrecci\u00f3n knew that Bank Utama would never have honored the checks.'</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">As to the second point, the Guidelines do not require a court specifically to identify a particular victim. That there likely are such victims, or that the defendant intends them to exist, is often sufficient to show a likely actual, or intended, loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">As to the third point, Resurrecci\u00f3n bases his argument (that a \u201crisk\u201d of harm should not be included in loss calculations) upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>commentary to a different guideline, namely the \u201cRelevant Conduct\u201d Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. comment, (n. 4). That note says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">If, ... the guideline refers only to harm sustained ... or to actual, attempted or intended harm <em>(e.g., </em>\u00a7 2F1.1 ...), the risk created enters into the determination of the offense level only insofar as it is incorporated into the base offense level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anz-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>The note then adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">Unless clearly indicated by the guidelines, harm that is merely risked is not to be treated as the equivalent of harm that occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-7\"><em>Id. </em>This language, however, does not help Resurrecci\u00f3n, for it refers to \u201crisks\u201d of harm <em>other than </em>\u201cintended harm,\u201d which (in the case of fraud) the relevant guideline <em>does </em>\u201cclearly indicate[]\u201d is to be counted. This commentary means (a) to avoid a kind of double counting (say, adding punishment for risk of injury from a gun over and above what the robbery guideline specifically provides for carrying a gun, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)) and (b) to avoid a court\u2019s using a standard that differs from the standard a specific guideline provides (say, adding punishment for a <em>risk </em>that a fraud will destroy a financial institution when the relevant guideline provides a two level increase for a fraud that <em>\u201csubstantially jeopardized </em>the safety and soundness of a financial institution,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(6) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Resurrecci\u00f3n cites in support of his arguments <em>United States v. Kopp, </em>951 F.2d 521 (3rd Cir.1991). In that case, an offender fraudulently obtained a loan of about $14 million from a bank, while pledging valuable security to the bank. The offender defaulted, the bank foreclosed, and, in the process, the bank allegedly lost about $3.5 million. <em>See id. </em>at 522. The Third Circuit held that the $14 million amount of the loan approximated neither the actual, nor the intended, \u201closs\u201d from the fraud, because sale of the security pledged by the offender had prevented a bank loss of the full $14 million. <em>See id. </em>at 524-25, 536. We do not see how <em>Kopp </em>is relevant here, for unlike the offender there, who pledged valuable security that mitigated the loss caused by his fraud, Resurrecci\u00f3n had intended to sell completely worthless securities that would have created a loss equal to the \u00bffull price at which he planned to sell them.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">2. Resurrecci\u00f3n says that the district court should not have increased his offense two levels for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). The offense at issue here, however, obviously involved a complex plan, and we can find no \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregorio, </em>956 F.2d 341, 343-44 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">3. Resurrecci\u00f3n says that the district court should have given him a two level reduction because he was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Given the letters found in Resurreccion\u2019s briefcase, however, and the other evidence recited above, the district court lawfully could have found, as it did, that Resurrecci\u00f3n \u201cwas no mere mule here, but a critical player in a wide-ranging fraud scheme.\u201d There is no \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Akitoye, </em>923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">4. Resurrecci\u00f3n says that the district court should have given him a two level reduction because of his \u201cacceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The district court, which has broad discretionary power in awarding, or denying, this reduction, <em>see United States v. Bradley, </em>917 F.2d 601, 606 (1st Cir.1990), determined, in light of Resurreccion\u2019s claims of innocence and testimony that the district court found \u201cessentially perjurious,\u201d that he had not accepted responsibility for the crime. There is no legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
