The United States Supreme Court vacated our original affir-mance of Danny Corley\u2019s conviction and sentence for burglary of a federal post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>office, <em>United States v. Corley, </em>967 F.2d 101 (5th Cir.1991), and remanded in light of <em>Williams v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). <em>See Corley v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2932, 119 L.Ed.2d 558 (1992). We now vacate Corley\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AMR\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">A full recitation of the relevant facts of this case is adequately set forth in our prior decision. <em>See Corley, </em>967 F.2d at 104. As the Government concedes, \u201cit is undisputed that there was an incorrect application of the Guidelines in this case.\u201d In particular, the district court erred in calculating Corley\u2019s criminal history score to be 36. A correct application of the Guidelines would have yielded a score of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\"><em>Williams </em>requires that, in a case where a district court has misapplied the Guidelines, \u201c[a] remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes that the error was harmless, <em>i.e., that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of a sentence.\u201d </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. at 1120-21 (emphasis added). The burden of proving a misapplication of the Guidelines is on the party challenging the sentence on appeal; however, after this, the burden shifts to the party defending the sentence on appeal to prove that \u201cbut for\u201d the misapplication of the Guidelines, the district court would have imposed an identical sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">In the instant case, the Government has not convinced us that, had the district court in the first place correctly calculated Cor-ley\u2019s criminal history score to be 21, the court still would have departed upward to the same sentence of 48 months. To understand our position, the district court\u2019s reasoning process in sentencing Corley must be set forth in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">First, in its erroneous attempt to apply the Guidelines, the district court unintentionally under-calculated Corley\u2019s criminal history score as 12. Dissatisfied with this score as a reflection of Corley\u2019s actual criminal history and also dissatisfied with the Guidelines\u2019 recommended sentence of 21-27 months,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court recalculated Cor-ley\u2019s criminal history score to be 36 under an \u201carbitrary [scoring] system,\u201d <em>Corley, </em>967 F.2d at 105, that had no relation to the Guidelines\u2019 scoring system. The court\u2019s calculation of 36 was thus not actually a \u201cmisapplication\u201d of the Guidelines; rather, it was in total disregard of the Guidelines\u2019 mechanism for calculating a defendant's criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">The Guidelines\u2019 recommended sentencing ranges are based on a combination of a defendant\u2019s criminal history <em>category </em>of IVI \u2014 which is determined by a defendant\u2019s criminal history <em>score</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 and the offense level for the crime committed. Because the minimum criminal history score necessary for placement in Category VI (the highest of the six categories) is 13, the district court\u2019s miscalculated score of 36 yielded a recommended sentence of 24-30 months, which would have been the same recommended sentence had Corley\u2019s score been correctly calculated at 21. The district court considered that range to be inadequate in view of Corley\u2019s extensive criminal history. Therefore, the court felt compelled to depart upward from the high end of the range (30 months) to 48 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">Of course, a decision to depart upward is not a misapplication of the Guidelines. However, in Corley\u2019s case, the district court\u2019s rationale for the selection of the 48 month figure is significant for our analysis under <em>Williams. </em>In sentencing Corley to 48 months, the court noted that \u201c[i]n your case, the criminal history points [under the court\u2019s own arbitrary scoring system] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>would be more than double the [minimum] points assigned to criminal history category 6 [i.e., 13], and thus the assigned imprisonment range of 24 to 30 months could be doubled to 48 to 60 months.\u201d Thus, the 48 month sentence was \u201ca result of\u201d a misapplication of the Guidelines, <em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1120, even though the court did not err in placing Corley in Category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Government, however, argues that \u201c[t]he artificial [calculations] that the trial court went through with regard to the defendant\u2019s criminal history [score] are irrelevant. What is relevant and determinative ... is that the court first considered Category VI, but rejected it because it ... under[-]represented the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct.\u201d We disagree with the Government\u2019s characterization of the district court\u2019s arbitrary scoring as irrelevant. Although the court\u2019s own scoring system was \u2014 albeit unwittingly \u2014 correct to the extent that the court placed Corley in Category VI, the court\u2019s articulated basis for departing upward to 48 months was premised on a total disregard for the Guidelines criminal history scoring mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">We cannot say with assurance that, had the district court correctly calculated Cor-ley\u2019s criminal history score to be 21 \u2014 rather than 36 \u2014 it would have departed upward to 48 months. Our conclusion is specifically based on the court\u2019s observation that the score of 36 was \u201cmore than double\u201d the minimum score of 13 necessary to place a defendant in Category VI. The difference between 21 and 36 is, therefore, quite significant. Had the court calculated the correct criminal history score of 21 in the first place, the court might not have felt the need to \u201cdouble\u201d Corley\u2019s sentencing range. The differential between 13 and 21(8) is considerably less the differential between 13 and 36(23).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We do not intend to imply that the district court, after considering the correct criminal history score of 21, will be foreclosed from departing upward to 48 months in resentencing. Rather, we are only complying with the Supreme Court\u2019s command in <em>Williams: </em>We have identified a misapplication of the Guidelines, and it is clear that Corley\u2019s 48 month sentence was imposed \u201cas a result of\u201d the misapplication. We simply cannot say with assurance that an identical sentence would have been imposed had the court correctly applied the Guidelines in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we REMAND Corley\u2019s case to the district court for resen-tencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-15\">. This recommended sentence resulted from a criminal history category of V and an offense level of 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-16\">. Categories I through VI are inclusive of the following criminal history point ranges: Category I (0-1 points); Category II (2-3 points); Category III (4-6 points); Category IV (7-9 points); Category V (10-12 points); Category VI (13 points and higher). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Sentencing Table, at 280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\">. Indeed, the district court very well might not have totally disregarded the Guidelines mechanism for calculating a criminal history score had the court correctly calculated Corley\u2019s score to be 21 rather than 12. Obviously, the court\u2019s decision to engage in its own arbitrary scoring was the result of its frustration stemming from its erroneous under-calculated score of 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
