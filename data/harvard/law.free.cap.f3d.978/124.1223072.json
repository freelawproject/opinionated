(A8.) At the plea hearing, he admitted exactly what was charged, <em>i.e:, </em>distribution of 14 ounces of cocaine on that date. (A30.) Thus, the offense of conviction was possession and distribution of less than 500 grams of cocaine on March 26, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">The appellant, Delviscovo, raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-19\">1. Whether the due process rights of defendant were violated by the court\u2019s erroneous application of the sentencing guidelines and by the court\u2019s imposition of a penalty for which the indictment did not contain proper notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-20\">2. Whether defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated by the court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and the prosecution\u2019s urging of a sentence in excess of the maximum amount specified by the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-21\">3. Whether the court violated the Eighth Amendment rights of defendant and his rights under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines by its refusal to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines found applicable under the career offender provisions of the sentencing guidelines?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">If the court had imposed a statutory maximum at an offense level of 32 under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines it is not clear whether Delviscovo would have made any claim that he was entitled to a downward departure under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. As imposed, the sentence was erroneous as a matter of law. We will therefore vacate the sentence imposed and remand the case for resentenc-ing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-15\">. If there are any other claims that Delviscovo has when this matter is heard for resentencing, he should raise those issues with the sentencing judge at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
