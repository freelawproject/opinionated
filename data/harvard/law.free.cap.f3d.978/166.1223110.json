HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Ronald Peters and Thomas Pullen appeal their sentences after each pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring to illegally export helicopters in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778. Both defendants challenge the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2, and the addition of offense points for managerial involvement under \u00a7 3B 1.1(c). Pullen complains of the refusal to depart downward from the guideline sentence range in his case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">In January 1990, a confidential informant contacted the U.S. Customs Service regarding a suspicious sale of helicopters. Peters had solicited the informant to purchase seven Agusta Bell Model 204 helicopters from a California company. Helicopters which are specifically designed, modified, or equipped for military purposes are included on the United States Munitions List, 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.1, Category VIII(a), and may not be exported without a license. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778. The Model 204 helicopter is equipped with \u201chard points\u201d to which weapons systems may be attached, allowing easy adaptation to military purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no dispute that export of the Model 204 without a license is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">Peters and Pullen told the informant that the helicopters were to be purchased and taken to Canada, where they would be resold to an unnamed foreign country unfriendly to the United States. Defendants never attempted to obtain an export license. Peters represented to the informant that he was the broker among the parties involved, and Pullen purported to be the foreign buyer\u2019s representative. Trying to obtain financing for the helicopter purchase, they convened a number of meetings and telephone conversations which included the informant between January and June, 1990. At least one person other than the defendants and the informant attended one of the meetings. Due to financial difficulties the conspiracy terminated in the summer of 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">When Peters was notified that he was the target of a federal investigation, he immediately began to cooperate. The government credited his substantial cooperation for disclosing Pullen\u2019s identity and convincing Pullen to plead guilty. As a result the government moved for a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines for Peters under \u00a7 5K1.1. Pullen, on the other hand, told a probation officer that he believed he had done nothing wrong since the conspiracy had not achieved its objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tive. He also expressed bitterness toward the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Both defendants pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge. The Pre-Sentencing Report for both defendants established a final offense level of nineteen. The base offense level for conspiring to violate the munitions export laws was assessed at twenty-two. This level was reduced by three for failure to complete the substantive offense, \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2), and two for acceptance of responsibility. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Two points were added to each defendant for playing a managerial role in the offense. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Since both Peters and Pullen had a criminal history category I, the resulting sentence range for both was thirty to thirty-seven months, plus two to three years supervised release and fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The district court accepted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion regarding Peters and departed downward from the guidelines by sentencing him to twelve months confinement plus thirty-six months supervised release and the guideline minimum fine. The court rejected Pullen\u2019s suggestion that past military service and commendations justified a downward departure for him. Pullen was sentenced to the guideline minimum confinement of thirty months, plus thirty-six months supervised release and the guideline minimum fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Both Peters and Pullen challenge the base offense level applied in their sentencing. They contend that under the Guideline provisions in force in the spring of 1990, the proper base offense level should be fourteen, not twenty-two. At that time the applicable section provided for a base offense level of \u201c(1) 22, if sophisticated weaponry was involved; or (2) 14.\u201d \u00a7 2M5.2. The court found that the Model 204 helicopters were sophisticated weaponry. The defendants dispute the factual and legal bases of this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The term sophisticated weaponry was not defined in the Guidelines, but its meaning was addressed by this court in <em>United States v. Nissen, </em>928 F.2d 690 (5th Cir. 1991). We held that the 1990 amendment to \u00a7 2M5.2 may be considered in determining whether items should be considered sophisticated weaponry under the pre-amendment provision. <em>Id. </em>at 695. That amendment provided that the base offense level should be twenty-two, or fourteen if the offense involved only ten or fewer non-fully-automatic small arms. \u00a7 2M5.2 (as amended Nov. 1, 1990). In light of that clarification of \u00a7 2M5.2\u2019s intended meaning, we decided that \u201cthe lower base offense level [of pre-1990 \u00a7 2M5.2] is reserved for truly minor exports of military equipment.\u201d <em>Nissen, </em>928 F.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The district court\u2019s factual determination that seven Model 204 helicopters are sophisticated weaponry is reviewed for clear error. <em>See id. </em>Peters and Pullen argue that these helicopters were not sophisticated weaponry because they were civilian aircraft only potentially usable for military purposes. Unlike most civilian aircraft, these helicopters were made with reinforced structures permitting the attachment of military hardware. The United States Munitions List controls aircraft \u201cspecifically designed, modified, or equipped for military purposes.\u201d 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.1, Category VIII(a). The Model 204 fits that description. We are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">In making'its determination, the district court referred to the clarification of \u00a7 2M5.2 by the 1990 amendment. Peters and Pullen argue that using the amendment to interpret the earlier provision amounted to an ex post facto application of the amendment. The Supreme Court has held that a criminal law is ex post facto if it is retrospective and disadvantages an offender by altering matters of substance. <em>Miller v. Florida, </em>482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). Defendants rely on <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>911 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir.1990), which held that an amendment to \u00a7 1B1.3 could not be retroactively applied because it substantially changed that provision. <em>Id. </em>at 1022. Two important distinctions exist between this case and <em>Suarez. </em>First, the question in <em>Suarez </em>was under which set of terms \u2014 pre-amendment or post-amendment \u2014 the defendant could be sentenced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Here, the district court sentenced both defendants under the terms of pre-amendment \u00a7 2M5.2 by determining whether or not sophisticated weaponry was involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reference to the amendment was only made in order to clarify the meaning of the pre-amendment section.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">More importantly, we have already held that the 1990 amendment to \u00a7 2M5.2 did not effect a substantive change to the provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">We view this amendment as making no substantive changes to either the guideline itself or to its commentary. Since it was intended only to clarify this guideline\u2019s application, we may consider the amended language, even though it was not effective at the time of sentencing for the offense in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>Nissen, </em>928 at 694-95. The district court permissibly followed the lead of this court in looking to the non-substantive amendment to interpret the governing provision. No unconstitutional ex post facto application of a substantive change increasing the defendants\u2019 sentence occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Defendants also complain of the offense level increase for acting as \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in the offense. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). Among the considerations suggested by \u00a7 3Bl.l(e)\u2019s commentary are planning, organizing, recruitment of accomplices, and the scope of the illegal activity. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 3). Peters and Pullen argue that their scheme was a two-man conspiracy with neither one exercising a leadership or managerial role over the other. The pre-sentencing report indicates that their scheme was more far-reaching and complicated than their characterization admits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants recruited the informant\u2019s involvement and met with an undercover Customs agent. At least one other person attended a meeting as well. Peters represented himself as a broker in the transaction. Pullen identified himself as the representative of an unnamed foreign buyer. Defendants have failed to show that the district court clearly erred in finding that they were organizers of this criminal activity within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Finally, Pullen complains of the district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure for his sentence. A claim that the court improperly failed to reduce a sentence will succeed only if the court's failure to depart violated the law. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d 454, 462 (5th Cir.1992). The district court departed for Peters after a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and sentenced him to twelve months. Pullen argues that he should have been given a similar sentence because (1) his sentence should be comparable to Peters\u2019 sentence; (2) the government made the oral equivalent of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at sentencing; and (3) his military service and commendations warranted a downward departure. We disagree with each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The fact that another party received a lesser sentence for the same offense does not make a sentence within the guideline range improper. <em>See United States v. Puma, </em>937 F.2d 151, 156 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 1165, 117 L.Ed.2d 412 (1992). The district court was justified in giving Peters and Pullen different sentences because the government acknowledged that Peters' cooperation was substantial. Courts give substantial weight to the government\u2019s evaluation of a defendant\u2019s assistance. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, (n. 3). Peters promptly and completely disclosed his involvement to investigators, and convinced Pullen to plead guilty. Pullen has failed to point to similar assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">We do not agree that the prosecutor\u2019s statement at sentencing amounted to an oral \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-17\">[BJased on his cooperation with the government and the fact of our mistake in representation to him prior to [sentencing regarding the correct guideline calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lation], as well as his distinguished military career, and the fact that he has no prior criminal record, we would ask that that will mitigate in terms of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIS\">The statement does not establish that Pul-len had provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d as \u00a7 5K1.1 requires. Rather than requesting a downward departure from the guideline range, it apparently does no more than suggest leniency within that range. We find no violation of law in the district court\u2019s failure to depart on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We are not persuaded that Pullen\u2019s military service and receipt of two purple hearts and a distinguished flying cross compel a departure from the sentencing guidelines. The primary focus of the sentencing guidelines is on the crime committed rather than on the individual offender. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Ruiz, </em>868 F.2d 698, 700 (5th Cir.1989), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Bachynsky, </em>934 F.2d 1349 (5th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (en banc). The Guidelines discourage departing on the basis of a variety of individual characteristics including previous employment record and community ties. \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.5, 5H1.6. An individual\u2019s service to the community does not justify a departure from the Guidelines. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>950 F.2d 969, 971 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 64, 121 L.Ed.2d 31 (1992). Without deciding, as some circuits have,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whether or not military service could ever justify a departure, we conclude that the facts of this case do not present such extraordinary circumstances as to require departure on the basis of this individual characteristic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court committed no violation of law in declining to depart downward from the guideline sentence range in Pullen\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-19\">.

The district court may rely upon information in the PSR which has some minimum indicium of reliability. <em>United States v.

In neither <em>McCaleb </em>nor <em>Neil, </em>however, was a departure based on military service found warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-21\">. Our confidence in this conclusion is bolstered by the fact, which we note but do not rely upon, that the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to add military service to the list of ordinarily irrelevant considerations. \u00a7 5H1.11 (as amended Nov. 1, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
