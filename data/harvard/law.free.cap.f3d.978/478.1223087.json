The partnership appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in HUD\u2019s favor. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-26\">In 1980, Clay Tower Apartments, an Oregon general partnership, finished construction on a housing project for low-income elderly people. <em>Clay Tower Apartments v. Kemp, </em>757 F.Supp. 1145, 1146 (D.Or.1991). The partnership financed the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>through what is now known as the Oregon Housing Agency [OHA], The financing proceeded under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by \u00a7 201(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 653 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437 to 1440).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Pursuant to the Section 8 Program, OHA and the partnership entered into a Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments [HAP] contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under a HAP contract, the owner collects a portion of the \u201ccontract rent\u201d directly from the tenants while the remainder is paid to the owner by HUD through the contract administrator, OHA. <em>See Rainier View Assocs. v. United States ex rel. U.S. Dep\u2019t Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>848 F.2d 988, 989 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (explaining the Section 8 Program), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1066, 109 S.Ct. 2065, 104 L.Ed.2d 630 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Before construction began, the City of Portland granted the project a real property tax exemption. <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1146. Under the terms of the exemption, the city assessed taxes against the underlying land and abated taxes assessed against improvements for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Both the partnership and OHA questioned what would happen to the contract rents when the abatement expired. In April 1978, HUD's housing development director responded in a letter to OHA\u2019s administrator. The letter cited the regulation for special additional adjustments to contract rent and concluded \u201c[w]e trust that this is sufficient to answer your concerns.\u201d <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The parties forged ahead. OHA and the partnership entered into an HAP contract which HUD subsequently approved. <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1146. The underlying financial analysis included under \u201cTotal Annual Expense\u201d a line for taxes. The figure \u201c10,000\u201d was typed on that line. No mention was made of the tax abatement; no mention was made of future tax obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">As required by the Section 8 Program, the HAP contract set forth the initial contract rent and included two mechanisms for its increase. <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1147. First, under the mandate of section 1437f(c)(2)(A), the contract provided \u201cautomatic annual adjustments\" to reflect changes in area-wide expenses, including increases in full real property tax. Each year from 1980 through 1990, Clay Tower\u2019s contract rents increased by the full percentage allowed under the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Second, carrying out the mandate of section 1437f(c)(2)(B), the contract permitted special \u201cadditional adjustments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These compensate for \u201csubstantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates, or similar costs which are not adequately compensated for by the adjustment\u201d authorized by the first provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">In 1980, construction ceased, and the tax abatement period began. The completed, seventeen-story building included 233 one-bedroom apartments reserved for low-income tenants. In 1990, anticipating the end of the tax abatement period, Clay Tower applied to OHA for a special additional adjustment in the contract rent to compensate for the expected, substantial tax increase. <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1147. OHA forwarded the request to HUD; HUD denied the request, stating that the expiration of the abatement was not a general increase in real property taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>On June 30, 1990, the property tax exemption expired. Multnomah County\u2019s tax statement reflects that Clay Tower\u2019s net assessed value increased from $600,000 to $9,343,800. The real property taxes increased accordingly, from $19,937 to $313,-062.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The partnership sued for declaratory relief. In a published opinion, the district court upheld HUD\u2019s statutory interpretation and entered summary judgment in HUD\u2019s favor. <em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1149. The partnership timely appealed; we have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Jones v. Union Pacific R.R., </em>968 F.2d 937, 940 (9th Cir.1992). We use federal law to interpret a government contract. <em>Saavedra v. Donovan, </em>700 F.2d 496, 498 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 892, 104 S.Ct. 236, 78 L.Ed.2d 227 (1983). \u201cWhen, as here, the district court\u2019s decision is based on analysis of the contract language, the decision is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Rainier View, </em>848 F.2d at 990 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Although the contract signed by the parties contains the same language as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(c)(2)(B), this case does not stand on mere agency interpretation. The existence of the contract changes the nature of our review. Section 1437f(c)(2)(B) notwithstanding, the parties executed a contract, and our inquiry focuses on the contractual, requirements. This focus does not demand deference to HUD\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>principles of contract interpretation as applied to the facts. <em>United States v. Plummer, </em>941 F.2d 799, 803 (9th Cir.1991). The agency argues that, by its plain meaning, the contract excludes Clay Tower\u2019s increase. HUD contends that the word \u201cgeneral\u201d signals Congress\u2019 intent to authorize additional adjustments in maximum rents only when real estate taxes of all similarly situated property owners in a given locale increase substantially. HUD says that if a local municipality doubled real estate taxes, that might be a \u201cgeneral\u201d increase not accounted for by the automatic adjustment because the automatic adjustment generally has a more regional focus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">The partnership says that, even under the government\u2019s definition, its tax increase qualifies as \u201cgeneral.\u201d Unlike a true site-specific tax increase, it occurred by operation of a state statute that necessarily applies equally and uniformly to similarly situated properties. The category of similarly situated properties includes those properties granted temporary tax abate-ments under the authority of that statute. The increase is \u201cgeneral\u201d because it applies to any project receiving the ten-year exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">The partnership argues that the increase qualifies as \u201cgeneral\u201d for two other reasons. First, it is permanent. Clay Tower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>will be subject to the higher tax as long as the apartment building exists. Second, it brings Clay Tower\u2019s tax base into line with that for most other developed properties. Its taxes will be based on the assessed value of both the land and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We hold that the contract unambiguously supports Clay Tower\u2019s interpretation. HUD entered into the Annual Contributions Contract with the partnership knowing that the project\u2019s tax exemption would expire after ten years. This inevitable tax increase was not a result of a unique rise in property value; nor was it a result of bad management. In fact, the exemption reduced the operating costs of the subsidized low-income housing for ten years. HUD was the direct beneficiary of reduced real property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The ten-year property tax abatement expired by operation of a state statute. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 307.630. The statute applies uniformly to all similarly situated properties. \"[A] law is general when it operates equally and uniformly upon all persons, places, or things brought within the relation and circumstances for which it provided.\u201d <em>Farrell v. Port of Columbia, </em>50 Or. 169, 91 P. 546, 547 (1907). The increase in property taxes for Clay Tower Apartments was \u201cgeneral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Claims for attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), shall be considered by the district court. The partnership shall recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to HUD and REMAND for entry of declaratory relief in favor of the partnership.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">. The initial term of the contract was five years. Four optional additional terms of five years each and one additional term of three years are possible under the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\">. The entire denial read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">This is in response to your June 5, 1990, request for a special adjustment to the rents at Clay Tower resulting from the expiration of the 10-year tax abatement by the City of Portland. <em>We are unable to grant your request because expiration of the abatement is not a \"general increase in real property taxes </em>...\u201d (24 CFR 883.710).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-20\">It was not necessary for you to submit this request to us, since the decision regarding its eligibility should have been made in your office pursuant with your responsibility under the Annual Contributions Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-21\">We suggest, if you have not already done so, that you look at the Amortization Schedule for Clay Tower to see if the abatement cancel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>lation is reflected by an adjustment in the debt service. We found this to be true for our insured properties with similar tax abate-ments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\"><em>Clay Tower, </em>757 F.Supp. at 1147 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">. <em>Alpine Ridge Group v. Kemp, </em>955 F.2d 1382, 1385 (9th Cir.1992). <em>See generally Rainier View, </em>848 F.2d 988 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>Sheridan Square Partnership v. United States ex rel. U.S. Dep't of Horn. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>761 F.Supp. 738, 741 (D.Colo.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\">. HUD also points to cases which interpret the phrase \"general rate increases\u201d as used in the Staggers Rail Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(6). For example, in <em>Texas v. United States, </em>the Fifth Circuit defined it to mean \"those [increases] that ... apply nationally or throughout broad regions of the country.\u201d 730 F.2d 339, 346 n. 11 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>469 U.S. 892, 105 S.Ct. 267, 83 L.Ed.2d 203 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">The partnership effectively establishes the irrelevancy of this interpretation. First, the Section 8 Program predates the Rail Act. Interpretations of the latter are therefore of marginal value in determining what was meant when the former was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">Second, applying the Rail Act interpretation here makes little sense. Subsection A, the automatic adjustment provision, compensates for national and regional increases. If subsection B had the same scope, it would be a redundancy. Third, even HUD does not adopt this interpretation. It reads \"general\u201d to refer to \"a given locale,\u201d such as a municipality, rather than the nation or a broad region.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
