Huffman and his wife, Patricia S. Huffman, now deceased, appeal from the Tax Court\u2019s partial grant of their motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees requested under I.R.C. \u00a7 7430, as amended by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342, \u00a7 6239(a) (\u201cTAMRA\u201d), which allows the recovery of \u201creasonable administrative costs\u201d and \u201creasonable litigation costs\u201d by a prevailing party in a tax case. I.R.C. \u00a7 7430(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner cross-appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-18\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-19\">1. Did the Tax Court err as a matter of law in bifurcating the analysis under \u00a7 7340 to determine whether the \u201cUnited States\u2019 position in the proceeding\u201d was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d into two stages: the \u201cadministrative stage,\u201d which concerns the notice of deficiency, and the \u201cjudicial stage\u201d which concerns the government\u2019s answer to the Tax Court petition? <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>2. Assuming bifurcated analysis is proper under \u00a7 7430, did the Tax Court err as a matter of law, or otherwise abuse its discretion, by considering only the answer filed by Respondent in the judicial proceeding and in holding that the United States\u2019 position in the judicial proceeding was substantially justified?</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">3. Did the Tax Court err as a matter of law in holding that the tax specialty of taxpayers\u2019 counsel was not, nor were any other \u201cspecial factor[s]\u201d shown, within the meaning of \u00a7 7430(c)(l)(B)(iii), which would justify awarding Clair S. Huffman, individually and as executor, attorney\u2019s fees in excess of the statutory rate of $75.00 per hour?</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">4. Did the Tax Court err as a matter of law in determining that, while Petitioners were entitled to reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees in excess of $75.00 per hour due to an increase in the cost of living, the measurement of the cost of living adjustment was from October 1, 1981 (the effective date of the Equal Access to Justice Act) and not from January 1, 1986 (the effective date of the cost of living adjustment in \u00a7 7430)?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">5. Did the Tax Court abuse its discretion in finding that 15.9 hours of attorney time and $20.00 for costs were all the recoverable fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">The procedural history of this matter is extended, and largely irrelevant to the disposition of the issues. The Internal Revenue Service engaged in stonewalling and outright perjury in handling the administrative disposition of Petitioners\u2019 notice of deficiency after this notice was initially issued in violation of the TEFRA partnership audit rules. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-248, \u00a7 402, 96 Stat. 324, 648-69 (codified as amended at I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221-6233). There followed an administrative hearing, a subsequent petition in Tax Court, a concession by the Commissioner to judgment on the pleadings, and then a motion by Petitioners pursuant to section 7430 and Tax Court Rule 231 for litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The issues on appeal arise from the Tax Court\u2019s treatment of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">Petitioners sought reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees in the total amount of $8,400.00, representing 67.2 hours of attorney time at $125.00 per hour, plus costs of $156.77. Five point nine attorney hours were spent before the Tax Court petition was filed. Eleven point three attorney hours were spent after the petition was filed, but before the attorney\u2019s fees motion was prepared. Attorney hours in the amount of 50.0 were devoted to recovering taxpayers\u2019 reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>The Tax Court granted, in part, Petitioners\u2019 motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Reimbursement for \u201creasonable administrative costs\u201d under section 7430(a)(1) for all the 5.9 attorney hours incurred pre-petition after receipt of the notice of deficiency plus $20.00 costs was allowed upon the finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position as to the notice of deficiency was not substantially justified because the partnership adjustments violated the partnership audit rules. The award included the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred to \u201cpersuade [the Commissioner] that the notice of deficiency was improper and to rescind that notice of deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">The court did not award Petitioners reasonable \u201clitigation costs\u201d under section 7430(a)(2), and held that the Commissioner\u2019s position in the \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d was substantially justified because the answer fully conceded the case. Nevertheless, the court found it was reasonable for Petitioners\u2019 counsel to have spent time preparing, filing, discussing, and prosecuting the attorney\u2019s fees and costs motion, and awarded reimbursement for 10 of the 50 hours claimed. The balance was disallowed because the Tax Court \u201cbelieve[d] that it was unreasonable to expend 50 hours of attorney time to recover costs pertaining to the entire 17.2 hours incurred prior to the Motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">The $75.00 hourly rate, specified by section 7430 unless \u201cthe court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor ... justifies a higher rate,\u201d was enhanced only for cost-of-living increases. \u00a7 7430(c)(l)(B)(iii). The Tax Court rejected Petitioners\u2019 claim that they were entitled to a special factor enhancement to $125.00 per hour, held that the prevailing market rate in a given geographic area is not a special enhancement factor under section 7430, and disagreed that \u201cthe dearth of qualified tax attorneys in Ventura County,\u201d justified fee enhancement. \u201cIt observed that [i]t is not enough to simply say \u2018that lawyers skilled and experienced enough to try the case are in short supply.\u2019 \u201d The court rejected Petitioners\u2019 argument that their attorney Staker\u2019s \u201cspecialized training\u201d in tax law was a special factor, and held that his expertise was not \u201cneedful for the litigation in question.\u201d In applying a cost-of-living adjustment (\u201cCOLA\u201d), the court chose October 1, 1981, as the baseline date because that was the date of enactment of a similar attorney\u2019s fee provision contained in the Equal Access to Justice Act, Pub.L. No. 96-481, \u00a7 204(a), 94 Stat. 2321, 2327-29 (1980) (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)) (\u201cEAJA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">Petitioners were awarded $1,628.49 attorney\u2019s fees for 15.9 hours of attorney\u2019s services at the rate of $102.42 per hour,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and $20.00 as \u201cadministrative costs.\u201d The remaining 51.3 hours of attorney time claimed and $136.77 of costs were held to be \u201cnonrecoverable litigation costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">Petitioners\u2019 appeal was timely. The Commissioner cross-appeals the Tax Court\u2019s calculation of the COLA under section 7430. Petitioners also seek recovery of fees and costs incurred in this appeal pursuant to section 7430. <em>See Prandini v. National Tea Co., </em>585 F.2d 47, 53 (3d Cir. 1978), <em>cited with approval in In re Nucorp Energy, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 655, 660-661 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">The central question presented under \u00a7 7430 is: At what point or points in the proceeding does the determination of whether there was substantial justification of government conduct commence? Once a determination of the point of commencement has been made and it is found that no substantial justification exists, do the effects of that determination persist throughout the entire proceedings? Petitioners contend that the determination of no substantial justification should be made at the earliest possible point in the proceeding consistent with law, and that the determination is thereafter binding. The Commissioner contends that an initial determination in administrative proceedings is not binding on later judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>JURISDICTION AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-3\">Jurisdiction is conferred by I.R.C. \u00a7 7482. The Tax Court\u2019s construction of section 7430, as to the bifurcation and cost-of-living adjustment issues, involves questions of law which we review <em>de novo. Sliwa v. Commissioner, </em>839 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir.1988). The Tax Court\u2019s determination of whether the Commissioner\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>Bertolini v. Commissioner, </em>930 F.2d 759, 761 (9th Cir.1991), as is its determination of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 571, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2553, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (setting review standard for award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\">The reasoning employed by the courts under the attorney's fees provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act applies equally to review under section 7430. <em>Estate of Merchant v. Commissioner, </em>947 F.2d 1390, 1393 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201c[M]ost of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning [under the EAJA] applies equally to review under <em>[section 7430]\u201d);Oliver v. United States, </em>921 F.2d 916, 922 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThere is little dispositive difference between section 7430 and the EAJA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-18\">\n<em>Construction Of Section 7Jf30: Bifurcation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-19\">Section 7430 was amended in 1988 to delineate separately the administrative and court phases of the proceedings by replacing the term \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d with \u201cadministrative or court proceeding.\u201d The terms \u201creasonable administrative costs\u201d incurred in an administrative hearing and \u201creasonable litigation costs incurred in connection with\u201d a court proceeding were also added. Corresponding changes were made throughout the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-20\">In the amended subsection (c)(7), which defines the key phrase \u201cposition of the United States,\u201d \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d was changed to \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d in paragraph (A), while language concerning \u201cadministrative proceeding[s]\u201d in paragraph (B) was rewritten.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>Divergent judicial opinions exist as to whether the phrase \u201cposition of the United States\u201d referred to the government\u2019s position both in prelitigation administrative proceedings and after the commencement of litigation. 14 Jacob Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 50.566 (1992). <em>Sliwa, </em>889 F.2d at 606, held that under the 1982 version of section 7430, \u201cposition of the United States\u201d referred to the government\u2019s position in both prelitigation administrative proceedings and after commencement of litigation, not only the government\u2019s in-court litigation position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, this Court has recognized that \u201c[the] rule of <em>Sliwa </em>does not apply to section 7430 in its present form, after the 1986 and 1988 amendments.\u201d <em>Estate of Merchant, </em>947 F.2d at 1392, n. 6; <em>see also Bertolini, </em>930 F.2d at 761 (implying that <em>Sliwa </em>was not applicable to cases decided after the 1986 amendment to section 7430). The interpretation of amended section 7430 presents a question of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The Tax Court bifurcated the inquiry whether the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d was substantially justified: 1) in the administrative proceeding, where the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d as to the deficiency notice was held not to be substantially justified; and 2) the judicial proceeding, where the \u201cposition of the United States,\u201d as determined by its answer which conceded the case, was held to be substantially justified. The Tax Court found that because the plain language of amended 7430(c)(7), unlike that of pre-1988 \u00a7 7430, refers to the <em>administrative proceeding </em>separately from the <em>judicial proceeding, </em>Congress intended that the United States could take two positions, which can be evaluated separately to determine if each was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The Tax Court acknowledged but did not follow <em>Sliwa </em>because that decision was-\u201cnot applicable to cases decided under TAMRA.\u201d It reasoned that \u201c \u2018in a civil proceeding\u2019 [the language of the pre-1988 statute] is much broader than \u2018in a judicial proceeding\u2019 [the current statutory language],\u201d an interpretation underscored by a separate provision \u201cin the [amended] statute for administrative proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Petitioners assert that the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is determined solely by the notice of deficiency and cannot be redetermined at the litigation stage of the case. They advance several arguments, but we reject them and uphold the bifurcated approach adopted by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">\n<em>The Plain Language Of Section 7)30</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">Petitioners first argue that the 1988 amendment to section 7430, which added paragraphs (i) and (ii) to subsection (c)(7)(B) demonstrates that the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is established as of the date of the notice of deficiency and does not change for purposes of evaluating whether the United States\u2019 position in the judicial proceedings is \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d In other words, paragraphs (i) and (ii) not only modify subsection (c)(7)(B), but also modify subsection (c)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">Second, even if paragraphs (i) and (ii) do not modify subsection (c)(7)(A), petitioners argue that the term \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d is an umbrella term which includes \u201cadministrative proceeding\u201d and \u201ccourt proceeding;\u201d therefore, the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is still determined by the earlier of (i) or (ii), unless there is no IRS appeals decision or notice of deficiency, in which case the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is determined by the answer in the litigation. Neither of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Alr\">\n<em>Effect Of Paragraphs (i) and (ii)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">The first contention is defeated by a facial reading of \u00a7 7430(c)(7), with due re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>spect for grammar and punctuation, and leads to the conclusion that paragraphs (c)(7)(B)(i) and (ii) are alternative objects of the preposition \u201cof,\u201d the final word of the introductory clause in (c)(7)(B), and modify only subsection (c)(7)(B) and not subsection (c)(7)(A). As a general rule, a modifying clause applies only to its immediate antecedent. 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.33 (5th ed. 1992); <em>see e.g., Pacijicorp. v. Bonneville Power Admin., </em>856 F.2d 94, 97 (9th Cir. 1988). This conclusion is reinforced by the limitation set forth in subsection (c)(2)(B), which defines \u201creasonable administrative costs\u201d and fixes those costs by reference to language identical to that in subsection (c)(7)(B)(i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">\n<em>Judicial Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Petitioners\u2019 second contention is resolved by our reading of the term \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d as synonymous with \u201ccourt proceeding,\u201d and not as an umbrella term that includes the term \u201cadministrative proceeding.\u201d Words with a fixed legal or judicially settled meaning, where the context so requires, must be presumed to have been used in that sense. 1 Mertens at \u00a7 3.36 (1991) <em>citing Real Estate-Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 13, 15, 60 S.Ct. 371, 372, 84 L.Ed. 542 (1940). Words of both technical and common usage are construed in the latter sense unless the statute plainly indicates otherwise. 1 Mertens at \u00a7 3.36, <em>citing, Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., </em>275 U.S. 215, 218, 48 S.Ct. 71, 72, 72 L.Ed. 247 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Dictionary definitions tend to support the construction of \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d as synonymous with \u201ccourt proceeding.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>46 (6th ed.1990) (defining \u201cadministrative procedure\u201d as \u201c[mjethods and processes before administrative agencies <em>as distinguished from judicial procedure </em>which applies to courts____\u201d (emphasis added)). By contrast, courts have held that actions taken or proceedings by the IRS prior to initiation of litigation in the Tax Court or the district court are \u201cnon-judicial in nature.\u201d <em>See, United States v. Baggot, </em>463 U.S. 476, 479, 103 S.Ct. 3164, 3166, 77 L.Ed.2d 785 (1983) (although a Tax Court petition for redeter-mination of tax or a suit for refund is a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d an IRS audit, including the IRS\u2019 informal internal appeal component, is not itself a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>455 F.2d 728, 733 (9th Cir.1971) (IRS investigation is not a judicial proceeding.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">Petitioner\u2019s cases cited as contrary authority, <em>e.g., Alleghany Corp. v. Pomeroy, </em>898 F.2d 1314 (8th Cir.1990) concern the different issue of fixing the limits of the abstention doctrine. In that context a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d can include any preceding and related \u201cadministrative proceeding.\u201d Broad principles of comity and federalism are not here implicated; rather, our focus is on the interpretation of the specific language of a technical statute. Both common usage and relevant case law require that \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d be interpreted as synonymous with \u201ccourt proceeding\u201d as defined in section 7430(c)(6). The terms \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cjudicial\u201d are hereafter used interchangeably.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">\n<em>Interpretation Of The Statute As A Whole</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">In analyzing the plain meaning of section 7430, the guiding principle is that a statute must be examined as a whole, with all of its sections and subsections in mind. <em>See, Hellmich v. Hellman, </em>276 U.S. 233, 237, 48 S.Ct. 244, 245, 72 L.Ed. 544 (1928). The section 7430(c)(4)(A) definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d cannot be fully understood without reading section 7430(a). Subsection (c)(4)(A)(i) refers only to <em>\u201cthe </em>proceedings\u201d (emphasis added) to which subsection (a) applies. In requiring that the prevailing party establish that the United States\u2019 position was not substantially justified. Subsection (a) refers alternatively to \u201cany administrative <em>or </em>court proceeding,\u201d and to both administrative costs <em>and </em>litigation costs. Prior to the 1988 amendment, \u00a7 7430 referred only to \u201cany civil proceeding\u201d (7430(a) 1987); the amended version distinguished and separately defined \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d and \u201ccourt proceedings.\u201d 7430(c)(5), (6). Looking at \u00a7 7430 as a whole, <em>\u201cthe </em>proceeding\u201d must refer to either the court or the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>tive proceeding or both. It follows that the prevailing party in both administrative proceedings and judicial proceedings who seeks administrative and litigation costs must <em>separately </em>establish that the United States\u2019 position in each of the proceedings was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">This interpretation is consistent with subsection (c)(7), which defines the position of the United States as the position taken in the administrative proceeding <em>and </em>the position taken in the <em>judicial </em>proceeding. Thus the position taken in the administrative proceeding does not automatically apply to the judicial proceeding. According to the plain language of \u00a7 7430 and under the normal rules of statutory construction, a bifurcated analysis of \u201csubstantially justified\u201d should be made in each proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"ajn-dedup-0\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Although the starting point for analyzing a statute is with its language, the court may look beyond the language of the statute to the legislative history where the language is ambiguous, or where the literal application of the statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters. <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Petitioners urge that the legislative history of \u00a7 7430 reveals Congress\u2019 intent that the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is defined solely by the earlier of the notice of deficiency or the taxpayer\u2019s receipt of the IRS Office of Appeals\u2019 notice of decision. In support of this argument, Petitioners cite the House of Representatives Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 4333:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aj9-dedup-0\"><em>Position of the United States. </em>\u2014 The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, with the modification that the position of the United States is determined as of the earlier of (1) the date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the IRS Office of Appeals, or (2) the date of the notice of deficiency. <em>If neither is applicable, the position of the United States is that taken in the litigation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">2 <em>Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 4333, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1104, (Vol.2) 100th Cong.2d Sess. 226 (1988), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1988, 4515, 5286 (emphasis added), <em>reprinted </em>in 1988-3 C.B. 473, 716. Based on the last sentence quoted above, Petitioners argue that bifurcation is impermissible. They claim that only when there is no IRS appeals decision or notice of deficiency is the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d defined by the position taken in the litigation. When, however, either an IRS appeals decision or a notice of deficiency exists, the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d is defined by the earlier of these, and the position taken in the litigation is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">The Conference Report, however, is more reasonably read to mean \u201cthat the position of the United States [in an administrative proceeding] is determined <em>as of, </em>\u201d the position taken in the earlier of (1) or (2). This interpretation is more in keeping with the plain language of \u00a7 7430. Nothing in the Report forecloses the possibility of a change in the position of the United States from the administrative to the court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">To permit a bifurcated analysis of the reasonableness of the Government\u2019s position does not undermine Congress\u2019 expressed intent in section 7430 to \u201cdeter abusive actions and overreaching by the Internal Revenue Service and ... enable individual taxpayers to vindicate their rights regardless of their economic circumstances.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 404, 97th Cong. 1st Sess. 11 (1981). To the contrary, a bifurcated analysis not only ensures that the prevailing taxpayer is reimbursed for pre-litigation and litigation costs, but also supports Congress\u2019s intent that before an award of attorney\u2019s fees is made, the taxpayer must meet the burden of proving that the Government\u2019s position was not substantially justified. It affords another opportunity for the United States to reconsider an inappropriate position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">\n<em>Case Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">Although the Tax Court correctly found that <em>Sliwa </em>was not applicable to cases decided under TAMRA, that case is instructive. <em>Sliwa </em>rejects a narrow construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>of the term \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d which would limit the court\u2019s examination of government conduct to that following the initiation of litigation by the taxpayer, reasoning \u201cthat such a restrictive construction of section 7430 is unwarranted, and, indeed, undermines the legislative intent of the statute to enable taxpayers to \u2018vindicate their rights regardless of their economic circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sliwa, </em>839 F.2d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Petitioners erroneously argue that a construction of section 7430 which permits a bifurcated analysis of \u201csubstantially justified\u201d cannot be harmonized with the judicial concern expressed in <em>Sliwa. </em>That concern was that the prevailing taxpayer would be foreclosed altogether from reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees, when the government\u2019s prelitigation position was unreasonable but its litigation position was reasonable. This concern was expressly addressed by the 1988 amendments, which we construe to permit a bifurcated analysis that examines the reasonableness of the government\u2019s position at both the administrative level <em>and </em>the court level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\"><em>Estate of Merchant </em>is said by Petitioners to disapprove a bifurcated analysis of \u201cposition of the United States.\u201d That case held that, under the 1982 version of section 7430, in making the determination that the position of the United States in the proceeding was unreasonable, \u201cthe reasonableness of the government\u2019s prelitigation administrative actions, as well as that of its later litigating position, must be taken into account.\u201d <em>Estate of Merchant, </em>947 F.2d at 1392, <em>citing Sliwa, </em>839 F.2d at 605-07. In a footnote, the court added: \u201c[Section 7430(c)(7)(B) (1988) ] now provides that the \u2018position of the United States\u2019 in tax proceedings is to be determined <em>from </em>the date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, or the date of the notice of deficiency, whichever is earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1392, n. 6 (emphasis added). Petitioners suggest that the juxtaposition of these two statements creates an inference that under the 1988 amendments to \u00a7 7430, the \u201clater litigating position\u201d of the United States is no longer relevant when the government\u2019s position at the earlier of the taxpayer\u2019s receipt of the notice of the IRS Office of Appeals decision or the notice of deficiency is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">We disagree. The interpretation which comports with the plain language of section 7430 is that the phrase <em>\u201cfrom </em>the earlier of the taxpayer\u2019s receipt of the notice of the IRS Office of Appeals decision or the notice of deficiency\u201d marks the starting point, not the ending point, of the analysis of the United States\u2019 position. Under this interpretation, the position of the United States <em>starts </em>with the earlier of the two, but has room to change toward reasonableness<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> between the administrative and court proceedings. The bifurcated analysis used by the Tax Court is consistent with this circuit\u2019s case law interpreting \u00a7 7430 prior to the 1988 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">\n<em>Did The Tax Court Abuse Its Discretion In Determining That Respondent\u2019s Position In The Judicial Proceeding Was Substantially Justified?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">In order to recover an award of attorney\u2019s fees from the Government, a tax litigant must qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under section 7430(c)(4)(A). \u201cFirst, the litigant must \u2018establis[h] that the position of the United States ... was not substantially justified.\u2019 Second, the taxpayer must also \u2018substantially prevail[ ]\u2019 with respect to <em>either </em>\u2018the amount in controversy\u2019 or \u2018the most significant issue or set of issues presented.\u2019 \u00a7 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii).\u201d <em>Heasley v. Commissioner, </em>967 F.2d 116, 120 (5th Cir. 1992) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">The statutory phrase \u201csubstantially justified\u201d means \u201c \u2018justified in substance or in the main\u2019 \u2014 that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. at 565, 108 S.Ct. at 2550. \u201cThat is no different from the \u2018reasonable basis both in law and fact\u2019 formulation ... To be \u2018substantially justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>fied\u2019 means, of course, more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 108 S.Ct. at 2550.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">\n<em>Commissioner\u2019s Concession Of Liability.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Generally, the position of the United States in the judicial proceeding<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is established initially by the Government\u2019s answer to the petition. <em>See, e.g., Sher v. Commissioner, </em>861 F.2d 131, 134-35 (5th Cir.1988). Here, the Tax Court concluded that the position taken in the judicial proceeding was substantially justified because the Commissioner, in his answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqBF\">admitted that petitioners had no tax liability, but denied that the issuance of the notice of deficiency was improper____ Thus, it is clear that [the Commissioner\u2019s] position in the judicial proceeding (without regard to actions pertaining to the Motion) was not only not substantially justified, but was in clear recognition of the applicable provisions of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Case law holds that if the Government concedes the petitioner\u2019s case in its answer, its conduct is reasonable. <em>See, Bertolino, </em>at 761 (Government\u2019s settlement of the case \u201cwith reasonable dispatch\u201d after the complaint was filed was reasonable); however, Petitioners correctly note that, while the Commissioner\u2019s answer in part admitted that Petitioners owed no tax liability, his denial that the issuance of the original deficiency notice was improper was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Normally, most of the elements, evidence and other insights gleaned from pretrial activities bearing on whether the Government\u2019s position was substantially justified may be known only to the Tax Court, and can only be revealed to the appellate court through \u201cthe unaccustomed task of reviewing the entire record, not just to determine whether there existed the usual minimum support for the merits determination made by the factfinder below, but to determine whether urging of the opposite merits determination was substantially justified.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 560, 108 S.Ct. at 2547. Because of the fact-bound nature of the inquiry, a deferential abuse of discretion review of the Tax Court\u2019s finding of substantial justification is appropriate. <em>See, id.; Estate of Merchant, </em>947 F.2d at 1393.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">The Commissioner\u2019s opposition to Petitioners\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees was based upon Revenue Officer Penny\u2019s declaration under penalty of perjury that Penny personally mailed a \u201cno change\u201d letter to Petitioners. At a later hearing on the fees issue, the Commissioner admitted that the Penny declaration was false as the alleged \u201cno change\u201d letter had in fact never issued. The Tax Court looked to the concession of the substantive tax issues and did not examine the reasonableness of the Commissioner\u2019s simultaneous assertion in the answer that the deficiency notice was substantially justified, which extended the dispute. The parties agree that the Commissioner's administrative proceeding position was substantially unjustified. Petitioners' attorney was compelled to incur costs to prove the Commissioner was unjustified in his administrative proceeding position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees And Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">The Congressional intent behind section 7430 is not served by looking only to the answer to determine whether the government\u2019s position in the judicial proceeding was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The better approach is to examine the parties\u2019 conduct within each stage of the case. Here, most of Petitioners\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees arose from the dispute over entitlement to and the amount of recoverable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. This kind of satellite litigation is generally referred to as \u201cfees for fees litigation.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. United States, </em>765 F.Supp. 642 (D.Or.1991). The Tax Court awarded Petitioners some attorney\u2019s fees associated with \u201cpreparing, filing, discussing, and defending the Motion [for attorney\u2019s fees and costs].\u201d Here, the Tax Court appears to have divided the time spent \u201cpreparing, filing, discussing, and defending the Motion\u201d between the administrative proceeding and the judicial proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>ing and allowed 10 of Petitioners\u2019 50 hours spent on the attorney\u2019s fees motion. No explanation is provided for the calculation of this allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Certainly the Commissioner may be justified in disputing a claim for excessive fees in some situations. Here, however, the Commissioner refused in both proceedings to acknowledge that Petitioners were entitled to fees or costs whatsoever. This was unjustified. As a result, Petitioners\u2019 attorney incurred costs to prove that the Commissioner was unjustified in refusing to acknowledge that any fees should be awarded. So long as the government\u2019s position justifies recovery of fees, any reasonable fees to recover such fees are recoverable. <em>See, e.g., Powell v. Commissioner, </em>891 F.2d 1167, 1172 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201c[WJhere the government\u2019s underlying position is not substantially justified, plaintiff is entitled under the EAJA [and \u00a7 7430] to recover all attorney\u2019s fees and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the vindication of his rights, including those related to any litigation over fees, and any appeal.\u201d); <em>Russell v. Heckler, </em>814 F.2d 148, 155 (3d Cir.1987) (Where the sole basis for the government\u2019s opposition to the fee petition \u201cis the alleged substantial justification of the government\u2019s position in the underlying proceedings ... the petitioner will almost always, if not always, be entitled to fees for litigation over an EAJA fee petition if she is entitled to fees for the underlying litigation;\u201d <em>(vacated on other grounds sub nom. Bowen v. Russell, </em>487 U.S. 1229, 108 S.Ct. 2891, 101 L.Ed.2d 925 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">It cannot be determined whether the Tax Court correctly applied these principles in awarding fees for only one-fifth of the alleged time spent to recover fees. We therefore reverse and remand for the determination of the proper recovery of fees incurred to recover fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">\n<em>Did The Tax Court Abuse Its Discretion In Refusing To Award Petitioners Attorney\u2019s Fees In Excess Of The Statutory Rate Of $75.00 Per Hour?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">The measure of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees awarded as administrative or judicial proceeding costs under \u00a7 7430(a) is \u201cbased upon prevailing market rates for the kind or quality of services furnished\u201d but \u201cshall not be in excess of $75.00 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for such proceeding, justifies a higher rate.\u201d \u00a7 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">Petitioners argue that they are entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees in excess of the statutory limit because: (1) the prevailing rate in Ventura County is $125.00 per hour; (2) Petitioners\u2019 attorneys are specialists in tax; and, (3) such specialists are of limited availability in Ventura County. In this appeal, Petitioners go further. They suggest this Court adopt a rule that \u201crecognizes tax specialists\u201d by enhancing attorney\u2019s fees in every \u00a7 7430 case in which a taxpayer is represented by a tax lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">In <em>Pierce, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted a substantially identical provision of the EAJA and held that \u201cthe prevailing market rate\u201d is not a \u201cspecial factor\u201d which would justify an upward departure from the $75.00 hourly rate set by Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-14\">[T]he \u201cspecial factor\u201d formulation suggests Congress thought that $75 an hour was generally quite enough public reimbursement for lawyers\u2019 fees, whatever the local or national market might be____ [T]he exception for \u201climited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved\u201d must refer to attorneys \u201cqualified for the proceedings\u201d in some specialized sense, rather than just in their general legal competence. We think it refers to attorneys having some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill <em>needful for the litigation </em>in question\u2014 as opposed to an extraordinary level of the general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-17\">487 U.S. at 572, 108 S.Ct. at 2553 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-18\">Here, the Tax Court interpreted <em>Pierce </em>to mean that, to qualify for a higher than statutory rate, the attorney must possess not just general training in tax, but rather special training in an area \u201cneedful for the litigation in question.\u201d The Tax Court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>eluded that while attorney Staker Possessed Specialized skill and knowledge in the area of TEFRA partnerships, the Commissioner conceded the underlying TEFRA issue; thus the only issues litigated by Staker in the Tax Court were the fees issues, which did not require his specialized skills. Accordingly, Staker\u2019s specialized skills in TEFRA were not \u201cneedful for the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The Tax Court\u2019s holding that general tax expertise does not qualify as a \u201cspecial factor\u201d warranting an enhancement of the statutory fee award is in keeping with the language of \u00a7 7430, logic, and the case law. As the Second Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apr-dedup-0\">Section 7430 applies only to tax cases; therefore most of the applications for attorney\u2019s fees under it would be to pay attorneys who have brought or defended tax cases. Such lawyers presumably all have a certain degree of \u201ctax expertise.\u201d To suppose that Congress intended them all to be paid at a higher than $75 an hour rate would allow this \u201cspecial factor\u201d exception to swallow the $75 an hour rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\"><em>Cassuto v. Commissioner, </em>936 F.2d 736, 743 (2d Cir.1991). <em>Accord Bode v. United States, </em>919 F.2d 1044, 1050 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cClearly, counsel\u2019s expertise in tax law, in and of itself, is not a special factor warranting a fee award in excess of $75 per hour under section 7430.\u201d). In light of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to discuss Petitioners\u2019 contention that tax specialists are allegedly not available in Ventura County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">\n<em>What Is The Effective Date From Which To Measure The Cost-Of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Provided in \u00a7 7)30?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Based on a COLA pursuant to \u00a7 7430(c)(l)(B)(iii), the Tax Court awarded Petitioners a higher rate than the $75 per hour statutory attorney's fee. The Tax Court based the adjustment on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) since October 1, 1981, the date of the enactment of the EAJA\u2019s $75 hourly cap. The Commissioner cross-appeals the Tax Court\u2019s application of the 1981 CPI and argues that the proper starting point for calculating the COLA is from the January 1, 1986, the effective date of the \u00a7 7430 COLA provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">Petitioners counter by asserting the cross-appeal is improper due to the Commissioner\u2019s alleged failure to raise the issue before the Tax Court. The Commissioner responds that his objection to Petitioners\u2019 costs as unreasonable preserved the issue. Moreover, Petitioners failed \u201cexpressly\u201d to argue that October 1, 1981, was the starting point for calculating the COLA until their reply to the Commissioner\u2019s objection. The Commissioner asserts that he was effectively prevented from addressing the issue by this failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">The Commissioner did not dispute Petitioners\u2019 evidence of cost-of-living figures for the greater Los Angeles area, did not object when the Tax Court held that it was going to use the CPI from the greater Los Angeles area, and did not submit any evidence of its own on the issue. Nevertheless, the Commissioner argues that a remand for the proper cost-of-living adjustment is unnecessary because those calculations already have been done by the Commissioner in another case, <em>Bayer v. Commissioner, </em>61 T.C.M. (CCH) 2980 (1991), <em>motion for reconsideration denied, </em>98 T.C. 19 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">Generally, a party may not raise new issues on appeal. <em>Taylor v. Sentry Life Ins. Co., </em>729 F.2d 652, 655 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(per curiam). </em>However, the COLA issue is important to the future application of section 7430, and we have discretion to hear it because it is solely a matter of statutory construction. <em>Abex Corp. v. Ski\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 513, 516 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">To calculate the COLA from October 1, 1981, the Tax Court relied on its own precedent in <em>Cassuto v. Commissioner, </em>93 T.C. 256, 272-273 (1989) as well as on cases decided under the EAJA. <em>See, e.g., Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., Inc. v. Car-lucci, </em>867 F.2d 1224, 1227 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Ramon-Sepulveda v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>863 F.2d 1458, 1463-64 (9th Cir.1988). After the Tax Court filed its decision in the instant case, <em>Cassu-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number><em>to </em>was overturned by the Second Circuit. That Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-5\">Congress clearly intended \u00a7 7430 to follow the same fee structure as the EAJA when it amended the statute in 1986 to \u201cconform ... more closely to the Equal Access to Justice Act.\u201d Before that time, \u00a7 7430 set forth no hourly fee reimbursement rate, but allowed simply for a maximum award of $25,000 in undifferentiated litigation costs. The 1986 amendment established the $75 an hour fee rate, and allowed courts to subsequently add COLAs to that rate. There is no evidence, however, that Congress intended to pre-date \u00a7 7430\u2019s new structure to the date of the EAJA. If that had been Congress\u2019 intent, it would have been easy for Congress to make this known, or to have simply calculated a COLA from 1981 to 1986, and made that the new base hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">936 F.2d at 742. (citation omitted). Petitioners argue that the Second Circuit opinion should not be followed by this Court because, in its subsequent opinion in <em>Bayer, </em>the Tax Court declined to follow <em>Cassu-to. </em>In addition, the Fifth Circuit has also applied the \u00a7 7430 COLA. <em>See, Heasley, </em>967 F.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">We find the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning compelling. If Congress intended the EAJA COLA to apply in \u00a7 7430 cases, it could have so provided very easily. The correct starting point for calculating the COLA is January 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\"><em>Amount Of Fees And Costs Awarded </em>The Tax Court awarded Petitioners fees for only 15.9 of 67.2 hours of attorney time and $20.00 in costs for all of the work done on the case. The Tax Court correctly applied a bifurcated analysis, but provided no detailed explanation as to how the award of fees and costs was calculated. Already mentioned was the court\u2019s failure to offer any explanation as to why 10 hours were awarded for the judicial proceeding concerning fees. Likewise, the $20.00 award for costs appears arbitrary, as no deference to a cost in that amount or an explanation of how it was calculated appears in the record. Finally, the cost of the filing fee in the judicial proceeding should be allowed because the petition was necessitated by the Commissioner\u2019s unjustified failure to respond in a timely fashion in the administrative phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">The decision of the Tax Court is reversed and remanded for a redetermination of Petitioners\u2019 entitlement to, and the amount of, costs and attorney\u2019s fees in the judicial proceeding. The decision finding Petitioners entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the administrative proceeding is affirmed, except that the Tax Court must recalculate the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The decision enhancing attorney\u2019s fees and costs by the EAJA 1981 COLA is reversed. On remand, the Tax Court shall apply the section 7430 COLA as of January 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal; Petitioners\u2019 request for fees and costs associated with this appeal under section 7430 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">.
