On appeal, Tokarska argues solely that we should reverse the Board\u2019s decision because it erred in determining that she failed to show that she had suffered past persecution, as a member of the Solidarity movement, sufficient to justify granting her \u201crefugee\u201d status and asylum. She asks this court to declare that she is entitled to a discretionary grant of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">She overlooks, however, the very limited role of this court in reviewing asylum cases. The Attorney General is authorized (in his discretion) to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). The statute defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, the Board has held that an alien who seeks \u201crefugee\u201d status may do so by showing either (1) that she reasonably fears that she will be persecuted if she returns to her home country, or (2) that she has suffered, in the past, persecution so severe that her suffering warrants asylum, on humanitarian grounds, despite the lack of any real likelihood that she would face persecution in the future. <em>See Matter of Chen, </em>Int.Dec. 3104 (BIA 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">Tokarska does not contest, on this appeal, the Board\u2019s determination that she had no reasonable fear of future persecution; she argues only that the Board erred in finding no <em>past </em>persecution sufficiently horrendous to qualify her as a <em>\u201crefugee\u201d </em>on humanitarian grounds, even if that persecution would not be repeated. (The Board took notice of the fact that Solidarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>is now part of the coalition governing Poland, so that Tokarska clearly could fear no future persecution for her Solidarity membership. Cf<em>. Kaczmarczyk v. INS, </em>933 F.2d 588, 593-97 (7th Cir.1991).)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We can reverse the Board\u2019s determination that Tokarska was not entitled to asylum only if the evidence she presented in respect to her past suffering \u201cwas so compelling that no. reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d that she had made the requisite showing or the INS had abused its discretion in deciding that the persecution she suffered was not sufficient. <em>INS v. Elias Zacarias, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). <em>See also NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Most \u201crefugee\u201d asylum cases involve claims of a reasonable fear of future persecution, but the few that address claims of past persecution involve facts that are very different from those presented here. To merit a grant of asylum on the basis of <em>past </em>persec\u00fction, \u201can alien must show past persecution so severe that repatriation would be inhumane.\u201d <em>Baka v. INS, </em>963 F.2d 1376, 1379 (10th Cir.1992). This more demanding standard where past persecution alone is in issue, although not manifest in the terse language of the statute, does have a substantial basis in policy and the past decisions of the courts and the Board. <em>See Skalak v. INS, </em>944 F.2d 364 (7th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">On the record in this case, Tokarska\u2019s experiences in Poland as a member of the Solidarity movement do not make out such a claim. She points to several facts in support of her claim of sufficiently severe past persecution: she was struck and injured by a tear-gas canister during an anti-government demonstration; she was arrested during another demonstration, suffered physical injury at the hands of police during that arrest and subsequent questioning, and spent twenty-four hours in jail; afterwards, her desk at work was searched, and she never again received a promotion or pay raise, although she had in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">These facts are significantly <em>less </em>compelling than those in other cases in which . federal courts have upheld administrative rejections of similar asylum claims based on past persecution. <em>Kapcia v. INS, </em>944 F.2d 702, 704, 708-09 (10th Cir.1991) (denial of asylum lawful where claimant was arrested four times, detained three times, beaten once, had house searched, and was treated badly at work; other claimant suffered two-day interrogation, detention, and beating, had parents\u2019 home searched, received bad work projects and no bonus, was conscripted into army where he was harassed, and was finally fired from job); <em>Skalak, </em>944 F.2d at 365 (denial of asylum lawful where claimant jailed twice for interrogation, for three days each time, and harassed by officials at work); <em>Kubon v. INS, </em>913 F.2d 386, 388 (7th Cir.1990) (denial of asylum lawful where claimant jailed for five days; \u201ca brief confinement for opposition to a totalitarian regime does not necessarily constitute persecution.\u201d); <em>see also Zalega v. INS, </em>916 F.2d 1257 (7th Cir.1990) (denial of asylum lawful where neutral, non-Solidarity member repeatedly arrested and interrogated, fired from job). While \u201c[t]he experience of persecution may so sear a person with distressing associations with his native country that it would be inhumane to force him to return there, even though he is in no danger of further persecution,\u201d <em>Skalak, </em>944 F.2d at 365, this is not such a case. Consequently, the persecution Tokarska describes is not \u201cso compelling\u201d that the agency <em>must </em>find her eligible for \u201crefugee\u201d status and asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The judgment of the Board of Immigration Appeals is summarily <em>affirmed </em>pursuant to Local Rule 27.1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
