This court has jurisdiction pursuant to the bankruptcy appeal provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). BCC originally filed a Chapter 11 petition in October 1984 and converted that reorganization case to a Chapter 7 liquidation in June 1989. After the conversion to Chapter 7, an initial meeting of creditors was held on August 9,1989, thus establishing a bar date of November 9, 1989, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3002(c), for the filing of claims against the debtor\u2019s estate. The claim of David Benjamin at issue on this appeal arose from Benjamin\u2019s assignment of several surface mining leases to BCC during its Chapter 11 proceeding and from Benjamin\u2019s subsequent loans to BCC, pursuant to order of the bankruptcy court, of funds that had been paid to Benjamin by BCC as compensation for the lease assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">BCC was a family-owned surface mining company that had operated in eastern and central Pennsylvania for over 70 years. Apparently due to what BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 reorganization plan Disclosure Statement termed \u201cthe emphasis placed by [BCC] on production rather than reclamation during the period 1974-1980,\u201d in 1983 it was necessary for BCC to enter into a consent decree with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources calling for substantial reclamation expenditures over the next several years. Because of those obligations and a general economic downturn in the coal industry in the early 1980s, BCC filed a Chapter 11 petition on October 1, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Appellant, David Benjamin, was the majority shareholder and president of BCC. BCC typically acquired resources for its mining operations by purchasing mining rights from the fee owners of coal-rich lands. In the early 1980s, David Benjamin personally acquired several such surface mining leases, paying the fee owners advance royalties and also paying finder\u2019s fees and certain costs of preparing the lands for mining. Benjamin expended over $340,000 for these leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">By the fall of 1984, BCC was already mining the leased lands and those operations were among its most profitable. Thus, in November 1984, BCC moved before the bankruptcy court for approval of an assignment of the leases by Benjamin to BCC. However, the proposed transaction was modified considerably before it was accepted by the bankruptcy court. Ultimately, by order dated December 17, 1984, the bankruptcy court accepted an agreement of assignment whereby BCC would reimburse Benjamin for prepaid royalties out of the normal royalty flow from mining operations on. the leased lands; in addition, BCC would pay to Benjamin a royalty override of two percent to reimburse him for finder\u2019s fees and costs of preparation for mining. To make sure BCC had sufficient funds for its operations and for the acquisition of more leases, Benjamin was required to loan back to BCC all amounts that he was paid for the assignments. The bankruptcy court gave Benjamin an administrative claim with super-priority under Section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code for amounts he loaned back to BCC under the lease assignment agreement. The payments to and from Benjamin were to pass through a \u201cLoan Repayment Account\u201d to be maintained at Equibank, although that account was never established and BCC and Benjamin apparently made the required payments directly to one another. Benjamin was to have a security interest in that account, but his security interest would be subordinate to the security interests of Equibank and Citibank, BCC\u2019s largest secured creditors. For his contemplated loans to BCC, Benjamin was to receive interest at one percent above Equibank\u2019s prime rate. The order establishing Benjamin\u2019s obligation to make the loans and allowing his administrative claim provided for full repayment to Benjamin by one of several contingent dates; in the event, repayment would have been due to Benjamin under the terms of the order no later than June 30, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan for BCC on October 4, 1985. BCC completed its mining on the leased lands sometime after the confirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>tion of the. reorganization plan, but before BCC\u2019s voluntary conversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. By the completion of mining, Benjamin received in royalties, and reloaned to BCC, over $340,000. Under BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 plan, Benjamin had been given a. Class XI claim for amounts due him under the assignment agreement and subsequent loan transactions. The plan specified that Class XI claims were to receive payment of one-eighth of their full value on the 15th day after the confirmation of the plan. The plan further assured that all Class XI claims were to be paid in full by the effective date of the plan, <em>i.e., </em>by June 30, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">BCC could not fulfill the terms of its confirmed plan. BCC operated under the plan for several years but by 1989 the company suffered adverse effects from a coal-industry labor strike and from the resulting loss of a key supply contract. On June 30, 1989, BCC moved before the bankruptcy court to convert its Chapter 11 case into a Chapter 7 liquidation. Benjamin\u2019s claim was listed on BCC\u2019s Chapter 7 schedules, and Benjamin therefore would have received notice, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002(a), of the claims bar date of November 9, 1989, established in the Chapter 7 proceeding. On December 18, 1989, Benjamin filed a \u201cProof of Claim\u201d seeking over $340,000 for loans to BCC, plus over $135,000 in interest. The Chapter 7 trustee objected to Benjamin\u2019s claim as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The bankruptcy court found that Benjamin\u2019s claim was an untimely filed general unsecured claim, not entitled to any priority under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507 or 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(c)(1). The bankruptcy court reasoned that, because of the confirmation of BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 plan, Benjamin\u2019s claim lost its priority administrative status and, relative to BCC\u2019s subsequent Chapter 7 proceedings, became a general unsecured, post-confirmation, pre-conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The district court affirmed, holding that the effect of BCC\u2019s reorganization plan was to convert Benjamin\u2019s claim into an unsecured general debt for the balance owed by the reorganized BCC as of the effective date of the confirmed plan. The district court concluded that the preservation of administrative claims in a converted case provided by Section 348(d) of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply if there has been a confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan and a consequent discharge of prior claims under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d). Both the bankruptcy court and the district court also made several additional rulings on subsidiary issues, <em>e.g., </em>whether the bankruptcy court\u2019s allowance of Benjamin\u2019s former administrative claim in the Chapter 11 case was sufficient to constitute an \u201cactually filed\u201d proof of claim under Bankruptcy Rule 1019(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">This court will affirm the district court on the grounds that the confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan discharged the administrative claim previously granted to Benjamin by order of the bankruptcy court. Thereafter, Benjamin had only an unsecured non-priority contractual claim based on the terms of the plan and, inasmuch as those terms were not fulfilled, Benjamin was obligated to file his proof of claim in timely fashion after the conversion to a Chapter 7 case. Because the discharge provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d) completely resolves the issue presented here, we will not address any of the additional rulings of the bankruptcy court or the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Benjamin\u2019s central argument in support of the validity of his claim in the Chapter 7 case is that Section 348(d) of the Bankruptcy Code resurrects his administrative priority claim, despite the intervening confirmation of BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 plan. Section 348(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-12\">A claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section 1112, 1307, or 1208 of this title, <em>other than a claim specified in section 503(b) of this title, </em>shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Thus, Section 348(d) relegates all claims in a converted case to pre-petition status, <em>except </em>Section 503(b) administrative expense claims. Benjamin therefore argues that administrative claims, such as his own claim in BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 case, are granted a special continuing administrative priority by Section 348(d); and that despite the confirmation of BCC\u2019s Chapter 11 plan, he still should have an administrative priority claim in the converted Chapter 7 case. In addition, Benjamin argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s allowance of the lease assignments in the Chapter 11 case constituted an informal proof of claim. Therefore, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 1019(3), Benjamin\u2019s claim was \u201cactually filed\u201d in the Chapter 11 case, and \u201cdeemed filed\u201d in the Chapter 7 case, obviating any need for a new filing prior to the bar date in the Chapter 7 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Benjamin\u2019s argument in the final analysis is incorrect. As the trustee correctly maintains, the discharge of all existing claims, including administrative claims, upon confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan is unambiguous both in the Bankruptcy Code and in BCC\u2019s own reorganization plan, which respectively provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection [exceptions not relevant here], in the plan, or in the order confirming the plan, the confirmation of a plan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(A) discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation____ (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">Upon the Confirmation Date, the Debtors shall be discharged of the claims of all Claimants, Interest holders and all other entities. The only remaining obligations of the Debtors shall be as specified in the Plan. (Amended Plan of Reorganization, August 26, 1985, p. 18.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">As the trustee suggests, the discharge provided by Section 1141(d) presumes that, in the process of formulating and voting on a reorganization plan, all classes of claimants will be able to use whatever leverage they may have, such as priority status, to effect the best treatment they can obtain for their particular claims. However, once the reorganization plan is approved by the bankruptcy court, each claimant gets a \u201cnew\u201d claim, based upon whatever treatment is accorded to it in the plan itself. Thereafter, each claimant\u2019s remedies for any future nonpayment of claims acknowledged in the plan are limited to the usual remedies for the type of claim granted by the plan\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Section 348(d) unquestionably would have preserved an administrative claim for Benjamin if he had possessed an administrative claim at the time of the conversion to Chapter 7. However, Section 348(d) simply does not speak to the treatment of <em>former </em>administrative claims if a confirmed reorganization plan has intervened between the Chapter 11 filing and the subsequent conversion. When the Chapter 11 plan of BCC was confirmed, Benjamin simply no longer had an \u201cadministrative claim\u201d \u2014 he then had only the contractual claim upon the debtor, i.e., the right to one-eighth payment 15 days after confirmation and the right to full payment by June 30, 1986, that was created for him in the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Benjamin cites In <em>re White Farm Equipment Company, </em>943 F.2d 752 (7th Cir. 1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 1292, 117 L.Ed.2d 515 (1992), as if it were authority for the general proposition that the continuing administrative status of claims in a converted case outweighs the effect of a Section 1141(d) discharge. However, <em>White Farm Equipment </em>reaches a much more limited result and is distinguishable from our case. In <em>White Farm, </em>a debtor filed successive Chapter 11 cases, the second for the purpose of liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>after the confirmed plan in the first Chapter 11 case could not be fulfilled. Despite the intervening confirmed plan, the court of appeals found that a priority claim of the Internal Revenue Service for trust fund taxes retained its priority status in the second Chapter 11 case. It is notable that the result in <em>White Farm </em>is heavily dependent upon the nature of the claim as a tax obligation. Moreover, even as so limited, it appears that the holding in <em>White Farm </em>may be contrary to the legislative intent underlying Section 1141(d)(2). While the Senate version of that section originally saved certain taxes from discharge upon confirmation of a plan, that version was rejected in favor of an unconditional discharge of all taxes for reorganized corporate debtors. <em>Compare </em>S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 129-30 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5915-16 (discussing types of taxes nondischargeable under Senate version of Section 1141(d)(2)); <em>with </em>124 Cong.Rec. H11,089 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6436, 6478 (statement of Congressman Edwards): \u201csection 1141(d)(2) of the House amendment is derived from the House bill as preferable to the Senate amendment____ Retaining an exception for discharge with respect to nondischargeable taxes would leave an undesirable uncertainty surrounding [corporate or partnership] reorganizations that is unacceptable.\u201d While the latter statement was interpreted in <em>White Farm, </em>943 F.2d at 757, as referring only to the uncertainties of \u201chidden liabilities,\u201d it may well be that the specific rejection of a nondischargeable tax provision by Congress means that all tax claims* including trust fund' claims, are discharged at a plan\u2019s confirmation by operation of Section 1141(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The court in <em>White Farm </em>also distinguished its own prior decision in <em>In re Jartran, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 859 (7th Cir.1989), where it had affirmed a bankruptcy court order holding that a creditor, who had been an administrative claimant in the debtor\u2019s first Chapter 11 case, would be denied administrative status in a second Chapter 11 case because of the intervening confirmation of the reorganization plan in the first Chapter 11 proceeding. Indeed, the court of appeals specifically noted in <em>White Farm, </em>943 F.2d at 757, that the bankruptcy court order affirmed in <em>Jartran </em>had held \u201cthat administrative claims arising from expenses incurred solely to preserve the first estate were not entitled to administrative priority in a second bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Thus <em>White Farm, </em>even aside from its debatable, interpretation of the effects of Section 1141(d) on tax claims, is distinguishable from our case because it accords special treatment to a tax trust fund claim. Benjamin\u2019s claim is actually more like the administrative priority claim denied priority status in a second Chapter 11 filing in <em>Jartran. See also In re Shepherd Oil, Inc., </em>118 B.R. 741 (Bankr.D.Az.1990) (priority claimant in Chapter 11 proceeding lost priority status upon confirmation of a reorganization plan, and had only a breach of contract claim in a successive Chapter 11 proceeding of the same debtor). Altogether, the plain text of Section 1141(d) strongly supports the trustee\u2019s argument that, post-confirmation, Benjamin no longer had an administrative claim and therefore failed timely to file his \u201cnew\u201d contractual claim in BCC\u2019s Chapter 7 case. <em>White Farm </em>certainly does not contradict that result for a non-tax administrative claim, and <em>Jartran </em>would support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">We will affirm the district court\u2019s February 25, 1992, order affirming the bankruptcy court order of April 30, 1991, that disallowed David Benjamin\u2019s claim as untimely filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-11\">. It appears that Benjamin may have made additional loans to BCC after the effective date of the confirmation. Even if such loans could be considered administrative claims under Section 503(b), arising post-petition, post-confirmation but pre-conversion, they would nevertheless be subject to the filing of proof of claim requirements set by the bankruptcy court. <em>See In re Johnson, </em>901 F.2d 513, 520 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">We do not address the alternative holding of the bankruptcy judge that the court's allowance of Benjamin's priority claim did not constitute an \"informal filing\u2019\u2019 and we do not rely upon that ruling as a basis for our holding here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
