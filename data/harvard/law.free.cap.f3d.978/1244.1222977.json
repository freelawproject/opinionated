The court remanded the case for a new evaluation. 1 Vet.App. 344. We find that we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal and we affirm on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-21\">In December 1980, Charles W. Travel-stead purchased a home with money advanced by a private lender. The loan was secured in part by a VA home loan guaranty in the amount of $27,500. In 1984, Travelstead sold the home to Hollis Copeland. As stated in the standard instructions printed in every guaranty application, such sale did not release Travelstead from liability to the VA if Copeland defaulted. Application for release must have been made to the Secretary and evaluated under standards set.forth at 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3713(a) (Law Co-op. Supp.1992)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Travelstead made no such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-22\">In February of 1987, the VA received notices of foreclosure and default from the private lender. It promptly informed Trav-elstead that he would be liable to the government if the VA paid a claim under its guaranty. In November of 1987, a foreclosure and sale of the house left a deficiency of $20,145.74. Pursuant to its guaranty, the VA paid the private lender this amount and then demanded indemnity from Travelstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-23\">In November of 1988, Travelstead applied to the VA for a waiver of indebtedness under 38 U.S.C.S^ \u00a7 5302(b) (Law Coop. Supp.1992) (formerly 38 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>\u00a7 3102(b))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. This statute permits the VA to \u201cwaive payment of an indebtedness\u201d with respect to a guaranteed loan \u201cwhere the Administrator determines that collection of such indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d The application was denied by the Veterans Affairs Committee on Waivers and Compromises; the denial was affirmed by both the Board and the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the court\u2019s \u00a7 5302 ruling was not appealed, this waiver provision is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">The statutory basis for Travelstead\u2019s entitlement to a waiver then shifted from \u00a7 5302 to 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3713(b) (Law Co-op. Supp.1992)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when the Court of Veterans Appeals raised <em>sua sponte </em>the applicability of this statute, which provides for a retroactive release from liability. To justify its consideration of this issue, the court cited its jurisdictional statute, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4052(b) (1988),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which states that \u201c[r]e-view in the Court shall be on the record of proceedings before the Administrator and the Board.\u201d Because the record showed that a VA examiner had considered Travel-stead (apparently without request) for a retroactive release, the court reviewed his entitlement to such release as part of its plenary review of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">The court found the procedure applied by the VA in evaluating Travelstead\u2019s eligibility for a retroactive release to be contrary to the express language of the statute. The procedure was evidenced by a document styled \u201cCheck Sheet \u2014 Release from Liability Under Section 1817(b) 38 U.S.C.,\u201d in which a VA examiner marked a box indicating that Copeland had \u201cdefaulted during 1st 12 mos; not considered satisfactory risk.\u201d The check sheet contained no other possible reasons for denial of release, implying that the post-transfer default was all that was considered. The court found this evaluation inadequate, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-12\">The law requires the VA to look at the facts as they existed at the time of transfer, not after transfer, in order to determine whether a veteran would have been entitled to a release from liability had he applied for it. We trust that the VA will change this form to eliminate the legally incorrect language and that determinations as to eligibility for a release of liability under a guaranty will thereafter be made in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-13\">Accordingly, the court remanded to the Board for a \u201cproper adjudication of [Trav-elsteadjs entitlement to a release of liability.\u201d The government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-14\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-15\">1. Does the \u201cfinality rule\u201d bar this court from reviewing a decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals which: 1) overturns the Secretary\u2019s established standard for denying a retroactive release; and 2) remands to the Board for application of the proper standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-16\">2. May the VA rely solely upon the post-transfer payment record of a transferee who has defaulted in determining that a veteran is not eligible for a retroactive release under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713(b)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">At oral argument, we <em>sua sponte </em>questioned our jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal and requested supplemental briefing on the subject. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions on this question, we find that we do have jurisdiction despite the fact that the court did not finally adjudicate Travelstead\u2019s entitlement to a retroactive waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">We have previously held that an order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not a final appealable order. <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1539, 1542-43 (Fed.Cir.1986) (finding no jurisdiction over agency appeal of order of the Court of International Trade remanding to the International Trade Administration). If one were to substitute the Court of Veterans Appeals for the Court of International Trade, and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals for the International Trade Administration, then the procedural posture of this case is similar to that of <em>Cabot Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Furthermore, our <em>Cabot Corp. </em>analysis was general and uncategorical, suggesting that appeals of such orders would vitiate the important interests served by the final judgment rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We noted that this rule \u201chelps preserve the respect due trial judges by minimizing appellate-court interference____\u201d <em>Cabot Corp. </em>788 F.2d at 1542, (citing <em>Flanagan v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 259, 263-64, 104 S.Ct. 1051, 1053-54, 79 L.Ed.2d 288 (1984)). This rule also saves \u201cthe expense and delays of repeated appeals in the same suit.\u201d <em>Woodard v. Sage Products, Inc., </em>818 F.2d 841, 845, 2 USPQ2d 1649, 1651 (Fed.Cir.1987) (in banc) (citing <em>McLish v. Roff, </em>141 U.S. 661, 666, 12 S.Ct. 118, 120, 35 L.Ed. 893 (1891)). We add to this our preference for review of a fully-developed record in contrast to determination of legal questions in the abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-12\">Nevertheless, the subsequent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sullivan v. Finkelstein, </em>496 U.S. 617, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990), requires us to decide this appeal at the present stage of proceedings. The remand order in <em>Finkel-stein </em>was rendered under circumstances similar to those present here. Mrs. Finkel-stein\u2019s application for widow\u2019s disability benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 was denied by the Social Security Administration and appealed to an administrative judge. The Social Security Act makes administrative adjudication decisions subject to review in the United States District Courts. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>Veterans Appeals here, the district court found the Secretary\u2019s procedure for determining entitlement contrary to the statute, and remanded for a redetermination under the proper legal standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held this order to be a final \u201cjudgment\u201d under \u00a7 405(g) appealable by the Secretary under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Justice White reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-4\">What happened in this case is that the District Court entered \u201ca judgment ... reversing the decision of the Secretary, with ... remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d The District Court\u2019s remand, order was unquestionably a \u201cjudgment,\u201d as it terminated the civil action challenging the Secretary\u2019s final determination that respondent was not entitled to benefits, set aside that determination and finally decided that the Secretary could not follow his own regulations in considering the disability issue. Furthermore, should the Secretary on remand undertake the inquiry mandated by the District Court and award benefits, there would be grave doubt, as the Court of Appeals recognized, whether he could appeal his own order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">496 U.S. at 625, 110 S.Ct. at 2664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Although the specific holding of <em>Finkelstein </em>is limited to appeals under \u00a7 405(g) of the Social Security Act, we do not find its precedential effect so limited. <em>Cf. Monongahela Valley Hosp., Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>945 F.2d 576, 586 (3d Cir.1991) (following <em>Finkelstein </em>to find appealable a remand to Health and Human Services, ordered on judicial review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l) of a Medicare reimbursement determination). If, under the statute governing the jurisdiction and practice of the Court of Veterans Appeals, its order in this case \u201creversing the decision of the Secretary,\u201d and deciding \u201cthat the Secretary could not follow his own regulations\u201d \u201cterminated the [] action challenging the Secretary\u2019s final determination,\u201d then it is final and appealable under <em>Finkelstein. Monongahela Valley Hosp., </em>945 F.2d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">We review \u201cdecision[s] of the United States Court of Veterans Appeals\u201d that have been \u201centered in a case.\u201d 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 7292(a)(2) (Law Co-op. Supp.1992). The court is itself required, \u201cto the extent necessary to its decision and when presented,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>to interpret statutory provisions, determine the applicability of their terms to an action of the Secretary, and to \u201ccompel action of the Secretary unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 7261(a) (Law Co-op. Supp.1992). Section 7267(b), under the caption \u201cDecisions,\u201d provides that a determination of a judge or panel in any proceeding before the court \u201cconstitutes the judge or panel\u2019s final disposition of the proceeding.\u201d 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 7267(b) (Law Co-op. Supp.1992). Here, the court rendered a \u201cdecision\u201d interpreting a statute (\u00a7 3713) and compelling action of the Secretary, on remand, contrary to the Secretary\u2019s prior ruling. This \u201cdecision\u201d was a final disposition of the proceeding respecting the Secretary\u2019s practice, and it was entered by the Clerk of the Court of Veterans Appeals on September 16, 1992. This order unquestionably terminated the action before the court. The doors of the court were closed to the Secretary, the action ended. Thus, under <em>Finkelstein, </em>the government may appeal such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">Travelstead now contends that permitting appeal of Court of Veterans Appeals decisions that are not \u201cfinal\u201d (in the sense of ending litigation on the merits) would render \u201cmeaningless and superfluous\u201d the certification procedure of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This contention is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>without merit. <em>See Cabot Corp., </em>788 F.2d at 1543 (government failed to request certification of interlocutory order of the Court of International Trade). However, the possibility of certification does not distinguish the veteran\u2019s benefits review process from that examined in <em>Finkelstein. </em>First-tier judicial review of Social Security disability benefits decisions is in the district courts, whose interlocutory decisions can also be certified for appeal under an almost identical statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Although the <em>Finkelstein </em>opinion never mentioned the certification statute, the Court was undoubtedly aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">The principal directive of <em>Finkelstein </em>is that remands are not all of the same nature, Some are final; some are not. A remand was recognized there to be final under the statute involved and in order to ensure that the court of appeals was able to review an important legal question which the remand made effectively unre-viewable. The same situation exists here. Certification merely provides another possibility for review in appropriate circumstances. It does not preclude appeal in the circumstances of <em>Finkelstein </em>or of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">Section 3713 of Title 38, captioned \u201cRelease from liability under guaranty,\u201d provides for contemporary release at the time of transfer (subsection (a)), and for retroactive release should the transferee subsequently default (subsection (b)). The \u201cretroactive release\u201d provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-8\">If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran under this chapter ... without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under subsection (a), and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines, <em>after such investigation as the Secretary deems appropriate, </em>that the property was disposed of by the veteran in such a manner, and subject to such conditions, that the Secretary <em>would have issued the veteran a release </em>from liability under subsection (a) with respect to the loan <em>if the veteran had made application therefor incident to such disposal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3713(b) (Law Co-op. Supp. 1992) (emphasis added). Subsection (a) requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that the transferee \u201cqualif[y] from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the transferee were a veteran eligible ... for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation.\u201d 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3713(a) (Law Co-op. Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">The parties dispute what sort of evidence may be considered by the Secretary in deciding whether to deny a retroactive release. They divide the universe of information probative of the transferee\u2019s creditworthiness into two categories \u2014 \u201cpre-trans-fer\u201d information and \u201cpost-transfer\u201d information, with the relevant transfer being the sale of the involved property from the veteran to his transferee. The former information exists at the time of transfer and is exemplified by the transferee\u2019s contemporary (at the time of transfer) credit history. The latter information is not extant at the time of transfer and is exemplified by the transferee\u2019s post-transfer payment history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>The government contends that the statute gives the Secretary broad discretion to consider whatever information he \u201cdeems appropriate,\u201d including post-transfer evidence. The government contends that the court\u2019s decision completely forecloses the possibility of examining such information, impermissibly restricts the Secretary\u2019s discretion, and raises unnecessary obstacles and pitfalls to his efficient and orderly administration of the statute. Citing the literal language of the statute, Travelstead contends that post-transfer information is by definition unavailable \u201cincident to such disposal,\u201d and cannot be considered by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">The Secretary\u2019s implementing regulations, found at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.4323(g) (1991), are similar to the language of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Paragraph 2.59(c) of VA Manual M26-3 (Manual M26-3), entitled \u201cLoan Management and Servicing Policies, Procedures, and Methods; Loan Guaranty Operations for Regional Offices,\u201d is more specific. It provides that a determination as to whether a transferee meets the credit requirements of the regulations \u201cwill usually be made through a retroactive credit-report,\u201d which is \u201cobtained from an acceptable credit reporting agency.\u201d It cautions that when the transferee defaults \u201cwithin a short period of time following transfer,\u201d o: \u2019y \u201cvery unusual circumstances\u201d will warrant a release, whether or not a credit report is obtained. It lists other factors to be considered when an accurate credit report is not obtainable, including a presumption of creditworthiness when there is no record of default within 12 months of transfer. It concludes that \u201c[djoubtful cases should be resolved in favor of releasing the original veteran-borrower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"As3\">Legal interpretations of a statute by the Court of Veterans Appeals are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7292 (1992); <em>Prenzler v. Derwinski, </em>928 F.2d 392, 393 (Fed.Cir.1991). However, regulations relating to an agency\u2019s practice under a statute which it is charged to implement, issued pursuant to a statutory grant of authority, are of legislative effect and must be given controlling weight by this court unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425-26, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405-06, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). In contrast, agency pronouncements that are merely interpretive are given lesser deference, varying with such factors as the timing and consistency of the agency\u2019s position and the nature of its expertise. <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 141-42, 97 S.Ct. 401, 410-11, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976); <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">Here, the Secretary\u2019s policy with respect to post-transfer information is contained in Manual M26-3, whose regulatory status (legislative or interpretive) is not entirely clear. Although \u00a7 3713 expressly grants the Secretary discretion to conduct whatever investigation he \u201cdeems appropriate,\u201d he must do so within the confines of the statute. In any event, we need not decide precisely what level of deference must be afforded the Secretary\u2019s pronouncements on this point. Even substantive rules cannot be promulgated that are contrary to statute. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; both this court and the Secretary must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82. We conclude that the Secretary does not have discretion to rely only upon the fact of a transferee\u2019s default within twelve months to deny a retroactive release under \u00a7 3713. Determination against a release on such a basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>without examining the facts and making a reasoned judgment as to creditworthiness at the date of transfer, is prohibited by both the plain language of that statute and by its general purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\">B. <em>The Use of Post-Transfer Information in Retroactive Release Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">The retroactive release provision of \u00a7 3713(b) mandates a retrospective application of the criteria of \u00a7 3713(a) to a hypothetical application for release made <em>at the time of transfer. </em>The language of the statute requires that the Secretary determine whether he \u201cwould have issued the veteran a release from liability under subsection (a) with respect to the loan if the veteran had made application therefor incident to such disposal.\u201d By definition, post-transfer evidence would not have been available \u201cincident to such disposal.\u201d However, such evidence may give rise to an inference respecting creditworthiness at the time of transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">Congress considered the release provision remedial, forgiving a veteran\u2019s failure to seek a contemporary release, and justified because \u201cthe position of the Veterans Administration would be substantially the same as it would have been if [the veteran] had previously obtained a release from liability to the Government under [subsection (a)].\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1125, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2708, 2713. This is not a case where \u201cCongress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. The Secretary\u2019s discretion to set the criteria for release thus does not permit an arbitrary conclusion based on post-transfer information alone concerning the transferee\u2019s creditworthiness \u201cat the time he or she acquired the property.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 326.-4323(g) (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">Whenever possible, the Secretary should base his retroactive release decision on information that would have been available had application been made \u201cincident to transfer.\u201d Manual M26-3\u2019s proviso that a transferee\u2019s default \u201cwithin a short period of time following transfer\u201d is dispositive is not valid if there exists and is not considered a contemporary credit report. The entire purpose of the statute is to provide relief to the veteran upon his transferee\u2019s default, when such relief yrould have been granted <em>ab initio </em>under \u00a7 3713(a). This purpose is undermined by permitting such default <em>ipso facto </em>to defeat the veteran\u2019s right to a release. We reject any VA interpretation that frustrates the congressional policy underlying this statute. <em>See SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 118, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 1711-12, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); <em>Horner v. Hollander, </em>895 F.2d 759, 761 (Fed.Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">The government contends that the court\u2019s opinion forbids reliance upon post-transfer information where pre-transfer information is unavailable. It notes that <em>post hoc </em>assessments of the transferee\u2019s creditworthiness are difficult to make, due to the loss or destruction of records and the reluctance of financial institutions to release non-current and therefore difficult to verify information. It suggests that compliance with the court\u2019s decision would effectively foreclose the grant of retroactive releases in a substantial portion of pending and future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-13\">We do not read the court\u2019s holding so broadly. The question whether post-transfer information may be used in such circumstances was neither before nor decided by the court. It merely reviewed the administrative record before it and concluded that the VA adjudication officer did not properly apply the law. The administrative record before the court consisted entirely of the check sheet entry, indicating a denial of retroactive release because the \u201ctransferee who assumed defaulted during 1st 12 mos; not considered satisfactory risk.\u201d We do not know whether or to what extent the VA attempted to reconstruct the transferee\u2019s contemporary credit record or to determine the reasons for the default by the transferee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rote invocation of a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>sumption of uncreditworthiness is unacceptable. There are many reasons for missed mortgage payments. Some may have been forecast at the time of transfer and therefore may (or may not) have been indicative of uncreditworthiness. Some may be caused by post-transfer events. Only the former, if probative of creditworthiness, will sustain the Secretary\u2019s denial of a retroactive release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">What we decide here, however, is that to draw a conclusion of uncreditworthiness solely on the fact of post-transfer default, which may have been no more than a single late payment, is not reasonable and is contrary to the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Secretary must base his denial of a retroactive release on more complete information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">We affirm the Court of Veterans Appeals\u2019 decision to remand to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals for an adjudication of Travelstead\u2019s entitlement to a retroactive release under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">Costs to Travelstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-16\">. 38 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3713(a) (Law Co-op.

Observing that Travelstead\u2019s tendered financial statement showed a net income over fixed expenses of $508.91 per month, the Board concluded that \u201d[i]t is reasonable to expect that you give this debt to your government the same consideration you give your other debts and that repayment of this debt would not be against equity and good conscience and not create a <em>severe </em>hardship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1338-18\">.

The appealed order of the Court of International Trade reversed the International Trade Administration\u2019s finding that Mexico\u2019s provision of carbon black feedstock and natural gas at government-set rates to two carbon black producers did not constitute a countervailable subsidy.

The standard for entitlement, found at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(B) (1982), required that the widow or widower\u2019s impairment be \"of a level of severity which under regulations prescribed by the Secretary is deemed to be sufficient to preclude an individual from engaging in any gainful activity.\u201d The Secretary had, in Mrs. Finkelstein\u2019s case, compared her heart condition with a schedule of so-called \"listed impairments,\" without making any determination whether this condition precluded her from engaging in any gainful activity.

In contrast, Manual M26-3 provides for a presumption of creditworthiness, based upon a record of no default within 12 months of transfer, in cases where contemporary credit information is unavailable. Such evidence clearly gives rise to a reasonable inference of creditworthiness at the time of transfer, is well within the Secretary\u2019s discretion, and both complies with the statute and implements its purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
