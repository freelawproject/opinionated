The trial court imposed an upward departure sentence for the robbery count, based on its conclusion that certain findings by the jury constituted substantial and compelling reasons justifying that departure. The trial court also imposed, over defendant\u2019s objections, consecutive sentences for the assault and the resisting arrest counts based on judicial factfinding. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing the upward departure sentence and in imposing the consecutive sentences. Defendant also raises a <em>pro se </em>claim that his federal due process rights were violated when a pretrial \u201ccall\u201d hearing setting his trial date was conducted in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s challenges to the upward departure sentence and to the pretrial hearing. As to defendant\u2019s challenge to the consecutive sentences, the state acknowledges that the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 260, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted, _US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008) controls, and, as such, the trial court erred in imposing the consecutive sentences. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
