J.</author>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Petitioner seeks review of a Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) decision remanding to the Crook County Court its decision approving a conditional use permit application for a nonfarm dwelling on a 25-acre tract of land that is zoned for exclusive farm use. Petitioner does not challenge the merits of LUBA\u2019s decision; instead, he asserts that LUBA erred in rejecting his argument that the county violated ORS 215.422(l)(c) and section 18.172.050 of the Crook County Code (CCC) by charging an excessive filing fee for the appeal of the conditional use approval.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that the assessment of the appeal fee violated both the ordinance and the statute and that LUBA erroneously shifted the burden of producing evidence concerning the reasonableness of the fee from the county to petitioner. We affirm, because we conclude that petitioner failed to meet his burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that the appeal fee violated either the ordinance or the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In 2007, the county issued Order 2007-56, which set the fee formula for appeals from county planning commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>decisions. In accordance with that order, the county charged petitioner a fee of $2,030 for processing an appeal to the county court of the county planning commission\u2019s decision to approve the nonfarm conditional use at issue in this case. As a ground of appeal, petitioner made an as-applied challenge to the fee assessment. Petitioner asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cThe excessive Crook County appeal fee to challenge this decision of $1850 + 20% of the initial application fee effectively prohibits meaningful citizen participation in the land use planning process in violation of Goal 1 of the Statewide Planning goals. This fee substantially exceeds any reasonable estimate of the cost of processing the appeal in violation of CCC 18.172.050.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In addition, 1000 Friends of Oregon submitted a letter regarding the fee to the county court. 1000 Friends asserted that, \u201c[a]s applied, the [order establishing the fee schedule] results in an unreasonable fee for this appeal in violation of state law (ORS 215.422(l)(c)). The challenged order establishes a very wide range of possible fees for appeals from the planning commission; these fees could impermissibly exceed average or actual costs.\u201d In the letter, 1000 Friends also asserted that several other counties charged much lower fees for appeals from planning commission decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Crook County court appeals are decided on the record, CCC 18.172.110(12)(a), but appellants may seek to admit new evidence on appeal. CCC 18.172.110(12)(a)(vi).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner did not seek to admit new evidence pertaining to the reasonableness of the appeal fee before the county court. Nor did the county itself adduce evidence regarding the fee formula determination process or whether the fee formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>was consistent with the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201caverage\u201d cost for such services within the county. In its decision on petitioner\u2019s appeal, the county court made no findings of fact or conclusions of law with respect to the reasonableness of the appeal fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Petitioner renewed his objection to the county\u2019s appeal fee in his ensuing appeal before LUBA. Petitioner asserted that \u201c[t]he county erred in assessing a $2030 local appeals fee which was not reasonable and which exceeded the average or actual cost of such appeal in violation of ORS 215.422(l)(c).\u201d The county argued before LUBA that petitioner\u2019s challenge was untimely, because he had failed to challenge the county\u2019s appeal fee ordinance when it was adopted. LUBA did not address that defense, \u201cbecause [it] agree[d] with the county that, even if such an as-applied challenge is permissible, petitioner has not demonstrated that the appeal fee charged in this case is unreasonable or exceeded the average cost of such appeals or the actual cost of the appeal.\u201d <em>Young v. Crook County, </em>56 Or LUBA 704, 717 (2008). LUBA explained that petitioner had made no effort to substantiate with evidence his argument that the appeal fee was unreasonable, \u201cand we cannot say that as a matter of law it is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Petitioner renews his as-applied challenge to the appeal fee assessment before this court. The question for decision is whether LUBA\u2019s decision is unlawful in substance. ORS 197.850(9)(a). In a nutshell, the difficulty for petitioner is that, although in previous appeals he complained that the appeal fee was excessive, he never made an evidentiary showing to support that argument. Petitioner had opportunities to make such a showing while the evidentiary record remained open, for example, by filing a motion to submit additional evidence before the county court, CCC 18.172.110(12)(a)(vi), or even, perhaps, by making a motion before LUBA for an evidentiary hearing or the taking of depositions. OAR 661-010-0045 (taking evidence not in the record).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner also could have made a public records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>request to inspect the documents that formed the basis of the order that set the appeal fee. <em>See </em>ORS 192.420. However, petitioner failed to avail himself of those or any other opportunities to buttress his assertions with supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">In its decision, LUBA mentioned the letter that 1000 Friends of Oregon submitted to the county court but did not treat that letter as part of the evidentiary record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As pertinent here, the letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201cWhether the amount of any appeal fee will be impermissible because it is unreasonable and exceeds the appeal\u2019s \u2018average or actual\u2019 cost is not ascertainable from the challenged order\u2019s face, because the amount of the fee will vary depending on the maps that may be required, the number of dwelling requested, and whether the applicant requests expedited review \u2014 none of which can be determined from the face of the challenged order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">However, the letter did not supply any of the purportedly missing information. Accordingly, it did not constitute evidence in any pertinent sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Nor does the record disclose that petitioner made any effort to obtain evidence about the reasonableness of the fee from county officials. Rather, petitioner took the position, as he does on review, that the burden of producing such evidence fell on the county. Indicative of that view, petitioner made the following request before the county court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">\u201cAppellant requests the County Court to revise the challenged order so that no appeal fees are charged that exceed the documented average cost or documented actual cost of the appeal. Appellant also requests a refund of all fees in excess of either the documented average cost of processing appeals such as this or the documented cost of this appeal, whichever is less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In short, petitioner\u2019s argument reduces to an assertion that LUBA erred in allocating to petitioner the burden of producing evidence concerning the reasonableness of the fee. We conclude that LUBA did not so err. Petitioner has the burden before this court to show that LUBA\u2019s order was unlawful in substance. In order to do so, petitioner must demonstrate a source of law that required the county to prove, in response to an as-applied challenge to its appeal fee formula determination order under ORS 215.422(l)(c), that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>assessed fee was reasonable. Petitioner has not made such a showing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\"> ORS 215.422 governs appeals of land use decisions within the county land use regulatory structure. As pertinent here, ORS 215.422(l)(c) addresses the fees that counties may charge for such appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201cThe governing body may prescribe, by ordinance or regulation, fees to defray the costs incurred in acting upon an appeal from a hearings officer, planning commission or other designated person. The amount of the fee shall be reasonable and shall be no more than the average cost of such appeals or the actual cost of the appeal, excluding the cost of preparation of a written transcript. The governing body may establish a fee for the preparation of a written transcript. The fee shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the actual cost of preparing the transcript up to $500. In lieu of a transcript prepared by the governing body and the fee therefor, the governing body shall allow any party to an appeal proceeding held on the record to prepare a transcript of relevant portions of the proceedings conducted at' a lower level at the party\u2019s own expense. If an appellant prevails at a hearing or on appeal, the transcript fee shall be refunded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">CCC 18.172.050 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201c(1) All fees for permits, variances, zone map amendments, comprehensive plan amendments, zone text amendments, appeals, and any other necessary review or permits pursuant to this title shall be set annually as determined by the county court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">\u2021 sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">\u201c(4) Pees charged for processing permits shall be no more than the actual or average cost of providing that service.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-7\"> CCC 18.172.110(12)(a)(vi) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">\u201cThe appellate body may, at its option, admit additional testimony and other evidence from an interested party or party of record to supplement the record of prior proceedings. The record may be supplemented by order of the appellate body or upon written motion by a party. The written motion shall set forth with particularity the basis for such request and the nature of the evidence sought to be introduced. Prior to supplementing the record, the appellate body shall provide an opportunity for all parties to be heard on the matter. The appellate body may grant the motion upon a finding that the supplement is necessary to take into consideration the inconvenience of locating the evidence at the time of initial hearing, with such inconvenience not being the result of negligence or dilatory act by the moving party.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b29-6\"> OAR 661-010-0045 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201c(1) Grounds for Motion to Take Evidence Not in the Record: The Board may, upon written motion, take evidence not in the record in the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>disputed factual allegations in the parties\u2019 briefs concerning unconstitutionality of the decision, standing, ex parte contacts, actions for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of ORS 215.427 or 227.178, or other procedural irregularities not shown in the record and which, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand of the decision.
