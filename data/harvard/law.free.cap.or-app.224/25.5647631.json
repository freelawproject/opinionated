J.</author>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for manslaughter in the first degree, ORS IdS.lISfIXa),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assigns as error the trial court\u2019s award of restitution to the victim\u2019s parents and to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account (Account). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The following facts appear to be undisputed by the parties. Defendant was convicted for fatally stabbing the victim, who was approximately 17 years old at the time of his death. At the sentencing hearing, the state sought restitution in the amount of $12,499 for the victim\u2019s burial expenses. The prosecutor informed the court that the Account had reimbursed the victim\u2019s family for $3,750 of those expenses and that the employer of the victim\u2019s father had paid the remaining expenses of $8,749.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the prosecutor, the victim\u2019s father intended to pay his employer back but that, for purposes of restitution, the court should consider the employer\u2019s payment as a gift to the victim\u2019s family. Defendant argued that, as to the sum paid by the employer, \u201c[W]e have an offset by payment from a third party with no right of subrogation, therefore, the amount of restitution has to be reduced[.]\u201d As to the amount paid by the Account, defendant argued, \u201cI\u2019m asking the court not to assess that as restitution because money has been paid from friends, neighbors, loved ones to the [victim\u2019s] family * *</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s arguments, reasoning that, \u201c[i]f the [victim\u2019s family] sued the defendant, they would have an economic damage claim that relates to the funeral expenses. The fact that they got a gift wouldn\u2019t preclude them from getting economic damages.\u201d The court also reasoned that the \u201cDepartment of Justice [would] have an economic damage claim of $3,750 in a civil lawsuit,\u201d and, accordingly, the court awarded both amounts as restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that the victim\u2019s parents did not \u201cincur\u201d any burial and memorial expenses, as required by the statute governing restitution, because of the employer\u2019s gift and because the Account compensated the victim\u2019s family rather than the victim. The state responds that both amounts of restitution were authorized under ORS 137.106, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201c(1) When a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201c(a) Include in the judgment a requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">For purposes of ORS 137.106, the term \u201ceconomic damages\u201d has the meaning given that term in ORS 31.710, except that the term does not include future impairment of earning capacity. ORS 137.103(2). ORS 31.710(2)(a), in turn, provides that the phrase \u201c [e]conomic damages\u2019 means objectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to reasonable charges necessarily incurred for * * * burial and memorial expensesf.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, under ORS 137.103(4), a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of ORS 137.106 means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201c(a) The person against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense, if the court determines that the person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201c(b) Any person not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection whom the court determines has suffered economic damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201c(c) The Criminal Injuries Compensation Account, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In light of the above statutes, we turn first to the issue of whether restitution was authorized with respect to the gift to the victim\u2019s parents by the employer of the victim\u2019s father. Under ORS 137.103(4)(b), the parents could be a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of ORS 137.106 if they suffered \u201ceconomic damages\u201d as a result of defendant\u2019s crime. Whether they suffered \u201ceconomic damages\u201d depends in this case on whether they \u201cincurred\u201d objectively verifiable money losses for burial and memorial expenses. ORS 31.710(2)(a). Thus, our task is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent when it used the word \u201cincurred\u201d in ORS 31.710(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The word \u201cincurred\u201d is not defined in ORS 137.103 as are other terms used in ORS 137.106. Consequently, we assume that the legislature intended the term to have its ordinary meaning. The commonplace meaning of the word \u201cincur\u201d is to \u201cbecome liable or subject to.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1146 (unabridged ed 2002); <em>White v. Jubitz Corp., </em>219 Or App 62, 66, 182 P3d 215, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 175 (2008) (so holding). In <em>White, </em>we held that \u201creasonable charges necessarily incurred\u201d for purposes of ORS 31.710(2)(a) are those medical expenses that a plaintiff has become subject to, regardless of whether a third party ultimately pays or writes off a portion of those expenses. We see no meaningful distinction with regard to burial expenses under the language of ORS 31.710(2)(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is a reasonable inference from the record that the victim\u2019s family was <em>subjected </em>to the enumerated burial expenses for their child, and would have had to pay them if the employer had not paid them. Thus, they \u201cincurred\u201d them for purposes of ORS 31.710(2)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>We turn next to the issue of whether the Account is entitled to be awarded restitution. The Account is a \u201cvictim\u201d under ORS 137.103(4)(c) \u201cif it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim\u201d described in ORS 137.103(4)(a). A \u201cvictim\u201d under paragraph (a) is a \u201cperson against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense if the court determines that the person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.\u201d Under ORS 31.710(2)(a), \u201ceconomic damages\u201d include \u201cburial and memorial expenses.\u201d In this case, had the victim\u2019s estate brought an action against defendant, defendant would have been liable for the victim\u2019s burial and memorial expenses under ORS 137.106. The Account therefore expended monies on behalf of a \u201cvictim,\u201d the victim\u2019s estate. It follows that the trial court did not err when it concluded that the Account was a \u201cvictim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The statutory citations in this opinion refer to the 2005 version of the Oregon Revised Statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> The summary of expenses in the record as an exhibit states, \u201c([B]alance of funeral expenses; church fees, tent, grave markers, clothes) $8,749.00\u201d and \"(maximum allowed for funeral) $3750.00.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-9\"> The parties assume for purposes of their arguments that ORS 31.710(2) requires that burial and memorial expenses be \u201cincurred.\u201d For purposes of this opinion only, we adopt their understanding of the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> <em>See also PGE v.
