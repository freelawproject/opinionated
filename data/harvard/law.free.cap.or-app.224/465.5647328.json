In both cases, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s assignment of error pertaining to the motion to suppress. In the driving while suspended case, defendant argues that the court erred in entering the conviction because there was no written waiver of his right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that the record does not contain a valid waiver of defendant\u2019s jury trial right and that the error requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for driving while suspended. We agree that the lack of a written jury waiver constitutes reversible error. <em>See generally State v. Taxon, </em>142 Or App 484, 920 P2d 567 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Conviction for misdemeanor driving while suspended reversed and remanded; conviction for contempt of court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> Defendant acknowledges that he was not entitled to a jury trial with respect to the contempt of court charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
