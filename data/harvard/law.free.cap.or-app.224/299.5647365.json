Second, if so, did the circuit court correctly remand the agency\u2019s decision? Third, did the circuit court err in awarding petitioner $50,000 in attorney fees? We conclude that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction; a prerequisite to circuit court jurisdiction is a final agency order in a proceeding other than a contested case, and the agency decision here did not fit within that category of agency action. We therefore do not reach the second question, and we necessarily vacate the supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The relevant facts are procedural and undisputed, taking place within the following statutory and regulatory framework. The Building Codes Division (BCD), a section within the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS), is responsible for the promulgation, amendment, and administration of the state building code. ORS 455.020; ORS 455.100. The code is a collection of \u201cspecialty codes,\u201d including, as relevant to this case, the plumbing code and the low-rise residential dwelling code. ORS 455.010(8). In promulgating and amending the code, the BCD operates under the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), ORS chapter 183, except as those provisions are superseded or supplemented by the more specialized provisions of ORS chapter 455 (\u201cBuilding Code\u201d). ORS 455.030(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Under the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, the building code can be amended in two ways. Ordinarily, an interested person (including a corporation, ORS 183.310(8)) proposes an amendment; the proposal must set out the \u201cjustification and * * * particular circumstances\u201d requiring the change. ORS 455.030(4). The director of DCBS then forwards the proposal to the appropriate advisory board for review. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]ith the approval of the advisory board,\u201d the director may choose to adopt or deny the proposal and then must \u201cnotify\u201d the person who proposed the amendments of that decision. ORS 455.030(5). Specialty codes are formally readopted every three years; the director\u2019s decision to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>or not amend is implemented at the time of readoption, although, with the permission of the appropriate advisory board, amendments may be adopted at any other time as well. OAR 918-008-0000(2); OAR 919-008-0028. The second method for amending a specialty code, called the \u201calternate method ruling process,\u201d is described in ORS 455.060(1) and OAR 918-008-0095. Under ORS 455.060(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201c[a]ny person who desires to use or furnish any material, design or method of construction or installation in the state * * * may request the Director of [DCBS] to issue a ruling with respect to the acceptability of any material, design or method of construction about which there is a question under any provision of the state building code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Petitioner Studor, Inc. (Studor) manufactures and sells a plumbing device called an Air Admittance Valve (AAV), which it describes as an alternative to \u201copen pipe venting\u201d as a method of preventing sewer gasses from entering buildings through plumbing fixtures. Several other companies also make AAVs. At present, under the state building code, open pipe venting is permitted and all alternatives, including AAVs, are not. In 2003, Studor began the process of trying to change that state of affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As a first step, Studor availed itself of the \u201calternative method ruling process,\u201d but the committee charged with administering that process rejected Studor\u2019s application and advised Studor that \u201cthe approval of AAVs requires more than just product approval and * * * plumbing code changes should also be considered.\u201d Studor then began its attempt to achieve its objective through the standard method, that is, by seeking an amendment to the building code, to be implemented at the next readoption. It submitted a proposal to the \u201cPlumbing Code Change Committee\u201d for amendments to the plumbing code and, in the alternative, to the \u201cOregon Residential Specialty Code Adoption Committee\u201d for amendments to the residential structures code. The committees forwarded conflicting recommendations to the BCD; the plumbing committee recommended denial and the residential committee recommended approval. The BCD ultimately followed the plumbing committee\u2019s recommendation and rejected the proposals. It then notified Studor of that decision in an e-mail to Studor\u2019s president and informed the president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that, if he was \u201cdissatisfied with the agency action, then a petition for judicial review may be filed in the Circuit Court for Marion Count[y] under ORS 183.484(1).\u201d That provision confers jurisdiction on the circuit court for review of orders issued in proceedings that are not contested cases, commonly called \u201corders in other than contested cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">As advised, Studor petitioned for judicial review in the circuit court for Marion County. There, however, the state moved for summary judgment on the ground that the rejection of Studor\u2019s proposed amendments was not an order in other than a contested case, but part of the rulemaking process, over which the circuit court had no jurisdiction. The court rejected the state\u2019s argument, ruling that the \u201cBCD\u2019s decision is an order, not a rule.\u201d Thereafter, the court held a trial at which the evidence consisted for the most part of Studor\u2019s application materials and the arguments in the parties\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment. The court concluded that the agency\u2019s refusal to amend the building code as requested by Studor was not supported by substantial evidence and entered a judgment remanding the case to the BCD. The court later awarded Studor $50,000 in attorney fees in a supplemental judgment. The state now appeals the judgment and the supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The threshold \u2014 and dispositive \u2014 issue in this case is whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to review the BCD\u2019s decision. That court has jurisdiction to review agency decisions only if those decisions are orders resulting from agency proceedings that are not contested cases; review of most other agency actions or decisions is in the Court of Appeals. ORS 183.400 (Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review rules); ORS 183.482 (Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review orders in contested cases); ORS 183.484 (circuit court has jurisdiction to review orders in other than contested cases). The document at issue in this case, addressed to the president of Studor, states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u201cRe: Code Change Proposal(s)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cPlease be advised that the Building Codes Division and the appropriate advisory board(s) has reviewed your code change proposal(s) to the 2003 Uniform Plumbing Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>for adoption as the 2005 Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code, relative to the requirements of ORS 455.030[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">* % * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cI am notifying you within 30 days of receipt of the recommendation from the Oregon State Plumbing Board, that the * * * code change proposals have been disapproved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">(Boldface in original.) The parties agree that this decision does not result from a contested case; they disagree about whether it is an order. That term is defined in ORS 183.310(6)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201c \u2018Order\u2019 means any agency action expressed orally or in writing directed to a named person or named persons, other than employees, officers or members of an agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Studor maintains that the document clearly fits within that statutory definition: It is agency action, in writing, directed to a named person who is not part of the agency itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Further, Studor argues, in considering whether a particular agency action is an order, the court should adopt a \u201cfunctional\u201d approach as the Supreme Court did in <em>Oregon Env. Council v. Oregon State Bd. of Ed., </em>307 Or 30, 761 P2d 1322 (1988). In that case, the court held that the Board of Education\u2019s decision to include a particular textbook on the list of books approved for use in Oregon public schools was an order because the decision was \u201cfunctionally similar to individual licensing decisions made by professional licensing agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. According to Studor, the BCD\u2019s decision in this case to deny inclusion of AAVs in the building code is also the functional equivalent of a licensing decision in that it results from the application of preexisting criteria to a determination of eligibility for a benefit. Moreover, Studor argues, <em>all </em>agency action is either an order in a contested case, a rule, or an order in other than a contested case. Here, according to Studor, neither party maintains that the BCD\u2019s decision was (or should have been) an order in a contested case, and it was not a rule as defined in the APA: \u201cany agency directive, standard, regulation or statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy * * * [including] the amendment or repeal of a prior rule.\u201d ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>183.310(9). Therefore, the decision must fall into the \u201ccatchall\u201d category and be an order in other than a contested case, reviewable in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The state\u2019s position, in contrast, is that the agency\u2019s action, a decision <em>not </em>to amend a rule, was taken in connection with a procedure involving the amendment of a rule. That being the case, the legislature could not possibly have intended judicial review in circuit court for substantial evidence, because doing so would be inconsistent with ORS 183.335(13), under which \u201cthe amendment * * * of a rule by an agency need not be based upon or supported by an evidentiary record.\u201d Put another way, the state argues that Studor\u2019s position leads to an anomaly that the legislature could not possibly have intended: that an agency\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to amend a rule receive a more stringent level of judicial review (that is, for substantial evidence) than the amended rule itself (that is, merely for compliance with rulemaking procedures and legislative authorization, ORS 183.400(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Further, according to the state, Studor\u2019s comparison of this case to <em>Oregon Env. Council </em>is not persuasive. The cases, it argues, are significantly distinguishable. <em>Oregon Env. Council </em>involved the mandatory application of \u201cguidelines and criteria of general applicability to a particular textbook.\u201d 307 Or at 36. It was that characteristic of the approval process that made it functionally similar to a permit application process and therefore a process resulting in an order. Here, no such mandatory \u201cguidelines and criteria\u201d exist; the director of DOBS \u201cmay\u201d adopt proposed amendments, ORS 455.030(5), that are \u201cin conformity with the policy and purpose prescribed by ORS 455.020,\u201d ORS 455.030(4), but nothing requires the director to do so, nor are \u201cpolicy and purpose\u201d the same as \u201cguidelines and criteria.\u201d Judicial review for conformity with legislative \u201cpolicy and purpose\u201d is the kind of review that rules receive under ORS 183.400(3), that is, review for conformity to legislative authorization; if Studor\u2019s position were correct, all rules would be orders, because all rules must conform to legislative policy and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Each of the parties\u2019 arguments has strengths and weaknesses. Fortunately, we need not choose one or the other. Even if Studor is correct that the notification it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>received from the BCD is an order \u2014 a conclusion that we most emphatically do not reach or even intend to imply \u2014 the circuit court lacked jurisdiction nonetheless. That is because the circuit court does not have jurisdiction to review all orders; it has jurisdiction to review only <em>final </em>orders. ORS 183.480(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201cNo action or suit shall be maintained as to the validity of any agency order except a final order * * * or except upon showing that the agency is proceeding without probable cause, or that the party will suffer substantial and irreparable harm if interlocutory relief is not granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Studor does not maintain that the agency proceeded without probable cause or that interlocutory relief is necessary to prevent substantial and irreparable harm \u2014 and if it did maintain that position, we would reject it. Thus, if the BCD\u2019s decision not to amend the building code was not a final order, then the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. Id.; <em>Oregon Health Care Assn. v. Health Div., </em>329 Or 480, 494, 992 P2d 434 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">ORS 183.310(6)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201c \u2018Final order\u2019 means final agency action expressed in writing. \u2018Final order\u2019 does not include any tentative or preliminary agency declaration or statement that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201c(A) Precedes final agency action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201c(B) Does not preclude further agency consideration of the subject matter of the statement or declaration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The notice that the BCD sent to Studor here both preceded final agency action and did not preclude further agency consideration of the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201cIn a sense, every order is final as to the specific subject that it covers; for example, even an order postponing a hearing is final as to whether the hearing will occur on the original date. * * * To ascertain whether [an] order was a final order, we must first describe the regulatory context within which [it occurs].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-13\"><em>Grobovsky v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>213 Or App 136, 143, 159 P3d 1245 (2007). Here, Studor sought to have its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>proposal incorporated into the 2005 revision of the state building code. The notice rejecting the proposal \u2014 dated September 20, 2004 \u2014 informed Studor that its proposal \u201cfor adoption as the 2005 Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code\u201d was disapproved. Thus, although the decision was \u201cfinal\u201d with respect to what the agency <em>planned </em>to do in the future, the decision nonetheless preceded the actual adoption of the new rule. In fact, adoption of a new code, without Studor\u2019s proposed amendment, did occur in 2005 and was subject to judicial review under ORS 183.400 (judicial review of rules).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Indeed, we have found no cases in which this court or the Supreme Court has held that an agency decision rendered in the context of a rulemaking or rule amendment proceeding is considered to be a final order. That makes sense. ORS 183.310(6)(b)(B), as set out above, provides that an order is not \u201cfinal\u201d unless it \u201cpreclude[s] further agency consideration of the subject matter of the statement or declaration.\u201d The subject matter of the BCD\u2019s decision was the propriety of amending the state building code so as to include Studor\u2019s AAV. Nothing \u201cprecludes\u201d further consideration of that subject matter. Unlike a person who has suffered an adverse outcome in a contested case, Studor is not \u201cprecluded\u201d from resubmitting its proposed amendment, either in the next cycle of revision or in the interim by way of an ORS 455.060 \u201calternate method ruling process\u201d as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We therefore conclude that, because the BCD notice to Studor was not a \u201cfinal order,\u201d the circuit court did not have jurisdiction. That conclusion obviates the need to address the state\u2019s contention that the court erred in concluding that the BCD\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and necessarily requires us to vacate the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Judgment reversed and remanded; supplemental judgment vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> Whether Studor could prevail in that rule challenge is a question we do not address. Nor do we address the possibility that the agency\u2019s denial of Studor\u2019s request for alternative method approval was an order in other than a contested case and reviewable as such in circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
