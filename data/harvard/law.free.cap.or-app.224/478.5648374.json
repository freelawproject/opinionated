J.</author>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Defendant appeals his conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) following the entry of his conditional guilty plea, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for diversion under ORS 813.215(4). Because defendant had participated in a diversion program with respect to a previous DUII charge within 10 years before the commission of the present offense, we conclude that he was ineligible for diversion in this case. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Defendant was charged with DUII on November 22, 1995. He entered into a diversion agreement on that charge on January 26, 1996. The agreement required defendant to participate in an alcohol treatment program, attend a victim impact panel, perform community service, and pay certain fees. Defendant fulfilled each of those specially imposed obligations on or before September 23,1996. On December 5, the trial court issued a notice that, in the absence of \u201can appropriate order or judgment\u201d or \u201cgood cause,\u201d the DUII charge would be dismissed on January 26,1997, which was the ending date of the diversion period under the agreement. The court issued a judgment of dismissal on January 26,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">On November 17, 2006, defendant was arrested for DUII in this case. Defendant filed a petition for diversion on February 1, 2007. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that defendant was ineligible for diversion. Defendant then entered a conditional guilty plea to the present charge, and he appeals from his ensuing conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">At issue is the meaning of ORS 813.215, which, as amplified below, we ascertain from the text of the statute in the context of the statutory scheme for DUII diversion. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and </em>Industries, 317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (stating that the goal of statutory construction is to ascertain, if possible, the meaning of the statute most likely intended by the legislature that enacted it by examining its text in context). ORS 813.215 (2005)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201c(1) A defendant is eligible for diversion if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\u00ab\u2021 * \u2021 iji \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201c(3) The defendant was not participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, other than a program entered into as a result of the charge for the present offense, in this state or in any other jurisdiction on the date the defendant filed the petition for a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201c(4) The defendant did not participate in a diversion or rehabilitation program described in subsection (3) of this section, other than a program entered into as a result of the charge for the present offense, within the period beginning 10 years before the date of the commission of the present offense and ending on the date the defendant filed the petition for a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Defendant asserts that the statutory framework that governs diversion distinguishes between a \u201cdiversion agreement\u201d and a \u201cdiversion program.\u201d Defendant argues tbat a diversion agreement is the \u201cagreement between the state and the defendant wherein the defendant agrees to complete specific programs within the one-year time period\u201d; whereas, \u201cthe group of programs\u201d that a defendant is required to complete under a diversion agreement constitutes the diversion program. It follows, defendant reasons, that, although he was subject to a diversion agreement until January 26,1997, he had completed his diversion program in the earlier DUII case on or before September 23, 1996. As a consequence, defendant reasons, he was eligible for diversion in this case, because he had not \u201cparticipate[d] in a diversion * * * program described in [ORS 813.215(3)] * * * within the period beginning 10 years before the date of the commission of the present offense,\u201d that is, November 17, 2006. <em>See </em>ORS 813.215(4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ORS 813.200 provides that the court shall inform a defendant charged with DUII of the availability of a diversion agreement and prescribes the contents of a petition to enter into such an agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ORS 813.230(l)(b) provides that, when the court allows a petition for diversion, the court shall, among other things, \u201c[s]ign the petition and indicate thereon the date of allowance of the diversion period, the length of the diversion period and the date upon which the driving while under the influence offense occurred.\u201d That statute also provides that, when the trial court signs and dates a petition, the petition \u201cbecomes the diversion agreement between the defendant and the court,\u201d and it requires the court to \u201cmake the agreement a part of the record of the case.\u201d ORS 813.230(2). ORS 813.230(3) provides that a DUII \u201cdiversion agreement shall be for a period of one year after the date the court allows the petition\u201d and that the court shall stay the DUII proceeding \u201c[d]uring the diversion period.\u201d ORS 813.225(1) allows a defendant to apply \u201cby motion to the court in which the diversion agreement was entered for an order extending the diversion period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>In sum, the foregoing provisions demonstrate that the diversion agreement is the written agreement that a defendant enters into with the court. The diversion agreement specifies the conditions that the defendant must perform during the diversion period. The diversion period, which is one year in duration, is the amount of time that a defendant must be subject to the terms of the diversion agreement. On those points the parties do not seem to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">On the other hand, the term \u201cdiversion program\u201d is not statutorily defined; rather, its meaning must be deduced from the text and context of ORS 813.215(4). A careful examination of those sources undercuts defendant\u2019s proposed construction. Contrary to defendant\u2019s view, the legislature has not referred to the group of specially prescribed conditions that a defendant must fulfill in order to perform his or her obligations under a diversion agreement as the diversion program. Rather, the legislature typically has referred to such conditions as \u201cthe conditions of the diversion agreement.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 813.225(4); ORS 813.250(1); ORS 813.250(3). Likewise, when referring to particular programs that a defendant must complete while participating in a diversion agreement, the legislature typically has not used the term \u201cdiversion program,\u201d but, rather, has referred, for example, to \u201cthe program of treatment,\u201d ORS 813.200(4)(c); the \u201crehabilitation program,\u201d ORS 813.250(4); or the \u201ctreatment program,\u201d ORS 813.260(2). <em>See e.g., Dept. of Transportation v. Stallcup, </em>341 Or 93, 101, 138 P3d 9 (2006) (use of different terms in statute suggests that each was intended to have a different meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Instead, the term \u201cdiversion program,\u201d as used in ORS 813.215(3), logically refers to the entire constellation of special and general conditions the satisfaction of which permits a defendant to avoid a judgment of conviction for DUII. <em>Cf. State v. Wright, </em>204 Or App 724, 731, 131 P3d 838 (2006) (describing a \u201cDUII diversion program\u201d as an \u201copportunity to avoid a substantial, judicially imposed adverse consequence\u201d). Regardless whether a defendant has successfully completed all specially prescribed conditions of diversion in the meantime, that avoidance cannot occur until one year after the court allows the diversion petition. <em>See </em>ORS 813.230(3); ORS 813.250(1). That is so, among other reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>because an overarching general condition of diversion is the requirement that a defendant not commit another DUII offense during the one-year diversion period. ORS 813.200(4)(e). Thus, a defendant continues to participate in a diversion program until that general condition is satisfied and the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that defendant participated in a diversion program in connection with his first DUII case until the diversion period ended and that case was dismissed on January 26,1997. It follows that defendant was ineligible for diversion in this case because he had participated in a diversion program described in ORS 813.215(3) within the period beginning 10 years before November 17, 2006, the date of the commission of the present offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> The legislature amended ORS 813.215 in 2007, but it did not change the pertinent language in any material respect. <em>See </em>ORS 813.215(1)(d), (e) (2007).
