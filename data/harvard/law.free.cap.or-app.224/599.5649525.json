The award of attorney fees stems from proceedings to resolve a medical services dispute following the entry of a claim disposition agreement (CDA). We review for errors of law, ORS 656.298(7) and ORS 183.482(8), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We take the facts from the final DCBS order. On June 13, 2000, claimant suffered a compensable back injury resulting in partial paralysis of his lower extremities. In February 2001, claimant and insurer entered into a CDA pursuant to ORS 656.236. In exchange for monetary compensation specified in the CDA, claimant released \u201call rights to workers\u2019 compensation benefits allowed by law, including temporary disability, permanent disability, vocational rehabilitation, aggravation rights to reopen claim, attorney fees, penalties, and survivor benefits potentially arising out of this claim, and any subsequent claim for new medical conditions, except for medical services * * In addition, the CDA provided checkboxes to indicate whether, for each category of benefits, the release would be a \u201cfull\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d release. For each category, including a category entitled \u201cPenalties and Attorney Fees,\u201d the checkbox indicating a full release was marked. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (WCB) approved the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In January 2005, claimant, with the assistance of counsel, requested administrative review of insurer\u2019s refusal to provide a wheelchair-accessible van. The medical review unit (MRU) issued an order requiring insurer to purchase the wheelchair-accessible van and requiring insurer to pay a fee to claimant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Insurer filed a request for a contested case hearing with DCBS. At that time, hearings were conducted by the administrative law judges (ALJs) of the WCB. The sole issue at hearing was the portion of the order awarding attorney fees. Insurer argued that the parties\u2019 CDA disposed of claimant\u2019s right to attorney fees. Claimant responded that an award of attorney fees was proper under ORS 656.385.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ORS 656.385(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\"><em>\u201cIn all cases involving a dispute </em>over compensation benefits <em>pursuant to ORS 656.245, </em>656.247, 656.260, 656.327 or 656.340, where a claimant finally prevails after a proceeding has commenced, the Director of <em>the Department of Consumer and Business Services </em>or the Administrative Law Judge <em>shall require the insurer </em>or self-insured employer to <em>pay a reasonable attorney fee to the claimant\u2019s attorney. </em>In such cases, where an attorney is instrumental in obtaining a settlement of the dispute prior to a decision by the director or an Administrative Law Judge, the director or Administrative Law Judge shall require the insurer or self-insured employer to pay a reasonable attorney fee to the claimant or claimant\u2019s attorney. The attorney fee must be based on all work the claimant\u2019s attorney has done relative to the proceeding at all levels before the department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">(Emphasis added.) The ALJ issued an order affirming the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Insurer submitted exceptions to DCBS, relying on <em>Rash v. McKinstry Co., </em>331 Or 665, 20 P3d 197 (2001), for the proposition that, under ORS 656.236(l)(a), a CDA completely resolves all current and future matters that arise out of a claim, except medical services, unless otherwise specified in the CDA. Insurer argued that, because the CDA expressly disposed of claimant\u2019s right to attorney fees and claimant did not reserve a right to an attorney fee, the CDA disposed of any prospective entitlement to attorney fees that claimant could claim. Claimant argued that the ALJ\u2019s proposed order correctly affirmed the MRU order because claimant\u2019s attorney was entitled to an award of fees under ORS 656.236(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">ORS 656.236(l)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\u201cThe parties to a claim, by agreement, may make such disposition of any or all matters regarding a claim, except for medical services, as the parties consider reasonable, subject to such terms and conditions as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board may prescribe. For the purposes of this section, \u2018matters regarding a claim\u2019 includes the disposition of a beneficiary\u2019s independent claim for compensation under this chapter. <em>Unless otherwise specified, a disposition resolves all matters and all rights to compensation, attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>fees and penalties potentially arising out of claims, except medical services, </em>regardless of the conditions stated in the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">(Emphasis added.) DCBS concluded that, under <em>Rash, </em>ORS 656.236(l)(a) extinguished only those matters or rights under the jurisdiction of the WCB not otherwise reserved by a CDA. Pursuant to ORS 656.385(1), attorney fees for medical services disputes are within the sole jurisdiction of DCBS and not under the jurisdiction of the WCB. Accordingly, DCBS concluded that the CDA, which was approved by the WCB, did not resolve the attorney fees awarded in this case because the issue was medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In addition, DCBS observed that the legislature had amended ORS 656.385(1) after the parties executed the CDA in 2001. At the time of execution, DCBS had <em>discretion </em>to award attorney fees to a prevailing claimant <em>only </em>in a \u201ccontested case order.\u201d ORS 656.385(1) (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2003, ch 756, \u00a7 2. The 2003 legislature amended ORS 656.385(1) to <em>mandate </em>an award of attorney fees to a prevailing claimant \u201cafter a proceeding has commenced before the Director of [DCBS].\u201d Or Laws 2003, ch 756, \u00a7 2. DCBS concluded that a claimant could not relinquish a right to attorney fees before such a right existed. Based on both the jurisdictional and the waiver issues, DCBS affirmed the award of attorney fees to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Insurer now seeks judicial review of that award. Insurer argues that ORS 656.236(l)(a) provides authority for a CDA that fully extinguishes all rights to attorneys fees \u201cpotentially arising out of claims.\u201d Next, insurer argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Rash </em>decision interprets the scope of that exclusion broadly. Finally, insurer argues that the CDA adopted by the parties in this case expressly released any rights that claimant may have to attorney fees under ORS 656.385(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Both claimant and DCBS respond to insurer\u2019s petition. DCBS argues that ORS 656.236(l)(a) does not permit a claimant to abrogate a right to lifetime medical services and that the mandatory attorney fee provision under ORS 656.385(1) does not depend on whether a claimant seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>enforce that attorney fee provision. DCBS asserts that a statutory construction of ORS 656.236(l)(a) that limits the permissible reach of a CDA to exclude attorney fees for medical services claims would harmonize ORS 656.236(l)(a) with ORS 656.385(1) and would make those statutes consistent with each other. According to DCBS, that approach would comport with the legislature\u2019s policy goal of protecting injured workers from the wrongful denial of a medical services claim. DCBS also relies on <em>In re Leisure, </em>336 Or 244, 253, 82 P3d 144 (2003), <em>citing School Dist. No. 1 v. Teachers Retirement Fund, </em>163 Or 103, 95 P2d 720 (1939), for the proposition that claimants may waive statutory rights only to the extent that those rights are directed solely to their personal protection and are not directed toward the fulfillment of a broader public policy. DCBS argues that a claimant\u2019s waiver of attorney fees would defeat the legislature\u2019s broader purpose of ensuring that workers have the ability to enforce rights to lifetime medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Claimant adopts DCBS\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.77(4)(a) (providing that a party may adopt a brief submitted by another party). In addition, at oral argument, claimant proposed that the statutory text in ORS 656.236(l)(a) providing that a CDA resolves all matters and rights \u201cpotentially arising out of claims\u201d except medical services, means that the legislature intended to \u201cexcept medical service claims because those do not arise out of the jurisdiction of the Workers Compensation Board.\u201d As support for that proposition, claimant interprets the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) to allow the parties to make a disposition of only those matters \u201csubject to the terms and conditions as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board may prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Two questions of statutory interpretation are central to this petition. First, we consider whether ORS 656.236(l)(a) allows the disposition of a claimant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees incurred during a subsequent medical services dispute. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that ORS 656.236(l)(a) does allow such a disposition and that the CDA between the parties in this case so disposes of claimant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees. Second, we consider whether a disposition of attorney fees in a CDA is ineffective in light of the mandatory attorney fee provision in ORS 656.385(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Because we conclude that the terms of a CDA control whether attorney fees may be awarded pursuant to ORS 656.385(1), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">To resolve issues of statutory interpretation, we examine the statutory text in its context and, if necessary, its legislative history. If the text remains ambiguous we then consider maxims of statutory construction to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Before engaging the specific issues of statutory interpretation, we pause to note the nature of attorney fees under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. An attorney representing a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is prohibited from directly charging that claimant for legal services, and the agency or appellate court must approve any award of attorney fees. ORS 656.388. In a denied claim, where the claimant finally prevails, any attorney fees are paid by the insurer or employer. ORS 656.386. If the claimant does not finally prevail in a denied claim, the attorney is not paid any attorney fees. If an attorney is instrumental in obtaining additional compensation for the claimant, then the attorney fee is paid out of the additional compensation awarded to the claimant and, if no additional compensation is awarded to the claimant, then the attorney is not paid any attorney fees. <em>Former </em>ORS 656.386(2) (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 908, \u00a7 1. Moreover, attorney fees are not compensation. Compensation is defined in ORS 656.005(8) as including all benefits, including medical services, provided for a compensable injury to a claimant by an insurer or employer. Because an insurer or employer does not provide attorney fees to a claimant and instead provides attorney fees to an attorney, attorney fees are not compensation. <em>See Rash, </em>331 Or at 671-72 (concluding that the phrase \u201call rights to compensation\u201d relates only to a <em>claimant\u2019s </em>right to benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Turning to the interpretation of ORS 656.236(l)(a), we observe that the first sentence of the statutory text delineates the <em>permissive scope </em>of matters that may be disposed of by a CDA and that the third sentence provides a <em>default rule </em>for the extent of the disposition controlled by a CDA. Both of those sentences expressly exclude medical services from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>scope of a CDA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cThe parties to a claim, by agreement, may make such disposition of any or all matters regarding a claim, except for medical services, as the parties consider reasonable, subject to such terms and conditions as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board may prescribe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The third sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cUnless otherwise specified, a disposition resolves all matters and all rights to compensation, attorney fees and penalties potentially arising out of claims, except medical services, regardless of the conditions stated in the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">It is apparent from the text of ORS 656.236(1) that the legislature considered medical services to be treated differently from all other types of benefits that the parties to a claim could resolve by mutual agreement. Because the legislature presumably would not intend the default rules of a CDA to exceed the permissive scope of authority for the parties to enter into a CDA, the scope of the permissive authority granted in the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) must be at least as broad as the scope of the default rules stated in the third sentence. <em>See Rash, </em>331 Or at 672-73 (concluding that where the wording in the third sentence \u201ccasts a wider net\u201d than the wording in the first sentence, a CDA resolves all matters contained within that wider net). Accordingly, if, under the default rules, a CDA resolves attorney fees related to medical services claims, we infer that the permissive authority for such a disposition is so provided. For that reason, we focus our analysis on that third statutory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Whether the scope of the medical services exclusion in that third sentence refers only to medical services benefits or also to entitlements to attorney fees and penalties derivative of a medical services dispute is difficult to discern. Specifically, it is not readily apparent whether the legislature intended the phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d to modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>term \u201cclaims\u201d or to modify the terms \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights.\u201d If the medical services exclusion applies to the term <em>\u201cclaims,\u201d </em>the default terms of the CDA would not resolve any matters or any rights to compensation, attorney fees, and penalties potentially arising out of medical services claims. Under that construction, because attorney fees are necessarily derivative of medical services claims, those derivative fees could not be disposed by a CDA. On the other hand, as further explained below, if the medical services exclusion refers back to medical services <em>matters </em>or <em>rights, </em>the default terms of the CDA would disaggregate matters regarding attorney fees from matters regarding medical services and would disaggregate rights to attorney fees from rights to medical services. Accordingly, under this latter construction, the CDA would, by its default terms, resolve all attorney fee issues, because attorney fees would be treated as separate and distinct from medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Although <em>Rash </em>did not present an occasion for interpreting the medical services exception, the Supreme Court\u2019s prior construction of the third sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) in <em>Rash </em>is relevant to our textual analysis because that prior construction is considered to be part of the text of the statute itself. <em>Stephens v. Bohlman, </em>314 Or 344, 350 n 6, 838 P2d 600 (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Rash, </em>the Supreme Court stated that, \u201c[a]s a matter of grammar, * * * the phrase \u2018to compensation\u2019 qualifies only the word \u2018rights\u2019 and not the word \u2018matters.\u2019 \u201d 331 Or at 671. We conclude that, because the words \u201cto compensation\u201d are included within the larger referential phrase \u201cto compensation, attorney fees and penalties,\u201d that entire larger referential phrase modifies only the word \u201crights\u201d and not the word \u201cmatters.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the Supreme Court concluded that the noun \u201cmatters\u201d in the third sentence is modified by the referential phrase \u201cpotentially arising out of claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>at 673. Based on the placement of the noun \u201crights\u201d in the middle of that third sentence, both \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights\u201d must be modified by that referential phrase. Consequently, the grammatical structure of the relevant part of that third sentence provides that, except for medical services and unless otherwise specified, a disposition resolves (1) all matters potentially arising out of claims, and (2) all rights to compensation, attorney fees, and penalties potentially arising out of claims. Within this context, \u201c[t]he plain and unambiguous meaning of the word \u2018all\u2019 is \u2018every.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rash, </em>331 Or at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">With that background, we turn to the key issue: whether the phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d modifies the term \u201cclaims\u201d or the terms \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights.\u201d The text enumerates specific \u201crights\u201d to different types of remedies: rights to \u201ccompensation, attorney fees and penalties.\u201d As noted above, \u201ccompensation\u201d is a statutorily defined term that includes \u201call benefits, <em>including medical services, </em>provided for a compensable injury to a subject worker or the worker\u2019s beneficiaries by an insurer * * ORS 656.005(8) (emphasis added). Because medical services are a benefit included in the definition of the more general term \u201ccompensation,\u201d the enumeration of types of remedies suggests that the legislature intended the compensatory remedy for medical services to be separate and distinct from a remedy providing attorney fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A grammatical construction that the phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d in the third sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) modifies \u201crights\u201d would give effect to the separate and distinct character of each of those separate types of remedies. Under that construction, the medical services exception would prohibit a CDA from resolving any rights to benefits for medical services, but a CDA would otherwise be capable of resolving <em>every </em>other remedy, including every other compensatory benefit and every right to attorney fees and penalties that could potentially arise out of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The grammatical construction that \u201cexcept medical services\u201d modifies \u201cclaims\u201d would fail to give effect to each of those enumerated rights. \u201cClaim\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201ca written request for compensation from a subject worker or someone on the worker\u2019s behalf* * *.\u201d ORS 656.005(6). Thus, if \u201cexcept medical services\u201d modifies \u201cclaims,\u201d all matters and rights potentially arising out of written requests for medical services would not be resolvable. Under that construction, because attorney fees and penalties are necessarily derivative of (or \u201cpotentially aris[e] out of\u2019) a claim, the type of <em>claim </em>would be completely dispositive of whether each type of <em>remedy </em>was resolvable by the CD A. The textual reference to \u201cattorney fees and penalties\u201d would be reduced to surplusage. Because, as a general rule, we construe statutes in a manner that, whenever possible, gives effect to all statutory provisions, <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005); ORS 174.010, we conclude that the phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d modifies \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">That interpretation is confirmed by applying rules of grammar and syntax to the third sentence in ORS 656.236(l)(a). Grammatical rules governing the usage of commas provide that if the referential phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d was intended to modify its immediately preceding noun, \u201cclaims,\u201d in a manner that \u201cis restrictive \u2014 that is, essential to the meaning of the sentence \u2014 [it should be] neither preceded nor followed by a comma.\u201d <em>The Chicago Manual of Style </em>\u00a7 6.38 (15th ed 2003). Because \u201cexcept medical services\u201d is restrictive and set off by commas, rides of grammar dictate that \u201cexcept medical services\u201d was not intended to modify \u201cclaims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Oregon Supreme Court has accepted the doctrine of the last antecedent as a long-standing grammatical principle useful in interpreting the text of statutes. The Supreme Court described the doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cReferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the meaning of the sentence. Thus a proviso usually is construed to apply to the provision or clause immediately preceding it. The rule is another aid to discovery of intent or meaning * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cEvidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>State v. Webb, </em>324 Or 380, 386, 927 P2d 79 (1996) (quoting Norman J. Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47, 33 (5th ed 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, because the referential phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d is preceded by a comma, the doctrine of the last antecedent indicates that the referential phrase applies to \u201call antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one.\u201d The preceding words, phrases, or clauses that can be made antecedents without impairing the meaning of the sentence are the words \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights.\u201d Thus, under the doctrine of the last antecedent, the referential phrase \u201cexcept medical services\u201d should modify \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights\u201d and not \u201cclaims.\u201d Our interpretation is consistent with the text of the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a), in which the term \u201cexcept for medical services\u201d clearly modifies the entire antecedent, \u201cany or all matters regarding a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Having concluded that \u201cexcept medical services\u201d modifies \u201cmatters\u201d and \u201crights,\u201d we turn to claimant\u2019s argument that the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) restricts a CD A to dispose of only those <em>matters </em>\u201csubject to such terms and conditions as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board may prescribe.\u201d Claimant\u2019s argument lacks merit. That quoted phrase from the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) does not modify the scope of \u201cmatters\u201d over which the parties may negotiate; it modifies the term \u201cdisposition\u201d and provides authority for the WCB to approve the CD A before it becomes final. Our interpretation of the first sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a) is confirmed by the default rules in the third statutory sentence, which do not limit the scope of a CDA to matters under the jurisdiction of the WCB. Specifically, the third sentence allows the parties to extinguish any rights to \u201ccompensation.\u201d As discussed above, \u201ccompensation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>includes, by definition, \u201call benefits, including medical services, provided for a compensable injury.\u201d ORS 656.005(8). Those benefits may include, among other things, vocational assistance services that, just like medical services, are within the jurisdiction of DCBS, and not the WCB. ORS 656.704(3)(a). Because ORS 656.236(l)(a) does not exclude vocational assistance from the scope of a CDA, it cannot logically be understood to limit the scope of a CDA to those matters subject to the WCB\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Thus, ORS 656.236(l)(a) provides a default rule that, unless otherwise specified, a CDA resolves all rights pertaining to a claimant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees, including attorney fees that could potentially arise out of medical services disputes. We turn, then, to the terms of the parties\u2019 CDA, interpreting it by applying the same rules of construction that apply to contracts. <em>Trevitts v. Hoffman-Marmolejo, </em>138 Or App 455, 459, 909 P2d 187 (1996). In the absence of any ambiguity, we construe the text of the contract as a matter of law. <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 361, 937 P2d 1019 (1997). The CDA entered into between the parties releases \u201call rights to all workers\u2019 compensation benefits allowed by law, including * * * attorney fees\u201d and provides for a \u201cfull\u201d release of rights to \u201cPenalties and Attorney Fees.\u201d Neither any party nor DCBS argues that the CDA otherwise establishes that claimant has reserved any right to attorney fees other than that under the default rules established in ORS 656.236(1)(a). Thus, the CDA entered into between these parties resolves all rights to attorney fees. Because we conclude that the legislature intended under ORS 656.236(1)(a) to provide authority for the disposition of all potential attorney fees, claimant\u2019s and DCBS\u2019s argument that any disposition of attorney fees would be contrary to public policy lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We next consider whether the disposition of attorney fees in the parties\u2019 CDA is nonetheless ineffective in light of the mandatory attorney fee provision provided by ORS 656.385(1). As discussed, the parties entered into the CDA in 2001. At that time, DCBS had discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party only in contested case orders. ORS 656.385(1) (2003). By the time the medical services dispute proceeding was commenced before DCBS in this case in 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>an award of attorney fees to claimant\u2019s attorney when the claimant prevailed was mandated in all proceedings for medical services disputes. ORS 656.385(1). That mandatory proviso applied to \u201call claims for which an order relating to the issue on which attorney fees are sought has not become final on or before [January 1, 2004], regardless of the date of injury.\u201d Or Laws 2003, ch 756, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In this case, claimant\u2019s medical services claim for a wheelchair-accessible van was not final by January 1, 2004. However, any right that claimant may have asserted to attorney fees was resolved by the CDA executed in 2001. A disposition such as a CDA has the finality and effect of a judgment. <em>See Fimbres v. Gibbons Supply </em>Co., 122 Or App 467, 471, 857 P2d 904 (1993) (concluding that a negotiated, signed agreement approved by a workers\u2019 compensation referee has the finality of a judgment). As discussed, the CDA entered into between the parties resolved all rights to attorney fees that could <em>potentially </em>arise out of the claim. Because a CDA has the finality of a judgment, the 2003 statutory amendment cannot reopen the parties\u2019 2001 CDA to create any new right to attorney fees. The award of attorney fees to claimant was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> Medical services are also excluded from the procedural effect of a disposition agreement prior to its approval by the WCB, as provided in the sixth sentence of ORS 656.236(l)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">\u201cSubmission of a disposition shall stay all other proceedings and payment obligations, except for medical services, on that claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\"> In <em>Rash, </em>the Supreme Court determined that an insurer\u2019s statutory lien against a claimant\u2019s third-party settlement proceeds was fully extinguished by a CDA because the CDA resolved \u201call matters * * * potentially arising out of claims.\u201d 331 Or at 673.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> The Supreme Court observed that the phrase \u201call rights to compensation\u201d related only to a worker\u2019s \u2014 and not an insurer\u2019s \u2014 right to receive benefits. The court did not consider whether the rights to attorney fees and penalties are similarly restricted, because the rights to attorney fees and penalties were not at issue in that case. <em>Rash, </em>331 Or at 671-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> To state the obvious, \u201cmedical services\u201d are not synonymous with \u201cattorney fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
