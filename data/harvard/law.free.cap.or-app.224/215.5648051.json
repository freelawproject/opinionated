J.</author>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In this legal malpractice case, plaintiff appeals after the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact as to what advice plaintiff was given and whether he relied on that advice. We agree and therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view the facts from the summary judgment record and all reasonable inferences that we may draw from them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the nonmoving party. <em>Ivanov v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>344 Or 421, 425, 185 P3d 417 (2008). In 2001, plaintiff and his wife decided to dissolve their marriage. They put together notes as to how their property would be divided, but plaintiff had concerns about the disposition of some of the property, including property that had been acquired before the marriage and his pension. Plaintiff, however, was apprehensive about the expenses that would be incurred if both parties obtained legal representation, and he thought that a paralegal might be a less expensive option.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">One of the properties at issue between plaintiff and his wife was a 75-acre parcel in Jackson County. Although they had agreed on a division of that property, they were unsure how to phrase the agreement and whether it was workable. Plaintiff decided to talk to defendant, an attorney, about the proposed agreement because he was \u201cconcerned about the effect of what [he and his wife] had agreed to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In July 2001, plaintiff met with defendant. Plaintiff showed defendant the informal agreement that he and his wife had reached, and they discussed that agreement in detail. Plaintiff and defendant had several subsequent meetings, and they discussed the parties\u2019 assets and possible distribution of those assets during each meeting. During one of the meetings, defendant told plaintiff that \u201cwhat [plaintiff and his wife] had agreed upon was adequate.\u201d Defendant then \u201creferred [plaintiff and his wife] to Karen[,]\u2019 a paralegal who he said did good work and to whom he had referred other people.\u201d Plaintiff then contacted the paralegal and asked her to prepare the documents for the final property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>After the paralegal had prepared those documents, plaintiff asked defendant to review them. Plaintiff and defendant discussed issues regarding tax implications of the agreement, and plaintiff then went ahead with the dissolution. Plaintiff and his wife executed the documents prepared by the paralegal. One of the terms of the property division conditioned plaintiffs interest in the 75-acre parcel on his ability to obtain zoning, building, water, and septic approvals from Jackson County. The property division did not include any reference to plaintiff\u2019s pension. As it tremed out, plaintiff was unable to obtain the necessary approvals from the county, and he lost his interest in the 75-acre parcel. Also, because the pension was not listed in the property division, his former wife \u2014 as opposed to any future spouse \u2014 would continue to have an interest in the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In 2005, plaintiff filed this legal malpractice action against defendant. His negligence claim alleged that defendant fell below the standard of care in the following four particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201c1. In referring Plaintiff to a paralegal untrained in legal matters to give him dissolution advice and prepare the necessary documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201c2. In advising him that the paralegal was competent to handle such a case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201c3. In failing to determine the extent and nature of Plaintiffs property interests and the complexity thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u201c4. In failing to advise Plaintiff that he should seek competent advice from an attorney licensed to practice in the state of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">According to the complaint, plaintiff had consulted with another attorney after the dissolution, who advised him that the dissolution documents \u201cwere not properly prepared, that [defendant should not have referred him to a paralegal because of the complexity of his case[,] and that he probably had suffered substantial loss based upon what should have been done with regard to the property rights and distribution of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Defendant moved for summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim, on the ground that \u201c[t]he undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>evidence as indicated by the affidavits and deposition testimony is that plaintiff did not want an attorney to represent him in his divorce.\u201d In support of that motion, defendant relied primarily on excerpts from plaintiffs deposition, in which he testified regarding his decision to use a paralegal to prepare the documents. In one of those excerpts, plaintiff testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">\u201cQ. * * * [Y]ou didn\u2019t ask [defendant] to become, had him become your attorney to do the divorce because you had a friend who told you to avoid an attorney if you could?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cQ. All right. And so when he gave you these alternatives, you thought the paralegal was the best way to go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201cA. Uh-huh * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">In another excerpt, plaintiff testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cQ. All right. But the fact is that he told you that a paralegal can fill out documents, do you think [defendant] was telling you that this is what you should do, or he gave you the alternative of making that selection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cA. I specifically said I wanted a paralegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">\u201cQ. You wanted one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">\u201cA. (Nodding head).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. That\u2019s because your friend\u2019s prior advice about attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">\u201cA. Exactly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, defendant argued that \u201c[t]he Plaintiffs deposition really establishes that he made the decision \u2014 not [defendant], to use the paralegal to do this.\u201d The trial court agreed, relying on defendant\u2019s notes of his meetings with plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">\u201c[T]he issue is not did the paralegal perform adequately, it is did [defendant] commit malpractice by referring [plaintiff] to a paralegal? And on that issue I see no material issue of fact in dispute, because * * * you can tell from the third conference, the Monday, August 12, 2002, conference, those notes clearly summarize without saying in so many words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>that the Plaintiff had no interest in having [defendant] represent him. And all the discussion in there, of notes, of [defendant] giving him warnings, telling him to take care of things, what issue to watch for, and, yes, there is a referral to [the paralegal]. \u2018[The paralegal] can fill out the papers for you the way you want.\u2019 And that just doesn\u2019t raise an issue with malpractice that I can see. There is no issue in dispute. * * * \"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Thus, from its oral ruling, the trial court appeared to focus on only one of plaintiffs four specifications of negli<em>gence </em>\u2014 i.e., that defendant referred plaintiff to a paralegal\u2014 when it granted summary judgment on the entire claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in focusing exclusively on his first specification of negligence and also in ruling, as a matter of law, that plaintiff could not state a claim for malpractice under that specification. Plaintiff argues that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendant referred him to a paralegal and whether he relied on defendant\u2019s advice in that regard. In support of those contentions, plaintiff offers the following averments from his declaration in opposition to summary judgment: (1) Plaintiff knew that a paralegal could type the necessary documents but set up an appointment with defendant to \u201cget advice as to whether this was the way to go\u201d; (2) he discussed \u201cassets and distributions in detail\u201d with defendant at each of their meetings; (3) defendant advised him \u201cthat what [plaintiff and his wife] had agreed upon was adequate\u201d; and (4) defendant \u201cthen referred [plaintiff and his wife] to * * * a paralegal * * In plaintiffs view, those averments, when viewed in the light most favorable to him, give rise to the inference that defendant referred him to a paralegal and that he relied on that advice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In response, defendant invokes the line of cases in which this court has held that a party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by contradicting prior deposition testimony. <em>See, e.g., Henderson-Rubio v. May Dept. Stores, </em>53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Or App 575, 583-85, 632 P2d 1289 (1981). According to defendant, plaintiffs deposition testimony conclusively establishes that \u201c[p]laintiff had already made the decision that he would use a paralegal based on the advice of a friend.\u201d Thus, defendant argues that \u201c[t]he sole cause for plaintiffs subsequent problems in his [dissolution] was the result of his decision not to use an attorney. An attorney cannot corral a potential client who does not want to use his services.\u201d Defendant further argues that the lack of \u201ccausation\u201d is fatal to all four specifications of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">As an initial matter, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we do not see a contradiction between plaintiffs deposition testimony and his later declaration. In his deposition, plaintiff testified that he wanted to use a paralegal because it was cheaper and because his friend had advised him to avoid attorneys. His declaration does not deny that that was the case; rather, his declaration states that, \u201c[w]hile I knew a paralegal could type the necessary documents up, I was concerned about the effect of what we had agreed to.\u201d He further averred that he sought defendant\u2019s advice to see \u201cwhether this was the way to go.\u201d It is possible to read plaintiffs deposition testimony and his declaration consistently \u2014 that is, that he wanted to avoid using an attorney because of the cost and expense, <em>but only if defendant advised him that it \u201cwas the way to go.\u201d </em>That evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether defendant referred plaintiff to a paralegal as alleged in the first specification of negligence and whether plaintiff relied on that referral.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">As noted above, the trial court inferred from the evidence in the record that plaintiff \u201chad no interest in having [defendant] represent him\u201d and therefore dismissed the negligence claim without addressing all four specifications of negligence. In reaching that conclusion, the trial court focused too narrowly on defendant\u2019s evidence and did not take into account plaintiffs declaration or give plaintiff the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from his averments. Although the record on summary judgment may be susceptible to the inference that plaintiff \u201chad no interest\u201d in obtaining legal representation in the dissolution proceeding, that is not the <em>only </em>inference that can be drawn from the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the competing evidence and available inference that plaintiff in fact sought defendant\u2019s advice as to whether to use a paralegal in his case and relied on that advice, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> In response to the summary judgment motion, plaintiff also offered a declaration stating that he had retained an expert to support his allegation that defendant\u2019s advice fell below the standard of care. Defendant conceded that \u201c[t]his statement is sufficient to deny defendant\u2019s motion concerning \u2018standard of care\u2019 according to ORCP 47 E[J\u201d and the standard of care is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> Once again, because the standard of care is not at issue on appeal, 224 Or App at 220 n 1, the question for purposes of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is whether plaintiff in fact relied on defendant\u2019s referral \u2014 or what defendant describes as a \u201ccausation\u201d question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\"> Nor was the trial court\u2019s factual inference necessarily dispositive of plaintiff s other specifications of negligence. Plaintiffs other specifications alleged that defendant failed to determine the nature and extent of his property interests and that, based on the complexity of his case, defendant should have advised him to \u201cseek competent advice from an attorney licensed to practice in the state of Oregon.\u201d Those specifications do not depend factually or legally on whether plaintiff had any \u201cinterest in having [defendant] represent him\u201d in a dissolution case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
