Plaintiff appeals from a limited judgment dismissing the claim, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and to the denial of plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint to add a new claim. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider the denial of plaintiffs motion, which was not expressly addressed in the limited judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, we view the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the party opposing the motion, to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, ORCP 47 C; <em>Robinson v. Lamb\u2019s Wilsonville Thriftway, </em>332 Or 453, 455, 31 P3d 421 (2001); <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 407-08, 939 P2d 608 (1997), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Cristina and Van Walraven owned Wallbangers Oregon, Inc. Wallbangers became indebted to plaintiff for business consulting services performed in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, plaintiff obtained a judgment against Wallbangers. This action, brought pursuant to ORS 95.260,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> comes on the heels of plaintiffs failed attempt to collect on the judgment. Plaintiff asserted in its complaint that, in an effort to avoid its debt to plaintiff, Wallbangers violated ORS 95.240(1) when it transferred property to defendant \u201c[w]ithout receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer\u201d and \u201cbecam[e] insolvent as a result of the transfer.\u201d Plaintiff brought this action to have the transfer set aside so that its judgment could be satisfied. The trial court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a limited judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the record on summary judgment gives rise to a question of fact as to whether defendant received a fraudulent transfer from Wallbangers. Defendant is a corporation owned by Cristina Walraven\u2019s mother; its sole asset is a condominium in Miami. Plaintiff offered evidence that, for two and one-half years and during the time that plaintiff was providing services to Wallbangers, Cristina was an officer of defendant. Plaintiff believed, based on Cristina\u2019s representations during that time, that Cristina owned an interest in the Miami condominium and that she intended to convey it to Wallbangers in order to provide capitalization to Wallbangers. Based on Cristina\u2019s representations that she had begun to take action to transfer title of the condominium to Wallbangers, plaintiff advised the Walravens to include the value of the condominium on Wallbangers\u2019s financial statements. They did so. In August 2003, the Walravens signed financial statements, created for purposes of securing credit and Oregon Liquor Control licensing for Wallbangers night clubs, stating that Wallbangers owned \u201cintangible assets\u201d of over $500,000. The Walravens told plaintiff that the \u201cintangible assets\u201d represented the value of the Miami property. Despite Cristina\u2019s representations to plaintiff that she had transferred her interest in the Miami property to Wallbangers, Wallbangers did not list the property as an asset on its 2003 federal tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">From that evidence, plaintiff asserts, a factfinder could infer that Cristina had acquired an interest in the Miami condominium, that she had transferred that interest to Wallbangers, and that Wallbangers in turn transferred the property to defendant for the purpose of sheltering the property from Wallbangers\u2019s creditors without consideration, in violation of ORS 95.240.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Defendant asserts that most of the evidence that plaintiff has offered in support of its claim is inadmissible hearsay. We need not address that argument, however. ORS 95.250 provides that \u201c[a] transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset.\u201d Assuming, without deciding, that plaintiffs evidence could be some evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Cristina planned for Wallbangers to acquire an interest in the Miami property, there is no evidence that such a transaction ever occurred. ORS 93.020(1) provides that \u201c[n]o estate or interest in real property * * * can be created, transferred, or declared otherwise than by operation of law or by a conveyance or other instrument in writing, subscribed by the party creating, transferring or declaring it[.]\u201d There is no evidence of a writing, recorded or unrecorded, purporting to grant Wallbangers an interest in the Miami property. We reject plaintiffs contention that the requirement for a writing is excused by part performance. There is no evidence that is \u201cclear, certain, and unambiguous\u201d showing that there was an agreement by defendant to transfer the property to Wallbangers. <em>See Mukai Living Trust v. Lopez, </em>199 Or App 341, 345, 111 P3d 1150 (2005). Thus, plaintiff has failed to produce evidence sufficient to carry its burden of proof. For that reason, plaintiffs claim fails as a matter of law and defendant is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">As previously noted, plaintiff also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend its complaint to allege a claim for common-law fraud. Because this appeal is from the limited judgment dismissing the claim against defendant as stated in plaintiffs first amended complaint and the judgment makes no mention of that ruling, we lack jurisdiction to consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\"> We note that a general judgment has been entered in the case and that an appeal is pending (CA A137331).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> ORS 95.260 sets forth the relief that a creditor may obtain against a transfer made in violation of ORS 95.240 and includes \u201c[ajvoidance of the transfer * * * to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
