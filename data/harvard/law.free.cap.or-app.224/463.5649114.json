The state concedes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. As explained below, we conclude that the state\u2019s concession is well taken. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Defendant was the driver of a vehicle that was lawfully stopped for several traffic infractions. The officer who made the stop determined that the vehicle needed to be impounded. While inventorying the contents of the vehicle, the officer found defendant\u2019s jacket, searched it, and located drug-related materials in a pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The parties agree that the search of the jacket was not authorized by any inventory policy, and that the circumstances presented no \u201cofficer safety\u201d concern that justified searching the jacket. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree that the search of defendant\u2019s j acket violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
