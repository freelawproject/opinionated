J.</author>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Defendant, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), appeals from a trial court order directing ODFW to return to plaintiffs, James Filipetti and Francesca Mantei, one black-tailed doe named \u201cSnowball\u201d (the doe). After the doe had been seized from plaintiffs\u2019 property pursuant to a search warrant, plaintiffs sought to recover the doe by filing a motion under ORS 133.633 for \u201creturn or restoration of things seized.\u201d The trial court granted that motion, and, on appeal, ODFW contends that the court erred because plaintiffs failed to establish a \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d of the doe pursuant to ORS 133.643(4). In particular, ODFW argues that (1) under ORS 133.643(4), a person can recover an item seized only if the person can lawfully possess that item; and (2) because plaintiffs did not (and do not) have a license or permit to hold wildlife, as required under OAR 635-049-0070, they cannot lawfully possess the doe. For the reasons that follow, we agree with ODFW. Consequently, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The parties stipulated, as pertinent here, for purposes of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for return or restoration of things seized, to the following material facts: On September 12, 2007, plaintiffs were in possession of the doe, but they did not possess a permit or license to hold wildlife. On that date, a search warrant was issued and served on plaintiffs at their residence in Clackamas County; that warrant permitted the search and seizure of evidence of the crime of \u201cUnlawful Holding of Wildlife (deer)\u201d and \u201cUnlawful Possession of Cervid to include any live deer (native or non-native) held in captivity.\u201d Under the authority of that warrant, the doe was seized from plaintiffs\u2019 property by law enforcement personnel and ODFW agents. Thereafter, however, no criminal charges were brought against plaintiffs \u2014 and, thus, as of the time the trial court rendered the order challenged on appeal, the doe was not needed for any evidentiary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">On October 15, 2007, plaintiffs filed a \u201cmotion for return or restoration of things seized,\u201d pursuant to ORS 133.633, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c(1) Within 90 days after actual notice of any seizure, or at such later date as the court in its discretion may allow:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201c(a) An individual from whose person, property or premises things have been seized may move the appropriate court to return things seized to the person or premises from which they were seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Plaintiffs further, and specifically, asserted that they satisfied the requirements for \u201creturn or restoration\u201d prescribed by ORS 133.643. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201cA motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a valid claim to rightful possession thereof, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201c(4) Although the things seized were subject to seizure * * *, the movant is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon the court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In particular, plaintiffs contended that they had a \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d of the doe because the doe had been seized from them and was \u201cno longer needed for evidentiary purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">ODFW opposed that motion. Specifically, ODFW argued that, under ORS 133.643(4), plaintiffs had to show more than just that the doe had been seized from them and was no longer needed for evidentiary purposes. Rather, ODFW contended, given the \u201centitled to\u201d language in ORS 133.643(4), plaintiffs also had to establish that they could lawfully possess the doe \u2014 and, because plaintiffs did not have the legally required wildlife permits, they did not, and could not, meet that requirement. After hearing extensive arguments on the matter, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On appeal, the parties essentially adhere to their positions before the trial court. We emphasize, at the outset, that our role is not to assess the \u201cequities\u201d of the parties\u2019 interactions or the doe\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d Rather, our exclusive, properly focused judicial function is to determine whether the trial court erred in its understanding and application of ORS 133.643(4). Thus, the only issue here is one of law \u2014 and, particularly, of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In addressing that issue, we apply the familiar principles of statutory construction set out in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Our fundamental task is to discern, and, if possible, to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting ORS 133.643(4). <em>Id. </em>at 610; <em>see also </em>ORS 174.020(1)(a) (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, a court shall pursue the intention of the legislature if possible.\u201d). We begin that inquiry by examining the statutory text in context and then, if necessary, resort to legislative history and maxims of statutory construction. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 610-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">ORS 133.643 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cA motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a valid claim to rightful possession thereof, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201c(1) The things had been stolen or otherwise converted, and the movant is the owner or rightful possessor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201c(2) The things seized were not in fact subject to seizure * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201c(3) The movant, by license or otherwise, is lawfully entitled to possess things otherwise subject to seizure * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201c(4) <em>Although the things seized were subject to seizure * * </em>* <em>the movant is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon the court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes', </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">\u201c(5) The parties in the case have stipulated that the things seized may be returned to the movant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, under the statute, proof of any of the five disjunctive conditions, ORS 133.643(1) to (5), is sufficient to establish the movant\u2019s \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d of the seized item.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">As noted, plaintiffs\u2019 claim to recovery was based, ultimately, only on ORS 133.643(4). Consequently, the issue narrows to the proper construction of that provision. Even more narrowly, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on the meaning of \u201centitled\u201d under ORS 133.643(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Plaintiffs contend that, under ORS 133.643(4), once the court determines that the item seized is \u201cno longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>needed for evidentiary purposes,\u201d then the person who possessed the item when it was seized is \u201centitled\u201d to its return. That is, under plaintiffs\u2019 construction, \u201centitled\u201d describes the <em>consequence </em>of satisfying a <em>condition. </em>To use a simple hypothetical: <em>If </em>a person buys a ticket, <em>then </em>she is \u201centitled\u201d to see the movie. Thus, in plaintiffs\u2019 view: If the court determined that the doe was no longer needed for evidentiary purposes, then plaintiffs were entitled to the doe\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Conversely, ODFW understands \u201centitled\u201d in subsection (4) to describe or connote an <em>additional </em>condition. That is, the court cannot order return of the item seized unless (1) the item is no longer needed for evidentiary purposes <em>and </em>(2) the person is \u201centitled\u201d to possess the item. ODFW further asserts that a person cannot be \u201centitled\u201d to possess an item unless that possession would be lawful. Thus, in ODFW\u2019s view, the court cannot order the return of an item, based on a claim of right under ORS 133.643(4), unless the court determines that the item is no longer needed for evidentiary purposes and the person seeking the return of the item would, upon its return, lawfully possess that item.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We first look to the term \u201centitled,\u201d which is not expressly defined in the statute. In the absence of a statutorily provided definition, we ordinarily assume that the legislature intended the words of the statute to carry their ordinary meanings. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. \u201cEntitle\u201d is pertinently defined as: \u201cto give a right or legal title to : qualify (one) for something: furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something * * <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>758 (unabridged ed 2002). <em>See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>573 (8th ed 2004) (defining \u201centitle\u201d as \u201c[t]o grant a legal right to or qualify for\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">If the legislature intended \u201centitled\u201d to mean \u201cgive[n] a right or legal title to,\u201d that construction of the term would comport with ODFW\u2019s contention that a movant must have the right to lawful possession of the things seized. Conversely, the legislature could have intended \u201centitled\u201d to mean \u201cqualif[ied] * * * for something\u201d or \u201cfurnish[ed] with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something * * *.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 758. That construction of the term \u201centitled\u201d would comport with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>does not necessarily require lawful possession of the things seized \u2014 but, instead, that \u201cthe court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes\u201d by itself serves as the \u201cqualification for\u201d or \u201cproper grounds for seeking or claiming\u201d return of things seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We proceed to the context in which the legislature used the term. <em>See Bridgeview Vineyards, Inc. v. State Land Board, </em>211 Or App 251, 262, 154 P3d 734, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007) (\u201cAt the first level of analysis, we do not consider the text in isolation; rather, we employ rules of textual construction that bear directly on how to read the text, and we are careful to consider the text in context.\u201d). Context includes \u201cother provisions of the same statute and other related statutes,\u201d as well as relevant judicial constructions of those statutes. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611; <em>State v. Thompson, </em>166 Or App 370, 377, 998 P2d 762, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 192 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We first consider the immediate context, which is the phrase or sentence in which \u201cis or will be entitled to their return or restoration\u201d appears. That phrase is followed by the language <em>\u201cupon </em>the court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes.\u201d ORS 133.643(4) (emphasis added). Essential to plaintiffs\u2019 construction of \u201centitled\u201d is the premise that \u201cupon,\u201d as used in ORS 133.643(4), connotes a <em>conditional </em>relationship between (a) \u201centitled to * * * return\u201d and (b) \u201cthe court\u2019s determination that they are no longer needed * * That is: \u201cIf (b), then (a).\u201d Or, to phrase the matter most concretely here: If the court makes the \u201cno longer needed\u201d determination, then the movant is \u201centitled\u201d to return of the seized item.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Conversely, ODFWs construction of ORS 133.643(4) is predicated on \u201cupon\u201d being used in a <em>temporal </em>sense. That is, the movant must be \u201centitled\u201d to return of the seized item <em>as of the time </em>the court determines that the item is \u201cno longer needed for evidentiary purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The parties\u2019 differing constructions correspond, plausibly, to two commonly employed usages of \u201cupon.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 2518 (defining \u201cupon\u201d as \u201cimmediately following on: very soon after[,]\u201d \u201con the occasion oil,]\u201d and \u201con the condition of\u2019). The former definition comports with ODFW\u2019s \u201ctemporal\u201d construction, and the latter with plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconditional\u201d construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In sum, when the operative statutory text is viewed in most proximate context, either party\u2019s reading appears to be plausible. We note, however, that there are also aspects of ORS 133.643, viewed as a whole, that militate against the plausibility of either party\u2019s proposed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">First, if plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction were correct, then the language \u201cthe movant is or will be entitled to [the item\u2019s] return or restoration upon\u201d would be meaningless \u2014 or, at least, gratuitous. That is, if plaintiffs are correct that, under ORS 133.643(4), a person who possessed a seized item can automatically recover the item once the court determines that the item is \u201cno longer needed for evidentiary purposes,\u201d the statute would read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cA motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a valid claim to rightful possession thereof, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201c(4) Although the things seized were subject to seizure, the court has determined that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In construing statutes, \u201cwe assume that the legislature did not intend any portion of its enactments to be meaningless surplusage.\u201d <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005); <em>see </em>ORS 174.010 (in construing a statute, the court is not to \u201comit what has been inserted\u201d and, \u201cwhere there are several provisions or particulars such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction conflicts with those precepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Conversely, ODFW\u2019s proposed construction depends on the premise that \u201centitled\u201d in ORS 133.643(4) means <em>\u201clawfully </em>entitled\u201d to possession. The difficulty with that construction is that the legislature employed the term \u2018lawfully entitled\u201d in the immediately preceding subsection of the statute. <em>See </em>ORS 133.643(3) (providing that \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d is shown where \u201c[t]he movant, by license or otherwise, is <em>lawfully entitled </em>to possess things otherwise subject to seizure\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, when the legislature wanted to use the term \u201clawfully entitled,\u201d it knew how to do so. <em>See, e.g., Springfield Utility Board v. Emerald PUD, </em>339 Or 631, 642, 125 P3d 740 (2005) (\u201c \u2018[U]se of a term in one section and not in another section of the same statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>indicates a purposeful omission.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611)). Further, in a related sense, ODFW\u2019s reading would appear to contradict another basic canon of statutory construction: The court is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted\u201d in a statute. ORS 174.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\">Our review of the statutory text in context thus demonstrates that the parties\u2019 proposed constructions of ORS 133.643(4) are both facially plausible but ostensibly problematic in some respects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because neither of those competing constructions is \u201cwholly implausible,\u201d <em>Owens v. MVD, </em>319 Or 259, 268, 875 P2d 463 (1994), the statute is ambiguous at <em>PGE\u2019s </em>first level. <em>Cf. State v. Rodriguez, </em>217 Or App 24, 28, 175 P3d 471 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 159 (2008) (emphasizing \u201chow little it takes to demonstrate that a statute is \u2018ambiguous\u2019 \u201d). Consequently, we proceed to the statute\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The legislature enacted ORS 133.643 in 1973 as part of the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s revision of the Criminal Procedure Code. The commentary to that revision discloses that the legislature did not intend a motion for return or restoration of things seized to serve as a vehicle for the return of things seized to a movant who could not lawfully possess them. That intent is primarily expressed in the context of things seized pursuant to search warrants that are ruled invalid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201c[I]f, on motion, the seizure is shown to be unlawful, the property shall be returned to the person from whom it was taken, unless otherwise subject to lawful detention!,] * * * to ensure that contraband is not returned, even if taken by an unlawful seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 163,103 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The commission emphasized that the grounds for a motion to suppress and for a motion for return or restoration differ greatly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cA narcotics pusher from whom a quantity of heroin has been seized by an unlawful search may be entitled to suppress the heroin as evidence, but not to get it back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Preliminary Draft No 2, Part II, Art 5, \u00a7 23, 66 (Nov 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Finally, and dispositively, the commission emphasized that it did not intend the state to return items that were unlawful for the movant to possess, no matter how the state came into possession of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">\u201cIn most if not all circumstances, the legality of the search or seizure is not relevant to disposition of a motion for return or restoration of the property. <em>If possession of the things seized is unlawful, the state retains the things no matter how it got them.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). That legislative history demonstrates conclusively that the legislature intended for the state to retain items seized if the movant\u2019s possession of them would be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Plaintiffs remonstrate, nevertheless, that the legislative history is inapposite because the doe is not \u201ccontraband\u201d in that it is possible, in some <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 viz., if one holds the requisite permit \u2014 to possess wildlife lawfully. With respect, that misses the thrust of the legislature\u2019s intent. Many items, including certain types of controlled substances and weapons, <em>can </em>be lawfully possessed, but only under certain, legally specified conditions \u2014 and, unless those conditions are satisfied, possession of the item is unlawful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In plaintiffs\u2019 understanding, the legislature intended to empower persons from whom such items were lawfully seized to compel their return even if the movant\u2019s possession of the returned item would be unlawful because the movant did not hold the legally required license or permit. The legislative history flatly contradicts such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We thus conclude that a party seeking to compel the return or restoration of seized property based on a \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d pursuant to ORS 133.643(4) must establish that (1) the item is \u201cno longer needed for evidentiary purposes\u201d and (2) the person is \u201centitled\u201d to the return or restoration of \u2014 that is, can lawfully possess \u2014 the item sought to be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In this case, plaintiffs stipulated that they did not possess a permit or license to hold wildlife. Consequently, at the time the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion, plaintiffs could not lawfully possess the doe. <em>See </em>ORS 498.002 (prohibiting possession of wildlife in violation of wildlife laws or rules); ORS 497.308 (prohibiting acquiring and holding in captivity any live wildlife in violation of wildlife laws or rules); OAR 635-049-0010 (Fish and Wildlife Commission official policy opposing the private ownership of native cervids); OAR 635-049-0070 (prohibiting possession of cervids without a permit or license). Thus, plaintiffs failed to establish a \u201cvalid claim to rightful possession\u201d of the doe under ORS 133.643(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The trial court erred in granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \u201creturn or restoration\u201d of the doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> We note, parenthetically, that our prior decisions referring to ORS 133.643 offer no assistance. In <em>State v. Terry, </em>37 Or App 333, 336, 587 P2d 1033 (1978), the state argued that ORS 133.643(4) did not apply because the property was \u201ccontraband.\u201d We stated that \u201c[i]t is arguable that if the [property was] * * * illegal to possess, the defendant did not have \u2018a valid claim to rightful possession thereof under ORS 133.643.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337. We declined to address the issue, however, because we did not conclude that the property was illegal to possess. <em>Id. Cf. Mercer v.
