Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 641, 175 P3d 454 (2007). Around midnight on February 17, 2004, Coos County sheriffs deputies Mitchell and Kenning were on patrol and noticed defendant, who is an adult male, and two teenaged girls talking on the sidewalk in a poorly lit area of a residential neighborhood. The deputies decided to \u201cstop[ ] to talk to them because * * * for one, the females were almost out after curfew. And just the manner \u2014 they were bunched up, talking. It looked very suspicious from what was going on.\u201d Mitchell explained that he was concerned because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell * * * if [defendant] was harassing the girls, not letting them leave,\u201d if \u201cthere was narcotics activity going on,\u201d or if the females \u201cwere feeling sorry for [defendant]\u201d because he looked homeless and the girls were \u201cnicely dressed.\u201d The deputies pulled over and got out of the patrol car without using overhead lights or sirens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Kenning asked defendant if he \u201ccould talk to him for a second.\u201d Defendant and Kenning stood at the rear of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>patrol car and began a \u201ccasual conversation\u201d during which Kenning asked defendant where he was heading and where he lived. Meanwhile, Mitchell had taken the girls aside toward the front of the patrol car. Defendant was calm throughout the conversation with Kenning.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Kenning asked defendant for identification, and defendant provided Kenning with an identification card. Kenning left defendant, taking his identification card, and walked toward Mitchell at the front of the patrol car. Mitchell met Kenning midway, and Kenning then handed defendant\u2019s identification card to Mitchell. Kenning returned to defendant, and Mitchell ran a records check on defendant\u2019s identification through dispatch. While Mitchell retained defendant\u2019s identification and was waiting for the records check to come back from dispatch, Kenning resumed his conversation with defendant. Kenning explained at the hearing that he was basically \u201cjust killing time until [defendant] wanted to leave, or [until] Deputy Mitchell returned with [defendant\u2019s] ID.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">During that time, Kenning asked defendant if he had anything illegal on him. Defendant denied possessing any illegal substances. Next, Kenning asked defendant for consent to search his person, and defendant did not respond orally but began emptying the contents of his pockets onto the back of the patrol car. One of the objects defendant took out of his pocket was a \u201cplastic bindle\u201d that contained a white substance. When Kenning asked defendant if the bindle contained drugs, defendant put his head down but did not reply. Defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. The deputies submitted the bindle to the Oregon State Police crime lab for testing, and the lab report identified the substance in the bindle as methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search on the ground that the evidence was obtained during an unlawful stop that was not supported by reasonable suspicion. The trial court concluded that defendant had not been \u201cstopped\u201d for constitutional purposes at the time that he consented to the search of his person, and therefore the court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>motion. Following a trial to the court, defendant was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He contends that he was unlawfully stopped when the deputies retained his identification and used that information to perform a records check without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Further, defendant argues that the evidence he sought to suppress was gained as a result of the unlawful stop and, therefore, should have been suppressed under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In its response, the state concedes that the deputies lacked reasonable suspicion when they approached defendant. However, the state relies on <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), and argues that, pursuant to its interpretation of <em>Hall, </em>defendant had not been \u201cstopped\u201d for constitutional purposes, because the record does not establish that defendant was aware that the deputies were using his identification to perform a records check. According to the state, <em>\u201cHall </em>holds that a person who knows that he is the subject of an ongoing police investigation is seized because he is objectively unlikely to feel free to leave in the absence of some action by the police to inform him that he is free to go.\u201d Accordingly, the state urges this court to remand the matter to the trial court to resolve the factual issue of whether defendant was aware of the records check at the time of the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In <em>State v. Highley, </em>219 Or App 100, 180 P3d 1230 (2008),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> decided just before oral argument in this case, we applied the reasoning of <em>Hall </em>in the context of a traffic stop. We held that a stop had occurred when the officer asked the defendant, a passenger in a car, whether he was on probation and thereafter requested and obtained the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, wrote down the information, and returned the license to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03,110.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Here, we conclude, consistently with <em>Highley, </em>that the deputies stopped defendant. First, the state concedes that Kenning and Mitchell lacked reasonable suspicion of defendant\u2019s criminal activity. Second, on approaching defendant and the teenaged girls, Kenning asked defendant for his identification; defendant handed Kenning his identification; and Kenning left defendant\u2019s side to walk toward Mitchell\u2014 who was with the teenaged girls at the front of the patrol car \u2014 and handed defendant\u2019s identification to Mitchell. Third, Mitchell retained defendant\u2019s identification while Kenning returned to defendant and resumed talking with him. Fourth, on returning to defendant, Kenning asked defendant whether he had anything illegal on his person; defendant denied possessing anything illegal; and Kenning then asked for defendant\u2019s permission to search. On those facts, defendant was stopped for constitutional purposes, and a remand to the trial court for further factfinding is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Our analysis does not end there, however. Pursuant to <em>Hall, </em>evidence obtained from a consensual search of a defendant is subject to suppression under Article I, section 9, if the defendant\u2019s consent is the product of the prior unlawful police conduct. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Hall </em>that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201c[a]fter a defendant shows a minimal factual nexus between unlawful police conduct and the defendant\u2019s consent, then the state has the burden to prove that the defendant\u2019s consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct. Deciding whether the state has satisfied that burden requires a fact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances to determine the nature of the causal connection between the unlawful police conduct and the defendant\u2019s consent. * * * Although determining the existence of such a causal connection requires examination of the specific facts at issue in a particular case, we view several considerations to be relevant to that determination, including (1) the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the defendant\u2019s consent, (2) the existence of any intervening circumstances, and (3) the presence of any circumstances \u2014 such as, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>example, a police officer informing the defendant of the right to refuse consent \u2014 that mitigated the effect of the unlawful police conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">339 Or at 34-35 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Here, defendant satisfied the minimal factual nexus required under <em>Hall </em>by establishing that, \u201cbut for\u201d the unlawful stop, Kenning would not have been in a position to ask for defendant\u2019s consent to search his person. <em>See State v. Ayles, </em>220 Or App 606, 612-13, 188 P3d 378 (2008) (concluding that the defendant satisfied his burden under <em>Hall </em>by establishing a \u201cbut for\u201d relationship between the illegal police conduct and the defendant\u2019s consent to search). Accordingly, the burden shifted to the state to establish that defendant\u2019s consent was \u201cindependent of, or only tenuously related to\u201d the unlawful stop. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 35. As in <em>Highley, </em>the request for consent to search defendant occurred in close temporal proximity to the prior illegality. Moreover, the state has not established that any intervening circumstances or other factors might have mitigated the effect of the unlawful stop on defendant\u2019s subsequent consent to search his person. Because the methamphetamine seized from defendant is the unattenuated product of exploitation of the unlawful stop, the motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of the state police crime lab report into evidence over defendant\u2019s objection that it violated his constitutional right to confrontation. Because of our disposition on defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, we need not reach the merits of defendant\u2019s second assignment of error. <em>But see State v. Birchfield, </em>342 Or 624, 157 P3d 216 (2007) (admission of a laboratory report without requiring the state to produce at trial the criminalist who prepared the report, or to demonstrate unavailability, violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> Mitchell testified that he and Kenning used their flashlights and that he may have turned on the car\u2019s back flashers as a safety measure to alert other drivers to the car\u2019s presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> By order dated July 23, 2008, the Supreme Court indicated that it is holding a petition for review in <em>Highley </em>in abeyance pending its decision in <em>State v.
