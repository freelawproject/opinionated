Defendant appeals, assigning error to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict. Defendant asserts that plaintiff failed to adduce sufficient evidence of outrageous conduct or of intent to inflict severe emotional distress. Defendant also argues that plaintiffs emotional distress was not a reasonable response to its conduct. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record from which the jury could have found the facts necessary to establish the elements of plaintiffs claim. <em>See York v. Bailey, </em>159 Or App 341, 349, 976 P2d 1181, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 287 (1999) (stating standard of review for denial of a motion for directed verdict). We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In reviewing the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict, we state the facts, including all reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Defendant is a manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks. Defendant, which is self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, has a policy of trying to put employees with work-related injuries to work in a light-duty capacity until they become medically stationary, rather than placing them on disability leave. Employees on light-duty work receive the same wages and benefits that they earn doing regular work. Defendant has a policy preference for giving injured employees light-duty work on the production floor, but, if no work is available within a particular employee\u2019s medical restrictions, then the employee is assigned to the nurse\u2019s station at the manufacturing plant. The nurse\u2019s station is operated by Rosemary Rasmussen, an occupational health nurse employed by defendant. Defendant encourages managers and supervisors to notify the nurse\u2019s station when they have light-duty tasks available on the production floor so that injured employees in the nurse\u2019s station can be assigned to do that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">When an injured employee becomes medically stationary, defendant determines whether a regular job is available within the medical restrictions, if any, that the employee still has. If no suitable jobs are available at that point, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the employee receives workers\u2019 compensation disability benefits and does not continue to work at the plant, even in a light-duty capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Plaintiff began working full time for defendant in 1988 in various aspects of truck production. In 2002, she began to experience repetitive-motion shoulder pain in her right shoulder, which led to her filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim and ultimately having surgery in July 2003. Plaintiff did not work for three months after the surgery. The injury did not heal as quickly as plaintiff had hoped, which caused her distress. Plaintiff had other stressors in her personal life and was taking antidepressant medication. Defendant was not aware of plaintiffs medication or the problems in her personal life.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Plaintiff was released to return to work in a light-duty capacity on October 6, 2003. By doctor\u2019s order, the work that she could perform was very restricted; she was ordered not to lift more than one pound and to do no pushing, pulling, or overhead work. Before plaintiff returned, a clerical worker in the nurse\u2019s station, Jennifer Marple, sent an e-mail to plaintiffs supervisor, Mike Calkins, telling him that, when plaintiff returned, he should not assign her any work: \u201cWhen [plaintiff] comes back to work[,] under no circumstance, should she cry, whine, beg, plead with you to find her something to do that\u2019s meaningful, productive, any kind of job, tell her you have nothing for her. You have no work for her to do.\u201d Plaintiff was instructed to report to the nurse\u2019s station, where she would be assigned light duty jobs until she was medically stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">When plaintiff returned, Rasmussen told her to report to, and work for, Marple. Marple, whom plaintiff had never met before, was unpleasant and hostile toward her from the beginning. She told plaintiff that she was her boss and that plaintiff would have to go wherever Marple wanted. Marple called plaintiff \u201cworthless\u201d almost daily, often in front of other employees. On at least one occasion, she referred to plaintiff as \u201cMs. Thing.\u201d Rasmussen\u2019s desk was only 10 to 12 feet from Marple\u2019s desk, so she was within earshot when Marple called plaintiff names.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s first assignment was to clean and organize a filing room, which involved moving 25- to 30-pound filing boxes by herself. After the first day, plaintiff told Marple that it exceeded her medical restrictions. Marple told her to use a rolling cart for any boxes that she didn\u2019t want to carry, but plaintiff still had to lift the boxes onto the cart. After three days, plaintiff complained to her shop steward that she was working beyond her restrictions and that her arm was getting sore. The shop steward talked to Marple about it. She pulled plaintiff off the job, but was angry and complained loudly about the steward\u2019s intervention. Plaintiff spoke with her doctor about the matter, and he faxed even more severe work restrictions to the nurse\u2019s station.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">On another occasion, plaintiff was assigned to a light-duty assembly job putting plastic washers on bolts, but the particular washers she was assigned to put on were very tight and required her to push very hard with her thumbs, which led to soreness in her shoulder. Other assembly work was available that did not require that kind of exertion. Plaintiff did not complain about the soreness to anyone, and she had assembled more than 2,000 bolts and washers before she was allowed to take a break. At that point, she could not move her shoulder any more.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Plaintiff was assigned to sell snacks to other employees on the production floor to raise money for a charity,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> something that was not routinely assigned to other people. Plaintiff was assigned that job at least two or three times a week, and sometimes every day of the week. Plaintiff\u2019s coworkers made insulting and malicious remarks to plaintiff when she performed the job, such as, \u201cget a job,\u201d \u201clazy bitch,\u201d and \u201cworthless.\u201d It was apparent to other employees that plaintiff was not happy with the assignment. Plaintiff told Marple what was going on and that it was humiliating, but Marple only responded by telling her, \u201cget hustling and get it done.\u201d Once, she suggested that plaintiff wear a low-cut shirt the next day so she would increase her sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Marple also ordered plaintiff to circulate a \u201cfootball pool\u201d and to collect bets on the pool, despite plaintiffs protests that it was illegal. Marple ordered plaintiff to place the first bet to get the pool started. Plaintiff complained to Rasmussen about the pool being illegal, but Rasmussen simply told her to avoid defendant\u2019s human resources manager, Trudy Houghton, so that she would not get into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Marple and Rasmussen essentially used plaintiff as a personal servant, ordering her to get snacks, sodas, and lunches for them, including going off the premises to get lunches on two occasions, which violated company rules. They never reimbursed plaintiff or even thanked her for buying their food. They also assigned plaintiff tasks, such as making posters for health-awareness events, that were meant to help Rasmussen earn a bonus and were not supposed to be done on company time. Plaintiff did some of the work on her own time and some in the nurse\u2019s station. When she was working on the projects in the nurse\u2019s station, Marple and Rasmussen would warn her to hide the work whenever Houghton was coming, so they would not get into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">When plaintiff complained about the assignments she was getting, Marple told her that, if she had a problem with them, Marple would require her to pick up garbage with a poker stick in front of everyone all around the plant. Plaintiff protested that the assignment would be \u201cjust to humiliate [her].\u201d Marple told plaintiff, \u2018Well, then you\u2019ll do what I tell you to do or I\u2019ll have you do that,\u201d adding that she had made another employee do it before and that he was so embarrassed that his injury improved thereafter. Marple also threatened to put plaintiff at what she called the \u201ctable of shame,\u201d a table in front of the cafeteria windows where she would be \u201cparaded\u201d in front of the other employees and where, according to Marple, \u201call the worthless workers go.\u201d Marple never actually followed through on those threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Plaintiff attempted to find work on the production floor on her own. She spoke to her former supervisor, Calkins, and complained to him nearly every day about the assignments she was being given and the treatment she received in the nurse\u2019s station. She told him, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve got to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>get me out of here.\u201d Calkins initially told her that he had work that she could do but that he could not assign it to her, citing the e-mail he had received from Marple before plaintiff had returned to work. He eventually did give her some work, but on one occasion he told plaintiff that she had to return to the nurse\u2019s station because Marple had called and said that she had a \u201cshameful\u201d job for plaintiff and that plaintiff had only \u201cso many minutes\u201d to get back to the nurse\u2019s station. He eventually talked to Houghton about the fact that Marple and Rasmussen would not allow plaintiff to work on the production floor, but, despite defendant\u2019s usual policy of encouraging supervisors to find light-duty work for injured employees, she told him to mind his own business and \u201cbutt out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Plaintiff spoke with other supervisors and was assigned other tasks on the production floor, where she wanted to be. For a period of about four weeks, she was able to do paint inspection nearly every day, but Marple sometimes pulled her from the work to do other tasks at the nurse\u2019s station, including those that were meant to help Rasmussen earn a bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">For several days, plaintiff was required to sit in a chair in the nurse\u2019s station and do nothing for her entire eight-hour shift. On one occasion, when plaintiff was performing light-duty work for Calkins, Marple called her back to the nurse\u2019s station and made her sit in the chair doing nothing for the rest of the day. On another occasion, plaintiff was ordered to sit and guard cookies at a bake sale, which drew derisive comments from passing coworkers. At one point, about twice a week, a supervisor came to the nurse\u2019s station and asked for plaintiff to do paint inspection. Although plaintiff was sitting in a chair doing nothing, Marple and Rasmussen turned down his request\u2014 apparently so they could have her do Rasmussen\u2019s \u201cbonus\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Things came to head in late February 2004, nearly five months after plaintiff had returned to work following her surgery. Plaintiff talked to Houghton, the human resources manager, and told her how Marple and Rasmussen had been treating her. She told Houghton that she was being treated \u201cunethically,\u201d being used as a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d or \u201cslave,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>having to do things like the football pool behind management\u2019s back, having to buy lunches and spend money without being reimbursed, and having to do work on her own time. She also told Stoughton about the threats that Marple had made to her. Houghton, who was close friends with Rasmussen and Marple, seemed surprised and said that she would \u201ccheck into it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Plaintiff then told Houghton that another employee with less seniority who had a similar shoulder injury was being allowed to work overtime, and she asked Houghton that she also be allowed to work overtime. Houghton declined and then, smiling at plaintiff, told her, \u201c[W]e have no work for you. Frankly, I have talked to everybody, including supervisors, managers, foremen. I have talked to everybody. I really have[.]\u201d She then said, \u201cNobody wants you. You\u2019re worthless. We build trucks down here. You know, your right arm \u2014 what are you \u2014 nobody wants you.\u201d She continued to repeat that plaintiff was worthless and \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d Plaintiff became hysterical and left Houghton\u2019s office; she eventually left work early. She sought medical care that night and was referred the next day to a psychiatrist, under whose care she remained through trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The next day, Houghton called plaintiff and told her not to come to work, saying, \u2018We don\u2019t have anything for you.\u201d Plaintiff did not work again until July 2004. Instead of a regular paycheck, she received advances on her permanent partial disability award. In July, she returned to work and wiped trucks down. She was supposed to do the job using only her good arm, but, according to plaintiff, to meet production expectations, she had to use her right arm. After four weeks, she was taken off the job because it hurt her shoulder. She was then given a data entry job but received no training on how to do it. Houghton, the plant manager, and plaintiffs supervisor would stand behind her looking over her shoulder for extended periods of time, which she found intimidating. Any time plaintiff asked a question, her supervisor would tell her, \u201cNo more talking.\u201d Plaintiff found the job to be very stressful because she did not know what she was doing. She eventually went on medical leave in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Plaintiff commenced this action on March 10, 2004, asserting claims for workers\u2019 compensation discrimination and intentional infliction of severe emotional distress (IIED). In an amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that she was entitled to punitive damages for both claims. When plaintiff finished presenting her case-in-chief, defendant moved for a directed verdict on her claims. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant renewed the motion at the close of all of the evidence, and the court again denied it, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s conflicting testimony that raises credibility issues, which are always the province of the jury to resolve.\u201d Defendant then moved to strike the claim for punitive damages. Noting that punitive damages are \u201creserved for the most outrageous, egregious activity,\u201d the court concluded that such activity \u201cis not found in the evidence in this case, particularly by a clear and convincing evidence standard.\u201d It granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The case was then submitted to the jury. With respect to the IIED claim, seven fact specifications went to the jury. Plaintiff alleged that defendant (1) intentionally worked her beyond her restrictions; (2) denied her productive work; (3) assigned her to do work for the purpose of causing her to be humiliated, even when productive work was available; (4) told her that, if she did not like the treatment she was receiving, then defendant would have her pick up garbage; (5) threatened to make her work at the \u201ctable of shame\u201d; (6) repeatedly called her \u201cworthless\u201d when she protested the pattern of treatment; and (7) referred to her as \u201cMiss Thing.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor on the discrimination claim, but it found for plaintiff on the IIED claim and awarded her $250,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After the jury returned its verdict, defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, alternatively, for a new trial. The court denied the motion and entered a judgment reflecting the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict on the IIED claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the denial of a motion for directed verdict, we review the record to determine whether there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found the facts necessary to establish the elements of the claim. <em>York, </em>159 Or App at 349. To prevail on a claim for IIED, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant intended to cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress or knew with substantial certainty that its conduct would cause such distress; (2) that the defendant\u2019s conduct in fact caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress; and (3) that the defendant engaged in outrageous conduct, that is, conduct extraordinarily beyond the bounds of socially tolerable behavior. <em>House v. Hicks, </em>218 Or App 348, 357-58, 179 P3d 730, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 381 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Defendant argues that plaintiff failed to establish any of the three elements. With respect to the first element, defendant argues that plaintiff failed to establish that any of its conduct was intended to cause severe emotional distress or that defendant knew that its conduct would cause such distress. Specifically, defendant argues that there is insufficient factual support in the record for the allegations that it intentionally worked plaintiff beyond her restrictions, denied her productive work, and assigned her work for the purpose of causing her humiliation. It argues that any intent that Marple may have had to inflict distress cannot be attributed to defendant, because Marple was not a managerial employee. With respect to the second element, defendant acknowledges that there is evidence from which the jury could have found that plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress, but it contends that, even assuming that the alleged conduct actually occurred, it would not cause a <em>reasonable </em>person to suffer severe emotional distress and, thus, that plaintiffs distress is not actionable. Finally, with respect to the third element, defendant argues that all of the specifications of conduct submitted to the jury fall short of the \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d standard required to support liability for IIED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>In response, plaintiff first raises two preservation challenges. She argues that defendant failed to assert at trial that Marple was not a management employee and thus that her intent cannot be attributed to defendant. She also argues that defendant failed to preserve the issue of the reasonableness of her response to defendant\u2019s conduct. On the merits, she disputes defendant\u2019s contention that a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard applies to determining whether severe emotional distress is actionable. Plaintiff also contends that, viewing the record in the light most favorable to her, there is sufficient evidence that defendant either intended to cause severe emotional distress or knew that it was substantially certain to occur. She also argues that the jury could reasonably find that defendant\u2019s conduct was extraordinarily beyond the bounds of socially tolerable behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">We begin with plaintiffs argument that defendant failed to preserve the contention that Marple\u2019s intent cannot be attributed to defendant. To preserve a claim of error for appeal, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Defendant did not argue to the trial court that the intent element could not be satisfied by evidence that Marple intended to inflict severe emotional distress. Accordingly, we consider evidence of Marple\u2019s intent in determining whether plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence to establish the intent element.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We turn next to plaintiff s contention that defendant failed to preserve the issue of the reasonableness of her emotional response. In denying defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the trial court did not specifically address the question whether plaintiffs response to defendant\u2019s conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>objectively reasonable. Rather, it stated only that conflicting testimony raised credibility issues that the jury had to decide. Given that the question whether plaintiff s emotional response was reasonable does not involve any credibility determinations, it appears that the trial court did not address that issue. Thus, the question for us is whether defendant raised the issue with sufficient specificity that the court should have been prompted to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In its trial memorandum, defendant began its analysis of the IIED claim by listing the elements of the tort as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\u201cSuch a claim requires pleading and proof of three elements: (1) that the defendant intended to inflict severe emotional distress on the plaintiff, meaning either that the defendant actually intended the distress or knew that it was substantially certain to occur as a result of the conduct in question; (2) that the conduct did, in fact, cause such severe emotional distress; and (3) that the defendant\u2019s conduct involved some extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In that statement of the elements, defendant did not assert that the distress must be objectively reasonable. However, in the next paragraph of the memorandum, defendant argued that the conduct described in plaintiffs complaint could not amount to IIED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201cThere is no evidence from which any objectively reasonable juror could infer that this conduct was engaged in with such intent, there is <em>no evidence a reasonable person would ever suffer such distress from such conduct </em>and, most importantly, it does not come close to involving \u2018some extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">(Emphasis added.) In its initial motion for directed verdict, at the close of plaintiffs case-in-chief, defendant argued that its alleged misconduct did not amount to intentional infliction of severe emotional distress, asserting, \u201cIt was clear, I think, from [plaintiffs] testimony and her comments on cross examination that this is the product of a huge emotional overreaction.\u201d When it renewed the motion at the close of all the evidence, defendant argued, \u201cThere is a large area where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>human beings and differences in personality and differences in sensitivity that make somebody else uncomfortable is not actionable. And that\u2019s what this case is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Taking all of those statements by defendant together, we conclude that defendant identified its position with sufficient clarity to preserve it for appeal. Particularly given the statement in defendant\u2019s trial memorandum that \u201cthere is no evidence a reasonable person would ever suffer such distress from such conduct,\u201d it was sufficiently clear that, in defendant\u2019s view, the law requires that the plaintiff\u2019s response be objectively reasonable. Accordingly, we turn to the question whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard applies in determining whether severe emotional distress is actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Defendant contends that, in <em>Checkley v. Boyd, </em>198 Or App 110, 131, 107 P3d 651, <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 538 (2005), we adopted comment j to the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46 (1965), which states, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cThe law intervenes only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201cThe distress must be reasonable and justified under the circumstances, and there is no liability where the plaintiff has suffered exaggerated and unreasonable emotional distress, unless it results from a peculiar susceptibility to such distress of which the actor has knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Plaintiff contends that our reference to comment j in <em>Checkley </em>was <em>dictum </em>and that neither we nor the Supreme Court have adopted the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">We need not determine whether either court has previously adopted comment j or, if we have not, whether we should adopt it now. Assuming, without deciding, that the \u201cdistress\u201d element includes a reasonable person standard, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that its conduct would not cause a reasonable person to suffer severe emotional distress. Plaintiff worked for defendant for 16 years \u2014 virtually all of her adult life \u2014 and her ability to continue her job was threatened by a serious injury. She presented evidence that being a productive employee is important to her. She also presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>evidence that her family\u2019s financial stability depended on her ability to continue working. In our view, a reasonable person in plaintiffs circumstances could suffer severe emotional distress as a result of defendant\u2019s demeaning treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"> We turn to defendant\u2019s argument regarding the first element \u2014 intent. Defendant argues that plaintiff failed to establish that any of its conduct was intended to cause severe emotional distress or that defendant knew that its conduct would cause such distress. An intent to inflict distress can reasonably be inferred from much of Marple\u2019s conduct, such as calling plaintiff back from a job on the production floor in order to give her a \u201cshameful\u201d job. Moreover, we have previously held that \u201cthe requisite intent can be inferred from outrageous conduct,\u201d <em>Buckel v. Nunn, </em>133 Or App 399, 404, 891 P2d 16 (1995), and also that intent may be inferred from the extent of the conduct, <em>Mains v. II Morrow, Inc., </em>128 Or App 625, 630-31, 877 P2d 88 (1994). In this case, evidence in the record describes a course of conduct extending over a five-month period. If the jury could find that defendant\u2019s conduct was outrageous, it could properly infer intent to inflict severe emotional distress. Accordingly, we turn to defendant\u2019s argument concerning the third element of plaintiffs IIED claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Defendant argues that, individually and collectively, the specifications of conduct submitted to the jury fall short of the \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d standard required to support liability for IIED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For purposes of this tort, conduct is outrageous if it is \u201cextraordinarily beyond the bounds of socially tolerable behavior.\u201d <em>House, </em>218 Or App at 357. \u201c \u2018Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46 comment d (1965)). Conduct that is \u201crude, boorish, tyrannical, churlish and mean\u201d does not support liability for IIED. <em>Kraemer v. Harding, </em>159 Or App 90, 110, 976 P2d 1160, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 357 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether conduct is an extraordinary transgression is a fact-specific inquiry, based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>House, </em>218 Or App at 358. The totality of the circumstances includes the conduct itself as well as any special relationship of the parties, characteristics of the plaintiff that were known to the defendant, and the setting in which the conduct occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">\u201cThe most important factor is whether a special relationship exists between a plaintiff and a defendant, such as an employer-employee, physician-patient, counselor-client, landlord-tenant, debtor-creditor or government officer-citizen, that shapes the interpersonal dynamics of the parties. A defendant\u2019s relationship to the plaintiff may be one that \u2018imposes on the defendant a greater obligation to refrain from subjecting the victim to abuse, fright, or shock than would be true in arm\u2019s-length encounters among strangers.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or 532, 547-48, 901 P2d 841 (1995)). The fact that conduct occurs in an employment context also bears on the degree of its offensiveness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Plaintiff contends that another factor in the totality of the circumstances is her status as an injured worker. Defendant disputes that contention, arguing that a claim for IIED motivated by injured worker animus is not separately actionable from a claim for workers\u2019 compensation discrimination under ORS 659A.040 to 659A.046. Defendant contends that those statutes provide the exclusive remedy for claims arising from a plaintiffs status as an injured worker and, thus, that the jury could not consider that status with respect to the IIED claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">That is incorrect. ORS 659A.040 provides a remedy for discrimination against a worker \u201cbecause the worker has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>applied for benefits or invoked or utilized the procedures provided for in [the workers\u2019 compensation statutes] or has given testimony under the provisions of those laws.\u201d ORS 659A.043 and ORS 659A.046 provide remedies for failure to reinstate or reemploy a worker who has sustained a compensable injury. Those statutes do not provide a remedy for all tortious conduct that is motivated by the fact that a worker is injured. In particular, as pertinent here, the statutes do not provide a remedy if an employer reinstates an injured worker and then inflicts emotional distress on the worker, not based on the fact that she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, but simply because she is injured. Because those statutes do not provide an adequate remedy for. such conduct, they do not preclude consideration of that status in common-law claims for IIED. <em>Cf. Crosby v. SAIF, </em>73 Or App 372, 374-75, 699 P2d 198 (1985) (ORS 659A.040 (then numbered ORS 659.410) did not preclude a common-law civil conspiracy claim alleging that the defendants conspired to divest the plaintiff of his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because the alleged conduct went beyond what is proscribed by the statute); <em>see also Olsen v. Deschutes County, </em>204 Or App 7, 16, 127 P3d 655 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 80 (2006) (ORS 659A.040 precludes common-law actions based on retaliation for filing workers\u2019 compensation claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Defendant argues that we should not consider plaintiffs status as an injured worker for a second reason. According to defendant, because the jury returned the verdict in its favor on plaintiffs discrimination claim, we must conclude that the jury found that none of defendant\u2019s conduct was motivated by plaintiffs injured status. That is also incorrect. In considering plaintiffs discrimination claim, the jury was not asked to determine whether defendant\u2019s conduct was motivated by the fact that plaintiff was injured. The trial court instructed the jury that, to prevail on that claim, plaintiff had to prove that defendant treated plaintiff as it did \u201cbecause she applied for benefits or used the procedures of the Workers\u2019 Compensation system[.]\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Defendant does not challenge plaintiffs basic proposition \u2014 namely, that some conduct by an employer that might otherwise be tolerable is intolerable if directed at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>worker known to be injured \u2014 and with good reason. It is unremarkable to conclude that calling an injured worker \u201cworthless,\u201d for example, is less tolerable in a civilized community than calling a noninjured worker the same thing. Thus, we conclude that plaintiffs status as an injured worker is part of the totality of the circumstances that we must consider in determining whether a reasonable jury could find that defendant\u2019s conduct was outrageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light of the parties\u2019 16-year employer-employee relationship and plaintiffs status as an injured worker, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>House, </em>218 Or App at 358 (internal quotation marks omitted). Taken individually, the acts that Marple, Rasumssen, and Houghton engaged in might not cross the line, but, given the repetitive nature of the conduct and its duration, a jury could find it as a whole to be intolerable. Of particular importance is the fact that, after five months of persistent and pervasive demeaning treatment by Marple and, to a lesser extent, Rasmussen, plaintiff went to Houghton, defendant\u2019s human resources manager, and told her what she had been enduring, only to have her essentially ratify the conduct by again calling plaintiff \u201cworthless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In short, the trial court did not err in concluding that plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence to send her IIED claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> Profits from the sales went to a fund intended to help the families of employees in financial need.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> Defendant does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-5\"> Defendant and <em>amicus </em>Associated Oregon Industries also argue that plaintiff did not complain about being mistreated to anyone in a position to do something about it \u2014 that is, to anyone in management \u2014 suggesting that allowing an IIED claim to go forward in such circumstances would create undue difficulties for employers. Plaintiff contends that Oregon law does not require an employee to complain to management before asserting an IIED claim against an employer. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>need not resolve that issue, because the record does not support the factual premise on which defendant and <em>amicus </em>rely \u2014 namely, that defendant did not complain to anyone in management. Plaintiff testified, \u201cProbably on a daily basis I talked to Mike Calkins about how I was being treated.\u201d Plaintiff described Calkins as her \u201cshift manager.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel read into the record testimony that Calkins gave in a prior proceeding, in which he also stated that he was a manager. Thus, there is evidence that plaintiff did indeed complain to management.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> In support of its position, defendant points out that the trial court struck plaintiffs claim for punitive damages, a ruling to which plaintiff does not assign error. Defendant argues that there is a nearly complete overlap of the elements that support punitive damages and the elements of IIED. Accordingly, defendant contends, the inability of plaintiffs evidence to support punitive damages in the eyes of the trial court strongly suggests that the court erred in denying the motion for a directed verdict on the IIED claim. We disagree. To be sure, in the face of seemingly inconsistent rulings, it is reasonable to assume that one of the rulings is incorrect. However, the fact that one of the rulings is not challenged on appeal does not bear on the correctness of the other ruling. We therefore do not consider the trial court\u2019s ruling on the punitive damages claim in analyzing plaintiffs IIED claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
