TriMet, </em>222 Or App 293, 195 P3d 389 (2008). We allow the petition for reconsideration. We write to briefly address only one of TriMet\u2019s arguments and reject the others without discussion. We adhere to our decision as issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">TriMet contends that, in our opinion, when construing the pertinent United States Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, we failed to give adequate deference to a letter written by the Deputy Assistant General Counsel for DOT\u2019s Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy Compliance. TriMet points out that a federal agency\u2019s opinion on the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to great weight. <em>See Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala, </em>512 US 504, 512, 114 S Ct 2381, 129 L Ed 2d 405 (1994) (an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation). However, TriMet does not actually challenge our interpretation of the pertinent regulations. Instead, it appears to take the position that we erroneously concluded that it was the collector, not grievant, who terminated the test early.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The basis for TriMet\u2019s position is not entirely clear. To the extent that TriMet argues that we were required to defer to the view of the facts that DOT\u2019s counsel evidently took, TriMet cites no authority for that position, and we are aware of none. To the extent that TriMet argues that our view of the facts is not supported by the record before us, we disagree. The arbitrator expressly found that \u201cgrievant was not given a full three hour period of time to provide an adequate sample of urine.\u201d That finding indicates that the collector, not grievant, terminated the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">TriMet disputes that factual finding. It relies on grievant\u2019s testimony at the arbitration hearing, asserting that her testimony shows that it was, in fact, <em>grievant </em>who terminated the test. The problem with TriMet\u2019s argument is that grievant\u2019s testimony is not part of the record on judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>review. The Employment Relations Board excluded the transcript of the arbitration hearing from the record. Although TriMet assigned error to the ruling excluding that evidence, it made no argument in support of that assignment, so we rejected it without comment. Because grievant\u2019s testimony is not part of the record before us, we do not consider it on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Petition for reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
