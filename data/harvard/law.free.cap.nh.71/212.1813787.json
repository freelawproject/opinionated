Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the May term, 1901, of the superior court by <em>Young, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-12\">The plaintiff testified without objection that he ran a small baggage express, and that he owned but one horse, for whose death he sought to recover in the action. In his closing argument counsel for the plaintiff said: [\u201cI do not ask for a verdict for my client because he is a poor man,] nor because the city is rich and powerful. I only ask for a verdict if he is entitled to one under the law and the evidence.\u201d The defendants excepted to the words, enclosed in brackets, on the ground that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was a poor man.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-13\"><em>Edwin 3.

So far as having effect upon the jury, the situation was practically as if it had appeared in express terms that the plaintiff was \u201c poor \u201d and the defendants \u201crich and powerful.\u201d The disproportion in power and resource being already before the jury, the remark of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his closing argument,\u2014 \u201c I do not ask for a verdict for my client because he is a poor man, nor because the city is rich and powerful; I only ask for a verdict if he is entitled to one under the law and the evidence,\u201d \u2014 was, certainly if counsel was taken at his word, calculated to promote rather than prevent a fair trial Such may not have been the motive for tbe remarkTlfltKough it is not inconceivable that, in order to appeal more effectively to the judgment of the jury upon the merits of the case, counsel may have thought it would be the part of wise advocacy to disdain all questionable considerations and methods. However, we cannot say that the remark was \u201cso inconsistent with legal fairness of trial as to make it a matter of law that there should be a new trial.\u201d <em>Aldrich </em>v. Railroad, 67 N.
