Plea, the general issue, with a brief statement claiming damages by way of recoupment for breach of contract on the part of the plaintiff. Facts found, and case transferred from the May term, 1901, of the superior court, by <em>Pike, </em>J, In October, 1899, the parties entered into an agreement whereby the plaintiff was to cut, saw, and stick all the lumber on the defendants\u2019 \u201cBrown lot\u201d in Greenfield. The plaintiff understood that he was to receive $3.65 per thousand for the work, the amount of lumber cut to be determined by the measure of the purchaser; and that $3.25 per thousand according to his sawmill measure should be paid him on account at the end of each fortnight\u2019s work. The defendants -understood as the plaintiff did, except that the payments on account were to be made only upon completion of each hundred thousand feet. The provision for payments on account constituted a material consideration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s agreement. It was necessary that he should receive payments every two weeks in order that he might pay his help; and if they were not made as often as this, they were not made within a reasonable time. It was also a material consideration of the defendants\u2019 agreement that the plaintiff should cut, saw, and stick all of the lumber upon the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">The plaintiff worked upon the lot from November 18, 1899, to January 15, 1900. January 1, he demanded a payment of $243, claiming that he had then sawed 175,000 feet, on account of which he had received $325. January 4, he was paid $200. If the parties had agreed as the plaintiffs claimed, there was due him at this time about $243.75; but if they had agreed as the defendants claimed, there was nothing then due him. The court found that the minds of the parties did not meet as to when the pay-ments on account should be made, and, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, allowed the plaintiff to recover for labor and services, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">For cutting, sawing, etc., 210,497 feet, at .$3.65 per thousand ........ $768.31</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXi\">Less amount received on account .... 525.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\">$243.31</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">Interest from date of the writ . . . . . 32.80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\">Total . ........$276.11</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-11\"><em>James F.

This is vital to its existence. There can be none where it is wanting. Where there is a misunderstanding as to anything material, the requisite mutuality of assent as to such thing is wanting; consequently the supposed contract does not exist, and neither party is bound. In the view of the law in such case, there has been only a negotiation resulting in a failure to agree. What has occurred is as if it were not, and the rights of the parties are to be determined accordingly.\u201d <em>Utley </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>94 U. S. 29; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>101 U. S. 43; <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>48 N. H. 203, 206; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>51 N. H. 85, 93; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>68 N. H. 411; <em>Concord Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Fer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>rin, ante, p. </em>33; <em>Hartford etc. R. R. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>24 Conn. 514; 1 Par. Cont. (4th ed.) 399b; 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d ed.) 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">But it does not follow that the plaintiff was without remedy for services performed under the supposed contract. He was entitled to recover of the defendants what his labor and services were reasonably worth, deducting what he liad received. This was the view entertained in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Stove Co., </em>63 Conn. 356, where the court said : \u201c If there was an honest mistake by the parties as to what the contract really was, the plaintiff understanding it as claimed by him, and tire defendant understanding it as claimed by its counsel, there was then no meeting of the minds of the parties, and hence no contract; and in such case the plaintiff would be entitled to recover of the defendant, for the work done by him and such materials as he furnished in the work at its request, such a sum as they would be reasonably worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Van Deusen </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>13 Pick. 229, \u201429 Am. Dee. 582, the result was announced as follows : \u201c The plaintiff's undertook to execute a contract between themselves and the company. But there being no such contract in existence, they are left to resort to their equitable claim for their labor and materials. So far as these benefited the company, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover against them.\u201d See, also, <em>Norris </em>v. <em>School District, </em>12 Me. 293,\u2014 28 Am. Dec. 182; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>24 Kan. 38,\u2014 36 Am. Rep. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The principle is well stated by <em>Brewer, </em>L, in the case last cited: \u201cWebster never assented to a contract to work for $1.50 a day. He agreed to do a certain work, and did it, but his understanding was that he was to receive $3 per day. Turner &amp; Otis employed him to do that work, and\u2019knew that he did it; but their understanding was that they were to pay but $1.50 a day. . . . What, then, should result ? Should he receive nothing because there was no mutual assent to the compensation? That were manifest injustice. Should his understanding bind both parties ? That were a wrong to them. Should theirs control? That were an equal wrong to him. The law, discarding both, says a reasonable compensation must be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The same principle underlies the decisions in this jurisdiction. <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>6 N. H. 481; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>51 N. H. 594; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>58 N. H. 333. The principle seems as sound in reason as it is well supported by authority. The action of the superior court, to which the defendants excepted, was in accordance with this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\n<em>Hxcepition overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
