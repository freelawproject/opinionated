One of the appellants is a child of a sister of Alzina\u2019s father, and the other a child of a brother of her mother. The decree was in favor of Mary B. Lewis and Francina C. Towns, two sisters of her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-13\">Dexter Bradford and Lucinda T. Bradford of Charlestown died leaving estate in that town. In March and May, 1900, shortly after their decease, Alzina, their only child, was appointed administratrix of each estate by the probate court for Sullivan county. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>There is no record of any further action by her in the administration of the estates. In July, 1900, Alzina died, and administration was taken upon her estate in Cheshire county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">The appellants allege that they are aggrieved because the estates of Dexter and Lucinda were not settled according to law before the settlement of Alzina\u2019s estate, because said estates were settled in the administration of Alzina\u2019s and decreed to Lewis and Towns, and because the estate of Alzina, enlarged by the estates of Dexter and Lucinda, has been decreed to Lewis and Towns, and no part to the appellants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">At the October term, 1901, of the superior court the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted by Young, J., and the appellants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-7\"><em>Don H.

P. S., <em>c. </em>196, s. 1, <em>cl. </em>IV; <em>Ib., s. </em>6.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The right of either of the appellants, if any, to a distributive share in the estate of Alzina\u2019s father or in that of her mother is not involved in the distribution of her estate, and will not be determined by any judgment which can be rendered in this proceeding. If, however, as stated in the case, Alzina was an only child, no ground is apparent upon which any person except creditors of her father or of her mother can claim to be aggrieved because the record fails to show the details of the completion of her administration of their estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
