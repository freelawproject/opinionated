We desire to save you the annoyance of vexatious lawsuits and to make speedy settlements of claims made against you by your employees and others. This we can only do satisfactorily by being able to investigate an accident while the facts are fresh in the memory of tbe witnesses and before tbe conditions under which the accident happened are changed. We wish, therefore, that you would instruct your superintendents and foremen, immediately on the happening of an accident, to notify ns on the blanks enclosed with the policy, and telephone or telegraph onr attorneys, Dickson &amp; Knowles,\u2014 telephone number, 3150 Boston,\u2014 at their expense, and they will at once .send a person to make an investigation.

On the same day, J. G. Brown, above mentioned, sent a letter t\u00f3 tbe defendants\u2019 resident managers at Boston, saying: \u201cA man at work for Ward &amp; Douglass in some way jumped off tbe third story of the building that they are tearing down, and struck on a pile of brick and injured him to some extent, and he is now at the hospital. ... 1 cannot tell you just now what made him jump, but understand that one story is that he made a misstep and jumped to save himself from falling : and another story is that he thought that a timber was going to fall on liim, and in some way in getting out of the way of it got so near as to require him to jump to prevent falling. I have no blanks to report this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>so give you this notice and will have blank filled out as soon as received.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel, by a letter dated May 22, addressed to the plaintiffs, acknowledged the receipt of \u201c a letter from the insurance agent, Jos. G. Brown, informing us that a man in your employ was injured,\u201d etc., and enclosed a blank report with a request that the plaintiffs would fill it out, and sign and return it at once. The plaintiffs filled out, signed, and returned the blank. It was dated May 22, and the defendants\u2019 counsel, under date of May 24, acknowledged its receipt. To the question in the blank, \u201c How did the accident happen ? (Give full details, describing machinery, tools, staging, etc., in connection therewith. If possible give rough sketch),\u201d the answer was: \u201cLost his balance on the side of the building and jumped off on to pile of brick below.\u201d To other questions they made answers to the effect that the accident was not due to want of ordinary care on the part of the injured person or of any. other person. In the counsel\u2019s letter of May 24, acknowledging the receipt of the report, they say : \u201c The \u25a0facts as set forth in the report are not sufficiently full to enable us to obtain a very clear idea as to the exact cause of the accident. 'Can you throw any additional light on this ? From the letter that we received from Mr. Brown ... it would appear that possibly the cause of O\u2019Connell\u2019s jumping was that he thought that something was going to fall on him, and he jumped to get out of the way. Kindly give us any additional information that you may have which would throw light upon this point.\u201d The plaintiffs not replying to this letter, the counsel wrote them again under date of June 13, calling attention to the delaj and asking them to give the matter their attention. The plaintiffs replied, June 17, .as follows: \u201c Replying to your communication, would say that Mr. O\u2019Connell jumped from building thinking some timbers were to strike him. He is still in the hospital here at Montpelier, and Ins recovery is still in doubt.\u201d In a letter dated June 27, the \u2022counsel acknowledged the receipt of this letter, and said: \u201cWe are not as yet in possession of enough particulars to enable us to form a very accurate opinion as to just how this accident happened, or to pass upon the question of your liability. . . . Do you know whether or not any timbers actually fell, or, if it apqjeared that timbers were to fall, what was the reason of their so doing, \u25a0and if the circumstances justified O\u2019Connell in doing as he did? It is probable that there were other workmen present at the time \u25a0who could throw light on this matter, and we wish you would get from them an accurate statement as to just what occurred immediately before and at the time that O\u2019Connell jumped.\u201d The plaintiffs made no reply to this letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">O\u2019Connell begun an action against the plaintiffs to recover dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>-ages for liis injuries, July 2, 1900. The writ was served upon one of the plaintiff's on August 2, and upon the other on August 22, and was returnable at the term of the supreme court for Grafton county which begun September 18. In a letter to the defendants\u2019 counsel, dated August 20, the plaintiffs said: \u201c Patrick O\u2019Connell has sued us in the sum of \u00bf5,000 for the accident that he met with here. I3o you wish us to make any move toward a settlement of the matter with him?\u201d September 17, the plaintiffs telegraphed the counsel that the O\u2019Connell suit was in the Grafton county court, which would open the next day. September 19, the plaintiffs wrote the counsel, saying that the suit must receive immediate attention, requesting them to telegraph on receipt of the letter whether they were going to attend to the suit, and saying that if they did not the plaintiffs would have to hire attorneys. The counsel replied by telegram on September 20: \u201cYou must pi'otect yourselves through attorney in O\u2019Connell suit until we get authority from insurance company to defend you. New Hampshire court probably has no jurisdiction over you. Your attorney should take advantage of that fact.\u201d Under date of September 21, they wrote the plaintiffs as follows: \u201cFor the purpose merely of ascertaining how you happened to be sued in New Hampshire, and whether that court has any jurisdiction over you in the case of O\u2019Connell, we have sent the matter to Jewell, Owen &amp; Yeazey, of Laconia, N II. They will make some inquiries of you, and we wish you would give them all the information that they desire, promptly. We wish it distinctly understood that in taking\u2019 action in this matter we are doing so without authority from the insurance company and without prejudice to the rights of the company under its policy, merely so that no disaster may happen to you through a default. As soon as we have heai'd from Jewell, Owen &amp; Yeazey and from the insurance company, rve will communicate with you further. It is possible that the company will take up the defence of the case, but we cannot in any way commit them. We will submit the facts to them and await their instructions.\u201d Under date of September 22, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants\u2019 counsel that, on the strength of their telegram, the plaintiffs employed counsel to appear for them in the suit before the receipt of the letter relating to the employment of Jewell, Owen &amp; Yeazey, and instructed the counsel to procure a continuance of the case. In a letter to the plaintiffs, dated September 18 and received September 28, the defendants\u2019 counsel acknowledged the receipt of the plaintiffs\u2019 telegram of September 17, and said: \u201cOn August 20 you wrote us that suit had been brought. We immediately wrote you directing that the summons in the suit bo sent us at once in order that we might take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>proper steps to defend you. We have always had much difficulty in getting you to answer our correspondence. Our papers show numerous instances of failure on your part to do this. We do-not know what state your case is in on account of your neglect to-send us the proper papers as directed. If any of your rights have been lost by the delay, it is your own fault. We should advise you to notify your own attorney of the condition in which your suit is; and we again request you to send us the paper or papers that were served upon you, upon receipt of which we will, notify the insurance company. In sending for these papers again at this late date we do not in any way prejudice the rights of the insurance company, but merely send for them so that we may notify them of the situation, and so that they may take such action as they see fit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">October 9, the defendants\u2019 counsel wrote the plaintiffs that they were instructed by the defendants to disclaim all liability in the case for several reasons, one being the neglect of the plaintiffs to notify the counsel \u201c at the beginning of the suit according to the terms of the policy.\u201d The counsel further say: \u201cIf you desire, we will defend the case; but the insurance company will not pay any verdict that may be rendered. You have a perfect right to control your case as you see <em>fit; </em>but unless we hear from you to-the contrary, we shall continue in the defence with the above understanding.\u201d Jewell, Owen &amp; Veazey appeared in the case for Ward &amp; Douglass, but were at the same time attorneys for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The defendants received no other information than that disclosed in the foregoing correspondence and report until their attorneys investigated the case after it was entered in court. Ward testified that he gave the defendants all the information that he had concerning the accident and claim for damages, and that lie-had had trouble with other insurance companies and thought it best not to write any more letters than were necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">The court <em>pro forma </em>ruled that the correspondence and telegrams were a substantial compliance with the conditions of the policy, and found for the plaintiffs, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>Scott Sloarn </em>and <em>Gfeorge F. </em>Morris, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-9\">Jewell, <em>Owen &amp; Veazey, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-10\">Chase, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOV\">The defendants\u2019 liability depends in part upon the answer to the question, whether the plaintiffs gave them \u201c immediate \u201d notice in writing of O\u2019Connell\u2019s accident, the claim made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>on account of it, and the suit that was brought to enforce the claim. This involves an ascertainment of the meaning of the word \u201c immediate \u201d as used in the policy. The word, when relating to time, is defined in the Century Dictionary as follows: \u201cWithout any time intervening; without any delay; present; instant; often used like similar absolute expressions, with less strictness than the literal meaning requires; as, an immediate answer.\u201d It is evident that the word was not used in this contract in its literal sense. It would generally be impossible to give notice hi writing of a fact the instant it occurred. It cannot be presumed that the parties intended to introduce into the contract a provision that would render the contract nugatory. As \u201cimmediate \u201d was understood by them, it allowed the intervention of a period of time between the occurrence of the fact and the giving of notice more or less lengthy according to the circumstances. The object of the notice was one of the circumstances to be considered. If it was to enable the defendants to take steps for their protection that must necessarily be taken soon after the occurrence of the fact of which notice was to be given, a briefer time would be required to render the notice immediate according to the understanding of the parties than would be required if the object could be equally well attained after considerable delay. For example, a delay of weeks in giving notice of the commencement of the employee\u2019s suit against the plaintiffs might not prejudice the defendants in preparing for a defence of the action, while a much shorter delay in giving notice of the accident might prevent them from ascertaining the truth about it. The parties intended by the language used that the notice in each case should be given so soon after the fact transpired that, in view of all the circumstances, it would be reasonably immediate. If a notice is given \u201c with due diligence under the circumstances of the case and without unnecessary and unreasonable delay,\u201d it will answer the requirements of the contract. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>55 N. H. 249, 265, 268; May Ins. (1st ed.), s. 462; <em>Ib. </em>(4th ed.), s. 462; <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>56 Vt, 374; <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Assurance Co., </em>47 Conn. 553, 568. Whether the notices were reasonably immediate,\u2014 like the kindred question of what is a reasonable time,\u2014 are questions of fact that must be determined in the superior court. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>43 N. H. 147, 151; <em>State </em>v. <em>Plaisted, </em>43 N. H. 413; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., supra, </em>265; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>61 N. H. 97; <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>70 N. H. 163, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">The defendants further allege that the plaintiffs did not give full particulars of the accident. The provision of the contract requiring full particulars did not call for unnecessary details, but only such as would enable the defendants to determine whether a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>. claim was likely to be made against the plaintiffs. Nor did it call upon the plaintiffs to make an exhaustive investigation of the circumstances attending the accident, or to decide what the facts were upon a consideration of conflicting evidence. The request, made by the defendants\u2019 resident managers in Boston of persons insured in the company, that they would notify the defendants\u2019 .attorneys by telegraph or telephone of an accident, so that they might send a person at once to make an investigation, shows that the defendants so understood the matter. The purpose of the .notice was to put the defendants upon inquiry rather than to give them full information concerning the accident. Whether the particulars furnished by the plaintiffs were sufficiently full under the circumstances to answer the requirement of the policy, is also a question of fact to be determined in the superior court. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 69 N. H. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The provision in the third condition of the policy, that the assured when requested by the company shall aid in securing in.formation and evidence, is of a similar nature, and should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the foregoing vieys.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">To the defendants\u2019 claim that their liability under the policy was ended by the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to forward to the defendants\u2019 counsel the summons or paper served upon the plaintiffs in the O\u2019Connell action immediately after service, in compliance with the \u25a0counsel\u2019s request, it is a sufficient answer that there is no provision in the policy making such failure a cause of forfeiture of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Such failure would be competent evidence on the question whether the plaintiffs reasonably aided the defendants in securing information concerning the action. Its weight would depend upon the circumstances, and must be determined by the tribunal charged with the duty of deciding questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The court ruled <em>pro forma </em>that the correspondence and telegrams were a substantial conqfliance with the conditions of the policy, and found for the plaintiffs. If this means that the questions were treated as matters of law, there was error in the course .adopted and the finding must be set aside. If it means that upon a consideration of the correspondence and telegrams it was found -as a fact that there was a substantial compliance with the condition of the policy, the only additional question of law raised by the defendants\u2019 exception is whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant such a finding. The evidence was ample. Not to mention any other testimony, the request made by the defendants\u2019 \u2022counsel of the plaintiffs, about August 20, 1900,\u2014 fifteen months after the accident and fourteen months after the last request for further information concerning the accident,\u2014 that the plaintiffs would send the summons in the O\u2019Connell action to the counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in order that they might take the proper steps to defend the plaintiffs, very strongly shows that the defendants did not understand that their liability had ceased because of any prior failure of the plaintiffs to comply with the requirements of the policy. It was a practical admission that the prior efforts of the plaintiffs to fulfill the terms of the policy had been reasonable both as to form and seasonableness. Apparently, the defendants then had full information concerning all the facts covered by the admission, except perhaps the date when O\u2019ConncH\u2019s action was begun. A finding that a notice of the beginning of the suit, given eighteen days after the service of the writ upon one of the plaintiffs and two days before its service upon the other, was \u201c immediate \u201d within the meaning of the word as used in the policy, would not be unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The general finding in favor of the plaintiffs is understood to include a finding of all facts in their favor that are necessary to support the general finding, and so to include findings favorable to them upon the questions of fact above mentioned. The <em>pro forma </em>ruling is understood to have related to the facts so found. Accordingly, unless the defendants procure an amendment of the case showing that this construction is erroneous, their exception must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled nisi.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
