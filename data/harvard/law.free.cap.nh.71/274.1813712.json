Seward, to avoid as preferences certain orders given by the bankrupt upon Hall, Langdon, and Nickerson, to John H. Sugden and others as the Portsmouth Milling Company, within four months before the filing of his petition; to restrain the defendants in the bill in equity from further prosecuting certain actions at law against the acceptors to enforce payment of \"the orders; and asking that the parties upon whom the orders were given be directed to pay the amounts in their hands due the bankrupt to the trustee. Transferred from the October term, 1901, of the superior court by Young, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">Seward did business as a contractor and builder, under the name of Cowan &amp; Seward and George W. Seward &amp; Co., and the orders in question were signed \u201c Everett Cowan and George W. Seward.\u201d Cowan had nothing to do with the business; and the Sugdens knew the fact, and did not rely on Cowan when they furnished the materials in payment for which the orders were given. Neither Cowan nor the firm of Cowan &amp; Seward has been decreed bankrupt. The Sugdens knew that Seward was insolvent when the orders were given, and had reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the orders was to give them a preference over other creditors. The court found that the orders in question were preferences within the meaning of the bankruptcy act, and ordered judgment for the defendants in the suits at law and for the plaintiff in the bill in equity, and the Sugdens excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">While the orders were accepted unconditionally, it was understood between the Sugdens and the acceptors that they were only to be paid out of money which might thereafter become due. Subject to the Sugdens\u2019 exception, the defendants in the suits at law were permitted to show by parol that they accepted the orders unconditionally by mistake; and Marden was permitted to show in the same way that Cowan was not in fact a partner with Seward, and had no interest in the contracts with Hall, Langdon, and Nickerson.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-8\"><em>John W. </em>Kelley, for Marden, trustee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-9\"><em>Samuel W. </em>Emery, for Sugden and others.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-10\"><em>Edward H.

B\u2019k\u2019cy Act, <em>ss. </em>60a, 60b. It follows that the orders were voidable by the trustee, and that judgment was properly ordered for the defendants in the suits at law and for the plaintiff trustee in the bill in equity <em>(II., s. </em>60b; <em>Pirie </em>v. <em>Company, </em>182 U. S. 438; <em>Landry </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Am. B\u2019k\u2019cy Rep. 281), unless error was committed in the proceedings. The only errors alleged are: (1) That subject to the Sugdens\u2019 exception the defendants in the suits at law were permitted to show by parol that they accepted the orders unconditionally by mistake; (2) that the plaintiff in the bill in equity was permitted to show in the same way that Cowan was not in fact a partner with Seward and had no interest in the contract with either Hall, Langdon, or Nickerson.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">As to the first exception, it is only necessary to say that it was wholly immaterial to the Sugdens whether the orders were accepted conditionally or unconditionally,\u2014 for a greater or less sum,\u2014 since, as already shown, the orders were entirely without effect as against the plaintiff trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Tbe second exception discloses no error. As trustee for the individual creditors of Seward, it was the duty of Marden to gather in all the individual assets properly belonging to the bankrupt estate of Seward. He was not bound to assume that credits nominally partnership were so in truth. If otherwise in fact, it was not only his right but his duty to show it; and parol evidence was clearly admissible for this purpose, certainly as between himself and the Sugdens, who, it is found, knew that the partnership existed only in name, and contracted relying solely upon the credit of Seward.
