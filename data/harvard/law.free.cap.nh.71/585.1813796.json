Evidence that a gift absolute in terms was made in apprehension of death warrants the inference that it was conditional, and hence ineffectual as a gift <em>inter vivos ; </em>and evidence that death ensued from a peril subsequently incurred, is sufficient to support a finding that it was invalid as a gift <em>causa mortis.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b615-12\"><em>A </em>gift <em>causa mortis </em>cannot be enforced unless established in the manner required by statute.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-13\">Bill oe Interpleader. Trans\u00ed erred from the February term, 1902, of the superior coui't by <em>Stone, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-14\">The petitioner, a physician, was called to attend Rodney Cross about five o'clock in the afternoon of February 15, 1901. [\u2019pon the arrival of the physician, Cross inquired who had- sent for him, and said lie was not sick. After the physician had proceeded with an examination, Cross stated he had taken laudanum; that if it did not kill him, lie had something which would kill him quickly; that he had lived as long as he wanted to, and was not going to live any longer. Stimulants and antidotes were adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tered,. During the visit and while the physician was alone with Cross, the latter, who was in his right mind, took a package from his clothing and said, \u201c Here\u2019s a package I want you to deliver to Annie Cross,\u201d meaning the claimant, who at the time was living in Worcester, Mass. The physician took the package with him when he left the house, and retained possession of it until the trial of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">After the physician had gone, Cross took nitric acid, and died between six and seven o\u2019clock the same evening. The evidence tended to show that his death was caused by nitric acid and not by laudanum. The testimony was, that when the physician made his visit it was his opinion that Cross had not taken sufficient laudanum to cause his death; that he would not have died so quickly from laudanum; that after the administration of the antidotes there was no reason for his death from the poison he had already taken ; and that he would recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">The package contained $190 in bank bills and the petitioner\u2019s note for $1,200, dated August 5, 1901, payable to Cross without interest.

Whatever doubt may have existed at one time in this state as to the kind of property capable of passing by delivery, to be valid as a gift (<em>Gale </em>v. Drake, 51 N. H. 78, 82; <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>33 N. H. 520, 522; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Goodhue, </em>28 N. H. 48, 56), it now appears by the reported decisions that land may be the subject of a parol gift, and that equity will compel a conveyance of the legal title if the donee has taken possession and made valuable improvements <em>(Seavey </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>62 N. H. 393); and that chattels <em>(Cutting </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>41 N. H. 147), bank notes and municipal bonds <em>(Emery </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>63 N. H. 552), specie and unindorsed negotiable notes of a third person <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>18 N. H. 360; <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>21 N. H. 491, 512), and an unassigned certificate of membership in a relief association <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Mansur, </em>64 N. H. 39, 40), may be transferred by delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">A written assignment is no more essential to give effect to a gift than to a sale of a chose in action. By delivery and accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>anee of the security, an equitable interest vests in the donee; and the donor or his legal representatives, in whom the legal interest or title remains, are mere trustees for the donee, and bound to permit the donee to use his or their names to enforce payment of the obligation. <em>Parish </em>v. Stone, 14 Pick. 198; <em>Grover </em>v. Grover, 24 Pick. 261; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>13 Gray 418; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Savings-Bank, </em>129 Mass. 325; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>16 R. 1. 663; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>18 Conn. 410; <em>Grymes v. Hone, </em>49 N. Y. 17; <em>Druke </em>v. <em>Heiken, </em>61 Cal. 846; <em>Basket </em>v. <em>Hassell, </em>107 U. S. 602. The money and the unassigned note stand upon the same ground. Both are susceptible of being presented as a gift by delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u2022In this case it is important to keep in mind the elements essential to a gift <em>causa mortis </em>and a gift <em>inter vivos. </em>To establish the former, it must appear that the gift was made by the donor during an illness or impending peril of such a nature as to cause him to apprehend death therefrom; and while it is not a legal requisite that he should die of the disease or peri] from which he apprehends death, he must not recover from it, and his death must result from a disease or peril existing or impending at the time the gift was made. <em>Cutting </em>v. Gilman, 41 N. H. 147; <em>Kenistons </em>v. <em>Sceva, </em>54 N. H. 24, 37; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Might, </em>17 Me. 287; <em>Parcher </em>v. <em>Savings Inst., </em>78 Me. 470, 473; <em>Larrabee </em>v. Hascall, 88 Me. 511; <em>Irish </em>v. <em>Nutting, </em>47 Barb. 370; <em>Grymes </em>v. <em>Hone, supra; Ridden </em>v. Thrall, 12.5 N. Y. 572. A vague impression that death may occur is not sufficient. The donor must be in a condition to fear approaching death from an existing illness or peril. <em>Dexheimer </em>v. <em>Gautier, </em>34 How. Pr. 472; <em>Gourley </em>v. <em>Linsenbigler, </em>51 Pa. St. 345; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>38 Xnd. 451; Thorn. Gifts &amp; Adv., ss. 27, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u201cSuch gifts are always made upon condition that they shall be revocable during the lifetime of the donor, arid that they shall revest in case he shall survive the donee, or shall be delivered from the peril of death in which they are made.\u201d The title to the property passes by the delivery in the donor\u2019s lifetime, and becomes perfected in the donee by the death of the donor, which terminates his \u201cright or power of defeasance.\u201d <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Clough, supra. </em>\u201cIt is not necessary that the donor should declare the condition\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Guile, </em>117 N. Y. 343, 849), by \u201can express qualification in the transfer or the delivery. It may be found to be such a gift from tbe attending circumstances, though tbe written transfer and tbe delivery may be absolute.\u201d <em>Grymes </em>v. <em>Hone, supra; Staniland </em>v. <em>Willott, </em>3 McN. &amp; G. 664. It has been said to be \u201calways implied when the gift is made in tbe extremity of sickness, or in contemplation of death.\u201d <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Clough, supra. </em>\u201cIt is a question resting ... in understanding and intention; . . . a question of fact.\u201d <em>Kenistons </em>v. <em>Sceva, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Therefore, when the gift is made during an illness or impending peril such as to cause the donor to apprehend death therefrom, though the transfer or delivery may be in terms absolute, the attending circumstances are such, nothing further appearing, that the condition may be inferred as a matter of fact; and being a question of fact, these circumstances may be overcome by evidence disclosing that the donor intended that the gift should be absolute. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>64 Pa. St. 18, 23; <em>Senschel </em>v. <em>Maurer, </em>69 Wis. 576, 579; Thorn. Gifts &amp; Adv., <em>ss. </em>21, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The distinguishing feature of a gift <em>inter vivos </em>is, that it is unconditional, and goes into immediate and absolute effect. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>42 N. H. 114, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In both classes of cases the delivery may be to a third person for the benefit of the donee; but in the latter class it must appear that by such delivery the donor intended to part with all control and dominion over the property. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>62 N. H. 69; <em>Blasdel </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>52 N. H. 238, 243; <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Clough, supra. </em>And if the gift is beneficial to the donee, its acceptance will be presumed and the gift complete. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>67 N. H. 385, 389; <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Perkins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">It is for the superior court to weigh evidence and draw conclusions of fact; and assuming that the trial justice, in ordering the property in question turned over to the executor, intended thereby to make a general finding of fact and not a mere ruling of law, the question here presented is, whether there is evidence in the case from which he was warranted in finding that the transaction could not take effect as a gift of either class.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">There was evidence that the donor, at the time the gift was made, had taken laudanum and apprehended death. From these circumstances, the conclusion'could have been drawn that the gift was conditional, and this notwithstanding the donor then declared that it was his purpose to kill himself,\u2014 evidence disclosing an intention to part with the property for all time, and that his love of life and desire to retain the property had ceased. There was .also evidence that his death was caused by nitric acid, in which case it was not the result of a peril existing at the time the gift was made, but of one subsequently incurred, and therefore an element essential to a gift <em>causa mortis </em>was lacking. Or it may have been found that his death was the result of the combined effect of the laudanum and the nitric acid; and if so, it might be inferred that it Avas intended as a gift <em>causa mortis, </em>but not being established as required by section 18, chapter 186, of the Public Statutes, it could not be enforced. As there was evidence from which the gift may have been found to be conditional, it could not take effect as a gift <em>inter vivos. </em>If, howev\u00e9r, the order was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>intended as a mere ruling of law, tlie parties should be permitted to have such questions of fact determined in the superior court as may be necessary to a proper disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>_Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
