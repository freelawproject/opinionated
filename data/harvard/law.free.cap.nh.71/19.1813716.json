Tried by a referee, and transferred from the October term, 1900, of the supreme court by <em>Parsons, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>July 26, 1896, one Andrews was the owner of the newspaper,, and before that date he began publishing the advertisement in question under a verbal contract with the defendant, by the terms-of which the publication was to be continued until forbidden by the defendant. July 15, 1897, Andrews sold to the plaintiff his-publishing business, including his account against the defendant, the amount of which has. been paid into court. Soon after that date the defendant notified Andrews to discontinue the advertise\u25a0ment. The latter informed him that he had sold the paper to the plaintiff, whom he ought to notify of the discontinuance. The plaintiff was not notified by any one, and in good faith continued the publication until May 4, 1898. The defendant did not know of the publication of the advertisement after July 15, although he regularly received a copy of the paper and might easily have ascertained the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-3\">Judgment was ordered on the report for the plaintiff for the amount paid into court and costs to the date of the confession, and for the defendant for costs since that date, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-4\"><em>Jesse F.

One of his rights was that he might terminate the executory contract at any time by notice to Andrews, the other contracting party. About the time of the sale he notified Andrews, to discontinue the advertisement, in ignorance of the fact of the sale. The plaintiff had not notified him of it, as it was his duty to do <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Fmery, </em>27 N. H. 26 9, 272), and the defendant\u2019s right to terminate the contract by notice to Andrews was-unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">By the notice the contract was terminated, and the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent publication of the advertisement, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, did not raise an implied promise on the part of the latter to pay therefor <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>20 N.
