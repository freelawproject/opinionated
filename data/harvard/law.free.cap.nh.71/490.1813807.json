The defendant answered, \u201c No.\u201d In the closing argument to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney referred to his interview with the defendant, and said: \u201cYou may consider whether I should be apt to ask that question if there was not some foundation for it. You also have a right to consider the witness\u2019 manner when he answered the question.\u201d The defendant excepted to the first of these assertions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-10\"><em>Prank M.

The defendant would then have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and might possibly be able to satisfy the jury that his testimony was untrue, or not entitled to as much weight as that of the defendant. At any rate, the testimony would go before the jury under the safeguards of an oath and the privilege of cross-examination. But instead of taking this course, the attorney asked the jury to draw from the fact that he asked the defendant a question covering the statement, the inference that the defendant made the statement. Although not sworn as a witness, he gave testimony which contradicted the defendant, and the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine him. His conduct had a strong tendency to render the trial unfair, and was not justifiable on any ground. He took no steps to prevent it from having its natural effect. Consequently, his client must suffer the delay and expense of another trial. <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>64 N.
