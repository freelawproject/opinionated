The plaintiff excepted to the testimony of the committee showing these facts. They testified without ob-' jection that the value of the fee of what was set off for the homestead was not over $500, and that the income of what they set off as the widow\u2019s dower was not more than one third of that of the whole property. The plaintiff then claimed that this was an answer to the objection that the committee had erroneously construed the law, and excepted to a ruling declining to consider the question of value upon this branch of the case. After a hearing, the appeal was dismissed, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-3\"><em>Greorge R.

P. S., <em>c. </em>197, <em>s. </em>3; H<em>armon </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>68 N. H. 28, 29, 31. Upon the return of the report it is within his province to determine (1) whether the proceedings of the committee were regular or irregular, and (2) whether in their findings of fact they acted in good faith or otherwise. His decree accepting or rejecting the report is not final; the right of appeal in both eases is given by statute. P. S., <em>c. </em>200, ss. 1, 2; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>62 N. H. 630, 631. If he decrees an acceptance of the report, and, upon an appeal assigning correction-able error, it is made to appear that the proceedings of the committee were irregular, or that in their findings of fact they were \u201cinfluenced by passion, prejudice, partiality, or corruption, or unwittingly fell into a plain mistake,\u201d the appellate court may reverse it. If, on the other hand, he decrees that it be rejected, and, upon a proper appeal being taken, it appears that the proceedings were regular and that the committee in their findings of fact were not influenced or mistaken as above stated, the appellate court may likewise reverse the decree. The judge of probate and the appellate court have authority to try the same questions. <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Haines, supra; Eastman </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The appeal must be in writing, setting forth the reasons of appeal (P. S., <em>c. </em>200, s. 2), and the appellant is restricted to the matters specified therein. \u201c At his instance, no grievances except such as he has assigned will be considered.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Goodell, </em>63 N. H. 458, 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss presents the question, whether the appeal states a reason disclosing error in the decree of the probate judge, sufficient to entitle the appellant to have it reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra. </em>The purpose of the statute, requiring the appellant to state in his appeal the reasons wherein the probate judge erred in accepting or rejecting the report, is to enable the appellate court to see the ground on which he bases his claim for relief. It is the statement of his cause of complaint. The error assigned in this appeal - the rejection and disallowance of the report - is but a recital of tbe decree made by tbe probate judge. It is not the assignment of a reason wherein the decree is erroneous, and presents no ground for an investigation, in the appellate court, of questions over which, upon a proper application, it could entertain jurisdiction. No reason for the appeal being stated, tbe refusal to grant the motion of tbe appellee was error; but as it appears that after a trial of the facts in the superior court the appeal was dismissed, that order presents no error of law. No other question is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">C~se discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
