The trial court was correct. There was no proof tending to show that any mistake was made in writing the contract, or that, appellants were deceived as to its terms. Such being the case, it is not permissible to vary the terms of the written contract by showing an agreement to locate the depot on a particular lot, when by the terms of the written instrument it was permissible to locate it elsewhere. (Wooters v. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co., 54 Texas, 294; Faires v. Cockerell, 29 S. W. Rep., 672 and 88 Texas, 428.) The two cases just cited are quite similar to the one in hand. It is true that in Faires v. Cockerell the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Civil Appeals, but not on the question now under consideration. Upon that point the Supreme Court sustained the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Ho error has been shown and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
