The case was tried by the court without a jury and judgment was rendered for appellee for the sum of $200 and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Appellant\u2019s contention that appellee was not entitled to recover, unless it was shown that appellant was negligent in the construction of its road, embankment, culverts.or sluices, is not sustained by the authorities. The requirement of the statute, that the railroad company shall construct the necessary culverts and sluices, as the natural lay of the land requires for the necessary drainage thereof, is absolute, and the right to recover damages resulting from a failure to comply with such require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>meat is not dependent upon whether or not the railroad company was guilty of negligence.
