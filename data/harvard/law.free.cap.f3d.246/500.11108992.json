Finding Daniels\u2019s claims to be meritless, we affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">Daniels was an Arlington police officer for thirteen years. While working in a plainclothes position, he began wearing on his shirt a small, gold cross pin (\u201cthe pin\u201d) as a symbol of his evangelical Christianity. He continued to wear the pin after he was reassigned to a uniformed position, which brought him into conflict with Arlington Police Department General Order No. 205.02(C)(2)(c) (\u201cthe no-pins policy\u201d). The General Order, as revised in November 1997, states that: \u201cNo button, badge, medal, or similar symbol or item not listed in this General Order will be worn on the uniform shirt unless approved by the Police Chief in writing on an individual basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">Daniels requested in writing that then-Police Chief David Kunkle make an exception to the policy and allow him to continue wearing the pin on his uniform. Kunkle declined, writing to Daniels that \u201cI have not authorized any non-department related pins and I do not intend to do so.\u201d Daniels refused Kunkle\u2019s order to remove the pin from his uniform shirt and did not respond to the police chiefs offer of accommodations, which included: (1) wearing a cross ring or bracelet instead of the pin; (2) wearing the pin under h'is uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>shirt or collar; or (3) transferring to a non-uniformed position, where he could continue to wear the pin on his shirt. Daniels declined these alternatives and ultimately was fired for insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Daniels sued, claiming that the no-pins policy is unconstitutional on its face, and that he had been the victim of intentional religious discrimination. The district court rejected Daniels\u2019s claims: It denied his motion for partial summary judgment on the facial challenge to the regulation and granted the city\u2019s summary judgment motion, dismissing the remainder of Daniels\u2019s claims. He timely perfected his appeal of both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">This case is on appeal from a denial of partial summary judgment and dismissal on summary judgment. Therefore, we review the record <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In deciding whether a fact issue has been created, the court must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The standard for summary judgment mirrors that for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the court must review all of the evidence in the record, but make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reviewing all the evidence, the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe, and should give credence to the evidence favoring the non-moving party as well as to the evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">B. <em>Facial Challenge to the No-Pins Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">Daniels asserts that Arlington Police Department General Order No. 205.02(C)(2)(c), one of many provisions regulating uniform standards for Arlington police, is an invalid prior restraint of speech protected by the First Amendment. He contends that the order is overbroad, impermissibly giving the police chief unfettered discretion to determine what expression may be displayed on an officer\u2019s uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">This argument is unavailing. As the district court correctly noted, \u201c[a] police officer\u2019s uniform is not a forum for foster<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ing public discourse or expressing one\u2019s personal beliefs.\u201d The Supreme Court has upheld appropriate restrictions on the First Amendment rights of government employees, specifically including both military and police uniform standards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reached the same conclusion in a case closely analogous to this one, <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Federal Labor Relations Auth. (\u201cFLRA\u201d), </em>in which we upheld department regulations prohibiting border patrol agents from wearing union pins on their uniforms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The city argues that the deferential rational review standard should be applied to the Arlington Police Department\u2019s no-pins policy, a test it surely , passes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We need not decide whether that is the singularly applicable test, however, because the no-pins policy survives even the stricter standard for reviewing restrictions on government employee speech promulgated by the Supreme Court in <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Pickering </em>standard balances \u201cthe interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interests of the State, as employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In <em>FLRA </em>we assumed that the speech involved was a matter of public concern, then applied the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test and concluded that the government\u2019s interest in promoting the efficiency of the services provided by its employees outweighed the employees\u2019 interest in engaging in the protected speech.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We found that \u201ca law enforcement agency\u2019s anti-adornment policy is [ ] entitled to deference when weighing the government\u2019s interest against the employee\u2019s interest under the <em>Pickering /Connick [v. Myers] </em>First Amendment test.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">We have used two tests, both derived from <em>Connick, </em>to determine whether speech relates to a \u201clegitimate public concern.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Daniels fails both. The first, the citizen-employee test, turns on whether a public employee \u201c \u2018speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters <em>only </em>of personal interest.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The second evaluates the content, form, and context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>given statement. None of these three factors favors Daniels\u2019s argument. The content of his speech \u2014 symbolic conveyance of his religious beliefs \u2014 is intensely personal in nature. Its form melds with the authority symbolized by the police uniform, running the risk that the city may appear to endorse Daniels\u2019s religious message.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The final factor, context, perhaps weighs most heavily against Daniels. Although the First Amendment protects an individm al\u2019s right, for example, to shout, \u201cFire!\u201d while riding a surfboard on the Pacific swells, it offers no such protection to the same speech uttered in a crowded theater.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Visibly wearing a cross pin \u2014 religious speech that receives great protection in civilian life \u2014 takes on an entirely different cast when viewed in the context of a police uniform. Although personal religious conviction \u2014 even the honestly held belief that one must announce such conviction to others \u2014 obviously is a matter of great concern to many members of the public, in this case it simply is not a matter of \u201cpublic concern\u201d as that term of art has been used in the constitutional sense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Because Daniels\u2019s communication of his personal religious views through the pin is not speech addressing a \u201clegitimate public coneern,\u201d the departmental policy does not offend the First Amendment. Application of the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test is thus precluded.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Yet, even were we to follow the path we blazed in <em>FLRA </em>and assume <em>arguendo </em>that Daniels\u2019s speech <em>does </em>involve a public concern, we would reach the same result. In <em>FLRA </em>we held that \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that allowing border patrol agents to wear union pins would interfere with an appearance to the public of neutrality and impartiality, which is important to the mission of all law enforcement agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Although it is true that unions are secular and religions sectarian, the analogy between Daniels\u2019s case and <em>FLRA </em>is tight. As recognized in <em>FLRA </em>the city through its police chief has the right to promote a disciplined, identifiable, and impartial police force by maintaining its police uniform as a symbol of neutral government authority, free from expressions of personal bent or bias. The city\u2019s interest in conveying neutral authority through that uniform far outweighs an officer\u2019s interest in wearing any non-department related symbol on it. Daniels\u2019s facial challenge to the no-pins policy fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>C. <em>Grant of the City\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Having reviewed <em>de novo </em>the legal claims Daniels asserts on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his case with prejudice on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">1. <em>First Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">For the reasons already discussed, the district court found that Arlington Police General Order No. 205.02(C)(2)(c) as applied to Daniels did not infringe his constitutional rights of free speech, expression, or association. The court also found that the no-pins policy is facially neutral and generally applicable, and only incidentally burdens Daniels\u2019s free exercise of his religion. Therefore, concluded the court, the rule is acceptable under the teaching of <em>Employment Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">On appeal, Daniels appears to focus on a single sentence in which the district court stated: \u201cPlaintiffs argument that wearing a cross on his police uniform is mandated by his religion is wholly without merit.\u201d Daniels is correct in arguing that it is improper for a court to assess what activities are mandated by religious belief.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Particularly when read in context with the court\u2019s pronouncement as a whole, we do not view this sentence as a comment on Daniels\u2019s religious beliefs, but rather as a rejection of the merits of his legal claim. Even if the court\u2019s perhaps-unfortunate phrasing allows for Daniels\u2019s interpretation, however, it does not undercut the validity of the conclusion that the no-pins policy does not target religion but only incidentally affects Daniels\u2019s individual religious practice, and thus is acceptable under <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Our conclusion that Daniels has not justified an exception to the police department\u2019s no-pins policy is analogous to the one we reached in rejecting a Muslim prison inmate\u2019s complaint after he was denied an exemption from the Texas prison policy requiring all inmates to be clean-shaven, even though wearing a beard was a tenet of his faith.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> After noting that the grooming policy of the prison has a legitimate penological justification, we found that the policy does not violate Muslim prisoners\u2019 free exercise of religion, but \u201cmerely removes or reduces one of many avenues by which they may manifest their faith.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The same is equally true of Daniels\u2019s complaint: The no-pins policy serves a legitimate governmental purpose in the context of uniformed law enforcement personnel, and Daniels undoubtedly has myriad alternative ways to manifest this tenet of his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">2. <em>Due Process and Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">The district court found that Daniels \u201cpresented no admissible evidence to suggest that he was terminated for the purpose of suppressing his rights protected by the First Amendment.\u201d The court therefore rejected his Due Process and Title .VII<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> claims. Daniels contends that the accommodations offered by the city were unreasonable, presenting a fact issue on his Title VII claim. He also argues that he raised a fact issue as to Chief Kunkle\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>motivation, and whether Kunkle discriminated against religious speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We agree with the district court that Daniels presented no evidence that he had been terminated to suppress his First Amendment rights. Therefore, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to his claims under the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As for his Title VII claims, we find that Daniels met that statute\u2019s requirements for establishing a prima facie case of religious discrimination, having produced summary judgment evidence that (1) he had a bona fide religious belief that conflicted with an employment requirement; (2) he informed his employer of this belief; and (3) he was discharged for failing to comply with the conflicting employment requirement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> With a prima facie case established, the burden shifted to the employer to show that it was unable reasonably to accommodate Daniels\u2019s religious needs without undue hardship.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This the city has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The only accommodation Daniels proposes is unreasonable and an undue hardship for the city as a matter of law. A police department cannot be forced to let individual officers add religious symbols to their official uniforms. The record shows, furthermore, that Daniels failed to respond to the police chiefs reasonable offers of accommodation. He cannot reject the city\u2019s good-faith efforts at accommodation because he did not fulfill his duty of cooperation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Finally, Daniels raised no fact issue as to Chief Kunkle\u2019s motivation. The undisputed facts show the <em>opposite </em>of pretext: The chief never denied that the cross is a religious symbol. The parties disagree only as to whether such symbols are appropriate accoutrements for police uniforms. Daniels\u2019s Title VII claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">3. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"APt\">Daniels also contends that genuine fact issues exist as to whether the city discriminated against religious speech by allowing other forms of symbolic speech. Daniels testified that he had seen, or heard about, many items of ornamentation worn on uniforms during his thirteen years with the Arlington Police. Former Chief Kunkle stated that before the no-pins order became effective in November 1997, he had approved pins promoting programs in which the city or police department directly participated, such as the DARE anti-drug campaign. In 1990, Kunkle had encouraged officers to wear red ribbons commemorating the 1985 slaying of federal drug agent Enrique Camarena. Daniels also points to his own affidavit, in which he stated that he attended a supervisory meeting in January 1997, in which Kunkle said he would not authorize the wearing of cross pins on uniforms because they \u201cmight offend someone.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The district court nevertheless found that Daniels failed to produce any competent summary judgment evidence that the city discriminated against religious speech while allowing other forms of symbolic speech. In fact, the court found that the evidence showed Daniels was the only officer in the Arlington Police Department who had applied for an exception to the no-pins policy since its enactment. Viewing the facts and their inferences in the light most favorable to Daniels, we are convinced that he has not proven any disparate treatment or shown that any non-Christian pin request was approved or otherwise handled differently from his. He has created no genuine issue of material fact on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"AAK\">4. <em>Texas Laws and Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3Vv\">The district court rejected Daniels\u2019s argument that the police chiefs order to remove his pin from his uniform was unlawful under Texas law. The court held that the state constitution and laws, including the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d), afford Daniels no greater protection on his claims than does federal law, and that he was properly terminated for insubordination after refusing to comply with the chiefs order.</p>\n<p id=\"AGo\">Although Daniels assigns error to these conclusions, the Texas Supreme Court has held that the TCHRA is modeled on Title YII of the federal Civil Rights Act, and should be interpreted in the same manner.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Daniels\u2019s civil rights claims under the state constitution are similarly unavailing because tort damages are not recoverable for violations of the Texas Constitution.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AYdh\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Arhc\">We discern no merit in any of Daniels\u2019s assignments of error. A police department does not violate the First Amendment when it bars officers from adorning their uniforms with individually chosen adornments, .even when those decorations include symbols with religious significance. Therefore, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">. <em>Morris v.
