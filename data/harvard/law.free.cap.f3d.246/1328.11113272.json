Alternatively, Delaney argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because counsel for his state post-conviction petitions advised him to file \u201cextra motions,\u201d thereby preventing him from making a timely federal filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-18\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of habeas relief <em>de novo, </em>but review a court\u2019s factual findings in a habeas corpus proceeding for clear error. Wil<em>cox v. Florida Dep\u2019t. of Corrections, </em>158 F.3d 1209, 1210 (11th Cir.1998) <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 103, 148 L.Ed.2d 62 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">AEDPA imposes a one-year period of limitations for writs of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). For prisoners, such as Delaney, whose convictions became final before the effective date of AEDPA, the one-year period to file a federal habeas corpus petition extends from the statute\u2019s effective date, April 23, 1996 until April 23, 1997. <em>Wilcox, </em>158 F.3d at 1210. This one-year limitations period can be tolled, however, by a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction [relief] or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Delaney\u2019s federal habeas pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>tition was filed on April 23,1999, two years after the grace period ended. Thus, to toll the time, Delaney had to have filed a state petition prior to April 23, 1997. Delaney argues that the motion he filed for state post-conviction relief under Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800 on October 15, 1996 sufficed to toll the limitations period even though it was dismissed because it was brought pursuant to the wrong statutory vehicle, that is, a Rule 3.800 motion rather than a Rule 3.850 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we first address the question of whether a state post-conviction challenge to consecutive sentences, dismissed because it was brought pursuant to the wrong statutory vehicle, is \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">The United States Supreme Court recently defined \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA in <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213(2000),. The Court found that \u201can application is \u2018properly filed\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing <em>filings.\u201d Id. </em>at 364 (emphasis added). The Court identified as examples of these laws and rules those which prescribe \u201cthe form of the document, the time limits upon its delivery, the court and office in which it must be lodged, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hurley v. Moore, </em>233 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000) (petitioner\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief under Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850, which requires that the motion be under written oath, did not contain the requisite written oath and therefore was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d). The Court explained that \u201cthe question whether an application has been \u2018properly filed\u2019 is quite separate from the question whether the claims contained in the application are meritorious and free of procedural bar,\u201d for,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-7\">[b]y construing \u201cproperly filed application\u201d to mean \u201capplication raising claims that are not mandatorily procedurally barred,\u201d petitioner elides the difference between an \u201capplication\u201d and a \u201cclaim.\u201d ... Ignoring this distinction would require judges to engage in verbal gymnastics when an application contains some claims that are procedurally barred and some that are not. Presumably a court would have to say that the application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d as to the nonbarred claims, and not \u201cproperly filed\u201d as to the rest. The statute, however, refers only to \u201cproperly filed\u201d applications and does not contain the peculiar suggestion that a single application can be both \u201cproperly filed\u201d and not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">We find that under <em>Artuz </em>the district court erred in looking beyond the face of Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.800 motion to consider the individual claims (i.e., whether they are challenges to consecutive sentences or to illegal sentences) in determining whether that motion was \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find that the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>was \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because the Rule 3.800 motion, on its face, met state procedural and filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Our inquiry does not end there, however, for while Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.800 motion tolled the one-year period during the time that the motion was pending in state court, the limitations period began to run again on October 31, 1997 when the state appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion. At that point Delaney had six months left before his one-year limitations period expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead of filing a federal petition within those six months, Delaney filed a motion for state post-conviction relief under Rule 3.850 approximately one month after the state appellate court ruling, on November 25, 1997 to satisfy the state appellate court\u2019s ruling that his challenge to consecutive sentences should have been raised by a Rule 3.850 motion. If this motion is considered \u201cproperly filed,\u201d then the limitations period would again have been tolled until this motion was resolved, leaving five months of the federal limitations period to file a federal habeas petition. The state appellate court denied his motion on April 9, 1999. Thus, if the Rule 3.850 motion is considered to have been \u201cproperly filed,\u201d his petition for federal habeas corpus relief, filed on April 13, 1999, would have been well within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-7\">(b) Time Limitations. A motion to vacate a sentence that exceeds the limits provided by law may be filed at any time. No other motion shall be filed or considered pursuant to this rule if filed more than 2 years after the judgment and sentence become final in a noncapi-tal case or more than 1 year after the judgment and sentence become final in a capital case in which a death sentence has been imposed unless it alleges that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\">(1) the facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown to the mov-ant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqFb\">Delaney\u2019s motion was clearly filed more than two years after his judgment and sentence became final. However, the rule provides that a motion is filed timely, even if filed more than two years after the judgment and sentence became final, if it alleges that \u201cthe facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown to the movant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Delaney argues that his motion did allege that newly discovered evidence rendered his conviction unlawful. While the claims raised in his Rule 3.850 motion may have no merit, the question for purposes of this appeal is whether the motion is, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), \u201ca properly filed motion for state post-conviction\u201d relief under that section. Under <em>Artuz, </em>an application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d when its delivery and acceptance \u201care in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Rule 3.850 requires only that the motion allege that facts \u201cwere unknown to the movant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence\u201d we find that if Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion in fact alleges \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d it was \u201cproperly filed.\u201d Delaney\u2019s Rule 3.850 therefore would have tolled the one-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>limitations period, leaving five months from the date the state appellate court resolved the motion on April 9, 1999, and therefore his petition for federal habeas corpus relief, filed on April 13, 1999, would have been within AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus as time barred is reversed and this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">. Delaney had previously filed a Rule 3.850 motion in 1995 and two Rule 3.850 motions in May, 1996. The trial court's denial of the 1995 motion became final in 1995 and the denial of the 1996 motions became final in June, 1996. Therefore, assuming these motions were \u201cproperly filed,\u201d they would not have extended the limitations period past June, 1997. Thus, for purposes of this ap-. peal, the 1995 and 1996 petitions for state post-conviction relief are immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">. Prior to <em>Artuz </em>this Court had held that a state court post-conviction motion that was denied as successive is not properly filed and does not toll AEDPA's limitations period in <em>Weeldey v. Moore, </em>204 F.3d 1083 (11th Cir.2000), <em>judgment </em>vacated, - U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 751, 148 L.Ed.2d 654 (2001). On remand, this Court held that in light of <em>Artuz </em>a successive state court post-conviction motion constitutes a \"properly filed\u201d petition for purposes of tolling AEDPA's statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>period. <em>Weekley v.
