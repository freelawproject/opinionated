Plaintiff asserted that he had complied with the requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By pretrial order of January 3, 1974, plaintiff was directed to be basically prepared to proceed to trial by April 16, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">On March 13, 1974, plaintiff filed the instant motion for leave to amend. What plaintiff\u2019s attorney proposes to do by the amended complaint is to add five more parties-plaintiff who were \u201cformer employees of the supervisory level\u201d of the defendant and \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to the plaintiff, in that each was between 40 and 60 years of age when dismissed and each had been employed by the defendant for a majority of his adult life. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney alleged that it was in the course of discovery that the five \u201csimilarly situated employees\u201d became known.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">Although plaintiff\u2019s counsel urges that the claims of the five additional plaintiffs seek the same relief as plaintiff, that the amendment will not result in undue prejudice, etc., to the defendant, plaintiff\u2019s counsel concedes that not one of the five additional employees had ever complied with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d). They have, however, each consented in writing to being made an additional plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-19\">Proposed plaintiff Montgomery was terminated about December 1, 1971. The other four proposed plaintiffs, Oye, Luca, Roach and Ekhammer, were discharged in about March of 1972. It thus is apparent on the face of the complaint and plaintiff\u2019s memoranda that in fact the claims of the five arise out of different discharges at different times from that of plaintiff Oshiro. The fact that their discharges were not discovered by the plaintiff until some several months after the instant suit was filed gives rise to the almost overwhelming inference that their discharges had no connection with plaintiff Oshiro\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-20\">None of the five proposed new plaintiffs has filed any claims with the State of Hawaii and, as indicated, none has filed a notice of intent to sue in compliance with \u00a7 626(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-21\"> The motion to amend must be denied: (1) The showing made by plaintiff\u2019s attorney does not satisfy this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>court that it was in fact timely; there is no indication of delay in filing because of oversight or inadvertent mistake. There is no question but that the joinder of new plaintiffs would create an entirely new law suit, and that it would necessitate extensive, new discovery procedures. (2) This court concludes that the failure of the proposed plaintiffs to comply with the requirements as to notice under \u00a7 626(d) preclude their joinder. The requirements of \u00a7 626(d) are jurisdictional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Plaintiff has argued that Burgett v. Cudahy, 361 F.Supp. 617 (D.Kansas 1973), permits his present amendment; that therein the court enlarged the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 626(d). However, the facts in <em>Burgett </em>are clearly to be distinguished from those of the instant case. In <em>Burgett, </em>all four plaintiffs were named in the original complaint. While the other three plaintiffs, Price, Eg\u00e1n and Walter were not named therein, in the notification made by Burgett under \u00a7 626(d), he indicated that \u201cthe circumstances of [his own] release and <em>of the other three gentlemen </em>at the same time strongly indicate discrimination\u201d, and concluded, \u201cin the event that the Department of Labor might elect not to proceed, against Cudahy, this is to provide notice that it is <em>our </em>intention to pursue a civil remedy [under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id., </em>at 619. \u201c[T]hey were all fired and rehired . \u25a0. at approximately the same time and <em>for ostensibly the-same reasons . '. </em>.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id., </em>at 622. All four \u201chad previously communicated with the local Wage and Hour Office and . . . had participated in the Department of Labor\u2019s negotiations with Cudahy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The <em>Burgett </em>court thereafter overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as to the three, apparently on the basis that \u201cany other result would constitute a meaningless and intolerable triumph of form over substance inimical to the Act\u2019s remedial function.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 625. This court does not disagree with the ultimate result but does not adopt all of the <em>Burgett </em>court\u2019s rationale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">As indicated above, the- motion to amend and add additional plaintiffs is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-13\">.

It would appear to this court that the <em>Burgett </em>court did but bolster its decision with the additional conclusion that the three employees, other than Burgett, were entitled to ride piggyback with Burgett under the class action provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), without complying with the specific condition of \u00a7 626(d). As indicated above, this court feels that the filing of a notice of intent to sue with the Secretary is a jurisdictional requirement, and would agree with <em>Burney, suyr'a </em>n. 2, headnote 9, 302 F.Supp. at 88, 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
