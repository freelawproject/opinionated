III. There is no basis to reverse the Industrial Board of Appeals\u2019 rational determination that the cash dispensing machine fees are not payments from earned wages required by the employer in violation of section 193 (2) of the Labor Law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>but rather are incurred in separate transactions through the voluntary choice of the employees. <em>(Matter of Hudacs v Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>90 NY2d 342.)

Labor Ready supplies daily workers who perform manual labor \u2014 for example, stocking shelves or doing yard work \u2014 for businesses and individual customers. In 2002 Labor Ready had 7,000 customers in New York State and employed approximately 18,000 unskilled and semiskilled laborers whose average salary was $6.41 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">To compete with other temporary employment firms, Labor Ready pays its employees at the end of every work day \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>company\u2019s slogans are \u201cWork Today, Paid Today\u201d and \u201cWork Today, Cash Today.\u201d Typically, the temporary employees coming to Labor Ready do not have bank accounts and are unable to sustain themselves financially on a weekly basis. Since many live in shelters or rooming houses where they have to pay daily, they choose to go to Labor Ready because they know that they will be paid at the end of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Upon completion of a job, a worker brings a supervisor a work ticket and is offered the option of being paid by check or by cash voucher. Those who choose a payroll check each day can cash it wherever they wish, including at a Fleet Bank for no charge. Neighborhood check-cashing facilities in Buffalo charge a fee of about 50 cents to one dollar; however, a worker may prefer not to receive cash at these places where other people may loiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Employees who opt for a cash voucher \u2014 redeemable only at a Labor Ready branch \u2014 receive a paper that looks just like a payroll check, but the signature space is voided and the voucher contains a PIN number that the employee must use at a cash dispensing machine (CDM). The voucher lists the gross wages, withholdings and the Labor Ready fee for redeeming cash. Thus, the actual value of the voucher is the worker\u2019s net wages minus the transaction fee. Labor Ready charges the worker one dollar plus any change that would have been part of the day\u2019s wages. If, for example, a worker\u2019s after-tax wages were $44.85, the voucher would be for $43, and upon accessing the CDM, the worker would receive $43 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Labor Ready makes multiple disclosures regarding the fees. The precise fee is on the voucher itself. Notice is also on pamphlets at Labor Ready branches, on a sign over each CDM and on the CDM screen during the transaction. Furthermore, during the transaction a worker may elect to return the voucher in exchange for a paycheck, which will be issued quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The CDMs were first leased and operated by Labor Ready and in 2000 assigned to Labor Ready Properties, Inc., another subsidiary, which purchases maintenance services from unrelated companies, such as Brinks, and ultimately receives the transactional fees. In New York in 2002, on average 67% of the temporary employees received their wages by cash voucher. Labor Ready Properties generated $17,800 in revenue at Buffalo branches between 1999 and 2000 and $8.3 million in gross revenue nationally in 2000 from CDM fees charged to the temporary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Having received complaints, the State Department of Labor in 1999 investigated Labor Ready\u2019s Buffalo branches for alleged unlawful deductions from wages for transportation and equipment costs and for deductions of CDM fees. In August 2002 the Department issued an amended order to comply with Labor Law article 6, directing payment to multiple named claimants. The parties settled the transportation and equipment cost deduction issues, with Labor Ready agreeing to pay more than $38,000 in restitution, interest and penalties. The parties were, however, unable to settle the issue concerning the CDM fees and stipulated that the amount of CDM fees generated at the Buffalo branches was approximately $17,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Upon review, the Industrial Board of Appeals (IBA) found no violation of Labor Law \u00a7 193 (1). Determining that the CDM charge against the employee\u2019s wages was a separate transaction under Labor Law \u00a7 193 (2), and entirely voluntary, the IBA found no violation. The IBA added, however, that it did \u201cnot in any sense condone\u201d Labor Ready\u2019s practice of \u201cextracting what is, relative to [the workers\u2019] daily wages, an extravagant amount of money to cash their vouchers,\u201d and repeated that the fees seemed \u201cexcessive\u201d when compared with the minimal amount of daily pay these laborers customarily received.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Department then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul the IBA\u2019s determination. Supreme Court transferred the proceeding to the Appellate Division, which reversed. Finding the matter one of statutory interpretation rather than agency deference, the Court concluded that the fee deduction and the payment of wages were inseparably connected and interrelated, and that the direct deduction of a fee for the service of providing cash wages was a violation of Labor Law \u00a7 193. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> As a threshold matter, we conclude that the Appellate Division applied the proper standard of review. Where, as here, the words are clear and the question simply involves proper application of a statute, there is little basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency <em>(see Matter of Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v Gliedman, </em>62 NY2d 539, 545 [1984]). We further agree with the Appellate Division that the IBA\u2019s interpretation directly contravened the plain language of Labor Law \u00a7 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The purpose of Labor Law article 6 is \u201cto strengthen and clarify the rights of employees to the payment of wages\u201d <em>(see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>Truelove v Northeast Capital &amp; Advisory, </em>95 NY2d 220, 223 [2000], citing Mem of Indus Commr, June 3, 1966, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 548, at 4; <em>see also Gottlieb v Kenneth D. Laub &amp; Co., </em>82 NY2d 457, 461 [1993]). Labor Law \u00a7 193 (1) (b), part of article 6, explicitly prohibits an employer from deducting monies from the wages of an employee except as required by law or as \u201cexpressly authorized in writing\u201d by and \u201cfor the benefit of the employee.\u201d The statute, moreover, specifies the deductions that an employee may authorize: \u201cpayments for insurance premiums, pension or health and welfare benefits, contributions to charitable organizations, payments for United States bonds, payments for dues or assessments to a labor organization, and similar payments for the benefit of the employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A \u201cdeduction\u201d literally is an act of taking away or subtraction. While under section 193 (1) (b) an employee may authorize an employer to take away or subtract wages, the clear language of this subdivision limits the types of deductions to those enumerated and to \u201csimilar payments.\u201d Labor Ready\u2019s fee for the service of providing a voucher for cash is a direct deduction of monies from wages. Even though the employee has the option of receiving a check, once the employee chooses the voucher the employer subtracts money from the amount received as wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Labor Ready does not argue that the deductions are similar payments to those the statute authorizes, for the money subtracted from the voucher is equivalent to service fees, not payments to a union or such organizations dealing with health, pensions or savings bonds. Nor can the charges be construed as a \u201cbenefit\u201d to the laborers because all the authorized deductions listed in section 193 for the employee\u2019s benefit are monetary or supportive. The only benefit to the worker here is one of convenience. That, however, is not a \u201cbenefit\u201d covered by the statute <em>(cf. Marsh v Prudential Sec., </em>1 NY3d 146 [2003] [investment banker\u2019s deferral of funds is a benefit]).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We agree with the Appellate Division that under subdivision (1) (b), an employee\u2019s act of receiving a voucher and cashing it at an on-site CDM is one transaction. Since the voucher already has the fee subtracted and can be cashed only at a Labor Ready CDM, the deduction is not disconnected from the payment of wages. Furthermore, since the voucher is not negotiable, the employee receives wages when he or she receives cash from the machine. Thus, the receipt of the voucher and subsequent receipt of cash cannot be viewed as two separate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Labor Ready asserts that Labor Law \u00a7 193 (2) governs because workers are simply paying a fee for service, and a worker\u2019s receiving the voucher and then cashing it are separate transactions. First, section 193 (2) provides that: \u201cNo employer shall make any charge against wages, or require an employee to make any payment by separate transaction unless such charge or payment is permitted as a deduction from wages under the provisions of subdivision one of this section.\u201d This language prohibits an employer from charging against wages or requiring a payment from wages by separate transaction unless the payment is one permitted in subdivision (1) (b). As we have noted, the fee for a cash voucher is not a \u201csimilar payment\u201d to those specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Second, subdivision (2) was added to the statute in 1974 to \u201cprohibit wage deductions by indirect means where direct deduction would violate the statute\u201d (Mem of State Dept of Labor in Support of L 1974, ch 160, 1974 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1957). The Legislature sought to end the subterfuge of an employer\u2019s paying full wages but then seeking payment at another time <em>(see Matter of Hudacs v Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>90 NY2d 342, 348 [1997]). In <em>Frito-Lay, </em>the employer sought, not by deduction from paychecks but by separate action, recoupment of cash that truck deliverers had received from grocery stores. This Court\u2019s decision, however, turned on the definition of \u201cwages\u201d and found that the cash that drivers received upon delivery of goods was owed to the employer and was not part of employee wages. Here by contrast the deduction of the processing fees occurs at the time the wages are paid. While it may appear that Labor Ready is paying the day laborer a full wage only to obtain payment at a later time, the employee never actually receives a negotiable instrument. Implementing the statute as written, we conclude that these deductions are governed by subdivision (1) (b) and violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Interpreting section 193 to permit an employer to make deductions from earned income as long as the worker agrees and has the option of receiving full payment could open the door to a new category of deductions that would be illegal if directly deducted but would be lawful if they were an option. The Department provides an example: An employer may offer its employees who work Saturday to Friday the option of receiving their full wages on Friday or advance wages on Wednesday less a five percent \u201cadvance payroll processing\u201d fee. Thus, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>deduction from wages under section 193 (2) would be legal as long as the employer structures it as a purportedly optional \u201cseparate transaction.\u201d In this case, the daily \u2014 as opposed to weekly \u2014 deductions could multiply the fee several times per week. While Labor Ready\u2019s decision to pay the temporary laborers daily is laudable, subtracting from wages a fee that goes directly to the employer or its subsidiary violates both the letter of the statute and the protective policy underlying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The legislative history of section 193 buttresses our reading of the statute. In 1889 and again in 1893, the Legislature passed laws requiring employers to pay employees in cash, not company scrip that could be used only at the \u201ccompany store,\u201d and prohibiting charges for provisions as offsets to wages (see L 1889, ch 381, \u00a7 1; L 1893, ch 717, \u00a7 2). Several years later, the Attorney General wrote that a recodification was enacted to protect workers from questionable practices of employers (see 1899 Report of Atty Gen, at 335 [1900]), and the intention of the Legislature was \u201cto absolutely prohibit the sale ... to their employees, upon credit, of groceries, provisions or clothing, with a view to deducting the amount charged for the same from the weekly payments required to be made in cash\u201d <em>(see </em>1901 Report of Atty Gen, at 152 [1901]).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The next amendment to the statute, codified as Labor Law \u00a7 197 in 1921, provided that there could be no \u201coff-set in behalf of the employer against wages\u201d for provisions, clothing and groceries <em>(see </em>L 1921, ch 50). The recodification to the current section 193 (1) in 1966 expressly prohibits direct wage deductions with limited exceptions <em>(see </em>Mem of Indus Commr, June 3, 1966, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 548, at 4). A memorandum in support of the bill adding the current subdivision (2) in 1974 states that since agreements to reimburse the employer by separate transaction are \u201cin no sense voluntary,\u201d these were deemed unlawful <em>(see </em>Mem in Support, 1974 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1957; <em>see also Frito-Lay, </em>90 NY2d at 346-348). The history of Labor Law \u00a7 193 manifests the legislative intent to assure that the unequal bargaining power between an employer and an employee does not result in coercive economic arrangements by which the employer can divert a worker\u2019s wages for the employer\u2019s benefit. Labor Ready\u2019s CDM revenues demonstrate the employer\u2019s benefit from the payments \u2014 the inequity that the Legislature sought to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Labor Ready\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AFa\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
