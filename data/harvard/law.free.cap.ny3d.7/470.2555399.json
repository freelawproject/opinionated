The prosecutor persisted in engaging in this conduct, forcing the defense to lodge hundreds of objections and three motions for mistrial, and forcing the court to admonish the prosecutor for her conduct numerous times. <em>(People v P.J.

Double jeopardy is not implicated as defendant\u2019s first trial reached a verdict. <em>(United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470; <em>People v Adames, </em>83 NY2d 89; <em>Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 US 667; <em>People v Catten, </em>69 NY2d 547; <em>Matter of Randall v Rothwax, </em>78 NY2d 494; <em>Matter of Potenza v Kane, </em>79 AD2d 467; <em>United States v Tateo, </em>377 US 463; <em>People v Liotta, </em>274 AD2d 751; <em>People v Arduini, </em>222 AD2d 965; <em>Matter of Owen v Harrigan, </em>131 AD2d 20.) II. If the Court applies double-jeopardy principles to defendants whose cases reach a verdict, the standard should be intentional conduct of a prosecutor such that the integrity of the judicial process itself has been impaired. <em>(Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 US 667; <em>People v Key, </em>45 NY2d 111; <em>United States v Jenkins, </em>420 US 358; <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>424 US 600; <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470; <em>People v Ortiz, </em>54 NY2d 288; <em>Matter of Davis v Brown, </em>87 NY2d 626; <em>People v Boone, </em>287 AD2d 461; <em>People v Hart, </em>216 AD2d 486; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>197 AD2d 709.) III. The prosecutor\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level to trigger double-jeopardy protections. <em>(United States v Wallach, </em>979 F2d 912; <em>Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 US 667; <em>People v Alicea, </em>37 NY2d 601; <em>People v Steinhardt, </em>9 NY2d 267; <em>People v Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d 412.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-6\"><em>Bennett L.

We conclude, as did the Appellate Division, that the proper remedy is a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In April 1997, petitioner allegedly raped and otherwise sexually molested the 21-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend. Two years later, in 1999, the victim reported this to the police, and also that petitioner had abused her when she was a child. After an investigation, petitioner was charged with rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree, sexual abuse in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, all allegedly committed in 1997 or later. He was not indicted for earlier events.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">At the pretrial <em>Ventimiglia </em>hearing, County Court ruled inadmissible much of the evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior uncharged criminal and immoral acts. As found by the Appellate Division, however, the prosecutor continuously flouted these and other rulings by attempting to place excluded evidence before the jury, repeatedly referencing matters not in evidence, making unsupportable assertions and calling upon the jury to draw improper inferences <em>(see People v Gorghan, </em>13 AD3d 908, 909-911 [3d Dept 2004]). In response, petitioner made numerous objections and moved for a mistrial on three occasions\u2014 after opening statements, during testimony and after the prosecutor\u2019s summation. While several times giving curative instructions, the court denied petitioner\u2019s mistrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Petitioner was convicted on all charges, but the Appellate Division \u2014 after detailing the prosecutorial misconduct\u2014 reversed his conviction and ordered a new trial, concluding that the prosecutor had engaged in \u201ca pervasive pattern ... of push<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ing beyond accepted boundaries on key issues ... in a fashion prejudicial to a fair trial\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 911). Upon remittal to County Court, petitioner sought an order barring retrial on double-jeopardy grounds. That court summarily denied petitioner\u2019s motion and petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding in the Appellate Division to prohibit a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The Appellate Division dismissed the petition. It found that, although the misconduct was substantial, the record revealed a prosecutor \u201cbent on securing a conviction, not one seeking to provoke defendant into moving for a mistrial\u201d and that petitioner had failed to demonstrate that the judicial process itself had been impaired <em>(Matter of Gorghan v DeAngelis, </em>25 AD3d 872, 873 [3d Dept 2006]). Thus, the Court concluded that retrial \u2014 rather than dismissal \u2014 was the appropriate remedy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">At its essence, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects criminal defendants from multiple prosecutions for the same offense <em>(Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 US 667, 671 [1982]). This protection includes the valued, though not absolute, right to proceed to verdict before the empaneled jury <em>(see People v Adames, </em>83 NY2d 89, 92 [1993]). Thus, ordinarily, when a defendant obtains a verdict or chooses to prevent one by successfully seeking a mistrial, double-jeopardy principles are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">An exception to this rule exists, however, in instances where a prosecutor has engaged in prejudicial misconduct deliberately intended to provoke a mistrial motion <em>(see Kennedy, </em>456 US at 673). In such circumstances, the prosecutor has effectively eviscerated the defendant\u2019s right to complete the trial before the empaneled jury and thus double jeopardy may bar retrial even though the defendant\u2019s own successful mistrial motion prevented the verdict. As we explained in <em>Matter of Davis v Brown </em>(87 NY2d 626, 630 [1996]),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201c[w]hen the prosecution fears the case is headed toward acquittal and intentionally causes a mistrial, the calculated result of this prosecutorial misconduct is to deprive the defendant of the right to have the case completed before the first jury. In such a case, a second trial of the defendant would constitute an impermissible second bite at the apple for the prosecution, in direct violation of the letter and spirit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>both the State and Federal Double Jeopardy Clauses\u2019 prohibitions against repeated prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We hold that this well-established but narrow exception is equally applicable to reversals on appeal when a trial court has erroneously denied a defendant\u2019s mistrial motion. As we noted in <em>Adames, </em>\u201c[t]he corrective action for prosecutorial trial misconduct should ordinarily not vary whether a verdict is nullified by a trial court or by an appellate court\u201d (83 NY2d at 90-91). The misconduct is the same, the prejudice to the defendant is the same and the result should therefore be the same. Indeed, to differentiate between granted mistrial motions and reversals on appeal would create an anomalous result. Defendants who suffer both prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct intended to cause a mistrial and erroneous denial of a mistrial motion would never be entitled to double-jeopardy protection, whereas defendants subjected only to prosecutorial misconduct resulting in the grant of a mistrial would be entitled to that protection <em>(see </em>2 Dressier and Michaels, Understanding Criminal Procedure \u00a7 14.05, at 326-327 [4th ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Here, although the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was deplorable, it was \u2014 as found by the Appellate Division \u2014 motivated by an intent to secure a conviction, not to provoke a mistrial motion. Thus, petitioner is entitled only to the ordinary remedy for harmful trial misconduct \u2014 a new, fair trial \u2014 and not dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Grapfeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur; Judge Pigott taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Judgment affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
