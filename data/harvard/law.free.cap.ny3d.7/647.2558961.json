This appeal asks whether defendant was \u201cincarcerated\u201d while serving a portion of his prior sentence of imprisonment in a day-reporting program. We answer that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Defendant was charged with three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal use of drug paraphernalia in the second degree, all taking place on November 8, 2002. He agreed to plead guilty to two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the third degree, in full satisfaction of the indictment. As part of his plea bargain, defendant further agreed to be sentenced as a second felony offender based upon a prior felony conviction for first-degree robbery occurring on March 25, 1991. For that crime he served a sentence of imprisonment from April 16, 1991 to February 23, 1993, his date of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">At sentencing for his current conviction, however, defendant argued that he could not be sentenced as a second felony offender because more than 10 years had elapsed between imposition of the sentence on his prior felony and commission of the current felonies. Defendant produced documentary evidence from the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) demonstrating that, as of September 28, 1992, his earlier sentence had been converted to day-report status. Defendant argued that, as of September 28, 1992, he was no longer incarcerated, and because his current felonies were not committed until November 8, 2002 \u2014 more than 10 years later \u2014 he was not in fact a second felony offender under Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The People contended that the 10-year period should be tolled for the entire time defendant spent serving the sentence of imprisonment on his robbery conviction \u2014 including while in the day-reporting program \u2014 and thus his current felonies were committed within the statutory period. County Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and sentenced him as a second felony offender to concurrent sentences of imprisonment of 4Va to 9 years. A divided Appellate Division affirmed, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony conviction the following criteria shall apply . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201c(iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, sentence [for the prior felony] must have been imposed not more than ten years before commission of the felony of which the defendant presently stands convicted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">\u201c(v) In calculating the ten year period under subparagraph (iv), any period of time during which the person was incarcerated for any reason between the time of commission of the previous felony and the time of commission of the present felony shall be excluded and such ten year period shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>extended by a period or periods equal to the time served under such incarceration . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Defendant contends that his time spent in a day-reporting program cannot act to extend the 10-year period because he was not \u201cincarcerated.\u201d Under the statute, read literally or contextually, defendant is wrong. Indeed, from September 28, 1992 until February 23,1993 \u2014 including the five months he was in the day-reporting program \u2014 defendant was confined (and in that sense \u201cincarcerated\u201d), serving out his sentence of imprisonment under the custody and control of DOCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">An inmate in a day-reporting program, under the applicable statutes and regulations, enjoys \u201cextended bounds of confinement\u201d <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 851 [10]; \u00a7 855 [5], [7]; 7 NYCRR 1926.2 [a] [4]). An approved inmate who has successfully participated in a work release program, completed furloughs to an approved residence and is either within six months of becoming eligible for parole or has one year or less to be served under his sentence, may be assigned from a work release facility to a residential treatment facility to participate in a program of continued employment <em>(see </em>7 NYCRR 1925.2). While residing at an approved residence, the inmate is required to report to the facility or other designated reporting location, to undergo frequent drug tests and, where appropriate, to participate in other rehabilitative programs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Moreover, before acceptance into a day-reporting program, an inmate must sign both a memorandum of agreement and copy of the day-reporting rules (7 NYCRR 1926.1). These documents specify that participation in the program \u201cis a privilege which may be revoked at any time\u201d and that the inmate \u201cremain[s] in the custody of [DOCS]\u201d (7 NYCRR 1926.2 [c]; 1926.3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The program imposes reporting duties and travel restrictions, including prior approval requirements for any method of transportation the inmate uses, for obtaining a driver\u2019s license and for having a motor vehicle (7 NYCRR 1926.3). Permission is also required before participants take any medication (except in exigent circumstances), obtain a credit card or enter into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>contract, and they must surrender the full amount of their employment earnings to the day-reporting center for documentation and proper deductions. Thus, inmates in day-reporting programs are merely granted the revocable privilege of serving their sentences of imprisonment under less strict conditions of supervision than other prisoners under lock and key.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Focus on the plain purpose of Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 also leads us to reject defendant\u2019s argument. The statute is intended \u201cto deter recidivism by enhancing the punishments of those who, having been convicted of felonies, violate the norms of civil society and commit felonies again\u201d <em>(People v Walker, </em>81 NY2d 661, 665 [1993]). To avoid enhanced punishment, prior felons must demonstrate their ability to live within the norms of civil society for 10 years. Plainly, time spent serving a sentence of imprisonment does not satisfy this requirement. That the Legislature has spoken in terms of time \u201cincarcerated\u201d does not compel us to limit the term to \u201cbehind bars\u201d <em>(cf. People v Love, </em>71 NY2d 711 [1988] [periods of wrongful incarceration are not included in the statutory toll]). Rather, we conclude that defendant should be considered incarcerated until he completed his sentence of imprisonment for the prior crime and was released into parole. Indeed, the sparse legislative history supports this sensible construction: \u201cThe alleged second felony offense must occur within 10 years after the defendant was released from a prison term on the first felony\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1973, ch 277, 1973 NY Legis Ann, at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Here, defendant remained incarcerated until he was paroled on February 23, 1993. Because he committed his current drug felonies on November 8, 2002 \u2014 less than 10 years later \u2014 he was properly sentenced as a second felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">. Though not determinative, we note that nothing in the record suggests that defendant resided outside of a state correctional facility for any period of time while participating in the day-reporting program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\">. These factors, among others, distinguish day-reporting programs from parole. In addition, unlike parole, the privilege of participation in a day-reporting program may be revoked without a hearing or other process (see Correction Law \u00a7 855 [6], [9]; 7 NYCRR 1904.1, 1927.5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b755-8\">R.S. Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK-\">(dissenting). \u201cIncarcerated\u201d is not an ambiguous word. It means locked up in prison. Defendant in this case was not incarcerated during the time in question. He not only worked outside the prison walls, but ate and slept in an \u201capproved residence\u201d \u2014 which can mean, and in this case apparently did mean, the home of his family <em>(see </em>7 NYCRR 1925.2, 1927.4, 1901.1 [c] [2] [i] [a]). The facts relied on by the majority \u2014 that defendant was required to report to a certain location daily, to undergo frequent drug tests, perhaps to participate in rehabilitative programs, and to sign a document to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that his nonincarcerated status \u201cmay be revoked at any time\u201d (majority op at <em>650) </em>\u2014 do not alter the simple fact that he was not incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Relying on the phrase \u201cextended bounds of confinement\u201d \u2014 a phrase used in the Correction Law in a different context <em>(see </em>Correction Law <em>\u00a7 851 </em>[10]) \u2014 the majority essentially turns the word \u201cincarcerated\u201d into a metaphor. Because defendant was not free to go anywhere he liked, the majority reasons, he was in a sense \u201cconfined,\u201d and \u201cin that sense \u2018incarcerated\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 650). But there is no reason to think that the Legislature was speaking metaphorically when, in Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) (b) (v), it excluded \u201cany period of time during which the person was incarcerated\u201d from the 10-year period prescribed in the statute governing second felony offenders (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The point of the exclusion is obvious: People who are incarcerated have little opportunity to commit felonies, and so do not get credit for the time in which they did not do so. The opportunities for criminal conduct by a person no longer incarcerated \u2014 even if he is required to report daily to a specified location \u2014 are incomparably greater. Defendant\u2019s situation during his time in the day reporting program was not greatly different from that of someone on probation or parole \u2014 who, it is undisputed, is not \u201cincarcerated\u201d within the meaning of this statute. The line the majority draws is thus less satisfactory than the one the Legislature drew \u2014 between people who are in prison and who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Smith dissents in a separate opinion; Judge Pigott taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
