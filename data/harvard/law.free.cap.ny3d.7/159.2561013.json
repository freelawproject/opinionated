Fundamental principles of economics, previously embraced by this Court, require that the \u201cdiscount rate\u201d used to determine the \u201cpresent value\u201d of awards also be used as the interest rate for the interval of time for which the awards are discounted to present value. <em>(Matter of Oil Spill by Amoco Cadiz Off Coast of France on Mar. 16, 1978, </em>954 F2d 1279; <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v Pfeifer, 462 US </em>523; <em>Wetzler v Sisters of Charity Hosp., </em>17 AD3d 1088; <em>Abellard v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

We conclude that the Court of Claims did not abuse its discretion and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In 1992, Sarah J. Denio sustained serious personal injuries in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in Niagara County. Her car was struck by a vehicle driven by Eric B. Poler, who lost control of his automobile on a wet roadway. Denio suffered a traumatic brain injury, as well as multiple facial fractures, two jaw fractures, five pelvic fractures, fractures in both ankles and numerous other injuries requiring years of medical treatment and rehabilitation. Claimant James S. Denio, Sarah\u2019s father, commenced this action as her guardian against defendant State of New York, alleging that the State\u2019s negligent maintenance of State Route 31 caused Poler to lose control of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">After a trial on liability issues, the Court of Claims in February 1999 found both the State and Poler negligent, apportioning 40% of the liability for Sarah\u2019s injuries to the State and 60% to Poler. The court determined that the State had notice of a preexisting dangerous roadway condition \u201cin the form of three-quarter inch wheel path rutting along with inadequate superelevation/banking on the curve,\u201d and that the State\u2019s failure to take reasonable measures to correct the defect was a proximate cause of the accident. The court further concluded that Poler\u2019s negligence was \u201cthe main cause\u201d of the collision based on his vehicle\u2019s three bald tires and expert testimony that he was speeding and did not react properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Following a bifurcated trial on damages, the Court of Claims awarded claimant $4,248,879.33. Before judgment was entered, the parties stipulated to CPLR article 50-B calculations, except for the rate of interest that the State owed on the award from the date of the liability determination until the entry of judgment <em>(see </em>CPLR 5002), and from the entry of judgment to the date of final payment <em>(see </em>CPLR 5003). The rate of interest to be charged against the State for prejudgment and postjudgment interest under State Finance Law \u00a7 16 was in dispute between the parties \u2014 claimant sought a rate of nine percent, while the State urged the application of a lower interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>After reviewing the proof presented by the parties, the Court of Claims found claimant\u2019s position \u201cmore persuasive\u201d and ordered the application of a nine percent rate for both prejudgment and postjudgment interest. In January 2003, the court entered a judgment reflecting the CPLR article 50-B stipulations, together with a nine percent interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The Appellate Division modified the award by increasing the damages recovery to more than $5 million, but otherwise affirmed the judgment and remitted the case to the Court of Claims for further CPLR article 50-B proceedings. During the pendency of their appeals to the Appellate Division, the parties stipulated to a partial payment of the January 2003 judgment. Upon issuance of the Appellate Division order, the parties further agreed to the form and amount of the judgment, expressly preserving their respective interest rate arguments. Judgment was entered and the State made a second payment in September 2005, thereby satisfying payment of all damages awarded to claimant, along with a prejudgment and postjudgment interest payment to the extent the State deemed appropriate. We granted the State and claimant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The State contends that the Court of Claims erred in applying a nine percent interest rate for prejudgment and post-judgment purposes because the court improperly relied on evidence of stock market rates of return in determining a reasonable rate. Instead, the State submits that trial courts applying \u201cceiling\u201d rate statutes, such as State Finance Law \u00a7 16, should calculate an interest rate based on short-term, risk-free US Treasury rates for the applicable time period covering the payment term of the judgment. Alternatively, the State suggests that trial courts should be limited to using short-term money market interest rates as the suitable benchmark but that, in no event, should equities be considered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">A successful plaintiff in a personal injury action is entitled to interest \u201cfrom the date the verdict was rendered or the report or decision was made to the date of entry of final judgment\u201d (CPLR 5002), as well as from the entry of judgment to the date of payment (CPLR 5003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The applicable rate of interest is nine percent per year \u201cexcept where otherwise provided by statute\u201d (CPLR 5004). This case involves one such exception. State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Finance Law \u00a7 16 provides that \u201c[t]he rate of interest to be paid by the state upon any judgment or accrued claim against the state shall not exceed nine per centum per annum.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">In <em>Rodriguez v New York City Hous. Auth. </em>(91 NY2d 76 [1997]), we addressed Public Housing Law \u00a7 157 (5), a comparable \u201cshall not exceed\u201d interest rate statute. The primary issue there was whether the nine percent interest rate was mandatory or whether Supreme Court had discretion to apply a lower rate. In resolving that question, we traced the historical underpinnings of CPLR 5004, the provision governing interest rates generally, in relation to the subject statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">First, we noted that prior to 1972, CPLR 5004 provided that \u201c[i]nterest shall be at the legal rate, except where otherwise prescribed by statute.\u201d At the time, the legal rate was \u201cbased upon the variable rate of interest on the loan or forbearance of money as set by the Banking Board, or, if no rate had been prescribed by the Banking Board, the rate of 6% per annum\u201d (Rodriguez, 91 NY2d at 78). The Legislature amended CPLR 5004 in 1972 to replace the variable rate with a fixed interest rate of \u201csix per centum per annum\u201d (L 1972, ch 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In the years following the adoption of this amendment, interest rates increased dramatically, making it more attractive for defendants to use funds that would otherwise have been paid to plaintiffs rather than borrow monies. As a result of this development, the Advisory Committee on Civil Practice issued a report in 1981 in support of a rate increase from six percent to nine percent. The report pointed out that the use of delaying tactics permitted defendants to take advantage of the economic situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cThe Committee has had reported to it many examples of a party\u2019s litigation conduct apparently motivated by the low interest rate contained in CPLR 5004. When the sums involved in the case are large, it is self-evident that the longer the defendant delays the case \u2014 assuming that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail \u2014 the longer the defendant will be able to keep money at a six percent rate that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>would have to pay two, three or even four times more for on the money market. Instances have been reported to us of patently unmeritorious appeals taken in commercial cases merely to obtain the delay, and of tort appeals, where possible in bifurcated trials, of liability findings just to postpone the trial of the damages issue\u201d (1981 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2658).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The Legislature adopted the recommendation and adjusted CPLR 5004\u2019s interest rate upward to nine percent in 1981 <em>(see </em>L 1981, ch 258).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In 1982, the Legislature decided to increase the ceiling limit for interest relating to certain governmental entities in order to parallel the CPLR 5004 nine percent interest rate enacted a year earlier <em>(see </em>L 1982, ch 681). As justification for the rate increase, the Legislature indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201c[t]he current rate of interest on claims paid by public owners in this state ranges from 3% for local governments, to 4% for various public corporations to 6% by the State. Since the mid-1970\u2019s the rate of interest in the private marketplace has exceeded these amounts often to a substantial degree\u201d (Senate Introducer Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1982, ch 681).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It was further recognized that the low statutory interest rates gave public entities \u201cno incentive whatsoever to enter into reasonable negotiations\u201d aimed at settlement <em>(id.). </em>Significantly, however, the Legislature chose to leave in place the \u201cshall not exceed\u201d qualifying language when it amended Public Housing Law \u00a7 157 (5), State Finance Law \u00a7 16, General Municipal Law \u00a7 3-a and Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Against this backdrop of legislative history, in <em>Rodriguez </em>we interpreted Public Housing Law \u00a7 157 (5) as imposing \u201ca not-to-be-exceeded maximum, instead of a statutorily fixed, rate of interest,\u201d and determined that a trial court may, under appropriate circumstances, exercise its discretion and apply a lower rate (91 NY2d at 80). We further described the nine percent rate as \u201cpresumptively fair and reasonable\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 81). Similar to the posture of the State on this appeal, the Housing Authority asked this Court in <em>Rodriguez </em>to limit the trial court\u2019s consideration to \u201crelatively safe\u201d investments such as US Treasury securities \u201cbased on the assumption that a reasonable plaintiff would have placed the verdict or judgment amount in\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>such investment vehicles <em>(id. </em>at 80). We expressly declined to adopt this restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Since <em>Rodriguez, </em>appellate courts addressing \u201cshall not exceed\u201d interest rate statutes have uniformly held that trial judges should examine \u201call reasonable investment possibilities during the relevant time period,\u201d including both private and public securities, in determining whether to apply a rate less than the ceiling rate <em>(Auer v State of New York, </em>283 AD2d 122, 126 [3d Dept 2001]; <em>see also Abiele Contr. v New York City School Constr. Auth., </em>6 AD3d 366, 367 [2d Dept 2004]; <em>Matter of New York State Urban Dev. Corp. [Alphonse Hotel Corp.], </em>293 AD2d 354, 355 [1st Dept 2002]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Recognizing that <em>Rodriguez </em>rejected the exclusive use of US Treasury rates as a benchmark, all four Departments have concluded that it would be illogical and unfair to focus exclusively on the lowest-returning investments in deciding whether to assign a lower interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We endorse the reasoning of these decisions. Interest is designed to compensate for the loss that results when a claimant is \u201cdeprived of the use of money to which he or she was entitled from the moment that liability was determined\u201d <em>(Love v State of New York, </em>78 NY2d 540, 545 [1991]). If a successful claimant was able to access a monetary award immediately, the claimant could invest those proceeds in a wide range of prudent investment choices, including money market funds, corporate bonds or reasonably-risked equity funds. Hence, it makes sense to consider a full spectrum of investments \u2014 both public and private \u2014 in determining an appropriate rate of interest. It follows that the most logical approach when attempting to persuade a trial court to apply a lower rate would be to demonstrate that an array of reasonable and balanced investment alternatives produces a return lower than nine percent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARjc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>To rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded State Finance Law \u00a7 16\u2019s maximum rate, the State bears the burden of proffering substantial evidence that rates of return on both public and private investments during the relevant period are below nine percent <em>(see generally Matter of Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v American Pen Corp., </em>94 NY2d 154, 158 n 1 [1999]; <em>Matter of FMC Corp. [Peroxygen Chems. Div.] v Unmack, </em>92 NY2d 179, 187 [1998]). Substantial evidence \u201c \u2018consists of proof within the whole record of such quality and quantity as to generate conviction in and persuade a fair and detached fact finder that, from that proof as a premise, a conclusion or ultimate fact may be extracted reasonably \u2014 probatively and logically\u2019 \u201d <em>(FMC Corp., </em>92 NY2d at 188, quoting <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d 176, 181 [1978]). Once the presumption has been rebutted, the claimant has the burden of coming forward with evidence tending to show that a higher rate, up to the statutory maximum, is reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">When faced with opposing parties\u2019 interest rate evidence, a trial court must weigh the evidence to determine an appropriate rate in the exercise of its discretion. Ordinarily, in weighing the evidence, the court may find a range of reasonable rates and as long as the rate selected is supported by a rational view of the evidence, no abuse of discretion will occur. As we stated in <em>Rodriguez, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that another interest computation may also be \u2018reasonable\u2019 does not mandate the selection of that rate in an exercise of discretion\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, </em>91 NY2d at 81). Only where the State goes so far as to establish that the ceiling rate is unreasonable would the selection of that rate amount to an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of discretion, because a court may not reasonably apply an unreasonable rate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In this case, the State sought the application of an interest rate lower than nine percent. Through an economist, the State advocated the use of \u201cbenchmark\u201d rates derived from US Treasury securities, whose maturity coincided with the length of time the verdict remained unpaid. The State\u2019s expert opined that a prejudgment interest rate of 5.35% was appropriate based on the interest rate for a US government security purchased in March 1999 with a maturity date in late 2002. He further recommended a postjudgment interest rate ranging from 1.76% to 2.13% premised on US government securities with one- and two-year maturity dates. The State also submitted evidence of interest rates associated with other low-risk financial instruments, including longer term US government securities and short-term money market instruments. Relying on Federal Reserve statistics, the State\u2019s economist calculated the monthly interest rates on five such instruments: \u201c3 Year Treasury notes, 4.97%; 10 Year Treasury bonds, 5.47%; 30 Year Treasury bonds, 5.76%; Aaa rated bonds, 7.17% and state and local bonds, 5.39%.\u201d Although maintaining that stock market performance was irrelevant, the State nonetheless presented proof indicating that stock market rates of return were also below nine percent for the relevant time period. For example, the State submitted a portfolio composed of \u201c60% equity exposure and 40% fixed income with a portion maintained in liquid short-term investments\u201d that would have yielded a rate of return of negative 1.93%.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In opposing a lower rate, claimant argued that the State\u2019s proposed rates were too restrictive and failed to consider other safe investment vehicles historically yielding higher rates. In support of his position that the nine percent rate should be used, claimant offered a sampling of investment portfolios achieving rates of return ranging from 9.03% to 12.96%. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>first portfolio proposed 75% from stock indices (allocating 25% to the S &amp; P 500, 25% to the S &amp; P MidCap 400 Index and 25% to the S &amp; P SmallCap 600 Index) and 25% from a fixed income securities index (measured by the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index), yielding an annual return of 9.03% between 1999 and 2002. A second portfolio using the same investments achieved a rate of return of 12.47% from 1993 to 2002. A third portfolio allocating 75% to the S &amp; P 500 and 25% to fixed income securities resulted in an annual return of 12.96% between 1975 and 2001. Claimant also submitted evidence demonstrating that an average of five portfolio choices achieved an annual return of 9.32% between 1951 and 2002. Finally, claimant\u2019s expert predicted that the stock market was expected to improve by late 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Based on the foregoing, the State presented substantial evidence that both private and public reasonable investments could have resulted in rates of return less than nine percent during the relevant time period. The State therefore rebutted the presumption that nine percent should be applied. In response, claimant came forward with evidence to support application of the statutory maximum rate. It is clear that the Court of Claims then weighed the conflicting evidence in making its determination to apply the nine percent rate for both prejudgment and postjudgment interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Appellate Division affirmed, although it was, of course, free to exercise its own discretion in reviewing the evidence underlying the Court of Claims\u2019 chosen rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">When we are presented \u201cwith affirmed findings of fact, tending to show that the rate of interest was not unreasonable, and [where] these findings are supported by substantial evidence, we are jurisdictionally precluded from reviewing the same\u201d <em>(City of Buffalo v Clement Co., </em>28 NY2d 241, 266 [1971]; <em>see also Humphrey v State of New York, </em>60 NY2d 742, 743-744 [1983]). Here, claimant submitted, in relevant part, evidence that a portfolio allocating 75% to equities \u2014 as measured by three well-known stock indices \u2014 and 25% to debentures achieved a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>rate of return of 9.03% during the relevant period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State did not directly challenge the reasonableness of claimant\u2019s investment portfolio selections. While evidence that a single portfolio supports the nine percent rate is admittedly slim and represents the outer limits of sufficiency, we are not prepared to say that such evidence was inadequate as a matter of law to uphold the Court of Claims\u2019 decision. We note that, based on the entirety of this record, either court below would have been justified in applying a lesser rate. Nevertheless, because the record supports its use of the nine percent rate, we are precluded from further review and conclude that the Court of Claims did not abuse its discretion in utilizing a rate of nine percent for prejudgment and postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Finally, we note that New York\u2019s pre-1972 method of indexing an interest rate was somewhat akin to the floating interest index used by the federal courts. Since 1982, federal law requires the calculation of rates for postjudgment interest based on US Treasury securities <em>(see </em>28 USC \u00a7 1961 [a] [computing interest \u201cat a rate equal to the weekly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the date of the judgment\u201d]). Other states have likewise enacted statutory indexing methods to calculate various forms of interest <em>(see e.g. </em>Fla Stat Ann \u00a7 55.03; Iowa Code Ann \u00a7 668.13; Mich Comp Laws Ann \u00a7 600.6013; Minn Stat Ann \u00a7 549.09). If the New York State Legislature desires to model its interest statutes after these standards in order to reduce public expenditures or to better reflect market fluctuations in interest rates, it can certainly do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On the cross appeal, the affirmed findings of fact with respect to the apportionment of liability are supported by the record. Therefore, this matter is beyond our review <em>(see Scheemaker v State of New York, </em>70 NY2d 985, 986 [1988]; <em>Humphrey, </em>60 NY2d at 743-744).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Claims appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\">. In this case, claimant was entitled to prejudgment interest from February 1999 to January 2003, and postjudgment interest from January 2003 until September 2005, when the State made its final payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\">. A number of statutes governing the interest rate applicable to judgments against governmental entities contain similar language <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 3-a [counties, cities, towns and villages]; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212 [6] [New York City Transit Authority]; McKinney\u2019s Uncons Laws of NY \u00a7 2501 [L 1939, ch 585, as amended] [various public improvement corporations]; Public Housing Law \u00a7 157 [5] [public housing authorities]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. With this case, the Fourth Department has now joined the other three Departments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">. We emphasize that the foregoing analysis applies only where a governmental entity requests that the court exercise its discretion to apply a rate lower than the ceiling rate set by State Finance Law \u00a7 16. The dissent nevertheless claims that our opinion \u201cunsettl[es] our established condemnation jurisprudence\u201d (dissenting op at 175). We do no such thing. In the condemnation arena, a condemnee entitled to prejudgment interest may argue that the ceiling rate is too low and consequently \u201cwould result in a denial of just compensation, or unfairness\u201d <em>(Matter of Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v American Pen Corp., </em>94 NY2d 154, 158 n 1 [1999]). In that situation, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>has no discretion to apply a higher rate; rather, only where the condemnee establishes that the ceiling rate is unreasonably low in comparison to market rates will the court impose a higher rate (see <em>Matter of City of New York [Brookfield Refrig. Corp.</em>\u2014Zoloto], 58 NY2d 532, 537 [1983] [fixing a higher rate based on medium term public securities]). Evidence of stock market rates plays no part in this analysis because the most logical way to demonstrate that the ceiling rate is constitutionally inadequate is to present evidence that even the interest rates for the most conservative investments \u2014 such as US Treasury securities \u2014 are higher than the rate set by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\">. A claimant cannot simply present a portfolio of common stocks that fared particularly well during the relevant time period since hindsight surely benefits a claimant\u2019s selection of proposed investment options. A claimant must instead proffer balanced investment alternatives for the court to consider, which may include government securities, reasonably-risked corporate bond indices, money market vehicles and recognized indices for low-to-moderately-risked securities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">. Hence, we disagree with <em>Auer </em>to the extent it indicates that a trial court\u2019s discretion is triggered only after the defendant demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cthat the statutory rate is unreasonably high\u201d <em>(Auer, </em>283 AD2d at 126). Rather, the court\u2019s discretion is implicated when it is presented with evidence that a rate less than nine percent would also be reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">. The rate was calculated using an annual return of negative 8.55% as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (S &amp; P) 500, and an annual return of 7.99% as measured by the Lehman Brothers Intermediate Government/ Corporate Index.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. Thus, we do not agree with the dissent\u2019s suggestion that this case be remitted to the Court of Claims to perform a weight of the evidence analysis. The Court of Claims would have had no basis for finding claimant\u2019s evidence \u201cmore persuasive\u201d had it not been weighing the evidence in its selection of the nine percent rate in the exercise of its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\">. On the other hand, claimant\u2019s other portfolios covering various time periods ranging back to the 1950\u2019s are not relevant to the calculation of prejudgment and postjudgment interest commencing in 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Read and R.S. Smith, JJ.</author>\n<p id=\"AKNB\">(dissenting in part). The majority\u2019s opinion is wrong in several ways. First, it is wrong because it confuses two different things \u2014 a reasonable rate of interest and a reasonable return on investment. Under the statute, claimant is entitled to the former, subject to a 9% limitation. The majority reads it as though she were entitled to the latter, subject to the same limitation. The majority\u2019s misreading of the statute to authorize awards based on stock market rates of return leads into complexities and contradictions that, we fear, will in practice be resolved by awarding the 9% maximum in every case \u2014 a result contrary to the plain intention of the Legislature, as the Court held in <em>Rodriguez v New York City Hous. Auth. </em>(91 NY2d 76 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Secondly, the majority\u2019s injection of equity rates of return into interest calculations has disturbing implications for the law of condemnation \u2014 an area in which, as the Constitution requires, interest rates are determined without a strict 9% maximum. If the logic of the majority opinion is applied in condemnation cases, condemnees may seek enormous interest rates when the stock market is booming, and condemnors may seek to use the majority opinion in reverse, with unpredictable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Finally, the majority opinion is wrong on its own terms. Even if it is correct to use equity rates of return as part of an interest calculation, the record here does not justify the decisions of the courts below, which the majority affirms. The Court should, at a minimum, remit this case to the Court of Claims for determination of a \u201creasonable\u201d interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">State Finance Law \u00a7 16 provides: \u201cThe rate of interest to be paid by the state upon any judgment or accrued claim against the state shall not exceed nine per centum per annum.\u201d <em>Rodriguez </em>makes clear that under this statute, the trial court is to fix a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d rate, equal to or lower than 9%, in the exercise of its discretion (91 NY2d at 80). We said in <em>Rodriguez </em>that, since 9% is the rate generally applied in cases between private parties (CPLR 5004), that rate is \u201cpresumptively fair and reasonable\u201d (91 NY2d at 81), but that does not mean that 9% may be awarded in every case. The presumption is rebut-table.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">What the statute provides for is a \u201crate of interest.\u201d In deciding what rate is reasonable it is important to remember what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u201cinterest\u201d is: \u201ca charge for borrowed money\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 610 [10th ed 1993]). In cases like this the State has, in effect, borrowed a claimant\u2019s money for a period of time ending with the date the judgment is paid. Thus the question a court should ask is: \u201cWhat is a fair and reasonable rate of interest for a loan of this amount by this claimant to the State over this period of time?\u201d Here, there is no way that the answer to that question can be 9%.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Claimant\u2019s involuntary loan, an obligation of the State, was virtually risk free. The interest rate on three-year Treasury bonds \u2014 risk-free instruments comparable in duration to the loan at issue here \u2014 was roughly 5% or 6% throughout the time in question. We do not imply that the interest rate in a case like this must always be identical to the rate on corresponding Treasury obligations. But it is clear here that the State\u2019s proposed prejudgment interest rate of 5.35% was within the range of reasonable choices, and that 9% was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Claimant\u2019s argument for the 9% rate, which the majority accepts, is essentially that she was entitled to more than interest on her money. She did not, she points out, choose to make a loan to the State; if she had had the money she might have invested part or all of it in the stock market, and earned a better return. The short answer is that the Legislature has not said she is entitled to the return on investment she might have earned elsewhere; it has said she is entitled to \u201cinterest.\u201d No court outside New York, as far as we know, has ever held that \u201cinterest\u201d may be calculated on the basis of stock market returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The majority seems to have accepted, as did the courts below, claimant\u2019s argument that it is unfair to limit her to a reasonable interest rate on a risk-free loan. Of course, courts are not free to revise the Legislature\u2019s enactments to achieve greater fairness <em>(Matter of Bello v Roswell Park Cancer Inst., </em>5 NY3d 170, 173 [2005]). But apart from that, the majority\u2019s quest for a truly \u201cfair\u201d rate of return cannot succeed. No one can know what rate of return claimant would have earned if she had had the money to invest as she chose, because no one can know whether she would have been wise or unwise, lucky or unlucky. Implicit in the majority\u2019s decision is that this problem may be solved by assuming claimant to be a typical prudent investor, but that assumption has its own problems, because there are times \u2014 and the 1999-2002 period considered in this case was one such time \u2014 when, because the stock market is in decline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>most prudent investors will do worse than those who lend out their money at a risk-free rate. The record in this case shows that even a relatively conservative investor, who put only 60% of her money into equities that tracked the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500, would have suffered a net loss of around 2% annually <em>(see </em>infra at 178-179).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Thus the approach of assuming the claimant to be a typical prudent investor can lead, in this and in some other cases, to awarding less than a risk-free rate; in strict logic, it could lead to awarding no interest, and even to awarding less than 100% of the principal. These results are obviously unacceptable, and it is probably for that reason that the Appellate Division in <em>Auer v State of New York </em>(283 AD2d 122 [3d Dept 2001]) adopted a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d variation on the \u201cprudent investor\u201d approach. <em>Auer </em>holds, in substance, that a 9% rate of return will be held \u201creasonable\u201d unless the evidence shows that <em>no </em>prudent investor could possibly have hit that target: \u201c[T]he defendant must show that <em>all </em>reasonable investment possibilities during the relevant time period demonstrate that the [9%] statutory rate is unreasonably high . . .\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 126 [emphasis added]; <em>accord, Matter of New York State Urban Dev. Corp. [Alphonse Hotel Corp.], </em>293 AD2d 354, 355 [1st Dept 2002]). This will probably never happen; there will always be some \u201creasonable\u201d portfolio, chosen with the benefit of hindsight, that can produce a 9% return. The evidence in this case, which we analyze in detail below (infra at 178-179), illustrates the point: in a low interest rate environment, with the stock market going steeply down, claimant came up with a \u201creasonable\u201d combination of investments that yielded, miraculously, 9.03%.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The <em>Auer </em>approach is unfair to the State, and it completely frustrates the direction of the Legislature, confirmed by our holding in <em>Rodriguez, </em>that a rate below 9% is sometimes appropriate. The Appellate Division relied on <em>Auer </em>in this case. The majority affirms the Appellate Division\u2019s order and says that it \u201cendorse[s]\u201d the reasoning of <em>Auer </em>(majority op at 167), but it seems to reject, in a footnote, <em>Auer\u2019s </em>key element \u2014 its virtually irrebuttable presumption in favor of 9% (majority op at 169 n 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The majority\u2019s approach, as we understand it, is that the trial court is free to pick any \u201creasonable\u201d rate of return. It does not say how the court is to choose, nor whether there is any floor; may the court choose a return below the risk-free rate, or even a negative return, if that is \u201creasonable\u201d? Nor does the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ity explain how it can affirm the decision below, while rejecting its fundamental premise. As we show below, the majority is affirming a decision that the courts below did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The likely practical effect of the majority\u2019s decision, despite its disclaimer, will be to drive all decisions into the 9% safe harbor that <em>Auer </em>created. It would be better, we think, to follow the statute, and <em>Rodriguez, </em>by requiring courts to award a reasonable \u201crate of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The majority decision also has the untoward side effect of unsettling our established condemnation jurisprudence. Before today, this Court required a condemnee challenging the fairness and reasonableness of the presumptively reasonable statutory rate to do so by comparing it to <em>prevailing market rates of interest (see e.g. Matter of City of New York [Brookfield Refrig. Corp.</em>\u2014Zoloto], 58 NY2d 532, 536-537 [1983]; <em>Matter of County of Nassau [Eveandra Enters.], </em>42 NY2d 849 [1977]; <em>Adventurers Whitestone Corp. v City of New York, </em>65 NY2d 83 [1985]). The Court never considered rates of return on \u201creasonably-risked equity funds\u201d (majority op at 167) to be relevant. Indeed, the idea of doing so is sufficiently fanciful that the California Supreme Court dismissed it in a footnote 21 years ago (see <em>Redevelopment Agency v Gilmore, </em>38 Cal 3d 790, 806 n 17, 700 P2d 794, 806 n 17 [1985] [\u201c(S)ince interest is at issue, only the rates of return on interest-bearing obligations are relevant. No case has suggested that the Constitution contemplates a \u2018prudent investor\u2019 in stocks or other equity securities\u201d], citing <em>City of New York; see also Liberty Sq. Dev. Trust v City of Worcester, </em>441 Mass 605, 808 NE2d 245 [2004] [holding that an adequate rate of prejudgment interest for a taking reflects what a prudent investor would earn in the usual interest markets], <em>citing Redevelopment Agency </em>and <em>City of New York).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">But now the majority has held that the rate of return on reasonably-risked equity funds, selected in hindsight, is indeed relevant to the judicial determination of fair and reasonable prejudgment interest in New York. The implications and consequences of this for condemnees and condemnors are unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Can a condemnee now rebut the presumption that 9% is reasonable by presenting hypothetical portfolios of stocks and bonds with a rate of return in excess of 9% for the period of delay between the taking and payment? This would be an easy hurdle to clear when the period of delay coincides generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>with a strong bull market, as was the case in the late 1990\u2019s. Of course, as the evidence in this case, which we analyze below, demonstrates, a hypothetical portfolio of stocks and bonds may be crafted to exhibit almost any rate of return, regardless of general market conditions, so long as a major part of the portfolio may be allocated to any combination of well-recognized indices (of which there are many) after their performance is already known. Or would the condemnee have to show that prevailing market rates also significantly exceeded 9%? Suppose there is a return to double-digit interest rates \u2014 the feature of the economic landscape in the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s which prompted the Legislature to raise the ceiling rate from 6% to 9% <em>(see </em>majority op at 165-166). In that event, may a trial judge in his discretion still award interest to the condemnee at the rate of 9% so long as the condemnor presents a single hypothetical portfolio of stocks and bonds returning 9% or less? The majority seems to say that equity rates of return are still not relevant to the question of the fairness of the statutory rate in a condemnation case <em>(see </em>majority op at 168 n 4 [\u201cEvidence of stock market rates plays no part in this analysis\u201d]). But a condemnee is entitled to prejudgment interest as part of constitutionally required just compensation. By contrast, a tort claimant obtains prejudgment interest only as a matter of legislative grace. Why, then, is it the tort claimant and not the condemnee who gets the benefit of stock returns? Does this pass constitutional muster?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The majority concludes that the State has rebutted the statutory presumption, but then opines that \u201c[i]t is clear that the Court of Claims then weighed the conflicting evidence [presented by the State and claimant] in making its determination to apply the nine percent rate for both prejudgment and postjudgment interest\u201d; and that this determination is beyond review in this Court because it is supported by affirmed findings of fact (majority op at 170). The record supporting these affirmed findings \u2014 which the majority concedes dwells at \u201cthe outer limits of sufficiency\u201d \u2014 consists of a single hypothetical portfolio, allocated 75% to equities and 25% to bonds, which exhibited an annual average rate of return of 9.03% during the relevant time period (majority op at 171). In fact, however, there is no basis for the majority to conclude that the trial judge ever weighed the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence, much less made findings of fact related to the conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The relevant part of the trial judge\u2019s opinion reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cThe court has <em>reviewed all of the arguments </em>presented by both claimant and defendant and their experts on the pre-judgment and post-judgment interest rate issue, and <em>finds the position of the claimant more persuasive. </em>The court does not believe the defendant has overcome the presumption of reasonableness and fairness attributed to the statutory interest rate of 9%. Consequently, the court finds the rate of interest payable will be 9% for the period from the date of the liability decision to the date of entry of final judgment herein, and 9% for the period from the date of entry of final judgment to the date of payment or delivery of the annuity contract, whichever is appropriate\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">While the majority states that \u201c[i]t is clear that the Court of Claims . . . weighed the conflicting evidence\u201d (majority op at 170 [emphasis added]) and \u201c[a]fter reviewing the <em>proof </em>presented by the parties, the Court of Claims found claimant\u2019s position \u2018more persuasive\u2019 and ordered the application of a nine percent rate\u201d (majority op at 164 [emphasis added]), the trial judge did not mention weighing \u201cevidence\u201d or reviewing \u201cproof.\u201d Instead, he stated that after reviewing the parties\u2019 <em>arguments </em>\u2014 hardly the same thing as proof or evidence \u2014 he found the claimant\u2019s <em>position </em>\u2014 again, not proof or evidence\u2014 \u201cmore persuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Secondly, the trial judge erroneously decided that the State had not \u201covercome the presumption of reasonableness and fairness attributed to the statutory interest rate of 9%.\u201d After concluding (albeit incorrectly) that the State had not rebutted the presumption and \u201c [consequently\u201d awarding claimant interest at 9%, the judge had no reason to weigh the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence, and the majority has no basis for assuming that he nonetheless took this unnecessary step. Certainly, there is no indication on the face of the judge\u2019s opinion that he did so. There are no findings of fact stated in his opinion, or discussions of the proof, which in and of itself constitutes reversible error by forestalling meaningful appellate review. The absence of any explanation (assuming the trial judge, in fact, weighed the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence) is particularly worrisome in this case because claimant\u2019s proof is, as the majority charitably labels it, \u201cadmittedly slim\u201d (majority op at 171).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Specifically, of the three hypothetical portfolios that claimant presented, each of which allocated 75% to equities and 25% to bonds, only one covered the relevant time period, as the majority acknowledges. If the trial judge relied on either of the two irrelevant portfolios to find in claimant\u2019s favor, he abused his discretion as a matter of law. There is no way to know what proof of claimant\u2019s the judge may have considered \u2014 again assuming that he weighed the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence in the first place \u2014 because his opinion is silent on the point. Further, claimant\u2019s portfolio evidence was, in fact, disputed; the majority is just wrong when it states that \u201c[t]he State did not directly challenge the reasonableness of claimant\u2019s investment portfolio selections\u201d (majority op at 171).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The three hypothetical portfolios were attachments to claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s affidavit. He stated that he secured them from UBS/PaineWebber and that each was \u201ctied to well known market indices\u201d for various time periods. There is no explanation or justification in the record as to why UBS/PaineWebber allocated 75% of each of these three hypothetical portfolios to equities and 25% to bonds. Claimant\u2019s attorney submitted only a chart captioned \u201cPerformance Results Based on Various Portfolio Asset Allocations.\u201d There is no indication who prepared this chart, which identifies a 75% equity/25% fixed income portfolio as a \u201cgrowth\u201d portfolio, not a \u201cbalanced\u201d portfolio. The majority, by contrast, says that a claimant \u201cmust. . . proffer <em>balanced </em>investment alternatives . . . , which may include government securities, reasonably-risked corporate bond indices, money market vehicles and recognized indices for <em>low-to-moderately-risked </em>securities\u201d (majority op at 168 n 5 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Next, the State submitted its expert\u2019s affidavit. Although the State\u2019s expert opined that returns on equities were not a proper benchmark for setting a prejudgment interest rate, he nonetheless looked at the rate of return that a hypothetical \u201cprudent investor\u201d would have received over the relevant time period, assuming 60% invested in equities (measured by the S &amp; P 500) and 40% invested in fixed income securities with a portion maintained in liquid short-term investments (measured by the Lehman Brothers Intermediate Government/Corporate Index). The rate of return was a negative 1.93%.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In reply, claimant finally presented the affidavit of <em>her </em>expert, who likewise \u201crecommend[ed] the 60%/40% balanced investment approach [which] represents a prudent investment\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>conceded that the State\u2019s expert \u201cis correct that if a 60% S&amp;P and 40% LBIN is used[,] the rate of return for the pre-judgment period in <em>Denio </em>would be -1.93%.\u201d He squared this uncomfortable fact with his opinion that the statutory rate of 9% was nonetheless \u201cappropriate\u201d by observing that, based on historical patterns, the market was likely to rebound and perform better over the long term. But the expert\u2019s prediction about the long-term future is not relevant to the proper rates of prejudgment and postjudgment interest in this case <em>(see </em>majority op at 171 n 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In short, the State disputed both claimant\u2019s investment portfolio choices and her unexplained 75%/25% allocation formula. Critically, claimant\u2019s expert opined that a prudent investor would have invested 60% in equities and 40% in bonds, yet claimant presented no evidence showing what such an investment would have returned over the relevant time period; the only competent evidence in the record for such a hypothetical portfolio, which was provided by the State\u2019s expert, concededly showed a negative return. As a result, we would hold that, as a matter of law, the State has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the 9% statutory rate of interest is unreasonably high for the time period at issue, and would remit this matter for the Court of Claims to set an interest rate below 9% within the range of the State\u2019s proof. Even if the majority is not willing to go so far, it should \u2014 having held that the State rebutted the presumption that the 9% statutory rate of interest is fair and reasonable in this case \u2014 remit to the Court of Claims for it to weigh the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence, exercise its discretion, and award interest accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In sum, the majority decision suffers from a confusion \u2014 apparently unique to New York\u2019s state courts \u2014 between interest and equity rates of return. This confusion has cost the taxpayers an additional $1 million in this case alone, and threatens to disrupt the State\u2019s condemnation jurisprudence. Even assuming that equity rates of return are relevant, the majority has taken the astonishing position that the Court has no choice but to affirm here because the trial judge must have made certain findings of fact that he had no reason to believe he needed to make, and does not say he made. And the only possible record support for these supposed findings of fact \u2014 a single hypothetical portfolio allocating 75% to equities and 25% to bonds and yielding 9.03% \u2014 was not endorsed by claimant\u2019s own expert, who instead \u201crecommend[ed] the 60%/40% balanced investment ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>proach.\u201d But the only hypothetical 60%/40% portfolio in the record showed a loss for the relevant time period. We respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick and Rosenblatt concur with Judge Graffeo; Judges Read and R.S. Smith dissent in part in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
