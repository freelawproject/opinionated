The dispute before us centers on a concession contract between the City, MDC and the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (collectively, the City), and Snapple Beverage Corporation \u2014 a marketer of popular beverages \u2014 in which Snapple drinks would be offered for sale in vending machines on City property, and Snapple through its own initiatives would market the City brand.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">When the City presented only the vending \u2014 not the marketing \u2014 portion of the contract to the New York City Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC) for a public hearing on December 8, 2003 and approval two days later, the Comptroller balked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City then sent the concession agreement to the Comptroller for registration on February 20, 2004, and the Comptroller objected by letter on March 18, 2004. Citing New York City Charter \u00a7 328 (b) (ii) and (c), the Comptroller\u2019s concerns rested on two grounds. First, he asserted that the agreement was tinged with official corruption on the part of City officials at MDC. Second, he alleged that filings by the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel \u2014 certifying that the procedures for soliciting the agreement were followed, and that the agency had the legal authority to award the contract \u2014 were improper because only the vending portion of the contract had been submitted for approval to FCRC. Only the second allegation is at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>By letter dated April 12, 2004, the Mayor responded to the Comptroller, directing him to register the contract pursuant to New York City Charter \u00a7 328 (c). On April 21, 2004, the Comptroller brought this combined special proceeding (CPLR art 78) and declaratory judgment action (CPLR 3001), seeking annulment of the contract with Snapple, a declaration that the contract was invalid and could not be implemented, and a declaration that New York City Charter \u00a7 362 (a) (defining \u201cconcession\u201d) includes intangible property. The Comptroller sought summary judgment declaring that section 362 (a) applies to all types of property; the City cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the proceeding in its entirety and raised a statute of limitations defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Supreme Court determined that the entire contract had been filed, and Charter \u00a7 328 (b) (ii) did not permit the Comptroller to raise an objection attacking only part of it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court rejected the City\u2019s statute of limitations defense, concluding that the last actions the Comptroller challenged \u2014 the filing of the contract on February 20, 2004, and the Mayor\u2019s overruling of his objections on April 12, 2004 \u2014 were within four months of the commencement of the proceeding for article 78 review and the declaratory judgment claim that grew out of it. Concluding that the statute of limitations had not yet begun to run on the claim regarding the definition of property, the court held that Charter \u00a7 362 (a), defining \u201cconcession\u201d as \u201ca grant made by an agency for the private use of city-owned property for which the city receives compensation,\u201d did not limit the meaning of \u201cproperty\u201d to \u201creal property\u201d but included intangible property. The court observed that numerous other Charter provisions used the terms \u201creal\u201d or \u201cpersonal\u201d when narrowly defining the term property, but section 362 (a) did not and thus the word \u201cproperty\u201d should be construed broadly to include intellectual property.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, concluding that Charter \u00a7 328 (b) (ii) permitted the Comptroller to object only to the existence or nonexistence of the certifications, not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>look beyond them to inspect the underlying process. Additionally, the Court agreed that the term \u201cproperty\u201d under Charter \u00a7 362 (a) includes intangibles such as intellectual property, recognizing that although the legislative history of the City Charter provision and concessions indicated the provision had been applied predominantly to real property, there was no sign of an intent to so limit its application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">As a preliminary matter, we reject the contention advanced by the City and Snapple that the statute of limitations bars the Comptroller\u2019s claim that the contract is invalid because it could not be registered properly under Charter \u00a7 328. We disagree that December 10, 2003 \u2014 the date of the FCRC vote \u2014 was the trigger date for the statute of limitations. As noted recently in <em>Matter of Best Payphones, Inc. v Department of Info. Tech. &amp; Telecom. of City of N.Y. </em>(5 NY3d 30, 34 [2005]), there are two requirements for determining when an agency action is \u201cfinal and binding upon the petitioner\u201d for article 78 statute of limitations purposes <em>(see </em>CPLR 217 [1]): the agency must have arrived at a definite position on the issue inflicting actual injury, and the injury may not be significantly ameliorated either by further administrative action or steps taken by the complaining party <em>(id. </em>at 34; <em>see also Matter of City of New York [Grand Lafayette Props. LLC], </em>6 NY3d 540 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Here, the agency determination became \u201cfinal and binding\u201d no earlier than February 20, 2004, the date the City filed the contract with the Comptroller for registration. At that point, the alleged procedural infirmity upon which the Comptroller bases his argument became irrevocable \u2014 the contracting parties had executed and filed a final, formal agreement subject to registration under section 328 (b). There was no further ameliorative administrative action expected, and the only steps left for the Comptroller were to set forth his objections on the ground that certification had not been made (\u00a7 328 [b] [ii]), and to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We agree with the City and Snapple, however, that the statute of limitations bars the Comptroller\u2019s additional claim that the contract is void based on the Mayor\u2019s failure to obtain total FCRC approval. That claim stems not from any injury asserted by the Comptroller under the Charter, but essentially from his role as an aggrieved voting member of the FCRC. On that claim, the statute began to run on December 8, 2003 \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>date the Mayor refused to submit the marketing portion of the contract to the FCRC. After that date, no further FCRC action \u2014 with respect to the marketing portion of the contract \u2014 or steps taken by the Comptroller, other than his vote, were anticipated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"> Turning to the substantive questions, we hold that under settled statutory interpretation principles, the term \u201cproperty\u201d in Charter \u00a7 362 (a) is not limited to \u201creal property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those same principles of statutory interpretation, however, compel the conclusion that the Comptroller may not, under Charter \u00a7 328 (b) (ii), transform a procedure for registering a contract into a substantive investigation of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Whether the term \u201cproperty\u201d in section 362 (a) should be limited to real property is, we acknowledge, a close question. Indeed, following approval of the Charter by the voters, Charter drafters Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr. (chair of the New York City Charter Revision Commission [NYCCRC] established in January 1989) and Eric Lane (NYCCRC\u2019s executive director and counsel) observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201c[t]he City possesses inalienable rights to its streets, highways, avenues, parks, wharves, and other public property. There is enormous demand for the use of this property. Through franchises, revocable consents, concessions, and licenses, the City has established techniques to grant permits to private entrepreneurs, such as cable, bus, and ferry compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>nies; restaurants; and newspaper purveyors, for use by the city\u2019s residents. The distinction among these uses provokes uncertainty, but we offer our view (which is now part of the Charter), and caution as Schwarz stated at one public meeting: \u2018[N] either the Kang nor the deity, in fact, has laid down immutable rules on what is a franchise, and what is a concession, and what is a revocable consent\u2019 \u201d (Schwarz and Lane, <em>The Policy and Politics of Charter Making: The Story of New York City\u2019s 1989 Charter, </em>42 NYL Sch L Rev 723, 873 and n 519 [1998]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The City makes a plausible argument that the term \u201cproperty\u201d as it relates to concessions, when analyzed within its historical and legislative context, was meant to refer only to real property. Perhaps the City\u2019s most favorable evidence that the current Charter\u2019s drafters intended the narrower meaning of \u201cproperty\u201d is found in a June 29, 1989 draft of what became section 362 (a), defining concession to mean: \u201ca grant made by any agency for the operation or management of an enterprise for profit <em>on </em>city-owned property for which the city receives compensation\u201d (see June 1989 Revised Proposals of NYCCRC [emphasis added]). This sentence, the City maintains, must employ the term \u201cproperty\u201d to refer to real property, because it is impossible to manage or operate a business \u201con\u201d intangible property. The Comptroller counters, however, that the drafters removed the word \u201con\u201d from the provision, thereby demonstrating some intent not to limit the types of property covered by section 362 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We choose to construe the term \u201cproperty\u201d in accordance with the clear legislative language recognizing that, should the City see fit, it may seek amendment of the Charter provision to reflect a narrower view of the term. It is fundamental, of course, that we turn first to the text itself when interpreting a statute, as the best evidence of legislative intent. Generally, unambiguous language is determinative, and courts must give effect to the plain meaning of a statute\u2019s terms <em>(see Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>1 NY3d 232, 239 [2003]). The terms here could not be clearer: \u201c \u2018[concession\u2019 shall mean a grant by an agency for the private use of city-owned <em>property\u201d </em>(\u00a7 362 [a] [emphasis added]). The only qualifier of the term \u201cproperty\u201d in this definition is \u201ccity-owned\u201d \u2014 not real, not personal, not tangible or intangible. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states that \u201cproperty\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201ccommonly used to denote everything which is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal\u201d (at 1095 [5th ed 1979]). We see no reason to limit \u201cproperty\u201d any more than the drafters have.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As the Comptroller emphasizes, when the drafters of the Charter meant \u201creal property\u201d in section 362, they used those words. For example, section 362 (d), defines the term \u201cRevocable Consent\u201d and twice uses the term \u201creal property,\u201d in contrast to \u201cinalienable property\u201d:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201c \u2018Revocable Consent\u2019 shall mean a grant by the city of a right, revocable at will, (1) to any person to construct and use for private use pipes, conduits and tunnels under, railroad tracks upon, and connecting bridges over inalienable property, (2) to an owner of real property or, with the consent of the owner, to a tenant of real property to use adjacent inalienable property for such purposes as may be permitted by rules of the department of transportation or the department of information technology and telecommunications or (3) to a public service corporation for facilities ancillary to, but not within, a franchise granted prior to the effective date of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Thus, within section 362 as a whole, the drafters took care to define the term \u201cproperty\u201d in no less than three distinct ways\u2014 real property (\u00a7 362 [d]), inalienable property (\u00a7 362 [d]) and City-owned property (\u00a7 362 [a]). Moreover, there are more than 50 other sections of the Charter expressly referring to \u201creal property\u201d \u2014 not \u201cproperty.\u201d We conclude that the drafters\u2019 decision not to use the term \u201creal property\u201d in section 362 (a) indicates that they did not intend the narrower construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The Comptroller also posits that in those sections where the drafters intended for property-related terms to have meanings that might vary from their commonly accepted meanings, they said so explicitly \u2014 in section 210 (8), for example, the drafters made clear that the term \u201creal property\u201d should include items such as liens and easements that are not generally viewed as real property (see <em>also </em>Charter \u00a7 1150 [12]). Thus, time after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>time, the drafters purposefully chose the term \u201creal property\u201d when that term was intended, and specially defined it or did not use it at all when something else was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Nor is it inconsistent that some sections of the Charter contemplate that many concessions will in fact be located on City-owned <em>real </em>property. For example, section 373 (a) requires the borough president (or designee) \u201cin which such . . . concession is located\u201d to serve on the FCRC reviewing the proposed concession <em>(see also </em>\u00a7 374 [b] [defining \u201cmajor concessions\u201d as those having \u201csignificant land use impacts and implications\u201d]). Naturally, the drafters would envision concessions affecting real property \u2014 the likely majority of City-owned property \u2014 and craft the Charter provisions accordingly. As this Court perceived more than a century ago in <em>Hudson Riv. Tel. Co. v Watervliet Turnpike &amp; Ry. Co. </em>(135 NY 393, 403-404 [1892]), however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201c[t]he words of the statute are to be interpreted according to their natural and obvious meaning, and, as the terms employed are not ambiguous, extrinsic facts are not available to restrict the authority which it plainly confers. ... It would be an unjust reflection upon the wisdom and intelligence of the law-making body to assume that they intended to confine the scope of their legislation to the present, and to exclude all consideration for the developments of the future. If any presumption is to be indulged in, it is that general legislative enactments are mindful of the growth and increasing needs of society, and they should be construed to encourage, rather than to embarrass the inventive and progressive tendency of the people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Former Mayor Edward I. Koch advised the drafters, moreover, that with respect to concessions, franchises and revocable consents it was essential that the new Charter recognize \u201cdifferent uses, warranting different levels of executive and legislative review . . . [and that] the new Charter be open-ended and flexible, recognizing that technological and economic developments will inevitably expand or alter the universe of uses\u201d (Mem of Mayor of City of NY Edward I. Koch to NYCCRC, dated June 5, 1989). Therefore, the former Mayor cautioned, \u201cthe Charter should speak in general categories rather than relying exclusively on current labels or activities\u201d <em>(id.). </em>As a result of our holding, FCRC review will occur for concession contracts involving intangible, as well as real City-owned property. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>as a policy matter, our interpretation of section 362 (a) is also consistent with the underlying goals of the Charter, to ensure transparency in the governmental process, and adequate checks and balances <em>(see e.g. </em>Schwarz and Lane, 42 NYL Sch L Rev at 739-743).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Applying those same general principles of statutory construction, as the City now urges, we must reject the Comptroller\u2019s position that under section 328 (b) (ii), he was entitled to inspect the process by which the City came to its agreement with Snapple.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Two provisions of the Charter are in issue. Section 327 (certification of legal authority and procedural requisites) requires that contracts not let by competitive sealed bidding must be certified, prior to filing with the Comptroller, by the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel <em>(see </em>Charter \u00a7 327 [a], [b]). Section 328 (registration of contracts by the Comptroller) provides that the Comptroller need <em>not </em>register the contract when certification pursuant to section 327 has not been made (see Charter \u00a7 328 [b] [ii]). On its face, section 328 (b) (ii) simply requires registration unless certification did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In this instance, the Comptroller argues rather circuitously that he need not comply with his statutory obligation to register the contract. He asserts that the City never submitted the marketing portion of the Snapple agreement to FCRC for review; that the mayoral certification under section 327 (a) that \u201cthe procedural requisites for the solicitation and award of the contract have been met\u201d is untrue; and he therefore cannot be compelled to register the contract under section 328 (b) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The Comptroller may deny registration, however, only if \u201ca certification required by [section 327] has not been made\u201d (\u00a7 328 [b] [ii]). The Comptroller\u2019s review as to section 327 certifications is explicitly limited by the plain terms of the statute. Section 328 (b) (ii) does not give the Comptroller the power to second-guess facially sufficient certifications provided by the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel. The delegation of duties set forth in the relevant provisions of the Charter establishes in plain language that the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel\u2014 not the Comptroller \u2014 bear the burden of determining that procedural requirements have been met and legal authority exists to award a concession contract. Thus, there is no reason to annul the Snapple contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs. The certified question should not be answered upon the ground that it is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. A voting member of the FCRC, the Comptroller cast his ballot \u2014 via designee \u2014 against the contract in a 4-2 vote to approve it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. Snapple also cross-moved for this relief but, having failed to answer the petition, it was not, in Supreme Court\u2019s view, entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. To the extent that the Comptroller raised other objections to the certifications, such as the failure of the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel to certify the contract properly before it was filed, the court found those objections waived because they were not timely raised in the Comptroller\u2019s March 18, 2004 letter. That determination is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">. The court did not address the City\u2019s statute of limitations defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">. Snapple additionally alleges that the Comptroller lacks capacity and standing to bring the claims alleged. The lower courts did not pass on these claims and the City does not join in Snapple\u2019s arguments. We conclude Snap-pie\u2019s claims are meritless. The Comptroller has the \u201cfunctional responsibility within the zone of interest to be protected\u201d \u2014 here, to insist upon certifications before registering a contract (see <em>Silver v Pataki, </em>96 NY2d 532, 537 [2001]) and thus has capacity to sue. It also seems clear that the Comptroller has standing to raise the issue whether, under section 328 (b), he may refuse to register a contract and prohibit the Mayor from implementing it on the grounds alleged. Certainly, the Comptroller has shown the existence of a cognizable \u201cinjury\u201d falling within his zone of interest (96 NY2d at 539).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">.
