Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The Town of Mount Pleasant Code allows the use of a parcel of land for \u201c[Conference and training facilities.\u201d When this zoning was adopted the property was owned by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which used it to train its own employees, and rented it to others who made similar use of it. IBM sold the property to defendant, Legion of Christ, Inc. (the Legion), an order of the Roman Catholic Church, which uses the property for the training of future priests and for other religious education. Apart from the subject matter taught, the chief difference between IBM\u2019s use and the Legion\u2019s is that many of the people now being taught are in long-term programs and thus live on the property for a year or two. We hold that, despite this difference, the property is still being used for conference and training purposes within the meaning of the Town Code, and the Legion\u2019s use is therefore permitted as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">IBM acquired the 97-acre property sometime before 1983, when the Town created a new \u201cOffice Corporate Education\u201d or \u201cOB-CE\u201d zoning district, coextensive with the property. A provision of the Town Code enacted in that year said that one of the purposes of the new district was to provide an \u201copportunity for private enterprise\u201d to educate \u201cthe employees of major corporations\u201d (Town of Mount Pleasant, Addendum to Zoning Book, June 28, 1983). IBM built a conference center on the property, which it used to train its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">IBM decided in the early 1990s that it wanted to rent out its conference center from time to time, and it asked for and was granted a change in the Town Code\u2019s description of the OB-CE district. A 1993 amendment eliminated the Code\u2019s reference to \u201cprivate enterprise\u201d and changed its language to refer to \u201cthe employees of major corporations and others\u201d <em>(see </em>Town of Mount Pleasant Code \u00a7 218-74, as amended Feb. 9, 1993). After this zoning change, IBM rented the property to profit-making and nonprofit enterprises, including a university, a college and a church. These lessees used IBM\u2019s facility for conference and training purposes without objection from the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The Town did object, however, when IBM sold the property to a tax exempt entity, the Legion, in 1996. (IBM also sold the Legion an adjacent parcel, which has been the subject of other litigation with the Town [see <em>Matter of Legion of Christ v Town </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>of Mount Pleasant, </em>1 NY3d 406 (2004)].) Before the purchase, the Town warned the Legion that it would not be permitted to use the property at issue here for \u201ca seminary,\u201d and after the purchase the Town began this action. The Town\u2019s complaint sought a judgment \u201c[declaring the use of the property ... for religious purposes to be in violation of the applicable zoning,\u201d but the Town \u2014 perhaps influenced by Congress\u2019s passage of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (42 USC \u00a7 2000cc <em>et seq. </em>[RLUIPA]) while the action was pending \u2014 has now abandoned its claim that religious use of the property is forbidden. The Town still argues, however, that the Legion is using the property as a college or seminary, and that it may not do so without a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Legion has referred to the facility it operates on the property as \u201cthe Seminary for Higher Studies\u201d and as \u201ca College of Philosophy and Theology.\u201d It has discarded these terms, however, and now describes the facility as a \u201cconference center\u201d or \u201ctraining center.\u201d It asserts that its use of the property is not materially different from IBM\u2019s. Apart from converting two rooms into chapels, the Legion has made few physical changes in the building: it uses the same bedrooms, the same rooms for preparing and serving food, the same classrooms, even the same weight room.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Those trained on the property by the Legion include \u201cbrothers in formation\u201d \u2014 members of the Legion who are studying philosophy as part of their lengthy preparation for the priesthood. These men may study and live on the property for as long as two years. A brother who completes the philosophy course receives what the Legion calls an \u201cecclesiastical degree,\u201d though the \u201cdegrees\u201d are not authorized by the State and are accepted at few, if any, other institutions. The Legion also offers classes of shorter duration for diocesan priests and laypeople; these programs, which could reasonably be called conferences, may be as brief as a week, or a single day. When IBM owned the property, the courses were, apparently, all short-term; the record does not show that any instructional program was longer than six weeks, though people teaching or administering such programs were there for as long as six months at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Supreme Court and the Appellate Division addressed two issues: whether the Legion\u2019s use complies with the Town Code and whether the Town\u2019s interpretation of the Code to prohibit that use violates RLUIPA. Supreme Court ruled in the Legion\u2019s favor on both issues and held that the Legion was entitled to at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>torneys\u2019 fees; the Appellate Division reversed both rulings and denied attorneys\u2019 fees. We now hold that the Legion\u2019s use is lawful under the Town Code. We do not reach the RLUIPA issue, and we affirm the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Town Code defines the \u201cPermitted Principal Uses\u201d of property in the OB-CE district as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201c1. Conference and training facilities to include but not be limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201ca. Continuing education activities and facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201cb. Classroom space and teaching equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201cc. Offices for staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201c2. Indoor and outdoor physical recreational facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">\u201c3. Housing and dining facilities provided that such facilities are not operated as a public hotel or public restaurant as defined in \u00a7 218-74E\u201d (Town of Mount Pleasant Code, ch 218, Schedule of Regulations, Residence Districts IIIA.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The Legion uses the property as the Town Code specifies. It conducts brief programs that could be labeled \u201c[c]onference[s]\u201d and it provides \u201ctraining\u201d to its brothers in formation and others. Substantially all of its activities consist of \u201c[c]ontinuing education,\u201d and to that end it uses \u201c[c]lassroom space,\u201d \u201cteaching equipment\u201d and \u201c[o]ffices for staff.\u201d It also uses \u201c[i]ndoor and outdoor physical recreational facilities,\u201d and \u201c[h]ousing and dining facilities.\u201d In short, the Town Code definition might almost have been written to describe what the Legion does on the property \u2014 and this is unsurprising, for it was written to describe what IBM did there, and the Legion does much the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">The Legion provides religious training and education, while the activities of IBM and its tenants were largely secular, but the Town no longer claims that the Code forbids the Legion\u2019s use on that ground. In arguing that the Legion\u2019s use is significantly different from IBM\u2019s, the Town relies primarily on the duration of the Legion\u2019s residential programs \u2014 up to two years, in contrast to the much shorter programs run by IBM and its tenants. The Town contends that an institution offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a two-year course of study is better described as a college or seminary than as a conference and training center.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We reject the Town\u2019s argument. Nothing in the Town Code says or implies that only training programs of relatively short duration are permitted in the OB-CE district. Indeed, by specifically forbidding \u201chotel or public restaurant\u201d use, the Town showed itself to be worried more about short-term than long-term visitors. We conclude that the property, as used by the Legion, is a conference and training center within the meaning of the Town Code. Whether it could also be called a college or a seminary is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We give a broad interpretation to the term \u201c[conference and training facilities\u201d not only because the Town Code defines the term broadly, but also because a broad reading does not injure any interest of the Town that can legitimately be protected by zoning. The longer duration of the Legion\u2019s programs appears to be completely harmless from the Town\u2019s point of view. The Town does not claim that the Legion\u2019s use of the property presents any traffic, health, safety or similar problem that was not also presented by IBM\u2019s use. Of course, there is one difference that is important to the Town \u2014 the Legion, unlike IBM, is tax exempt. But keeping property in taxpaying hands is not a legitimate purpose of zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We therefore hold the Legion\u2019s use permitted under the Town Code. We do not need to, and do not, decide the RLUIPA question addressed by the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be awarded under 42 USC \u00a7 1988 (b) to the prevailing party in an RLUIPA action. We recognize that at times, when a party asserts both state and federal claims and prevails on the former, it may be entitled either to a ruling on its federal claim for purposes of deciding the fee issue or to an award of fees even in the absence of a ruling on the federal claim <em>(Matter of Johnson v Blum, </em>58 NY2d 454, 458 n 2 [1983]). That rule does not apply here, however. When this action was brought RLUIPA had not even been enacted, and the Legion then had available to it the state-law defense that we have found dispositive. The provision of state law on which this case turns is not a state counterpart to RLUIPA, but a local zoning code. It would distort reality to hold that the Legion is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in an RLUIPA case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to the Legion, by granting judgment declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ing that the Legion\u2019s use of the property is permitted as of right by the Town Code, and, as so modified, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
