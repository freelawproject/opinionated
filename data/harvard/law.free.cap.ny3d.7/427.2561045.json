On June 9, 2000, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, followed by supervised release for a term of three years. As a condition of the supervised release, petitioner was required to pay $786,402 in restitution \u201cno later than 90 days prior to the end of [his] supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Shortly thereafter, on June 16, 2000, petitioner pleaded guilty in Supreme Court to one count of scheme to defraud in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 190.65) in satisfaction of state charges pending against him in New York County. He admitted that he had \u201cschemed and conspired\u201d with his son and certain rival contractors and others to rig bids, thereby inflating prices of construction-related contracts at various residential and commercial buildings in the New York metropolitan area.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Petitioner was sentenced on August 29, 2000, to an indeterminate prison term of 1 to 3 years, to be served concurrently with his federal sentence. He agreed to pay $750,000 in restitution and $250,000 in lieu of forfeiture, the former payable in installments and the latter payable in full on or before the date of sentence. The forfeiture stipulation specified that the $250,000 \u201cshall be forfeited pursuant to CPL \u00a7 220.50 (6) and, in accordance therewith, distributed pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 1349.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">On May 6, 2003, while petitioner was still under the supervision of the New York State Division of Parole and on federal supervised release, his attorney wrote to the District Attorney, seeking information as to how petitioner\u2019s restitution and forfeiture payments had been disbursed. Noting that petitioner still owed more than $250,000 in federal restitution, his attorney asked the District Attorney to verify that the $250,000 state forfeiture payment would be applied to the federal restitution obligation \u201cas required by the order of priority set forth in CPLR \u00a7 1349.\u201d As relevant, this provision states at subdivision (2) (c) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cmoneys realized as a consequence of any forfeiture pursuant to this article shall be apportioned and paid in the following descending order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c(c) Amounts ordered to be paid by the defendant in any other action or proceeding as restitution, reparations or damages to a victim of any crime committed by the defendant even though such crime did not constitute the basis for forfeiture under this article, to the extent that such amounts remain unpaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On July 24, 2003, the District Attorney responded, informing petitioner that $80,000 of the forfeited amount had been sent to the state substance abuse service fund <em>(see </em>CPLR 1349 [2] [g]), with the remainder retained by the District Attorney in his capacity as claiming agent and claiming authority. The District Attorney refused to apply any portion of the forfeited moneys to satisfy petitioner\u2019s federal restitution debt, noting that CPLR 1349 (2) (c) \u201cwas clearly designed to protect victims of crimes\u2014 not the defendants who commit them.\u201d Further, if petitioner\u2019s \u201cassets were totally depleted (an allegation that has not been made) and he were to default upon his <em>agreed </em>upon payments, then the unpaid victims may have standing to claim money from the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">On September 24, 2003, petitioner commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of mandamus, seeking to compel the District Attorney to apply the $250,000 forfeiture payment, \u201ctogether with appropriate interest,\u201d to his federal restitution debt. Petitioner claimed that the District Attorney had violated CPLR 1349 (2) (c) when \u201c[i]nstead of paying the money to the benefit of the [federal] victims,\u201d he \u201cretained $170,000 for [his] own purposes and donated $80,000 to a substance abuse program.\u201d On October 8, 2003, the District Attorney moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that it was untimely and petitioner lacked standing, and thus had failed to establish a clear legal right to the requested relief. In the event the petition was not dismissed, the District Attorney requested a reasonable time to file an answer as CPLR 7804 (f) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On July 8, 2004, Supreme Court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the petition, first rejecting the District Attorney\u2019s statute-of-limitations and laches defenses. The court also concluded that petitioner had standing because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201ca plain reading of CPLR \u00a7 1349 shows that the legislature, in establishing the order of priority set forth in the statute, intended not only to benefit the victims of crimes, but \u2018arguably\u2019 to provide an indirect benefit to the perpetrators of crime by allowing funds forfeited by them to be applied to other unrelated crimes that they committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]hrough [his] failure to apply the funds to the restitution debt remaining in the Federal Case, . . . [the District Attorney] failed to comply with the order of priority set forth in CPLR \u00a7 1349 and adopted by the Stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tion.\u201d The court ordered the District Attorney to apply the full $250,000 forfeiture payment to petitioner\u2019s federal restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Appellate Division subsequently reversed Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the law, granted the District Attorney\u2019s motion, denied the petition, and dismissed the proceeding. The Appellate Division concluded that the petition was untimely, and that petitioner lacked standing. We subsequently granted petitioner permission to appeal, and now affirm the Appellate Division on the ground that petitioner lacks standing to press a claim for violation of CPLR 1349 in this CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u201c[T]he contemporary rule is that a party has standing to enforce a statutory right if its abuse will cause him injury and it may fall within the \u2018zone of interest\u2019 protected by the legislation\u201d <em>(Matter of District Attorney of Suffolk County, </em>58 NY2d 436, 442 [1983]). \u201cSimply stated, a party must show that the in-fact injury of which it complains (its aggrievement, or the adverse effect upon it) falls within the \u2018zone of interests,\u2019 or concerns, sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provision under which the agency has acted\u201d <em>(Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk, </em>77 NY2d 761, 773 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Here, petitioner\u2019s purported injury \u2014 the windfall he failed to realize when the District Attorney refused to apply the state forfeiture to satisfy petitioner\u2019s federal restitution obligations\u2014 does not fall within the zone of interests protected by CPLR 1349. The Legislature restructured forfeiture procedures in 1984 to create a \u201cforfeiture statute [that] can be used by law enforcement agencies throughout the state as an effective tool to take the profit out of crime\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1984, ch 669, Bill Jacket, at 7). In 1990, the Legislature strengthened forfeiture yet again to allow state and local agencies to receive a share of forfeited property so as to recover some of their expenses in investigating and preparing forfeiture actions <em>(see </em>Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1990, ch 655). Legislation does not \u201ctake the profit out of crime\u201d or encourage district attorneys to pursue forfeiture by empowering a criminal defendant like petitioner to direct forfeited moneys so as to suit his own best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Further, CPLR 1349 (2) (c) requires the claiming authority to apply forfeited moneys to restitution debts \u201cto the extent that such amounts remain unpaid.\u201d Thus, a criminal defendant must exhaust his resources before forfeited moneys may be tapped to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>pay off his restitution debts. To interpret the statute otherwise, as petitioner urges, would risk rendering forfeiture meaningless. Here, petitioner has not even alleged that he lacks the funds to pay his federal restitution obligations, much less proven this. As the District Attorney intimated in his letter to petitioner, any unpaid victims of petitioner\u2019s other crimes, as the intended beneficiaries of CPLR 1349 (2) (c), have standing to enforce the statute by making a claim against the District Attorney for the forfeited moneys. Petitioner, however, does not. He has standing to enforce his plea agreement, but in this case the plea agreement says no more than that the District Attorney will comply with CPLR 1349. The plea agreement does not compel the District Attorney to use petitioner\u2019s state forfeiture to satisfy his federal restitution obligations. In short, petitioner may not bootstrap the reference to CPLR 1349 in his plea agreement into standing to enforce this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">As a final matter, in this case the District Attorney seems to have committed forfeited moneys to lower-priority purposes before he had any reason to know whether petitioner had sufficient resources to pay federal claimants. While this course of action appears somewhat risky, here we have no way of knowing why the District Attorney proceeded as he did because an answer was never filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur; Judge Pigott taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
