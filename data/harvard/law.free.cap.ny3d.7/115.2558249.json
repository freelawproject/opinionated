The affirmed factual findings of 498 Seventh, LLC\u2019s material breaches of the lease, and the absence of any supposed waiver by Bates Advertising USA, Inc., are beyond this Court\u2019s review. <em>(Glenbriar Co. v Lipsman, </em>5 NY3d 388; <em>Thoreson v Penthouse Intl., </em>80 NY2d 490.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b221-7\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In November 1997, plaintiff Bates Advertising USA, Inc., a large advertising and marketing firm, entered into a lease with defendant 498 Seventh, LLC so that Bates might relocate its 700-person worldwide headquarters from the Chrysler Building into space in 498\u2019s building in New York City\u2019s Garment District. Both plaintiff tenant and defendant landlord, sophisticated business entities, were represented by experienced real estate counsel throughout lengthy negotiations that produced an 85-page lease with 23 exhibits. Bates was to become the building\u2019s anchor tenant and occupy approximately 25% of its floor space. The base rent for the 16-year lease, with options and other rent escalations, exceeds $100 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Exhibit C to the lease, captioned \u201cLANDLORD\u2019S WORK,\u201d lists numerous upgrades and improvements that 498 agreed to make to the building in order to provide Bates with the amenities, safety and security that it had bargained for. Part E of exhibit C lists 11 required alterations, including providing a class E fire alarm and communications system, installing a card key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>system for after-hours access to the building, and upgrading an existing freight elevator to passenger-elevator quality. \u201c[I]n an attempt to have the tenancy begin as early as possible while ensuring that [498] would be sufficiently motivated to follow through with these items [in part E of exhibit C] after [Bates] took possession,\u201d the parties followed the common practice \u201cadopted by the real estate profession generally\u201d and included a rent abatement clause in the lease (291 AD2d 179, 181 [1st Dept 2002]). Under the terms of this provision, if 498 had not substantially completed the described work by January 1, 1999, and Bates had already moved in and was conducting its ordinary business, then Bates was entitled to abatement of one-half day\u2019s rent for each day\u2019s delay in substantially completing one or more of nine of the 11 items; and abatement of a full day\u2019s rent for each day\u2019s delay in substantially completing either or both of the two most important of the 11 items, one of which was provision of a class E fire alarm and communications system.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Bates\u2019s lease in the Chrysler Building expired on March 31, 1999, without any renewal options, and so Bates moved into 498\u2019s building on March 22, 1999. After an initial and undisputed rent-free period, Bates commenced paying rent as of June 13, 1999, subject to reservation of its rights under the lease\u2019s rent abatement clause. Alleging that work required by the lease remained unfinished, Bates commenced this action against 498 in December 1999, seeking refund of rent and other relief. Bates contended that it had not received the benefit of its bargain under the lease, forcing it to occupy space that was less valuable than the top-shelf commercial accommodations envisaged by the parties when they fixed the rent, and posing a threat to its employees\u2019 safety and security, its global operations and worldwide computer systems, and its image in the international advertising and marketing industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Supreme Court dismissed Bates\u2019s causes of action grounded on the rent abatement clause, concluding that this provision was an unenforceable penalty. The Appellate Division reversed on the law, reinstated these causes of action, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The Appellate Division noted that the situation that the rent abatement clause sought to address was \u201cnot unique to these parties\u201d (291 AD2d at 181). Namely, the contracted-for alterations \u201cwere a vital part of the deal,\u201d but \u201cas a practical matter, it would be difficult for [Bates] to prove the value of its damages arising from a breach of this lease term\u201d because, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cthere would be no way of knowing whether a loss of a client, or an employee, had been caused by conditions in the building. Therefore, although [Bates] was willing to begin its tenancy before all the agreed-upon alterations had been completed, and [498] was no less interested in the tenancy beginning, it was necessary for the parties to acknowledge and somehow provide for the possibility of delays attendant to these additional alterations\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The Appellate Division further observed that \u201c[b]y imposing [a] one-to-one proportionality between the days the breach continued and the value of the compensation, the parties successfully avoided the possibility that the tenant would obtain a benefit in gross disproportion to the injury it suffered\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 183). Nor was \u201cvast disproportion created by the fact that the full-day abatement would be applicable whether one or both of two possible improvements remained uncompleted,\u201d or by the parties\u2019 designation of a \u201cgroup of work items, any or all of which would trigger the <em>maximum </em>of a half-day rent abatement for each day of delay\u201d <em>(id.). </em>These \u201cminor\u201d disproportions were \u201cas likely to inure to the benefit of the landlord as to that of the tenant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 184).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">After a bench trial, Supreme Court concluded that 498 breached the lease by failing to provide the required class E fire alarm and communications system until May 9, 2000, or 412 days after March 23, 1999, the day after Bates moved into the building. There was no dispute that Bates\u2019s rent payments for the 412-day period following June 13, 1999, when Bates commenced paying rent, totaled $4,339,528.61. Thus, Supreme Court awarded Bates rent abatement credits in this amount against which to offset future rent payments.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Appellate Division affirmed \u201cfor the reasons stated\u201d by Supreme Court (19 AD3d 290, 290 [1st Dept 2005]). We granted permission to appeal, and now also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Although 498 protests that it did not breach the lease, Supreme Court concluded otherwise and the Appellate Division affirmed. We may not revisit Supreme Court\u2019s affirmed factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>findings underpinning the determination of breach, which are supported by the record <em>(see </em>Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 13:10, at 489 [3d ed rev] [\u201c(F)indings of fact made by the <em>nisi prius </em>court which have been expressly affirmed by the Appellate Division and have the requisite evidentiary support are . . . conclusive and binding on the Court\u201d]). Moreover, in light of these factual findings, 498 materially breached the lease. Thus, the only remaining issue for us to resolve \u2014 and the main point of contention between the parties \u2014 is whether the rent abatement clause is a proper remedy for this breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Whether a contractual provision \u201crepresents an enforceable liquidation of damages or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law, giving due consideration to the nature of the contract and the circumstances\u201d <em>(JMD Holding Corp. v Congress Fin. Corp., </em>4 NY3d 373, 379 [2005]). The party challenging the liquidated damages \u2014 in this case, 498 \u2014 \u201cmust demonstrate either that damages flowing from [the failure to complete on time the items of work called for by the lease] were readily ascertainable at the time [Bates and 498] entered into their [lease], or that [the rent abatement] is conspicuously disproportionate to these foreseeable losses\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 380).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">498 has not attempted to show that damages attributable to its failure to complete the contracted-for work by the promised date were readily ascertainable at the time the parties entered into the lease. Instead, 498 argues that the rent abatement clause is illegitimate and unenforceable because Bates\u2019s attorney testified that the clause was intended to \u201cincentivize\u201d the landlord, and to provide \u201ca club over his head to make sure he gets the work done.\u201d But the prospect of damages in the event of breach may always be said to encourage parties to comply with their contractual obligations. Liquidated damages are not transformed into a penalty merely because they operate in this way as well, so long as they are not grossly out of scale with foreseeable losses. In this case, we agree with the Appellate Division that 498 has not demonstrated that the rent abatements are conspicuously disproportionate to Bates\u2019s foreseeable losses. Rent abatement was keyed to the number of days of 498\u2019s nonperformance, and varied from a half day to a day depending upon the importance of the item of work not completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur</p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\"> Supreme Court also determined that 498 breached the lease by providing the lobby card access system 314 days late, and the private passenger elevator service 23 days late. Because the rent abatements under the lease\u2019s liquidated damages clause run concurrently, the resulting half-day credits for these breaches were subsumed within the $4 million credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
