Occasionally, however, a plaintiff to whom the defendant owes a duty of care is not in a position to prove directly what actually happened or that a specific act of the defendant was negligent. In a proper case, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the law allows a jury to consider the circumstantial evidence and infer that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dant was negligent in some unspecified way. <em>(See generally Kambat v St. Francis Hosp., </em>89 NY2d 489 [1997].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">On this appeal, we address defendants\u2019 assertion \u2014 supported by the Appellate Division \u2014 that circumstantial evidence (res ipsa) may never justify summary judgment for the plaintiff. We conclude that, while there is no rule or policy absolutely foreclosing that possibility, it should be a rare event. Here, open questions of fact remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Plaintiff, on behalf of the estate of Fabio Pardo, sued defendant Rais Construction Company, alleging that Pardo was fatally injured while delivering building materials to Rais Construction for a job it was doing at the residence owned by Barry and Susan Kleinman in Nassau County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">At their depositions, Alejandro and Maria Pardo (Fabio\u2019s brother and sister-in-law) testified that Rais had engaged Fabio to pick up boxes from a hardware store and deliver them to the Kleinman house the morning of December 26, 1998, a Saturday. They claimed that they accompanied Fabio to the site, where a roll of roofing material fell from the roof and hit him on the head. They testified that a man at the house opened the door but neither Maria nor Alejandro could identify him, nor did they tell him that there had been an accident. Further, Maria acknowledged that Fabio did not seek any medical treatment for the injury until the end of February 1999. In his deposition, Cesar Rais testified that he never left roofing materials on the Kleinmans\u2019 roof, implying that none were there on December 26. Rais also testified that his crew stopped work at the site three days before the incident. Barry Kleinman supported Rais\u2019s assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Rais further stated that he did not engage Fabio to do any work on the day in question or even during the previous several weeks, having let him go weeks before out of concern that Fa-bio\u2019s extreme headaches were posing a safety problem for Fabio and others. Rais added that it was not until April of 1999 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>he was told about the alleged accident. Barry Kleinman testified that he was at the house the afternoon of December 26, 1998 and saw no evidence of work being done. He said it had snowed the day before and there were no tracks or disturbances in the fresh snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In resisting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, defendants argued that there were disputed questions of fact, including whether the accident had even occurred. Supreme Court initially denied the motion but on reargument granted plaintiff summary judgment against the Rais defendants on the basis of res ipsa loquitur. The Appellate Division reversed, stating that res ipsa loquitur \u201cmay not be used as the basis for granting summary judgment in favor of a plaintiff on the issue of liability\u201d (18 AD3d 632, 633 [2d Dept 2005]). Because there are questions of fact precluding summary judgment for the plaintiff, we affirm. We disagree, however, with the Appellate Division\u2019s statement that res ipsa loquitur may never serve as a basis for granting a plaintiff summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In addressing the procedural role of res ipsa loquitur, it is useful to examine the development of the doctrine itself. This Court used the term \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d for the first time in <em>Mullen v St. John </em>(57 NY 567, 570 [1874]), in which a part of a building fell on the plaintiff. \u201cBuildings properly constructed do not fall without adequate cause,\u201d we said. <em>(Id. </em>at 569.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201cIf there be no tempest prevailing or no external violence of any kind, the fair presumption is, that the fall occurred through adequate causes, such as the ruinous condition of the building, which could scarcely have escaped the observation of the owner. The mind is thus led to a presumption of negligence on his part, which may, of course, be rebutted. In the absence of explanatory evidence, negligence may be presumed.\u201d (57 NY at 569-570.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Citing an English case <em>(Kearney v London, Brighton, &amp; S. Coast Ry. Co., </em>1869-1870 LR [5 QB] 411 [1870]), the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>expressly espoused the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and upheld the judgment for plaintiff based on the jury\u2019s verdict. After <em>Mullen, </em>and for about 30 years, the Court heard a number of res ipsa loquitur cases and was almost uniformly inhospitable to the plaintiffs or the doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Slowly thereafter, res ipsa loquitur gained general acceptance with us,\u00ae but there was some confusion over the doctrine\u2019s procedural effects. Courts, including ours, used \u201cprima facie case,\u201d \u201cpresumption of negligence\u201d and \u201cinference of negligence\u201d interchangeably even though the phrases can carry different procedural consequences. One case went so far as to use all three interchangeably.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In <em>Foltis, Inc. v City of New York </em>(287 NY 108 [1941]), a pivotal case, we reversed the grant of a directed verdict for the plaintiff. The Court emphasized that when dealing with res ipsa loquitur, the indiscriminate use of the terms \u201cpresumption\u201d and \u201cinference\u201d caused procedural problems. The Court held that res ipsa loquitur does not create a presumption of negligence against the defendant. Rather, the circumstantial evidence allows but does not require the jury to infer that the defendant was negligent. The Court went on to state that res ipsa loquitur evidence does not ordinarily or automatically entitle the plaintiff to summary judgment or a directed verdict, even if the plaintiffs circumstantial evidence is unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We stand by those principles, and in the context of this appeal, reaffirm that only in the rarest of res ipsa loquitur cases may a plaintiff win summary judgment or a directed verdict. That would happen only when the plaintiffs circumstantial proof is so convincing and the defendant\u2019s response so weak that the inference of defendant\u2019s negligence is inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Drawing on a number of cases that had fashioned the criteria for res ipsa loquitur, and relying on Prosser, the Court listed these criteria in <em>Corcoran v Banner Super Mkt. </em>(19 NY2d 425 [1967]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201c(1) the event must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; (3) it must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d (19 NY2d at 430, quoting Prosser, Torts \u00a7 39, at 218 [3d ed].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Our more recent decisions have generally followed this formulation <em>(see e.g. States v Lourdes Hosp., </em>100 NY2d 208 [2003]; <em>Kambat v St. Francis Hosp., </em>89 NY2d 489 [1997]), and the case at hand gives us no reason to change it. We have not, however, discussed the summary judgment or directed verdict aspects of the doctrine in the 65 years since <em>Foltis. </em>Over the last century, the Appellate Division has held barely more than a dozen times that a plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment or a directed verdict in res ipsa loquitur cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An approach that sparing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>consistent with <em>Foltis, </em>and in accord with the treatise commentators.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Since <em>Foltis, </em>our courts have grown more sensitive to the differences between inferences and presumptions, recognizing that terminology can carry varying procedural implications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the line is sometimes blurry, and on occasion, courts have still referred to res ipsa loquitur as creating a <em>presumption, </em>as opposed to an inference, of negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, Wigmore has characterized res ipsa loquitur as raising a presumption of negligence, as have a number of courts in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The difficulty in applying a presumption or an inference has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>generated some criticism in an analogous setting <em>(see </em>Allen, <em>Presumptions, Inferences and Burden of Proof in Federal Civil Actions </em>\u2014 An <em>Anatomy of Unnecessary Ambiguity and a Proposal for Reform, </em>76 Nw U L Rev 892 [1982]) and one author has listed eight ways in which courts have used the term \u201cpresumption.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In our own taxonomy in other contexts, we speak of \u201cpresumption[s] of law\u201d <em>(Matter of Buccini v Paterno Constr. Co., </em>253 NY 256, 259 [1930]), \u201cpresumption[s] of fact\u201d <em>(Myers v Bartholomew, </em>91 NY2d 630, 636 [1998]), \u201cconclusive presumption [s]\u201d <em>(Cornell Univ. v Bagnardi, </em>68 NY2d 583, 594, 595 [1986]), \u201crebuttable presumption[s]\u201d <em>(Williams v City of New York, </em>2 NY3d 352, 366 [2004]), \u201cconflicting presumptions\u201d <em>(Palmer v Palmer, </em>162 NY 130, 133 [1900]) and \u201cstatutory presumption[s]\u201d <em>(DeJesus v DeJesus, </em>90 NY2d 643, 652 [1997]). Perhaps even more unsettling, we also hear of \u201cmandatory inference[s]\u201d <em>(West v Nabors Drilling USA, Inc., </em>330 F3d 379, 385 [5th Cir 2003]), \u201cpresumptive inference[s]\u201d <em>(Matter of Hines v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>67 AD2d 1000, 1001 [2d Dept 1979]) and \u201cpermissive presumption[s]\u201d <em>(County Court of Ulster Cty. v Allen, </em>442 US 140, 157 [1979]). In <em>United States v Gainey </em>(380 US 63, 78 [1965] [dissenting op]), Justice Black stated that \u201c[i]n its simplest form a presumption is an inference permitted or required by law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In most of the <em>post-Foltis </em>res ipsa loquitur cases cited, the courts would likely have reached the same result whether by way of inference or presumption or some other word or phrase. We adhere, nevertheless, to our jurisprudence, in which we denominate res ipsa loquitur as creating an inference (as defined in this writing and our case law <em>[e.g. Kambat, supra]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The dizzying array of formulations (from mandatory inferences to permissive presumptions), however, suggests that things would be far less complicated if we viewed the res ipsa loquitur/summary judgment issue without undue emphasis on labels and pigeonholes. Res ipsa loquitur is a phrase that, perhaps because it is in Latin, has taken on its own mystique, although it is nothing more than a brand of circumstantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>dence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Viewed in that light, the summary judgment (or directed verdict) issue may also be properly approached by simply evaluating the circumstantial evidence. If that evidence presents a question of fact as to the defendant\u2019s liability under the <em>Kambat/Corcoran </em>test for res ipsa loquitur, the case should go to trial. If the circumstantial evidence does not reach that level and present a question of fact, the defendant will prevail on the law. Alternatively, as we have said, the plaintiff should win summary judgment or a directed verdict in the exceptional case in which no facts are left for determination. This is not such a case. Here, there are material questions of fact for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B.
