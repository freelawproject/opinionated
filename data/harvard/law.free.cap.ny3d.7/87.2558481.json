The legislation created procedures to weigh the threat posed by the offender\u2019s release and classifications geared to the offender\u2019s risk level. SORA contemplates three levels of risk, from level one (the lowest) to level three, with reporting requirements increasing for each level (Correction Law \u00a7 168-Z [6] [a]-[c]). A five-member Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders is charged with the responsibility for developing risk assessment guidelines and recommending to a sentencing court the risk level involved upon the release of an offender (Correction Law \u00a7 168-Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Pursuant to Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d), certain defendants convicted of sex offenses in other jurisdictions must register as sex offenders in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case before us involves the application of this subsection to defendant\u2019s United States Navy court-martial, following which the Board recommended, and County Court determined, that he be classified a level two sex offender under Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (ii). We agree with defendant that this determination must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Defendant was convicted in 2000 by a general court-martial under a generic provision in the Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibiting, among other things, \u201call conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d (10 USC \u00a7 934). Within the general statutory provision, defendant seems to have been convicted of the specific regulatory offense of \u201cindecent assault.\u201d The Navy apparently sentenced defendant to a bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>conduct discharge and reduction in pay grade, but no fine or term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Because the record in this case is incomplete and sometimes inconsistent, we cannot be certain as to the basis of defendant\u2019s conviction. One document before us, apparently from the regional commander, indicates that defendant\u2019s conviction was for \u201cindecent assault\u201d under the general provision in 10 USC \u00a7 934. The crime has also been described as a lesser-included offense under the military crime of rape (10 USC \u00a7 920). Contrastingly, a separate postconviction report from the military prosecutor, closer in time to the trial, suggests that defendant was convicted of ordinary assault (10 USC \u00a7 928). Furthermore, we have not been furnished with an authoritative description of the elements of \u201cindecent assault.\u201d A single page in the record, neither dated, titled, nor authenticated, purports to list the elements, but does not indicate whether those elements are legally prerequisite to the offense. Nevertheless, for purposes of this decision, we will assume that defendant violated 10 USC \u00a7 934, that his crime was indecent assault and that the elements of indecent assault are as described in <em>United States v Watson </em>(31 MJ 49, 53 [CMA 1990]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201c(1) [t]hat the accused assaulted a certain person not the spouse of the accused in a certain manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201c(2) [t]hat the acts were done with the intent to gratify the lust or sexual desires of the accused; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c(3) [t]hat, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces . . . .\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The Appellate Division held that the military crime of indecent assault satisfies the requirements in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (ii) (mandating registration for those convicted of \u201ca felony in any other jurisdiction for which the offender is required to register as a sex offender in the jurisdiction in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the conviction occurred\u201d). Even though military law does not classify offenses as felonies or misdemeanors, the Court reasoned that indecent assault is a federal felony and that defendant was required to register as a sex offender with naval authorities. We granted defendant leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) specifies particular federal crimes that require registration <em>(see </em>\u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [iii]); undisputedly, indecent assault is not among them. The section also mandates that the offender register if the crime of conviction in the other jurisdiction \u201cincludes all of the essential elements of any such crime provided for\u201d in the statutory sections referring to convictions obtained in New York (\u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [i]).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The People have conceded that they are not relying on that subsection, but solely on section 168-a (2) (d) (ii), which provides that an offender must register when convicted of \u201ca felony in any other jurisdiction for which the offender is required to register as a sex offender in the jurisdiction in which the conviction occurred\u201d (\u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [ii]). There are two elements to this subsection: first, the underlying offense must be a felony; second, the offender must be required to register as a sex offender in the other jurisdiction as a result of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">As to the first element, the People argue that indecent assault can result in a sentence of up to five years\u2019 imprisonment, and is therefore equivalent to a federal felony <em>(see </em>18 USC \u00a7 3559 [a] [4] [labeling crimes punishable by from 5 to just under 10 years\u2019 imprisonment class D felonies]).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Assuming that indecent assault qualifies as a felony within the meaning of our statute, County Court\u2019s determination fails because the second element of section 168-a (2) (d) (ii) requires that the conviction result in the offender\u2019s obligation to register in the \u201cother jurisdiction,\u201d i.e., where defendant was convicted\u2014 here, the United States Navy. The People argue that Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5800.14 obligates defendant to register with the Navy. It does not. This \u201cInstruction\u201d is a notification order directed to \u201cAll Ships and Stations\u201d; by its own terms, it places responsibility to provide notification not on the offender but on the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), the Navy Personnel Command, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the \u201cConvening Authority or Convening Authority\u2019s Designee\u201d for each court-martial, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The People have presented no evidence of any kind suggesting that naval sex offenders must register with the Navy or have any ongoing obligation to keep the Navy informed of their whereabouts once they leave the service. Furthermore, the People have presented no evidence that the Navy or Department of Defense maintains any registry or equivalent database; if there is no registry, there can be no registration and no registrants. Because the People have not shown that defendant ever had any obligation to register with the other jurisdiction, they have not met the second statutory requirement for registration in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">On the state of this record, we are unprepared to say whether, in a new proceeding, the People may be able to sustain a declaration that defendant must register in New York. Unless amended, section 168-a (2) (d) (ii) might not apply to any military convictions and we agree with our concurring colleague\u2019s suggestion that the Legislature examine the issue. We note, however, that section 168-a (2) (d) (i) remains available (even for military offenders) if the People can prove the crime of conviction in the other jurisdiction includes all of the essential elements provided for in the New York statutes described in that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and defendant\u2019s adjudication as a sex offender annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Graffeo, J. (concurring). I agree with the reversal in this case based on a plain language analysis of Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d). But because I do not believe that the Legislature intended to exclude certain military courts-martial premised on sex crimes from the reach of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), I write separately to highlight the need for legislative reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The statute at issue \u2014 Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d)\u2014 designates several categories of New York residents who must register under SORA if they have been convicted of particular crimes in other jurisdictions. Registration is required for enumerated federal offenses <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [in]) and for an offense in another jurisdiction that contains the same \u201cessential elements\u201d as a New York crime that is register-able under SORA (Correction Law \u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [i]). As the Court notes, neither of these categories is implicated here. Rather, the People claim that defendant is covered by subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>sion (2) (d) (ii), which requires registration for <em>\u201ca </em>felony in any other jurisdiction for which the offender is required to register as a sex offender in the jurisdiction in which the conviction occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Pursuant to this provision, the crucial inquiry is whether the jurisdiction where defendant was convicted of a felony required registration as a sex offender for that crime. It is apparent from the record in this case that the United States Navy does not have a registry of sex offenders similar to those maintained by the states.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, Navy regulations, promulgated under the directives of Congress and the Secretary of Defense <em>(see </em>Pub L 105-119, tit I, \u00a7 115 [a] [8] [C], 111 US Stat 2466), merely require naval personnel to establish a program for notifying a jurisdiction that a discharged individual who relocates to that state has been subject to a court-martial for a qualifying sex offense <em>(see </em>Secretary of Navy Instruction 5800.14).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notification, however, is not akin to registration and without a formal registration requirement, a court-martial based on any of the offenses delineated in the Secretary\u2019s Instruction is not encompassed within the ambit of Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (ii). Consequently, New York\u2019s SORA does not mandate that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>fendant register as a sex offender for the indecent assault court-martial under article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 USC \u00a7 934), despite the fact that the Secretary of the Navy classifies that offense as one serious enough to warrant notification to state and local law enforcement officials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Although the technical operation of section 168-a (2) (d) (ii) relieves defendant, and others similarly situated, from registration, this result is inconsistent with the intent of both federal and state law. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (Pub L 103-322, tit XVII, subtit A, \u00a7 170101, 108 US Stat 2038, as amended, codified at 42 USC \u00a7 14071) expressly provides that \u201ceach State . . . shall ensure that procedures are in place to accept registration from . . . residents who were . . . sentenced by a court martial\u201d for a sex offense (42 USC \u00a7 14071 [b] [7] [A]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>In order to comply with this requirement, the Legislature amended various provisions of SORA to expand its reach <em>(see </em>L 2002, ch 11, Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem No. 102, 2002 NY Legis Ann, at 7). This case, however, highlights the existence of a loophole in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (ii) that prevents registration of an individual who is discharged by court-martial for a crime that is specifically classified by the Navy as a sex offense.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">It is true that section 168-a (2) (d) (ii) does not allow all courtmartialed sex offenders to escape registration since subdivision (2) (d) (i) encompasses crimes in other jurisdictions that have the same \u201cessential elements\u201d as sex offenses under New York\u2019s Penal Law. But the extent to which the essential elements standard closes the loophole is far from certain at this juncture because New York appellate courts have not had occasion to examine whether specific sex offenses in the Uniform Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Military Justice qualify under the essential elements provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather than relegating to the courts of this state the task of determining on a case-by-case basis whether a particular court-martial satisfies the essential elements test \u2014 and risking the chance that it will not \u2014 the Legislature should examine whether SORA needs to be amended to expressly include courts-martial based on crimes designated by the military as sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B.

Nevertheless, if another jurisdiction classifies forcible touching as a felony for which registration is required, the Legislature has adopted a policy of requiring a person convicted of such an offense who moves into this state to register even though the same conduct committed here would not be registerable (see Correction Law \u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [ii]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. <em>Compare e.g. </em>Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 (2) (sexual intercourse between 21-year-old defendant and victim less than 17 years old constitutes rape in the third degree), <em>with </em>10 USC \u00a7 920 (b) and (d) (defining \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d as nonforcible sexual intercourse with a child less than 16 years old, but providing an affirmative defense if the child was at least 12 years old and the perpetrator reasonably believed the child was at least 16 years old).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
