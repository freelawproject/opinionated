Collateral proceeding.\u2014 Following previous decisions, the doctrine announced, that the action of a legally constituted board of land commissioners in 1838, deciding who were the heirs of a deceased party, who had been entitled under the law to land, and issuing to them a headlight certificate, is conclusive of their right to it, on a collateral inquiry, whether the decision of the board was right or not.

Tried below before the Hon. W. E. Collard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-25\">Suit against appellants, averring that plaintiff was seized on 21st June, 1881, of three hundred acres of land, a part of the one-third league patented to heirs of Mariana Moro, Jr., in Milam county, Texas; that defendants entered on the land and removed therefrom four hundred and thirty-two cords of wood belonging to plaintiff, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the value of $1,000, for which, as well as $500 vindictive damages, he prayed judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\">Defendants answer by plea of not guilty and general denial; denying that the cord-wood ever belonged to plaintiff; that if he ever purchased the land from which it was cut, that at the time of his purchase the wood was a chattel severed from the realty, made by the labor and skill of defendants under a claim of ownership of the land and trees into manufactured timber, and did not pass by deed of purchase to plaintiff; that defendants were in possession under a regular chain of title from the sovereignty of the soil; that plaintiff was a trespasser, and charged damages by way of rents and cutting timber, etc., by plaintiff, and prayed for plaintiff\u2019s pretended title to be removed as a cloud on defendants\u2019 title, and for their writ of possession, etc.; that if plaintiff was entitled to recover at all, he could only recover the value of the wood standing in the tree, and not in its manufactured state, etc. To this cross-bill plaintiff filed plea of not guilty. November 13, 1882, the case was submitted to the court upon both the law and the facts. The court adjudged that the demurrer of defendants to plaintiff\u2019s bill be overruled, and that the plaintiff recover of the defendants the value of the four hundred and thirty-two cords of wood in the tree, to wit, at twenty cents per cord, equaling the sum of $86.40, and that defendants take nothing by their cross-bill of trespass to try title to the land, and that the plaintiff Scarborough recover all costs of suit.

The security of property and the repose of society demand the consistent maintenance of this principle. If it were departed from, no man could rely upon any ancient title. Age and acquiescence, instead of giving strength and confidence to a title, would weaken it. The law, in its principles and practice, is eminently conservative. Rights that rest upon the past adjudications of early tribunals and officials must be upheld and respected. Hardiman <em>v. </em>Herbert, 11 Tex., 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">In Styles <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 Tex., 506, it was said: \u201cWhere it is considered that the evidence of her (the applicant) having the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>qualifications to receive a headright had been, subjected to the judgment and approval of the board of land -commissioners of the county and had by them been approved, and again examined and approved by the traveling board, and finally approved by the commissioner of the general land office, who, if he had any doubts, was required by the statute to take the opinion of the attorney-general, surely it is time that this subject should be put at rest.\u201d These views have again and again been indorsed, emphasized and illustrated by repeated decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In Johnston <em>v. </em>Smith, 21 Tex., 728, it is said: \u201c The commissioner who issued the grant was the exclusive judge of the merits and qualifications of the applicant. It was for him to determine whether he possessed the qualifications requisite to entitle him to the bounty of the government, and it is well settled that his decision upon that subject is final, and will not be revised by this court. The issue of the grant precludes inquiry upon that subject. 15 Tex., 590; 11 Tex., 708, 717. Thus in Styles <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 Tex., 503, where it was proposed to impeach the grant because the grantee <em>\u201c </em>was never a married woman, a widow or the head of a family,\u201d this court held that the evidence was rightly refused. Babb <em>v. </em>Carroll, 21 Tex., 767; Bowmer <em>v. </em>Hicks, 22 Tex., 155; Bradshaw <em>v. </em>Smith, 53 Tex., 474; Todd <em>v. </em>Fisher, 26 Tex., 243; Lindsay <em>v. </em>Jaffray, 55 Tex., 631; Howard <em>v. </em>Colquhoun, 28 Tex., 134; Palmer <em>v. </em>Curtner, 55 Tex., 67; Walters <em>v. </em>Jewett, 28 Tex., 201; Hanrick <em>v. </em>Jackson, 55 Tex., 32; McPhail <em>v. </em>Burris, 42 Tex., 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The patent which issued was based on this certificate, and the heirs of Mariana Moro, Jr., referred to in it, must be taken to be the persons who are decided to be such heirs by the issuance of the certificate to' them upon which the patent is founded, and without which it could have no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The patent, when issued, inured to the benefit of Chas. Chevalier, to whom the certificate and the land located and surveyed by virtue of it had been long before conveyed by Mariana Moro, Sr., and his wife. Upon its issuance the legal title passed to Chevalier and bis heirs. Merriweather <em>v. </em>Kennard, 41 Tex., 282; Pasch. Dig., art. 4288 (a) and note 978 (a) and authorities there referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"Add\">The appellees show a chain of title from the heirs of Chevalier to themselves. The certified copy of the transfer from Mariana Moro, Sr., and his wife to Chevalier, acting upon which the patent was delivered to Chevalier or his agent, was an archive of the general land office, and a certified copy from that office was admissible in evidence. R. S., arts. 57, 3808.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>' It thus appearing that the plaintiffs in error have the superior title to the land, it would be proper to reverse the judgment, and here render a judgment in their favor. As, however, it is possible that upon another trial the defendant in error may be able, either by proof of possession or in some other manner, to show a stronger and better right to the land in suit than he has yet done, the case will be reversed to give him an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In the view we have taken of the case, it becomes unnecessary to pass upon the right of the defendant in error to damages resulting from the removal of the four hundred and thirty-two cords of wood that were cut down and corded on the land before he purchased from II. L. Moffitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">It may be proper to say that if his deed from Moffitt, which is not \u25a0set out in the record, is only an ordinary warranty deed for the land, it would seem that the timber that has already been severed from, the soil and manufactured into cord-wood, before its purchase by defendant in error, would not pass to him by such a deed as a part of the realty. On this point, however, it is not necessary now to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The deed from Carmelita Ohevano and her husband, Jose Chevano,. is defective in not showing that the instrument was sufficiently explained to the wife by the officer taking the acknowledgment. Nor was she asked whether she desired to retract the deed. There are also other defects in the acknowledgment. It was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">[Opinion delivered May 29, 1883.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
