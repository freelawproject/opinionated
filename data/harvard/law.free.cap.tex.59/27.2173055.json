Defendants filed general denial, and set up abandonment of homestead; that plaintiffs left the same in 1868; that^R, A. Upton had been sheriff of Refugio county during said time, and exercised the rights of citizenship in said county; that W. B. Cline bought the same in good (faith in 1874, at execution sale, under a valid judgment against R. A. Upton; that he bought in good faith and paid the amount of his bid, $66, which was credited on the judgment under which he bought; that there was no improvement on the lots when he bought to show that they had ever been used as a homestead, and that he was not advised at the time of his purchase of any right or claims plaintiffs had thereto as such; praying for judgment, or in the alternative for a personal judgment against R.

Upton for the amount of Cline\u2019s bid, $66, with interest; that said sum had been paid in good faith on a valid judgment against Upton, had been credited on the same, and gone to liquidate it to that extent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-6\"><em>E.

A. Upton for the sum so paid, with interest from time of payment at rate of eight per cent, per annum. This instruction was refused. It was error to refuse this instruction.
