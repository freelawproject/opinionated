Service op garnishment.\u2014 To authorize a judgment by default against a corporation, service of process requiring the corporation to appear and answer must be made either on the president, treasurer, principal officer or agent of the corporation, or on the agent or person representing such .corporation in the county within which the cause of action arose. Service upon a trustee of the corporation will not be sufficient, unless, in addition to being such trustee, he sustains to the \u00abcorporation some one of the relations above enumerated.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Eeeob from McLennan.

Wheeler brought suit against the Southern Life Insurance Company in the district court of McLennan county to recover $5,000, the amount of a policy on the life of her deceased husband. At the same time affidavit was made and a writ of garnishment issued against plaintiff in error and served upon S. W. Mabry, S. A. Killough and B. F. Bichey as trustees. Judgment by default was rendered against the life insurance company for the amount of the policy, and at the same time against plaintiff in error ;as garnishee. The latter judgment was brought before the court on writ of error. The only question raised by the assignment of errors \u2022considered in the opinion involved the legality of the service on plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-7\"><em>Clark &amp; </em>Dyer, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arq0\">cited, besides the statute, O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Canal Co., 10 Cal., 332; Aiken <em>v. </em>Mining Co., 6 Cal., 199; Drake on Attachments, \u00a7 470.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-8\">No briefs for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b579-9\">Watts, J. Com. App.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ABU\">This was a judgment by default rendered against plaintiff in error as garnishee. The affidavit for the writ of garnishment recites that the affiant had \u201c reason to believe that Waco Lodge Ho. 70, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, which lodge is a private corporation chartered by an act of the legislature \u2022of the state of Texas, approved the 26th day of January, 1874, .and whose trustees are S. W. Mabry, S. A. Killough and B. F. Bichey, who are resident citizens of McLennan county, state of Texas, is indebted to said life insurance company.\u201d A copy of the writ of garnishment was served upon each of the parties named as trustees. Plaintiff in error insists that there was no legal service upon it to support the judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The statute then in force providing for service of process upon private corporations consisted, of two sections. First, by section 2 of \u201c An act to fix the venue in certain cases,\u201d approved March 21, 1874, it is enacted \u201cThat service of process on any of such corporations may be had by delivering a copy of such process, with certified copy of plaintiff\u2019s petition, if any, to the president, secretary, treasurer, principal officers, or the agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">By section 2 of \u201cAn act to confer jurisdiction of certain civil \u2022causes on the courts in the several counties in this state,\u201d approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>April 17, 1874, it is enacted \u201c That service.of process may be had on any such corporation, association, or joint stock company, by delivering a copy to -the agent or person representing such corporation in the county in which the cause of action or a part thereof arose.\u201d It does not appear from the allegations in the affidavit for the writ of garnishment that the trustees named are embraced in the terms of the statute. They are not shown to be principal officers, or agents or persons representing the corporation. For anything appearing to the contrary, they might be the trustees of the corporation for a particular or limited purpose, holding the legal title to some particular piece of property for the corporation. It does not appear that these trustees or either of them was \u201c president, secretary, treasurer, principal officer, agent, or representing the corporation \u2022 in McLennan county; \u201d and borrowing the .language of the supreme court of California in O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Canal Co., 10 Cal., 343, <em>\u201c </em>The summons might, with as much propriety, have been served upon any other stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">To authorize a judgment by default against a corporation, the process must be served in the manner and upon some one of the persons named in the statute. And as that was not done in this case, the judgment against plaintiff in error ought to be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">[Opinion approved June 5, 1883.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
