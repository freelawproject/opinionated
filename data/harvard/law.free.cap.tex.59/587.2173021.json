Walker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">Suit by Bucker <em>&amp; </em>Montgomery in their own'right and for the use of Marshall, Yaughn and Vicars, based upon about forty certified due bills which had been executed by G. G. Anderson to certain persons named for labor in constructing defendants\u2019 line of railroad from Austin to Burnet. Anderson\" was alleged to be a sub-contractor under Sanford &amp;'Son, who were original contractors of appellants to furnish cross-ties in constructing its road. Appellees claimed to be the legal and equitable owners of said bills, by purchase and assignment, except a few named, which were indorsed to appellees for collection. The bills were due, and the contractors and subcontractor had failed and refused to pay them. Appellees claimed a judgment and an order of sale enforcing the right guarantied by art. XVI, sec. 35, Const. of 1875, and to foreclose the lien provided by the act of February 18, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">After hearing the evidence and argument, the court presented its conclusions of fact and of law, and gave a judgment against the defendants\u2019 railroad and its equipments. These findings and the judgment were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">\u201cThe court finds from the testimony the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">\u201c 1. That Sanford <em>&amp; </em>Son had a contract with the defendant for delivery of cross-ties for use in construction of the said road of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">\u201c2. That, under Sanford <em>&amp; </em>Son, Q. G. Anderson was a subcontractor for one hundred thousand cross-ties for use in making said railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\"><em>\u201c </em>3. That the road was constructed between October 15, 1881, from Austin to Burnet, and May 1, 1882, and that all the wages sued for was performed in Williamson county, Texas, after October 15, 1881, and before the filing of the suit herein; that the road was built into\" and through Williamson county, Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-11\">\u201c4. That the accounts hereinafter set out were for wages for laborers in cutting, hewing, and in hauling cross-ties to the right of way of said railroad, and said ties so cut and hauled were used in the construction of said road, and that all of the said labor was performed at the instance of G. G. Anderson, who was a sub-contractor of said company. The bills show the character of labor, whether cutting and hewing or in hauling. By hauling is meant labor of the individual in loading upon wagons, driving teams and unloading the ties. The hire for the wagons and teams is excluded from the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201c5. The accounts as set out in othe petition, and which include each and all of the said items of wages, were indorsed by the original laborers to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs by purchase were the legal and equitable owners of all of the said wages accounts, except the last three (Marshall $132, Yaughn $47.15, and J. S. Vickers $25.80); of these the plaintiffs were legal owners by assignment for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">\u201c 6.

The items as follows were for wages for labor performed in furnishing ties used in the construction of the railroad of the defendant, from Austin to Burnet, through Williamson county, Texas, viz. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">Wages of J.

The statute regulating the enforcement of liens given to mechanics, laborers and operatives upon railroads, to secure the payment of their wages, does not declare who shall be made defendants in suits brought to foreclose such liens. It is claimed in this cause that the contractor and sub-contractor, under contract with whom the labor was performed, were necessary parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>This question, under the terms of the statute, is not entirely free from difficulty; but we are of the opinion that the contractor and sub-contractor should have been made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The right of the appellees, who hold by assignments, which we deem valid, the several claims for labor which are made the basis of the action, depends upon two facts: 1st. That the persons through whom appellees claim performed the labor for the railroad under a contract with the contractor or sub-contractor. 2d. That they have never been paid for that labor. The sub-contractor is the principal debtor in this case, and the person to whom the facts necessary to be established to support or defeat the claims must be known, and of which the appellant is not presumed to have knowledge; and if the cause can be tried without making him a party, it may be that the appellant, for want of knowledge of the facts of the case, may have a lien foreclosed upon its property, when in fact no indebtedness, such as would give the lien, existed; and at the same time such judgment and the payment thereof would be no bar to a suit by the sub-contractor against the contractor or the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">It would seem that such parties should be before the court, in actions of this character, as w&lt;Md enable the court to render a judgment binding upon the contractor, sub-contractor, railway company and the laborer alike. If the indebtedness is established as between the contractor and sub-contractor, as well as between those persons and the railway company and the laborer, this gives protection to all when the judgment is paid. This should be done in an action in which they are all parties, unless the claim of the laborer has been established as against the other parties by suit prior to the institution of suit to foreclose the lien given by the statute. If all the parties are before the court, all equities between them may be adjusted, and a judgment binding upon them all rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">A payment under a judgment so rendered would, to its extent, protect a railway company against further demand by the contractor or sub-contractor, as fully as would a payment by a person against whom a judgment in garnishment has been rendered protect him against his creditor whose debt he has paid. If the con-' tractor and sub-contractor are not made parties, such judgment would afford no protection against either of them, for they could not be bound by a judgment rendered in a cause to which they were not parties; and they would be permitted to show that the judgment against the railway company in favor of the laborer was erroneous, either for the reason that the services upon which the claim was based had never been rendered, or that, if rendered, they had been paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In such case a railway comp my could protect itself only by showing that the laborer\u2019s claim was well founded. Such burden should not be imposed, and multiplicity of actions encouraged, when the whole matter could be so easily settled in one suit in which all parties in interest are before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It could never have been intended that judgments against railway companies, by which their property may be subjected to sale for debts for which others are primarily liable, should be rendered until the liability of such persons has been established in a suit to which they are parties. Phillips on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, 397; Sullivan v. Decker, 1 E. D. Smith, 704; Emmett and Keifer v. Rotary Mill Co., 2 Minn., 290; Carney v. La Crosse &amp; M. R. R. Co., 15 Wis., 503; Sinnickson v. Lynch, 1 Dutch., 318; Webbing v. Powers, 25 Mo., 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We see no reason to doubt that the lien held by the laborers passed to the appellees by the assignments made to them. Phillips on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The several objections made to the testimony of the witness Anderson go rather to its weight than to its admissibility, and the fact that all of .the claims were not proved to be for labor would not affect the right of the appellees to recover upon them in so far as they were shown to be for such services as under the statute are secured by lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The claims which were withdrawn during the trial, in so far as they were separate and distinct from those upon which the judgment was rendered, went out of the case, and the appellant was not in any manner prejudiced thereby. It was not .necessary to bring them into the case in the first instance, and the cause could proceed after they were withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">If any claim, entire in its character, was secured and a judgment recovered for a part of it, that might raise a question as to the right of the holder of the claim to institute another suit upon that part of the claim so withdrawn, but it could not affect the right of the appellees to recover upon that part of the claim which remained as a part of the cause of action sued upon. The court did not take into consideration, in determining the amount for which the judgment should be rendered, any matter not, under the statute, secured by lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The exception to the petition for the want of necessary parties should have been sustained, and for the error of the court in overruling it the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">REVERSED AND REMAMDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">[Opinion delivered June 8, 1883.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
