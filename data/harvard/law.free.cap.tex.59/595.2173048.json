Mullins and others (the vendors) having contracted to deliver said cattle by the 1st August, 1881, they were obliged to use, to effect such delivery, that <em>care, skill and energy </em>which a good business man engaged in the stock business would use to collect said stock of cattle and deliver them at the chute in Day\u2019s pasture between November 29, 1880, and August 1,1881, taking them, from the range where they were accustomed to run at the making of the contract, np to August 1, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-13\">\u201c 6.

Touching this subject of ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>der the court charges that neither Mullins (for plaintiffs) nor Driskill (Day\u2019s administrator) had the power to add to the conditions of the contract. If the cattle tendered were of the mark and brands specified in the contract, it was the duty of Mullins to deliver them, and of Driskill to receive them on the contract. That cattle of said mark and brands were of inferior quality would be no reason for their rejection. Mor had Driskill the right to insist upon the additional delivery of any definite number of cattle conditional t\u00e9 his receiving any cattle in the mark and brands specified, if shown to have been tendered upon the contract. If it appear from the testimony that Mullins (for plaintiffs) had delivered the said, stocks of cattle (including in the delivery those tendered), or if Mullins had used such <em>due diligence </em>to deliver them as before defined in paragraph Mo. 5 of this charge, then it would not have been an addition to the contract (nor a cause for rejection of the cattle) for Mullins to insist upon such delivery as a satisfaction or compliance with the obligation of Mullins (for plaintiffs) to gather and deliver said cattle. Under such conditions the legal effect of such final delivery would be a discharge. If, however, it appear from the testimony that there was a tender by Mullins (for plaintiffs) of said cattle, upon condition that they be received in full satisfaction, or as a discharge of their obligation to deliver the cattle, when it was not true, or shown by the testimony, that Mullins had either delivered (including those tendered in the delivery) all said stocks, or had used due diligence, as defined above in paragraph Mo. 5, then Driskill (Day\u2019s administrator) was authorized to reject \"sitid cattle so tendered, and the plaintiffs would be liable - for damages for not delivering them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-4\">\u201c 8. The plaintiffs are entitled to the purchase money at the contract price, \u00a79.50 each, for all the cattle the testimony shows to have been delivered on the contract, with interest at ten per cent, per annum from April 1, 1881.

If, from the testimony, it \u25a0 is shown that the plaintiffs (or-those they represented) failed to deliver said stocks of cattle by August 1, 1881, and failed to use such diligence as is defined in paragraph Mo. 5 of this charge, for the collection and delivery thereof, then the jury will- allow defendant damages; and the-measure of damages is the difference, if any, shown by the testimony between the contract price ($9.50 per head) and the' market price or value of such cattle at the time and place of final delivery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>for all of said cattle </em>of said mark and brands which were not so delivered, and which, by the use of diligence, as above defined, the. plaintiffs could have delivered at the said time and place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">\u201c 10. If, from' the testimony, it be shown that Mullins and others (the plaintiffs) complied with their obligation to gather and deliver said stocks, or used the diligence to effect the gathering and delivery,, of said stock as defined in paragraph 5 of this charge, then the jury cannot find any damages for the defendant against the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-7\">\u201c11. If the jury do not find damages under paragraph 9 of this charge, they will then find the amount of purchase money for such cattle, if any, the testimony may show were delivered upon said contract at $9.50 per head, and interest at ten per pent, upon such sum from April 1, 1881, to this date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-8\">\u201c 12. If the jury do find damages under paragraph Mo. 9 of this charge, then they will find the difference in favor of the party in whose favor such difference, between the <em>purchase money </em>and <em>the </em>damages, may be, and if such balance is in favor of plaintiffs the jury will compute interest thereon at ten per cent, from April 1, 1881. . . .\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-9\">The testimony was conflicting as to the number of cattle in the' several brands sold; as to the degree of diligence used by the vendors in the collection of the cattle; as to the difference in the price of cattle August 1, 1881. There being testimony of some cattle dealers and many cow-boys that the ruling price at Day\u2019s pen at that time was $15 per head; while a great amount of testimony by cattle men and dealers showed that, at the same time and place, the price was from ten to ten and a half dollars per head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-10\">Testimony was offered and excluded of the declarations of Charles Mullins, one of the plaintiffs, touching the number of cattle in the several brands,-made before and after the sale to Day.

Other instructions were refused because substantially given in the general charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-12\">The jury returned a verdict, Movember 10, 1882, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-13\">\u201cWe, the jury, . . . find for the plaintiff the sum of twenty thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven dollars.

By the ninth paragraph of the charge the right of appellant to recover damages is limited to such cattle as were not delivered and which appellees \u2022could have delivered by the use of the diligence defined m para-' graph fifth of the charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-10\">The appellant was entitled, as damages, to the difference between the contract price of the cattle (\u00a79.50 per head) and the highest 'market value per head between August 1, 1881, and date of the trial (November, 1882).</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-11\">\u2018 As to measure of damages, Randon <em>v. </em>Barton, 4 Tex., 289; Calvit <em>v. </em>McFadden, 13 Tex., 324; Cartwright <em>v. </em>McCook, 33 Tex., 612; Gregg <em>v. </em>Fitzhugh, 36 Tex., 127; Brasher <em>v. </em>Davidson, 31 Tex., 190; Flake <em>v. </em>Nuse, 51 Tex., 98; Parsons on Contracts, vol. 2, p. 155, and authorities there cited; Add. on Contracts, sec. 357; Chitty on Contracts, pp. 1194-5; Brock <em>v. </em>Jones, 16 Tex., 467; Draper <em>v. </em>Hill, 43 Vt., 439.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-16\"><em>Walton &amp; Hill, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7M\">The charge of the court was correct.

If, by the terms of that contract, they were absolutely bound to deliver by the 1st of August, 1881, ten thousand head, or reasonably- near that quantity, then, as they delivered and tendered but little over half that amount, their contract was violated and they should not have recovered the verdict they did. If, bn the other hand, the number to be delivered! depended upon what they could, with the proper use of skill, care and diligence, collect and turn over to appellant at the place and by the time appointed, then the turning point in the case is' as to the amount and degree of such care, skill and diligence exercised by the appellees in making such delivery. Contracts for the sale of goods, in which the quantity to be delivered is qualified by the words. <em>more or less, </em>and the purchase money is to be determined by the-number of articles delivered, are thus classified by the supreme court of the United States in Brawley <em>v. </em>U. S., 6 Otto, 171:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">1. When the contract is to furnish goods of a certain quality or character to a certain amount.</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">2. When the contract is to furnish or sell certain goods identified by reference to independent circumstances, such as an entire lot deposited in a certain warehouse, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">3. When other qualifying words are added, the more clearly to\u00bb explain what the intention of the parties was in naming the quantity, and allowing the contract to be performed by delivering more or less of it. For instance, when some future act on the part of the seller or purchaser is to fix the quantity of goods which is to be delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">These qualifications may be added. to either of the first two\u00bb classes, and in that event will limit and explain the meaning of the quantity as restricted by the expression <em>more or less.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">In the first of these cases, if the goods delivered vary materially in quantity from the amount bargained for, the contract will be violated. In the second, \u201c the naming of the quantity is regarded only as an estimate of the probable amount, in - reference to which good faith is all that is required of the party making it.\u201d Brawley v. U. S., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>In the third case, the seller is bound to deliver the quantity, determined by the future action on the part of the seller or buyer, as the contract provides. For instance, in the case cited the agreement was to deliver \u201ceight hundred and eighty cords of wood, more or less, as should be determined to be necessary by the post commander,\u201d etc., and it was held that, the post commander having determined that only forty cords were needed, it was held that the United States was not liable for any number of cords beyond the forty cords delivered. See, also, Guillim v. Daniel, 2 Cromp., M. <em>&amp; </em>R., 61; Robinson v. Noble\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, 8 Pet., 181; Pembroke Iron Co. v. Parsons, 5 Gray, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"AbN\">Applying these principles to the present contract, we find that it does not in the least assimilate itself to the first class, as before defined. Disregarding the provisions of the third section of the agreement, we have a contract of the second class, in which there is merely an estimate that the number in the brands and marks mentioned is about ten thousand, and the seller will not be liable if it is less, provided he has acted 'in \"good faith in making the estimate. His contract is in effect to deliver all the cattle in the named brands, with certain exceptions, be the same ten thousand, or more or less; and, unless he has committed a fraud in making his estimate, his contract is fulfilled when he furnishes the entire stock in those brands, less the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">But the third section explains and qualifies the meaning of this stipulation of the parties, and shows that the quantity sold was only so much, as should be actually\" delivered by the 1st of August, 1881. This section adds, by way of giving greater strength and clearness to the meaning of the parties, that all the cattle in said brands, meaning the said supposed ten thousand head, left on the range after the 1st of August, 1881, are not embraced in the sale, but remain the property of the vendors. \"Words could not be plainer nor more explicit to guard the sellers against any conveypjice of, or obligation to convey, ten thousand cattle or thereabouts, or all in the brands mentioned, but only such of them as they should deliver by a certain time. The only question left open was as to what diligence the vendors were to use in gathering and delivering the \u25a0cattle. This might have been the subject of a stipulation, and then the vendors would have been in default and liable to damages, if the failure to deliver was in consequence of a neglect to comply with such stipulation. But there was no agreement on this subject, and in its absence the law says that the parties intended that reasonable care, skill, energy and diligence must be used by the person charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>with that duty in collecting the cattle, and placing at the proper place of delivery within the stipulated time, and this was a question for the jury, under proper instructions from the court; there being no allegation in appellant\u2019s pleadings that the appellees had falsely or fraudulently represented that there were ten thousand cattle in the brands named at the date of the contract, but the averment being to the contrary, <em>i. e., </em>that there were that many, but that they were not all delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Thus the question at issue between the parties was in effect narrowed down to this: Did the sellers deliver all the cattle, subject to the contract, which, by the use of proper diligence, they could have delivered at the time and place at which they contracted to-make the delivery? An examination of the charge of the court shows that it was entirely in accordance with the views of the law announced in this opinion, and submitted them to the jury in a clear, concise and able manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">After briefly stating the pleadings, the court charged that the-contract contained no guaranty as to the number of cattle in the marks and brands. That it was a mere contract of sale of said marks and brands, and an undertaking by the sellers to deliver said stock by August 1,1S81, and that such only as were actually delivered by that time passed to the vendee, the balance remaining unaffected by said contract. He also charged that the vendors were' obliged to use, to effect such delivery, that care, skill and energy which a good business man engaged in the stock business would use to collect said stock of cattle and deliver them at the place where these vendors were bound to furnish them to the vendee, and at the time mentioned in the contract. If the vendors did this, it amounted to reasonable diligence, and hence the charge fulfilled the requirements of the law in all these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">This left to the jury the power to determiners to the diligence-used by appellees in collecting and delivering the cattle, and, as the-evidence on that subject was conflicting, and, to say the least, not very, unequally balanced, the finding of the jury cannot be disturbed on that account. Mullins proved the employment of sufficient hands-for the purpose; their constant work at gathering and delivering; the delays caused by the death of his father and of the purchaser of the stock; the fact that the cattle were scattered over a country for-hundreds of miles, and that they were faithfully searched for in every place where they ranged, and that there were not more than six thousand one hundred or six thousand two hundred, all told, subject to the contract, after deducting those excepted. Of these he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>actually delivered five thousand and sixty-one and tendered five hundred more, leaving from four to six hundred undelivered. If this was the evidence credited by the jury, it was certainly sufficient to show reasonable diligence in collecting and delivering all but the four or six hundred head; and as damages were allowed for failure to deliver, to.the extent of $1,500, and there was no culpable failure in reference to any other portion, we must conclude that the allowance was made in reference to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">It is further said by appellant that the charge of the court as-to the tender of the five hundred head of cattle on 27th July, 1881, was erroneous. The court charged that all cattle tendered and refused were taken out of the contract, which was correct law unless the tender was attended with some circumstance that prevented it from being equivalent to a delivery. The only circumstance of this character which the evidence justified the court in submitting to the jury was stated in the charge. The appellant claims that the tender was coupled with a condition that Driskill should receive this herd of five hundred in full satisfaction of the balance due on the contract. This is the testimony of Driskill; but the evidence of Mullins shows that when he offered the cattle he told Day on 27th July, 1881, that, as far as delivering more cattle was concerned, he did not have time to deliver them before the contract would expire, and if he should deliver any more he would have to take Driskill\u2019s word for the pay. He offered to deliver the cattle that he had brought with him in accordance with the contract, and notified the men to deliver as they had done with all before in Day\u2019s life-time. How, it is evident that up to this time there was no condition asked in reference to the tender, and none was asked until Driskill refused to receive the drove because they were of inferior quality, about which the contract did not provide; and unless he would, for that reason, deliver one thousand five hundred more. It was in reply to this demand that Mullins told Driskill that he did not have time to collect more before the expiration of the contract, and that, if he took the cattle, he (Mullins) would consider the contract at an end whether Driskill did or not. The jury evidently gave credit to this testimony; and, if they did, they believed that Mullins originally annexed no conditions to his tender, and afterwards only refused to submit to an unreasonable demand on the part of Driskill, viz., that he should do a thing which it was out of his power to do, and which his contract did not demand'of him. It was Driskill that imposed unreasonable conditions as to the tender, and it was his refusal to-receive the cattle unless these conditions were complied with that-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>rendered the tender ineffectual. If the cattle offered had been received without anything passing upon the subject, it is clear that the contract would have been complied with on the part of Mullins, except, perhaps, as to the four hundred or six hundred head before mentioned. The demand, therefore, for fifteen hundred more imposed new burdens and conditions on appellees, which they were not bound to submit to in order to secure an acceptance of the cattle tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The court did not err in refusing to give the instructions asked by defendants\u2019 counsel, because the correct. law upon the subject of these charges had already been placed before the jury in the general instructions submitted to them. The measure of damages asked by this charge is, in effect, what the court had already given. It was not what is contended in the twelfth assignment of error,' the difference between the contract price and the highest market value between the date when to be delivered and the time of trial, for the undelivered cattle had not been paid for. Randon <em>v. </em>Barton, 4 Tex., 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">It is complained that the court should not have rendered a judgment foreclosing the lien provided for in the contract upon a verdict which does not find that such lien existed. The contract was pleaded by both parties and put in evidence without objection, and this showed that if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover they were entitled to have the lien enforced. By failing to deny this in their pleadings, the defendants admitted the lien, and there was no proof about it necessary, and nothing in reference to it for the jury to determine. Hence the lien was properly foreclosed without a verdict establishing it. Pearce v. Bell, 21 Tex., 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">As to the numerous objections taken to the ruling of the court excluding appellee\u2019s evidence, it will be found, upon an examination of it in connection with the principles upon which this opinion is based, that all of this testimony was irrelevant and unimportant, and tended to raise issues foreign to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The evidence of Wm. Day, mentioned in second assignment, was offered, it is said, because it proved an implied admission of Mullins that there were other cattle undelivered and which could have been delivered under the contract; and that it would- have shown a purpose not to deliver more cattle unless for a better price. It might have shown that he expected that some cattle, would be undelivered at the expiration of the contract. This was a contingency contemplated by the parties as likely to happen without fault on the part of the sellers, and hence they made provision for it, For fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that the jury might put the very construction upon it which appellant thinks they would have done, the evidence should not have gone to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The fact proposed to be proved by Driskill in his answer to the twentieth interrogatory, and excluded by the court, was irrelevant and incompetent. The utmost that it would have proven was that Mullins supposed or knew that there were cattle subject to the contract in his possession after its expiration. This was admitted; moreover, it did not tend to- prove the only issue on that subject, viz., that they were there because he had not used due diligence to collect and deliver them in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The other evidence ruled out tended to show what was Chas. Mullins\u2019 estimation of the number of cattle in the brands conveyed before and subsequent to the date of the contract. What they were before was not important, because they might have been increased or diminished by purchase or sale between that time and the date of the contract. Besides, the contract estimated them at ten thousand; and whether this estimate was right or wrong could make no difference. Tiie point was, did the sellers use diligence to deliver the cattle in time? and this testimony would have thrown no light upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Upon the whole we see no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">[Opinion delivered June 8, 1883.]</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Associate Justice West did not sit in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
