SWEENEY, Attorney at Law:\n </parties>\n <parties id=\"p-2\">\n  Office of Lawyer Regulation, Complainant-Respondent,\n  <br/>\n  v.\n  <br/>\n  Patrick S. Sweeney, Respondent-Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-3\">\n  No. 2015AP1370-D\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-4\">\n  Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-5\">\n  Opinion Filed: February 19, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <disposition id=\"p-6\">\n  ATTORNEY disciplinary proceeding.\n  <em>\n   Attorney's license revoked.\n  </em>\n </disposition>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   PER CURIAM.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 1 We review the recommendation of the referee, James C. Boll, that Attorney Patrick S. Sweeney's license to practice law should be revoked due to his professional misconduct. The referee also recommended that Attorney Sweeney be ordered to pay restitution consistent with the terms of an order imposed in a related criminal matter, and pay the costs of this proceeding which are $10,338.75 as of August 17, 2018. Attorney Sweeney opted not to pursue an appeal of the referee's report and recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 We adopt the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law and agree that the seriousness of Attorney Sweeney's professional misconduct warrants the revocation of his law license. We further agree that he should pay restitution, as recommended by the referee, and that he should pay the costs of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Attorney Sweeney was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1992. He practiced in the Madison area. He has not previously been subject to professional discipline but his law license is presently administratively suspended for failing to pay state bar dues and failing to certify his compliance with trust account record keeping requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On July 10, 2015, the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) filed a disciplinary complaint alleging that Attorney Sweeney\n   committed five counts of professional misconduct and seeking revocation of his law license. Attorney Sweeney filed an answer and this court appointed Referee James C. Boll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The disciplinary proceeding was adjourned several times. On January 6, 2017, after Attorney Sweeney was indicted on related criminal charges, the referee determined there was cause to defer the matter pending resolution of the related federal criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sweeney\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CR-103 (W.D. Wis. 2017); SCR 22.41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 The federal indictment alleged that from March 2007 until March 2011, Attorney Sweeney devised a scheme to defraud three limited liability companies in which he held a member's ownership interest. Attorney Sweeney approached the co-members of the companies and proposed that the companies loan $105,000 to $115,000 to a friend of Attorney Sweeney. The loan was purportedly secured by a home mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Attorney Sweeney did not loan the money to his friend, but instead converted the funds to his own use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 The indictment alleged that Attorney Sweeney drew checks totaling approximately $420,000 on the companies' checking accounts. When asked for the original promissory note, Attorney Sweeney provided a false document bearing the forged signature of his friend. The indictment also alleged that on February 14, 2013, Sweeney made a false declaration in a bankruptcy matter when he submitted a sworn \"List of Creditors\" that falsely listed the embezzled funds as \"loans to debtor\" in an effort to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy of his obligation to repay the funds he had embezzled. Finally, the indictment alleged that in March 2011, Attorney Sweeney committed identity theft during and in relation to the alleged scheme to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Attorney Sweeney ultimately entered a guilty plea to Count Two, the bankruptcy charge. On November 17, 2017, the federal court sentenced Attorney Sweeney to five years of probation, with the first year on home confinement, and ordered him to pay restitution of $481,970.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sweeney\n   </em>\n   , 16-CR-103 (W.D. Wis. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 Shortly after Attorney Sweeney's federal sentencing hearing, Referee Boll scheduled a status conference in this disciplinary proceeding. On January 22, 2018, the parties advised the referee that Attorney Sweeney had agreed to stipulate to the underlying counts of the disciplinary complaint and that both parties would submit briefs on the question of the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 On January 31, 2018, the parties executed a stipulation in which Attorney Sweeney withdrew his answer and pled no contest to each of the five allegations\n   of misconduct alleged in the OLR's disciplinary complaint. The parties agreed that the disciplinary complaint, the record in the federal criminal prosecution, and the terms of the stipulation could serve as the factual basis for the referee's factual findings and determination of misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 In the stipulation, Attorney Sweeney stated that he understood the misconduct allegations, his rights to contest the misconduct allegations and the factual basis for them, that his entry into this stipulation was made knowingly, voluntarily, without coercion, and without the benefit of any negotiations for a reduction in either charges or sanctions in this matter. He stipulated that his entry into the stipulation represents his admission to all of the misconduct charged in the OLR's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 Both parties filed briefs on the question of sanctions. The OLR maintains that revocation is warranted. Attorney\n   Sweeney requested a one-year suspension of his law license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 On July 30, 2018, Referee Boll filed a report, stating that based on the record he found by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence, that Attorney Sweeney violated the rules of professional conduct as alleged. We summarize that professional misconduct here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 First, the parties stipulated that on December 9, 2013, while his law license was administratively suspended, Attorney Sweeney filed an answer on behalf of a defendant in a pending civil proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Board of Regents of the University v. The Consciousness Project, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Dane County Circuit Court, No. 2013CV3383. The referee concluded that by appearing\n   on behalf of the defendant and thereafter filing an answer, affirmative defense, and counterclaims in the case during the period of time his license was suspended, Attorney Sweeney violated SCR 10.03(6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and former SCR 20:1.15(i)(4),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(f)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count One).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Next, the parties stipulated and the referee concluded that by drafting a Promissory Note to the Fairview Entities while he served as its managing member and had in the past represented the Fairview Entities, and thereafter by signing his friend's name to the Promissory Note, then personally guaranteeing\n   and signing the Promissory Note as guarantor, Attorney Sweeney violated SCR 20:1.7(a)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count Two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 The parties stipulated and the referee concluded that by misappropriating funds of the Fairview Entities for his own personal use, Attorney Sweeney violated SCR 20:8.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count Three).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 The parties stipulated and the referee concluded that by representing to other members of the Fairview Entities, while he served as its managing member, that the Fairview Entities had provided\n   loans to his friend when in fact, the loan funds were dispersed to him for his own personal use without the knowledge or authorization of the other members, Attorney Sweeney again violated SCR 20:8.4(c) (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 Finally, the parties stipulated and the referee concluded that by failing to pay filing fees in the bankruptcy case, even after receiving orders from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Clerk ordering him to do so, Attorney Sweeney violated SCR 20:3.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count Five).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19 After making a determination of misconduct as to all five counts summarized above, the referee evaluated the appropriate discipline for Attorney Sweeney. Attorney Sweeney had argued that a one-year suspension of his law license would suffice, asserting that he was not dishonest and did not have selfish motives. He urged the referee to consider several mitigating factors. The referee agreed that the absence of previous discipline was one mitigating factor, but rejected Attorney Sweeney's request that the referee consider other mitigating factors. As the referee observed, Attorney Sweeney sought to introduce facts beyond the scope of the agreed upon record, and also failed to explain how these factors relate to his admitted misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 20 The referee rejected Attorney Sweeney's argument that a one-year suspension was adequate. He was not swayed by Attorney Sweeney's apparent perception that he was treated harshly by the federal court, and observed that Attorney Sweeney provided no Wisconsin case law to support his proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21 The referee determined that Attorney Sweeney's misconduct was of a very serious nature that warranted revocation. Indeed, the referee concluded that Attorney Sweeney's conduct was even more egregious than the conduct described in the cases offered by the OLR in support of its request for revocation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Edgar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509600\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/230/205/\">\n    230 Wis. 2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509600,11509483\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/601/284/\">\n    601 N.W.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (suspending lawyer for two years for converting $11,000 from a sale of a client's house to pay her own personal expenses);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4140646\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/359/70/\">\n    2014 WI 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4140646\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/359/70/\">\n    359 Wis. 2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4140646\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/359/70/\">\n    856 N.W.2d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suspending lawyer for three years for converting approximately $72,000 of client's funds\n   held in trust and attempting to conceal the conversion);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Krombach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430763\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/589/\">\n    2005 WI 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430763\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/589/\">\n    286 Wis. 2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430763\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/589/\">\n    707 N.W.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (revoking lawyer's license for engaging in a series of conversions of a client's trust funds and for making misleading representations and providing an inaccurate accounting to the OLR).

We determine that the seriousness of Attorney Sweeney's misconduct demonstrates that his law license must be revoked to protect the public, courts, and legal system from the repetition of the misconduct; to impress upon Attorney Sweeney the seriousness of his misconduct; and to deter other attorneys from engaging in similar misconduct. We further accept the referee's recommendation that we order Attorney Sweeney to comply with the restitution order imposed on him in the federal court in the amount of $481,970, and we impose the full costs of this disciplinary proceeding on Attorney Sweeney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 24 IT IS ORDERED that the license of Patrick S.
