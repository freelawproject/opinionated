Univ. Good Samaritan\n   </em>\n   , No. WC18-6171,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203765247\">\n    2018 WL 3765247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. WCCA July 23, 2018). On August 10, 2018, Johnson appealed from the WCCA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Johnson challenges the WCCA's denial of his petition to vacate the Mediation Resolution/Award. We have reviewed the record and summarily affirm the WCCA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Johnson also challenges the constitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.461\">\n    Minn.

Johnson has not identified the constitutional provisions that he claims were violated and he has not provided any legal authority\n   to support his constitutional challenges. We conclude that Johnson has waived his constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Christie v.
