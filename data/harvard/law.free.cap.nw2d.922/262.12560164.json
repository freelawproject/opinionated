All claims, aside from defamation and unpaid wages, were dismissed for failure to state a claim. In July 2018, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the defamation and unpaid wages claims. The district court found Tollefson's claims to be frivolous under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-26-31 and awarded the defendants their attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62] On appeal, Tollefson argues he was not given proper notice of a number of events and/or proceedings in the district court, including the summary judgment motion and hearing. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(7), concluding that the record reflects that Tollefson was provided with notice of the events and/or proceedings in the district court.\n   <em>\n    State v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338499\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/907/765/\">\n    2018 ND 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338499\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/907/765/\">\n    907 N.W.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (service of a motion may be made by mailing a document to the person's last known address). Tollefson also alleges that a number of procedural irregularities resulted in the violation of his constitutional rights. A review of the record indicates no procedural irregularities. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(4), finding no abuse of discretion by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b63] Finally, we conclude Tollefson's appeal is frivolous and without merit, and therefore we summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Witzke v. City of Bismarck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411560\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/718/586/\">\n    2006 ND 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411560\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/718/586/\">\n    718 N.W.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that an appeal is frivolous \"if it is flagrantly groundless, devoid of merit, or demonstrates persistence in the course of litigation which could be seen as evidence of bad faith\"). Because Tollefson's appeal is frivolous, we award the appellees double costs incurred on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.R.App.P. 38 (providing that this Court may award just damages and single or double costs, including reasonable attorney fees, if it determines an appeal is frivolous).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b64] Gerald W.
