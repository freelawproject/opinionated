Although this summary affirmance of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals (WCCA) is not precedential, I am prompted to write to ensure that the WCCA's method of analysis does not introduce uncertainty about what triggers statutory employer liability for workers' compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this case, the employee does not dispute that she was an employee of the Leech Lake Band (the Band), not ISD #115 (the District). Nevertheless, she argues, the District is responsible to pay compensation benefits because the District is a statutory employer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.215\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Under the statute, general\n   contractors are liable for benefits when their \"subcontractor\" fails to provide coverage or pay benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. 1. Based on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Band and the District, the employee characterizes the District as a general contractor and the Band as a subcontractor. Because the Band did not pay benefits, she asserts, the District must.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The record provides no legal basis to consider the District a statutory employer. By entering into a contract with the Band, the District procured services for itself, not as a general contractor for another. Nor was the Band a subcontractor, because it did not provide services to a general contractor or under an existing contract between others.\n   <em>\n    Subcontractor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"subcontractor\" as \"[s]omeone who is awarded a portion of an existing contract by a contractor, esp. a general contractor\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moorhead v. Grassle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339186\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/254/103/\">\n    254 Minn. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339186\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/254/103/\">\n    93 N.W.2d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (1958) (defining contractor and subcontractor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thus, based on the plain language of the statute, the employee's petition did not trigger liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.215\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The WCCA could have ended its analysis there, without reaching the issue of tribal sovereign immunity in a case in which the Band was not a party.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tibbetts v. Leech Lake Reservation Bus. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10661764\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/397/883/\">\n    397 N.W.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. 1986) (reaching the issue of tribal sovereign immunity in a case in which the Band was a party).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For this reason, I respectfully concur in the result.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
