He contends his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to challenge his guilty plea to the child-endangerment charge on factual-basis grounds. Ross also claims the district court erred in refusing to consider additional evidence in mitigation of his punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 30, 2016, Davenport Police Department conducted surveillance on Quincy Ross's residence as part of an ongoing narcotics investigation. During the surveillance, officers observed Ross and a small child-later identified as Ross's son-exiting a vehicle that Ross had parked in front of his residence. The police were aware Ross had warrants out for his arrest and that he was barred from driving. When officers attempted to make contact, Ross fled on foot towards his residence with his son following him. Once Ross was in his residence, he slammed the door, which hit his son and caused a laceration over his left eye. Ross eventually exited his residence peacefully and was placed into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ross was charged with one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver; one count of child endangerment; and one count of operating a motor vehicle while license barred, as a habitual offender. Ross was given notice of the State's intent to pursue a habitual-offender enhancement due to his prior felony convictions. An agreement was reached in which Ross would plead guilty to the possession charge and a lesser-included offense of child endangerment without injury in exchange for the State dismissing the operating-a-motor-vehicle-while-barred charge. Additionally, the State would be able to make any recommendation at the time of sentencing; however, it would not pursue the habitual-offender sentencing enhancement, and if the State recommended incarceration, it would recommend concurrent sentences. On his written guilty plea for the child-endangerment offense, Ross handwrote that he \"put my child at risk by running toward house and away from police.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ross was informed during his plea-taking hearing and in his written guilty plea that to challenge the plea he must file a motion in arrest of judgment. The court accepted Ross's guilty pleas to one count of possession with intent to deliver and one count of child endangerment without injury. Ross did not file a motion in arrest of judgment. During his sentencing hearing, Ross presented two exhibits that he filed earlier that morning consisting of certificates of completion of varying programs and letters from family, friends, and from the Salvation Army describing its program and Ross's request for admittance into the program. The court refused to consider the letters and sentenced Ross to an indeterminate ten-year prison term for the possession offense and an indeterminate two-year term for the child-endangerment offense, to be served concurrently. No mandatory minimum or habitual-offender enhancements were imposed. Ross now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He contends the confrontation between the police and himself was not violent and argues his son merely followed him into his residence and his son appeared to have accidentally hit his head in the process of following his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court had before it the minutes of evidence, Ross's consent to rely on the minutes of evidence to establish a factual basis for his guilty plea, the presentence investigation, and Ross's statement in his written guilty plea admitting he put his child at risk. Upon our de novo review, we are satisfied the facts support the offense and conclude a factual basis for the challenged plea to child endangerment existed. Therefore, we find defense counsel did not breach an essential duty in allowing Ross to enter the plea or in failing to file a motion in arrest of judgment to challenge his plea.

The defense also filed several letters from Ross's family and friends for the court's consideration during sentencing. The defense explained to the court the letters were not from victims when the court inquired about the authors. The court first stated, \"[O]nly victims are allowed to speak,\" and subsequently stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Well, I'm not going to consider them. They're not victims.

We presume the court's concern was related to victims' rights and limitations found in Iowa Code chapter 915. Specifically, Iowa Code section 915.21 allows a victim to provide a written or oral victim-impact statement without being subject to an oath or cross-examination. However, \"victim\" is limited to someone who has \"suffered physical, emotional, or financial harm,\" but can include the victim's immediate family if such a victim has died, become incompetent, or is a minor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20915.10\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 915.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regardless, Ross was not attempting to present evidence from a victim, but rather mitigating evidence as permitted by section 901.2(1). If the situation had been one where the letters were mailed to the court by the individuals themselves rather than presented by the defendant, then the letters may have qualified as information \"from other sources.\" However, the letters and documents were filed by the defendant before the sentencing hearing and clearly the defendant desired the exhibits be considered for sentencing purposes. Thus, pursuant to section 901.2(1), the court was under a duty to consider defendant's mitigating evidence in sentencing-at least absent an objection by the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, before pronouncing judgment and sentence, the court must receive and examine \"all pertinent information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20901.5\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 901.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Our supreme court has long held a defendant is entitled to fundamental fairness at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At 7:00 a.m. that day, defense counsel filed with the clerk of court two proposed exhibits: the first containing certificates of completion of various programs and courses Ross completed while in jail, and the second containing several letters from Ross's family and friends and the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center. During the hearing, defense counsel identified those exhibits for the court. When the court inquired about the authors, counsel explained that the letters were not from victims. The court then stated \"Well, I'm not going to consider them. They're not victims. He can tell me about what support he has.\" Although counsel made no formal offer of the exhibits into evidence, the combined general docket shows the exhibits were exhibits (no longer proposed exhibits) at 9:01 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If the record ended there, I might be concurring with the majority.

Although the sentencing transcript record contains no formal offer of Ross's proposed exhibits and contains no verbal indication the court admitted the exhibits in evidence, I interpret the combined general docket to mean the proposed exhibits filed at 7:00 a.m. were admitted into evidence and docketed at 9:01 a.m. As such, the exhibits were \"received\" by the court from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20901.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 901.2(1). The contents of the letters can be characterized as providing unsworn facts and opinions concerning family circumstances and employment and rehabilitation potential. Thus, they were relevant to the question of sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20901.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A sentencing court has a duty to consider all the circumstances of a particular case. We do not believe however, it is required to specifically acknowledge each claim of mitigation urged by a defendant. Furthermore, the failure to acknowledge a particular sentencing circumstance does not necessarily mean it was not considered. Instead, we review a sentence for an abuse of discretion based on the entire record, and look to see if the reasons articulated by the trial court are sufficient to enable us to determine if an abuse of discretion occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In response to remarks by defense counsel, the court inquired as to the voluntary placement status of the Salvation Army program and with regard to making placement a condition of probation, the court stated: \"Doesn't appear from that letter they accept that, but maybe they do.\" Thus, the court had read and considered the Salvation Army letter-defendant's second exhibit-though not orally admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ross then spoke in mitigation and was given a full opportunity to say what he wanted, and did so in a lengthier manner than we often see. He told the court he made a mistake and was really sorry, that he has two sons and wanted an opportunity to make things right so his younger son \"doesn't take these steps that I made in my life.\" He told the court a lot of people look up to him and he asked for mercy so he could make things right with his family and better himself. He explained he had a job waiting for him, wanted to make things right for his sons' sake and was sorry for putting his family through this. Ross's allocution takes eighteen lines of the sentencing transcript. When the court announced its reasons for imposing the sentence, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Now, I've read this PSI, and I've heard what you said today and I see your things that you've done in jail, and I'm glad you've been productive in the jail. You're lucky that this is one jail that has a lot of programs that do help people, but it's not our fault that you didn't get substance abuse treatment in the jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   That's your fault, and it's based on-and today, based on this, I'm looking at a history of somebody since back in 2003, 2005, frankly, your actions speak louder than your words. You've got an 8-year-old son and today is the first time that you're sorry that you put him through this? Where have you been the last eight years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   You've been in prison. You've been continuing to use substances since you've been off parole, and you've been deceptive. You've been deceptive to those people back there about your life and your relationships. You've been deceptive to yourself, and that's not the type of person who's gonna be successful on probation, and that's why-plus these are assaultive kind of behaviors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Every single time there's all these failures to appear with warrants issued, failure to appear, warrants issued, probation, parole violation. You knew in May that part of your parole was not to use drugs, and you continued to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: That's why I'm seeking if you can give me some type of help. I don't think prison will help me, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: Well, obviously you didn't seek the community help that was available in this community. Salvation Army has been there for years. It's voluntary. You haven't been in that. You haven't taken advantage-now that you're gonna be sent to prison again, all of a sudden you're willing to go. You've got all these judgments that you haven't paid and past things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   You've been unemployed, yet you seem to have enough money to buy drugs. Frankly, your priorities have not been in the right place. You've not been accepted to drug court. That might have been a good place for you, but I'm not in charge of that program. They have specific criteria, and yours haven't been accepted. The Residential Corrections Facility isn't gonna accept somebody who's got a history of violence like you do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   We've-frankly, we don't have any other community resources that I think are appropriate or that you've availed yourself of up until maybe now you're saying that you're gonna go to the Salvation Army, but I don't believe at this time that probation is an appropriate disposition, and I'm going to not suspend the sentence, and I'm gonna order that you be delivered to the Iowa Department of Corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On my review of the entire record, I would find that, although the court announced it would not consider the letters, its thorough and interactive recitation of reasons for its sentencing decision in fact responded to the primary themes contained in the letters. The court invited Ross to tell her what he wanted her to know from the letters; and, although he did not reference the letters in his statements in mitigation, his summarized remarks to the court embodied their essence. The court did nothing to limit or hinder his ability to allocute. He was given the opportunity to say what he wanted. The court then explained its reason for the sentence in detail, reciting numerous facts and factors it considered. After carefully reviewing the entire record, it is clear to me the court considered all the relevant and pertinent facts and circumstances, and did not abuse its discretion in its sentencing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I would affirm the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The record does not show an exhibit maintenance order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Iowa Ct.
