Flynn's recommendation that the court declare Attorney David W. Schiltz in default and suspend his Wisconsin law license for a period of 18 months for professional misconduct in connection with: (1) his work on certain client matters; (2) his practice of\n   law while his law license was suspended for noncompliance with mandatory continuing legal education (CLE) reporting requirements; and (3) his failure to disclose his unauthorized practice of law in his reinstatement petition to the Board of Bar Examiners (BBE). The referee also recommended that this court order Attorney Schiltz to successfully complete 25 hours of continuing legal education (CLE) courses as deemed appropriate by the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR). Finally, the referee recommended that the court order Attorney Schiltz to make restitution to a former client and to pay the full costs of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Because no appeal has been filed, we review the referee's report pursuant to\n   Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.17(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After conducting our independent review of the matter, we agree with the referee that, based on Attorney Schiltz's failure to answer the complaint filed by the OLR, the OLR is entitled to a default judgment. However, we disagree with the referee that Attorney Schiltz's professional misconduct warrants an 18-month suspension of his Wisconsin law license. We conclude, instead, that a nine-month suspension is warranted. We order Attorney Schiltz to make restitution and to successfully complete 25 hours of CLE courses as deemed appropriate by the OLR. We also find it appropriate to impose the full costs of this proceeding on Attorney Schiltz, which are $4,705.70 as of August 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Attorney Schiltz was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1987. He had no disciplinary history prior to the filing of this complaint. His law license has been administratively suspended for failing to comply with CLE reporting requirements since May 31, 2016, and for failing to pay annual bar dues and to provide a required trust account certification since October 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On March 15, 2018, the OLR filed the current complaint against Attorney Schiltz. On June 25, 2018, the OLR filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleges a total of 25 counts of professional misconduct. The following facts are taken\n   from the OLR's amended complaint, which, as discussed more fully below, Attorney Schiltz has admitted by default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Practice During Suspension (Count 1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On May 31, 2016, the BBE suspended Attorney Schiltz's law license due to his failure to comply with CLE reporting requirements. During his suspension, Attorney Schiltz continued to meet with clients and appear in court, primarily in estate matters. The OLR alleged in its amended complaint that this conduct gave rise to the following violation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Count 1: By continuing to practice law following the May 31, 2016 suspension of his law license, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.26(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 31.10(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   20:8.4(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Estate of W.E.S. (Counts 2-3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 W.E.S. died in May 2015. In December 2015, the probate court appointed C.R. as the personal\n   representative of W.E.S.'s estate. Because C.R. resided out of state, the court appointed Attorney Schiltz as the estate's resident agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the time of his death, W.E.S. owned a 50 percent interest in certain real property. The property sold in February 2016, and Attorney Schiltz acted as the title company's disbursement agent for the sale. Attorney Schiltz received the $104,766.75 net proceeds of the sale, from which he was to disburse 50 percent of the sale proceeds ($52,383.38) to W.E.S.'s estate. He did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In August 2016, C.R. retained a lawyer to represent him and the estate in an effort to obtain the sale proceeds from Attorney Schiltz. The effort was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 In November 2016, W.E.S.'s estate sued Attorney Schiltz and the title company to obtain the owed portion of the real estate sale proceeds. Attorney Schiltz did not appear or participate in the civil case. In April 2017, the circuit court issued a default judgment against Attorney Schiltz for $55,875.59, representing the sale proceeds plus attorney fees. By early May 2017, Attorney Schiltz had paid $52,383.38 of the judgment, which represented the sale proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Although the BBE suspended Attorney Schiltz's law license on May 31, 2016, Attorney Schiltz did not inform either C.R. or the probate court of his suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The OLR alleged in its amended complaint that the conduct described above gave rise to the following two violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Count 2: By failing to promptly deliver $52,383.38 to the estate of W.E.S., Attorney Schiltz violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(1) and current SCR 20:1.15(e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Count 3: By failing to notify C.R. that his Wisconsin law license had been suspended, by failing to advise C.R. to seek successor counsel, and by failing to provide written notification of his suspension to the probate court, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.26(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Estate of J.S.

J.S.'s son, W.R.S., hired Attorney Schiltz to assist him with J.S.'s affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 In May 2015, Attorney Schiltz drafted and had W.R.S. sign a transfer by affidavit form, seeking to have J.S.'s $3,000 in assets transferred to W.R.S. Consistent with the form's instructions, Attorney Schiltz sent a copy of the form to the Estate and Casualty Recovery Section (ECRS) of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 In July 2015, and again in February 2016, the ECRS wrote to Attorney Schiltz, asking him to provide information that would determine if J.S.'s estate owed any funds to the ECRS. Attorney Schiltz did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Between February and May of 2016, W.R.S. called Attorney Schiltz 16 times to find out the status of the matter. Attorney Schiltz did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 In June 2016, Attorney Schiltz told W.R.S. that he had taken care of the ECRS claim. This was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Later in June 2016, the ECRS again wrote to Attorney Schiltz seeking documentation and any funds owed. That same day, the ECRS contacted W.R.S. directly, who learned that the matter had not been resolved. W.R.S. provided the requested information to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 In July 2016, W.R.S. filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Schiltz. Attorney Schiltz did not cooperate with the ensuing OLR investigation. On February 13, 2017, this court temporarily suspended Attorney Schiltz's law license for his non-cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 Although the BBE suspended Attorney Schiltz's law license on May 31, 2016, Attorney Schiltz did not inform either W.R.S. or the probate court of his suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 The OLR alleged in its amended complaint that the conduct described above gave rise to the following five violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Count 4: By failing to respond to the ECRS's attempts to contact him regarding its claim against his client, the estate of J.S., between July 2015 and June 2016, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 20:1.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Count 5: By failing to respond to W.R.S.'s telephone calls between February and May 2016 requesting information regarding the status of the probate matter, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 20:1.4(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Count 6: By falsely informing W.R.S. that he had resolved the ECRS claim against the estate of J.S. when he had not done so, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Count 7: By failing to notify W.R.S. that his license to practice law had\n   been suspended, by failing to advise W.R.S. to seek successor counsel, and by failing to provide written notification of his suspension to the probate court, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.26(1).\n   \u2022 Count 8: By willfully failing to respond timely to the OLR's written requests for information, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.03(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 22.03(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Municipal representation (Counts 9-11)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 At the time of his May 31, 2016 suspension for failure to comply with CLE reporting requirements, Attorney Schiltz had been the attorney for a particular town for several years, including acting as municipal prosecutor. Attorney Schiltz did not timely inform the town or the town's municipal judge of his suspension, nor did he timely advise the town to seek successor counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 From June of 2016 through at least April 30, 2017, Attorney Schiltz continued to represent the town in municipal court and other proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 In May 2017, the OLR received a grievance against Attorney Schiltz concerning his representation of the town while his law license was suspended. Attorney Schiltz did not cooperate with the OLR's subsequent investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 The OLR alleged in its amended complaint that the course of conduct described above gave rise to the following three violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Count 9: By continuing until April 30, 2017 to actively represent the town following the May 31, 2016 suspension of his law license, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.26(2) and SCR 31.10(1), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Count 10: By failing to notify the town that his license to practice law had been suspended, by failing to advise the town to seek successor counsel, and by failing to provide written notification of his suspension to the municipal court before which he had matters pending, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.26(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Count 11: By failing to respond timely to the OLR's written requests for information, Attorney Schiltz violated SCR 22.03(2) and SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Limited Liability Partnership Representation (Counts 12-15)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 In March 2015, a condominium association filed a civil suit against a limited\n   liability partnership (LLP) and two individuals over a dispute regarding\n   management of the condominium. Soon after being served, the defendants hired Attorney Schiltz to represent them. Related to the representation, the LLP gave $3,305 to Attorney Schiltz to be held in trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 In August 2016, Attorney Schiltz filed pleadings in the case. Over the next few months, Attorney Schiltz appeared at multiple scheduling conferences in the case. The court scheduled a trial. Attorney Schiltz informed his clients of that fact, but told them they did not need to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 In March 2017, Attorney Schiltz failed to appear at a summary judgment proceeding. Later in March 2017, neither Attorney Schiltz nor his clients appeared at the scheduled court trial. As a result of the non-appearance, the circuit court granted summary judgment against the defendants in the amount of $66,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28 Attorney Schiltz's clients made numerous attempts to contact him both before and after the circuit court's entry of summary judgment against them. Attorney Schiltz was unresponsive, and did not otherwise inform his clients about the status of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 29 Eventually, Attorney Schiltz contacted his clients and told them he would move to vacate the judgment. He never did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 In early May 2017, the defendants hired a different lawyer to represent them. The successor counsel moved to overturn the judgment. The circuit court eventually reopened the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 31 In July 2017, the successor counsel wrote to Attorney Schiltz, requesting the $3,305 that Attorney Schiltz was to be holding in trust. Attorney Schiltz did not respond or turn over the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 32 During the circuit court proceedings, the circuit court informed the OLR of Attorney Schiltz's conduct.

The referee cited no precedent to support his suggested tripling of the suspension sought by the OLR, nor did he discuss the cases cited by the OLR in its brief in support of default judgment. The referee noted that no mitigating factors existed to diminish the seriousness of Attorney Schiltz's misconduct, and that Attorney\n   Schiltz's actions \"do not reflect respect for the rule of law or basic honesty.\" The referee additionally recommended that this court require Attorney Schiltz \"to complete 25 hours of CLE credit courses in areas that are approved in advance by OLR. The courses should include ethics and trust account matters.\" Finally, the referee recommended that this court order Attorney Schiltz to pay the full costs of this proceeding, as well as $3,305 in restitution to the LLP referenced earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 62 Attorney Schiltz did not appeal from the referee's report and recommendation.

Although the OLR effected personal service of its original complaint\n   and mailed the amended complaint to both Attorney Schiltz's office address registered with the State Bar and the address at which he was served with the original complaint, he failed to appear or present a defense. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to declare him in default. In addition, the referee properly relied on the allegations of the complaint, which were deemed admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Coplien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001798\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/311/\">\n    2010 WI 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001798\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/311/\">\n    329 Wis.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001798\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/329/311/\">\n    788 N.W.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore accept the referee's findings of fact based on the allegations of the amended complaint. We also agree with the referee that those findings of fact adequately support the legal conclusions of professional misconduct with respect to all counts of misconduct alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 64 However, we disagree with the referee's recommendation that this court should impose an 18-month license suspension. As noted above, it is ultimately this court's responsibility, rather than the referee's, to determine the appropriate level of discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Reitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    2005 WI 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    279 Wis.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    694 N.W.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In considering the appropriate sanction, this court seeks to impress upon the attorney the seriousness of the misconduct, to deter other attorneys from engaging in similar misconduct, and to protect the public, the courts, and the legal system from a repetition of the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Grogan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007308\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/341/\">\n    2011 WI 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007308\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/341/\">\n    331 Wis.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007308\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/341/\">\n    795 N.W.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 65 Under the unique circumstances of this case, we conclude that a nine-month suspension is appropriate. In imposing this suspension, we agree with the referee's view that the six-month suspension requested by the OLR in its amended complaint is insufficient. Although the OLR correctly noted in briefing to the referee that we imposed a six-month suspension in\n   <em>\n    Scanlan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baratki\n   </em>\n   , both of these cases have distinguishing features. Unlike the present case, where no mitigating factors appear present,\n   <em>\n    Scanlan\n   </em>\n   featured a respondent-lawyer who was remorseful and ultimately cooperative with the disciplinary process, and who suffered significant mental health and personal problems at the time of his misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Scanlan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459772\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/290/30/\">\n    290 Wis.2d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459772\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/290/30/\">\n    712 N.W.2d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally,\n   the present case involves nearly three times as many misconduct counts as did\n   <em>\n    Baratki\n   </em>\n   (25 counts here versus nine in\n   <em>\n    Baratki\n   </em>\n   ). On the instant facts, then, we agree with the referee that something more than a six-month suspension is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 66 But given that Attorney Schiltz has no disciplinary history, the referee's recommended 18-month suspension seems high. We find\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279036\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/39/\">\n    2016 WI 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279036\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/39/\">\n    372 Wis.2d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279036\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/372/39/\">\n    886 N.W.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   instructive. Like Attorney Schiltz, the respondent-lawyer in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   had no disciplinary history. Also like Attorney Schiltz, the respondent-lawyer in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   committed a considerable number of misconduct counts (21 counts, versus Attorney Schiltz's 25 counts). Also like Attorney Schiltz, this misconduct included failing to inform multiple clients, opposing counsel, and courts of a license suspension; continuing to practice law after a license suspension; inattentiveness to client matters; and failing to cooperate with OLR investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We concluded that a nine-month suspension was \"clearly deserved\" in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   , as the respondent-lawyer's actions showed \"a total disregard of his clients' needs and objectives, as well as of his obligations as an attorney in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38.

We agree with this recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 68 As is our normal practice, we also find it appropriate to impose the full costs of this disciplinary proceeding, which are $4,705.70 as of August 27, 2018, on Attorney Schiltz.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCR 22.24(1m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 69 Finally, turning to the issue of restitution, the OLR alleged, and the referee agreed, that this court should order Attorney Schiltz to pay restitution in the amount of $3,305 to the LLP that had given Attorney Schiltz that sum to be held in trust. As explained above, Attorney Schiltz failed to return that sum to the LLP upon its request. Attorney Schiltz had multiple opportunities to object to this restitution amount before both the referee and this court. He has not done so.
