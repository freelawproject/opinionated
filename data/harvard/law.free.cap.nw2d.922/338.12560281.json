That\n   amount shall then be remitted to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pursuant to MCL 600.2963(8), appellant shall not file a new civil action or appeal in this Court until the entry fee in this case is paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Clerk of the Court shall furnish two copies of this order to appellant and return a copy of appellant's pleadings with this order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
