During the course of the robbery, the assailant bound customers and an employee with duct tape, sexually assaulted one of the customers, and fled in that customer's car. Appellant was arrested and charged with four counts of aggravated robbery, four counts of kidnapping, one count of second-degree assault, and one count of attempted second-degree criminal sexual conduct. Before trial, the state also charged appellant with one count of motor vehicle use without consent. At trial on these charges, the state introduced\n   <em>\n    Spreigl\n   </em>\n   evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of appellant's 1990 burglary conviction for the purpose of proving his identity.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In deciding his criminal appeal, we first determined that appellant's earlier burglary conviction, which was dissimilar from the charges appellant challenged in his 1994 appeal, was not relevant and that the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed its probative value.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7747128\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/520/177/#p180\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7747128\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/520/177/#p180\">\n     at 181-82\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Because the prohibition on introducing\n    <em>\n     Spreigl\n    </em>\n    evidence is a procedural safeguard and is thus irrelevant to the defendant's actual guilt or innocence, a reversal based on a violation of that safeguard \"does not contradict innocence,\" but does not \"agree with innocence.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    We conclude that the legislature intended for the phrase \"consistent with innocence\" to mean \"agrees with innocence.\" Our decision is based on\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.16\">\n     Minn.
