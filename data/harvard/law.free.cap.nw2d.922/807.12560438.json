That is, the circuit court decided the matter before giving Mr. K. an opportunity to present his case. The State concedes this was error, but says it is susceptible to a \"harmless-error\" review. It is not. We hold that denying a defendant the opportunity to present his case-in-chief is a structural error, the consequence of which is an automatic new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.

Mr. K. contested these allegations, and so the matter proceeded to a bench trial after Mr. K. waived his right to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 When the State wishes to terminate a parent's rights, it must follow a statutorily-mandated, two-phase trial procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first is the \"grounds\" phase, the purpose of which is to determine \"if the allegations in a ... petition to terminate parental rights are proved by clear and convincing evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048.31\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 48.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The result of this first phase is a determination regarding the parent's fitness: \"If grounds for the termination of parental rights are found by the court or jury, the court shall find the parent unfit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048.424\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 48.424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). If the parent is found unfit, then (and only then) may the court proceed to the dispositional phase.

Mr. K. testified that he had not seen his children \"for a couple of months\" and wasn't involved in their lives. He testified that he didn't visit his children, speak to them, write to them, text them, or contact their foster home from July 2015 to September 2016. When the State asked Mr. K. why he didn't contact his children, Mr. K. stated he didn't have a phone and that a social worker told him he couldn't contact the foster home. Mr. K. admits that he didn't make any effort to contact his children and was hardly involved in their lives for three years. When pressed as\n   to whether he had a good reason for not contacting them, he said: \"There's no reason at all. There's no excuse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 On cross-examination by his own attorney, Mr. K. reiterated that a social worker told him that he wasn't permitted to contact his children or allowed to have the foster home's phone number. Mr. K.'s attorney didn't explore any other aspects of Mr. K.'s direct testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 On redirect, Mr. K. again admitted that he took no steps to contact his children and that he did not make any inquiries about how or if he could contact them. The circuit court itself asked Mr. K. to relate what the social worker told him. \"[S]he told me that she wasn't allowed to give me any information on [my children,]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   he said. The circuit court also asked him why he chose not to visit his children even though he had visitation rights. Mr. K. said he moved out of town in July 2015 for a better job and was unable to visit his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 The guardian ad litem renewed his examination, asking Mr. K. whether anything prevented him from visiting his children. Mr. K. said that other than being out of town, nothing prevented him from exercising his visitation rights. Mr. K's testimony ended with his attorney asking him about the contact information Mr. K. gave to the social worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 The State rested the \"grounds\" phase of its case at the conclusion of Mr. K.'s testimony. After some discussion amongst the parties and the circuit court about the next procedural step in the case, Mr. K.'s attorney asked that he be allowed to \"put my client on\n   the stand and finish our side of the case.\" Before he could do so, however, the guardian ad litem moved the circuit court for a directed verdict arguing that the State had proved adequate grounds for terminating Mr. K.'s parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 Even though Mr. K. had not yet put on his case, the circuit court granted the motion. It decided that, even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. K., he had abandoned S.M.H. and J.E.H. within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048.415\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 48.415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After finding Mr. K. to be an unfit parent, the circuit court proceeded later that same day to the \"disposition\" phase of the trial to determine the children's best interests. At its conclusion, the circuit court permanently terminated Mr. K.'s parental rights to both his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Mr. K. appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued that deciding whether he was an unfit parent before he could present his case violated his due process rights. Further, and more significantly for our purposes here, Mr. K. said this was no run-of-the-mill error, it was structural error, the consequence of which is a mandatory reversal. The State admitted error (it could hardly do otherwise), but maintained the circuit court's decision was subject to a \"harmless-error\" review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The court of appeals agreed with the State. The court of appeals said the evidentiary record (to\n   which Mr. K. was unable to contribute except through the State's adverse examination and his own counsel's cross-examination) overwhelmingly established grounds for termination. So the error, it concluded, was harmless. We granted Mr. K.'s petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The issue we consider here presents a question of law: \"Whether a particular error is structural and therefore not subject to a harmless error review is a question of law for our independent review.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The parties agree the circuit court erred when it decided he was an unfit parent before he had an opportunity to present his defense. But they go their separate ways with respect to whether this\n   error was \"structural,\" as opposed to something subject to \"harmless-error\" review.\n   <em>\n    Travis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692214\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/347/142/\">\n    347 Wis. 2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b655,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692214\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/347/142/\">\n    832 N.W.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Constitutional errors may be structural errors or may be subject to harmless error analysis.\").

That is, a trial is a procedurally balanced proceeding in which the parties face no disparate structural barriers in presenting their respective cases to the decision-maker. Although its precise origins are unknown, the adversarial trial took root in England shortly after the Norman conquest of 1066. Ellen E. Sward,\n   <em>\n    AHistory of the Civil Trial in the United States\n   </em>\n   , 51 Kan. L.

The trial mechanism evolved over time, but manifested many of its modern characteristics as early as the late-fifteenth century. Some accounts, dating back to 1468, describe a trial as a proceeding in which \"the parties or their counsel in open court present their evidence to the jury, and witnesses are examined upon oath.\" Theodore F.T. Plucknett,\n   <em>\n    A Concise History of Common Law\n   </em>\n   , 129-30 (Little, Brown &amp; Co. 5th Ed. 1956) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Today, Sir William Blackstone's eighteenth-century description of a proper trial is readily familiar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The nature of the case, and the evidence intended to be produced, are next laid before [the jury] by counsel also on the [opening] side; and, when their evidence is gone through, the advocate on the other side opens the adverse case, and supports it by evidence; and then the party which began is heard by way of reply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   3 William Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   ch. 23, 367 (Richard Couch, London 21st ed. 1844) (1768).

The defendant may choose to forgo his presentation, of course, but without the option of going forward we cannot dignify the proceeding with the appellation \"trial.\" Such a proceeding is structurally unbalanced because the defendant faces an impediment to presenting his case that the State does not. Here, for example, the State had the option of choosing who would testify, the order in which it would present its witnesses, and the information it would adduce\n   from each witness. It is of no constitutional moment that the State's case consisted solely of Mr. K.'s testimony. The relevant fact is that the State enjoyed the liberty of choosing the parameters of its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Mr. K. enjoyed no such liberty. In the \"grounds\" phase of the trial, the circuit court did not allow him to decide who his witnesses would be, the order in which they would testify, or the evidence he would seek from each one. By denying to Mr. K. the same opportunity allowed to the State, the circuit court required that he present his case only in response to the prosecutor's questions and within the constraints of his attorney's cross-examination. Mr. K.'s attorney obviously believed there was more to the defense than he was able to squeeze into the interstices of the State's case. After the State rested, he asked \"to be able to put my client on the stand and finish our side of the case.\" The record does not reflect with certainty whether \"finishing\" the case would have involved additional witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it does show that his attorney thought there was more to Mr. K.'s defense and that he was not waiving his right to present it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 The State says the circuit court's error was of the same general nature as those we have previously assayed for harmlessness. It points out that in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , for example, we observed that \"[a] criminal defendant has a personal, fundamental right to testify and present his own version of events in his own words.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186426\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/355/722/\">\n    355 Wis. 2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b619,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186426\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/355/722/\">\n    849 N.W.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal marks omitted).

The United States Supreme Court came to a similar conclusion after considering a defendant's\n   claim that his trial was defective because the trial court excluded evidence that could have cast doubt on the credibility of his confession. The Court said that, \"[i]n the absence of any valid state justification, exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor's case encounter and 'survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12764\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/683/#p691\">\n    476 U.S. at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12764\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/683/#p691\">\n    106 S.

Ct. 2142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 The State says the circuit court's error in this case is of a piece with Nelson,\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   . They may not all share the same spot on the continuum between harmlessness and harmfulness, it suggests, but they nonetheless all exist on that continuum. The difference, it argues, is one of magnitude, not type. Conceptually, excluding a single piece of evidence is a fractional denial of the defendant's opportunity to put on his case. So, if excluding a fractional part of the defendant's case is subject to harmless-error review (as the State asserts), it follows that excluding the whole would be subject to the same test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 The State's observation is accurate, as far as it goes. But it does not go far enough. If a trial were a two-dimensional affair, the State's argument would be more persuasive. If a case were merely a compilation of individual facts, then the difference between excluding one piece of the defendant's evidence and excluding the entirety of the defendant's case is just a question of quantity. But a trial is not a formless jumble of evidence dumped in the factfinder's lap, nor does the factfinder adjudge a party's success by the size of the heap. A trial is, instead, an exhibition of evidence\n   presented within an intentionally-ordered construct designed to produce an intelligible and persuasive account of the matter\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . It is, in that sense, three-dimensional, all components of which combine to produce depth, emphasis, cohesion, and-ultimately-understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 So a trial is not just a contest between competing facts; it is a contest between the constructs in which they are presented, something practitioners call the \"theory of the case.\" The competition between the theories of the case is what makes the trial adversarial, a dynamic that affects every aspect of the proceeding, including the type, nature, and extent of evidence a party may choose to elicit during the opposing party's case-in-chief. If defense counsel knew beforehand that the court would deny him the right to present his case, he might shoehorn as much of his presentation as possible into the State's case. That might solve the quantitative problem presented by the circuit court's error. But it could do very little, if anything, to preserve the defendant's ability to present his facts according to his theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 The error in this case did not affect just the quantity of evidence presented, such as in Nelson,\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   . It was, instead, an error affecting the adversarial nature of the trial. This matter was presented to the circuit court according to only the State's theory of the case. This lack of mutuality made the hearing less\n   like an adversarial contest between the parties and more like a continental-European inquisitorial proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State might be more\n   likely to see the permeating flaw this introduces into the very framework of the trial if the defense controlled the sequence of the State's witnesses and their direct examination, or if the State could present its case only through the cross-examination of its own witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 The harmless-error rubric is incapable of reaching an error that affects the framework of the trial. By its own terms, it is designed to address errors whose effect \"may therefore be\n   <em>\n    quantitatively\n   </em>\n   assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [it was] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulminante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    499 U.S. at 307-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    111 S.

But there is no quantitative assessment that can measure the harm of a proceeding in which only the State is allowed to present a theory of the case.

The proper order is first to determine whether the error is structural in nature. If it is not, then (and only then) we assay the error's harmlessness-that is to say, we consider whether it prejudiced the defense. The dissent, however, started with the second step. It conducted a minute examination of the record to assess the sufficiency of the evidence, reasoning that \"[p]recedent and fundamental fairness to C.L.K. and to his two children require that we consider evidence presented at both the factfinding hearing and the dispositional hearing when determining the effect of the error.\" Dissent, \u00b687. But the \"effect on C.L.K.\" is what we consider when conducting the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   step of the analysis. The\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   step (determining whether the error is structural) depends on the error's effect on the proceedings, not the prejudice to C.L.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 This is why cases addressing structural error do not scrutinize the evidence presented at trial, as the dissent insists we must do. Dissent, \u00b679. The\n   two cases foundational to the structural error doctrine,\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   and Fulminante, illustrate this neatly. The issue in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   was whether denying a defendant his right to counsel of his choice was a structural error.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    548 U.S. at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    126 S. Ct. 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He had gone through a complete trial, so there was an evidentiary record for the Court to consider if that had been relevant to the question. But in the course of reaching its decision, the Court completely ignored it. There is no mystery as to why-the evidence of record simply has nothing to say about whether an error is structural. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Fulminante\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed whether coerced confessions qualified as structural errors.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    499 U.S. at 306-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    111 S. Ct. 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , there was an evidentiary record available for the Court's consideration. But in concluding there was no structural error, no part of its opinion addressed the evidence adduced at trial. As these cases demonstrate, a reviewing court does not determine whether an error is structural by perusing the evidence. It discovers that answer by evaluating the nature of the error in relation to the damage it causes to the trial mechanism. So when the dissent faults us for not joining in an in-depth review of the evidence against Mr. K., it is actually adjuring us to look in the wrong place for signs of structural error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 If we could start with a harmless-error review, as the dissent does, we would have no need for the structural error doctrine at all, because we would just affirm all judgments in which we believe the error caused no harm. That, of course, depends on the assumption that no error can hide potentially useful information from us, that we can always perform a quantitative harmless-error analysis. But the whole point of the structural error doctrine is that some errors so undermine the proceeding's integrity that we\n   cannot know what we do not know. The dissent's approach depends on the belief that a state-centric half-trial in which the defendant was not allowed to present his case-in-chief could not have deprived the court of any instructive information. Based on that assumption, it totted up the information that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in the record and declared it good enough. Nowhere, however, does it explore the actual question presented by this case, to wit, whether the circuit court's proceedings had enough structural integrity to adduce the information necessary to decide whether Mr. K. was an unfit parent. So the dissent proceeded as if the error was not structural without ever inquiring into whether it actually was.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Not even the precedent on which the dissent relied for the motive force of its reasoning supports its conclusion. The dissent says that\n   <em>\n    Evelyn C.R.\n   </em>\n   teaches us that the solution to the problem created by the circuit court's error is to borrow from the \"disposition\" phase of the trial to supply any deficit in the \"grounds\" phase. Dissent, \u00b678 (citing\n   <em>\n    Evelyn C.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9439657\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/246/1/\">\n    246 Wis. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b628, 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9439657\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/246/1/\">\n    629 N.W.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .). That is to say, the dissent believes we should import evidence and argument regarding the \"best interests of the child\" into the\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   question of Mr. K.'s fitness as a parent. But that would be helpful only if we are looking for a way to paper over the circuit court's error. The first and second phases of the trial address different questions, so it is not immediately apparent\n   how evidence and argument from the second could supply the structural integrity lacking in the first. Nor does the circuit court\n   revisit the question of the parent's fitness in the \"disposition\" phase of the trial, so as a practical matter, the borrowed evidence and argument will always have precisely zero effect on the circuit court's determination in the \"grounds\" phase. A remedy that depends on\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   evidence and argument to justify a prior judicial determination is rhetoric, not reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b634 Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Evelyn C.R.\n   </em>\n   cannot inform our analysis because the asserted errors there and here are not the same. Although both cases involve parents who were not allowed to present their case-in-chief, that is the only similarity they share. In\n   <em>\n    Evelyn C.R.\n   </em>\n   , the mother (Tykila S.) lost her right to present her case as a sanction for her failure to appear at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b616. She did not contest the default and conceded that failing to appear deprived her of the right to challenge the State's case. Consequently, the right to put on one's case-in-chief was not at issue on appeal, and so it should come as no surprise that our opinion said nothing about it. Tykila S.'s assignment of error was instead that the circuit court failed to satisfy its independent statutory and constitutional obligation to identify sufficient evidence of record to support the state's case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The issue, therefore, was a straightforward challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Our holding that evidence presented at the \"disposition\" phase may supply the deficit in the \"grounds\" phase,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b636, says nothing about the nature of a parent's right to contest the State's case. So\n   <em>\n    Evelyn C.R.\n   </em>\n   can give us no instruction here for the simple reason that it did not address, even tangentially, the question now before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b635 We have little difficulty in concluding that the error presented in this matter \"affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being simply an error in the trial process itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605031\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1899/#p1907\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The error did not just \"affect\" the framework, it completely eliminated half of it. Further, the remaining half left the State as the sole expositor of the theory of the case. With so much of the adversarial nature of the trial excised, there is no adequate context within which to conduct a quantitative analysis of the missing testimony. Therefore, we cannot engage in a harmless-error review. The dissent worries that, in so concluding, we have recognized a structural error that has no provenance in prior pronouncements from either this court or the United States Supreme Court. Dissent, \u00b638. Perhaps, however, neither of these courts have had occasion to address this issue because the proposition that a state-centric half-trial can produce a structurally sound result is so astonishing that no one has thought to make the argument before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b636 We hold that denying the defendant an opportunity to present his case-in-chief is a structural error, one that is \"so intrinsically harmful as to require automatic reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    Neder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p8\">\n    527 U.S. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p8\">\n    119 S.

(dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b638 Structural error is not a \"legal rabbit\" that a court can pull out of its hat, and thereby avoid a thorough examination of the record and the legal principles that must be reviewed when a parent's rights are terminated. Yet, that is just what the majority opinion has done today when it creates this new structural error, never before recognized by the United States Supreme Court or by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b639 Although I agree that the circuit court erred in shortening C.L.K.'s presentation at the factfinding hearing, the error was a trial error. It was not a structural error because it did not affect the framework of the entire trial. Rather, the framework of the trial was established through C.L.K.'s vigorous representation by counsel before an unbiased factfinder from which framework we can quantitatively assess the effect of the error. Accordingly, because the complained-of error is not structural, it is subject to a harmless-error analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b640 Furthermore, the error did not affect the validity of the finding that C.L.K. had abandoned his two young children or that it was in the best interests of the children that C.L.K.'s parental rights be terminated so that their foster parents can adopt them. Because I conclude that the circuit court error was harmless and, therefore, the two children who were\n   abandoned by C.L.K. should have a permanent home in which to grow, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b641 On September 13, 2016, when J.E.H. and S.M.H. were five and six years old, respectively, the State filed a petition to terminate C.L.K.'s parental rights based on abandonment, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048.415\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 48.415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a)2. (2015-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both children have lived with their foster parents, who are their maternal great aunt and uncle, since March 17, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b642 Prior to being removed from their mother's home, J.E.H.'s mother inflicted second and third-degree burns on both his feet, requiring hospitalization and extensive treatment for the burns and for the abuse he suffered. The children's mother voluntarily terminated her parental rights to both children. C.L.K. chose to retain his parental rights; therefore, a petition for involuntary termination was filed for C.L.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b643 On March 23, 2017, the circuit court held the trial on the termination of C.L.K.'s parental rights, which is a two-step process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   C.L.K. was present and he was represented by counsel at both hearings, as he has been throughout the proceedings that relate to J.E.H. and S.M.H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b644 C.L.K. testified. He admitted that from July of 2015 to September of 2016 he had no contact with the children. He did not visit them, or speak with them by phone, or send them letters or messages of any type. He also testified that during that 15-month period, he had no contact of any type with the foster parents. He admitted that he could have called the foster parents, but he did not try to do so. He also said he sent the foster parents no letters, nor did he try to have contact with the children or the foster parents through the \"Bureau.\" When asked if he could have done so, he said \"Yes, I could have.\" When asked, \"Was there any reason why you could not?\" C.L.K. said, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b645 C.L.K. was asked if he had any contact with anyone from the \"Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare.\" Again, he said that he did not. He also was asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q Did you make any effort to reach them to find out about your children?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A No, I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q Could you have?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A Yes, I could have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q Should you have?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A Yes, I should have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q Was there any reason why you did not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A There's no reason at all.

He said, \"I'm going to reserve questioning if this case is allowed to proceed past this point, but I do have one or two at this point.\" Counsel then asked C.L.K. his reasons for having sparse contact with his children and the foster parents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q You mentioned the former social worker led you to believe-what was it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A That I wasn't allowed to have any information concerning where my children are located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q And what led you to believe that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A That's what she told me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q What information?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A I was asking for information to get a number for Ms. Cupil so I can call my children, but I was told I couldn't have that number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Q So did that prevent you from having contact with your children?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b646 On re-direct, the State asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q And since they were brought into care, you've known where they were because they've always been with the Cupils.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q And you testified that you made no efforts during that time period to get in touch with the Cupils.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q And you testified in your deposition that you could have called, but you didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A I could have tried harder, yes. That's what I meant when I said I could have called.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b647 After C.L.K.'s testimony the State submitted certified copies of relevant orders, which the court admitted into evidence. The State then rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b648 As the State did so, counsel for C.L.K. began to argue to the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Well, your Honor, I think at this stage you have to take it in the light most favorable to [C.L.K.]. And to believe [C.L.K.] has good reason for not having communication over that period of time we're talking about is that he, in his mind-it's subjective-but he, in his mind, thought he couldn't because of what was told to him directly by a social worker. And also that social worker, [C.L.K.] thought, had a way to communicate with him if he or she wanted to....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   So I think [C.L.K.], again, at this point, believing everything that he says, that he gives a good enough reason to have not had the communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   THE COURT: Well, you've argued a motion that hasn't been made yet; although I suspected it was coming.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b649 The record shows that counsel for C.L.K. actually was arguing to dismiss the State's case because C.L.K.'s stated reason constituted good cause for not contacting the children, the foster parents or the social worker. However, the circuit court interpreted counsel's argument as opposing a State motion for a directed verdict, which the State never made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b650 It is not clear from the transcript whether the attorney for the State thought the court's reference to a \"directed verdict\" was a motion to dismiss the State's case, which would have been logical given that it was defense counsel who made the argument when the State rested, or something else. Counsel for the State then summarized the overwhelming evidence of abandonment that had been presented by C.L.K.'s own testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b651 Before the court ruled, counsel for C.L.K. said, \"[i]f this is not a directed verdict motion at this point then and the State rests its case in chief, then I'm going to ask to be able to put my client on the stand and finish our side of the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b652 The circuit court clearly interpreted defense counsel's argument at the conclusion of the State's proof on abandonment as arguing against a State motion for a directed verdict in favor of the State on the ground of abandonment, which the State never made. Therefore, after a brief argument by the guardian ad litem, the court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   THE COURT: I'm granting the implicit motion for a directed verdict. I get it, that in [C.L.K.]'s mind\n   there was justification for what happened here. But legally, there is not. And I'm addressing only the abandonment claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The court then held that the State had met its burden of proof of abandonment as a ground for terminating C.L.K.'s parental rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b653 Subsequently, with the agreement of counsel, the court held the dispositional hearing that same day. The State's first witness was Ms. Cupil, the foster mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b654 Ms. Cupil testified that the children have resided with her since March of 2014. She testified that she and John, her husband, wanted to adopt the children. She explained that she was the children's great aunt and that she loved the children very much. She said that when the children first came to live with her and her husband they were two and four years old,\n   respectively.

Structural Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b680 I begin my discussion, based on the record before us and the applicable law in which structural error is grounded. It should be noted that the majority opinion refuses to consider the entire trial that took place before C.L.K.'s parental rights were terminated. It also does no analysis of the law when concluding that the error at the factfinding hearing was structural error. It gives only lip service to the \"strong presumption\" that an error is not structural when counsel was afforded and the factfinder was impartial, which is required by\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Clark\n   </em>\n   . It does not explain how the error so affected the trial that its effect could not be measured or that its burden continued from the start of the trial without relief to the end of the trial after which C.L.K.'s parental rights were terminated. Instead, ipse dixit, the majority opinion discovers a new type of structural error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b681 However, the structural error factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   are my guides.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As I explain as this discussion of structural error progresses, the framework in which this termination of parental rights trial was conducted was sound. It consisted of vigorous representation by counsel before an unbiased judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Although protection of an interest beyond that of an adverse decision for a defendant can be structural error, for example when there is a complete denial of the right to counsel at trial, as in\n   <em>\n    Gideon\n   </em>\n   , the majority opinion identifies no such interest, and I could find none in this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b682 The majority eloquently and expansively expounds on the merits of the adversary system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It grounds its newly minted structural error in the alleged failure to permit \"the respondent the option of presenting his case-in-chief\" at the first step of a two-step trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the majority opinion sets out no reasoning and applies no structural error precedent to support its broad assertion that an error at one hearing cannot be abrogated by presentations later in the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \u00b683 Furthermore, the quantitative effect of the error that occurred in the factfinding hearing is easily measured. Review of the full record, i.e., both hearings that were held March 23, 2017, shows that C.L.K. fully testified about why he had had so little contact with his children and the foster parents. He explained why he thought he had an excuse for \"messing-up\" and that he loved his children. The foreshortening of C.L.K.'s testimony that occurred at the first-step of the trial, was abrogated by his direct testimony at the second-step, as well as by his counsel's thorough cross-examination of all witnesses the State presented at both hearings. As Nelson explained, when the effect\n   of the error on the outcome of a trial is capable of assessment, the error is not structural.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186426\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/355/722/\">\n    355 Wis. 2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186426\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/355/722/\">\n    849 N.W.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Fulminante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    499 U.S. at 307-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p307\">\n    111 S.

Second, his attorney confirmed that C.L.K. had no other witnesses to present when C.L.K.'s testimony at the dispositional hearing was concluded and counsel told the court that he had no further witnesses. And think about it, who besides C.L.K. would know why he did not see, speak with or attempt to contact his two young children and their foster parents for 15 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   \u00b685 C.L.K. had a full opportunity to explain why his absence should not be sufficient to prove abandonment.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   \u00b693 In conclusion, although I agree that the circuit court erred in shortening C.L.K.'s presentation at the factfinding hearing, the error was a trial error. It was not a structural error because it did not affect the framework of the entire trial. Rather, the framework of the trial was established through C.L.K.'s vigorous representation by counsel before an unbiased factfinder from which framework we can quantitatively\n   assess the effect of the error. Accordingly, because the complained-of error is not structural, it is subject to a harmless-error analysis.\n   \u00b694 Furthermore, the error did not affect the validity of the finding that C.L.K. had abandoned his two young children or that it was in the best interests of the children that C.L.K.'s parental rights be terminated so that their foster parents can adopt them. Because I conclude that the circuit court error was harmless and, therefore, the two children who were abandoned by C.L.K. should have a permanent home in which to grow, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   \u00b695 I am authorized to state that Justice ANNETTE KINGSLAND ZIEGLER joins this dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-281\">\n    This is a review of an unpublished decision of the court of appeals,\n    <em>\n     State v.
