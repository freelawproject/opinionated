The Belgian steel firms investigated were Fabfer, Clabecq, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Sidmar, and S.A. Cockerill Sambre (Cockerill).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The period of investigation (POI) for Fabfer and Clabecq was July 1990 through June 1991, and the POI for Sidmar and Cockerill was calendar year 1991. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed.

Substantial evidence is that which \u2018\u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951) (citation omitted), <em>quoted in Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>3 Fed. Cir. (T) 44, 51, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The Court must accord substantial weight to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers. <em>American Lamb Co. v. United States, </em>4 Fed. Cir. (T) 47, 54, 785 F.2d 994, 1001 (1986) (citations omitted).

Classifying OCPCs and Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">In November 1978 and February 1979 the Belgian Council of Ministers decided that the government of Belgium (GOB) would assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>interest costs on all medium- and long-term loans held by certain steel companies agreed to before January 1, 1979. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. Pursuant to this decision and upon agreements with the steel companies, the GOB agreed to assume the interest costs in exchange for the companies\u2019 promises of conditional future issuances to the GOB of \u201cobligations convertibles participantes et conditionnelles\u201d (OCPCs), or \u201cconditional and convertible participating bonds.\u201d In this way, the GOB assumed the interest costs of Cockerill, Sidmar, and Clabecq for the five-year period from 1979 through 1983. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">OCPCs are called conditional because \u201ccertain conditions had to be met before the bonds could be issued.\u201d (Conf. R. 39 at 11.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the instruments are named convertible because the bonds contained \u201ca provision allowing for their eventual conversion to ordinary shares.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In 1985, Cockerill and Clabecq agreed, and Sidmar conditionally agreed to convert the OCPCs into securities known as parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficia-ries. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. Parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries, or \u201cbenefactor shares,\u201d generally describe shares \u201cgiven in remuneration of persons who made contributions or did consulting for a company prior to its establishment.\u201d (Confid. R. 39 at 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Commerce considered OCPCs and parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries to be \u201chybrid securities\u201d because they are \u201csecurities/instruments which appear to be neither debt nor equity (nor grants, since the funds are not given outright).\u201d <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,254. After reviewing several techniques to classify such hybrid financial instruments, Commerce decided upon the following approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">We have distinguished grants from both debt and equity by defining grants as funds provided without expectation of a: (1) Repayment of the grant amount, (2) payment of any kind stemming directly from the receipt of the grant (including interest or claims on profits of the firm (i.e., dividends) with the exception of offsets as defined in the Proposed Regulations \u00a7 355.46), or (3) claim on any funds in case of company liquidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">* * * To classify a hybrid instrument as either debt or equity, we have applied the following hierarchy which in the Department\u2019s view establishes whether an instrument has the qualities of debt or equity: (1) Expiration/ Maturity Date/Repayment Obligation, (2) Guaranteed Interest or Dividends, (3) Ownership Rights, and (4) Seniority. For each hybrid instrument, we considered the four sets of criteria in order. Once a characteristic is clearly indicative of debt or equity, we will stop our analysis and categorize the hybrid as debt or equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjEz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Id. </em>In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce applied its new methodology and determined the OCPCs constituted debt. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277 (citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,254-55).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Commerce also applied its methodology to the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries issued by Cockerill, Sidmar, and Clabecq, and determined the instruments constituted equity. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,255. Because Commerce reached this conclusion using business proprietary information, the agency referred to a memorandum on file for an explanation of its reasoning. In that document, Commerce first distinguished parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries from grants and found parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries should not be classified as grants because \u201c [ ]. \u201d (Conf\u00edd. R. 52 at 1.) Turning to the debt-equity classification and its first criterion, the \u201cexpiration/maturity date/repayment obligation,\u201d Commerce concluded \u201cClabecq\u2019s and Sidmar\u2019s [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] * * * constitute equity\u201d as they \u201c[ ]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2.) Although it was unnecessary under its new methodology, Commerce also considered the second criterion, \u201cguaranteed interest or dividends,\u201d and determined the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries \u201c[ ] \u201d thus supporting its determination that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constituted equity. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">After determining OCPCs constituted debt and parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries comprised equity, Commerce found the conversion of OCPCs into parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries amounted to a conversion of debt to equity. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. Because this assumption of interest costs in return for parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries was limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries, Commerce determined the GOB\u2019s conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries was coun-tervailable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">B. Measuring the Benefits from the OCPCs-to-Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries Conversions:</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">To measure the countervailable benefits, if any, from government infusions of equity, Commerce used the market-determined prices of equity as a benchmark. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,250-51. In determining the benchmark, Commerce distinguished between the primary market and the secondary market. (Def.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Respective Mots, of Domestic Producers and Fabfer for J. Upon Agency R. (Def.\u2019s Br.) at 62.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the market-determined price for equity purchased directly from the firm, that is, in the primary market, was less than the price paid by the government for the same form of equity purchased directly from the firm, the premium conferred a countervail-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>able benefit to the firm. <em>See </em>54 Fed. Reg. 23,366, 23,381 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1989) (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(1)(i)) (proposed May 31, 1989) <em>(Proposed Regulations).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">If there was no market-determined price in the primary market, Commerce looked to the price of equity in the secondary market as a benchmark. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,250. Commerce compared the price paid by the government to the prevailing market price and countervailed the premium, if any, paid by the government for its shares. <em>Id. </em>at 37,251. Finally, if there was no market-determined price for the company\u2019s shares, that is, if a company\u2019s stock was not publicly traded, Commerce would resort to its equityworthiness test or inquiry. <em>Id. </em>Under this approach, if a company is unequityworthy Commerce will find that a government infusion of equity confers a counter-vailable benefit. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">To measure the countervailable benefits from Sidmar\u2019s OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversion, Commerce verified that Sidmar\u2019s stock was not publicly traded. Because Sidmar had no market-determined price, Commerce turned to its equityworthiness test to determine if the conversion was countervailable. <em>(See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 98 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(1))).) Commerce did not initiate an equityworthiness investigation of Sidmar, however, because the agency found the petition did not contain sufficient evidence to support an allegation of unequity-worthiness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,275. The agency thus determined \u201cthe GOB\u2019s conversion of its debt to equity does not provide a countervailable benefit to [Sidmar].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,277.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In measuring the benefits from the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions by Cockerill and Clabecq, Commerce verified that although parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries may in some cases be purchased, the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficia-ries issued by Cockerill and Clabecq \u201care not publicly-traded on the Belgian stock exchange.\u201d (Confid. R. 41 at 41.) Commerce determined, however, that the common shares of Cockerill and Clabecq were being traded and thus, Commerce elected to use the price at which the common shares were traded to provide a market benchmark against which to measure the benefit from the GOB\u2019s purchase of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries. (Def. \u2019s Br. at 82.) In effect, \u201cCommerce was forced to compare the GOB\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>purchase price for [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] with the next most similar publicly traded equity instrument issued by Cockerill and Clabecq \u2014 common shares.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Finding \u201cthe GOB paid considerably more for its shares than the market price at that time,\u201d Commerce deemed the GOB\u2019s acquisition of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. To measure the benefit, Commerce calculated the premium paid by the GOB as the difference between the price paid by the government for the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries and the market price of the common shares. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Commerce found the resulting benefits to be nonrecurring and allocated the benefit to 1991. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">C. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">a. Classifying OCPCs and Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Domestic Producers claim parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries have more in common with grants than equity instruments, and thus object to Commerce\u2019s finding that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constitute equity securities. Parts b\u00e9n\u00e9-ficiaries, Domestic Producers argue,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">have all of the disadvantages of both debt and equity, and none of the advantages of either. Like debt, they have a ceiling on the amount of return they can earn for the investor. * * * Also like debt, they convey no voting rights, and there is no potential for capital appreciation. Like equity, they carry no guaranteed return and no protection against the loss of capital. Worse than either debt or equity, \u201cparts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries\u201d entitle their holder to payment, on liquidation of the company, only after creditors, preferred shareholders, and even after payments to the common shareholders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">(Mem. in Support of Domestic Producers\u2019 56.2 Mot. for J. Upon Agency R. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br.) at 14^15.) The parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries acquired by the GOB, Domestic Producers argue, \u201cdo not entitle their holder to any meaningful claim on the profits of the firm,\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Mem. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br.) at 3 (footnote omitted)), because the terms of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries \u201cmake it highly unlikely that a holder of [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] would ever realize any return on the investment,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 3 n.3 (citation omitted)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Domestic Producers also point out both Sidmar and the GOB apparently chose to classify parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries as grants as evidenced by their responses to Commerce\u2019s questionnaires.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">If Commerce\u2019s finding that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constitute equity is sustained, Domestic Producers assert, \u201cit will open an enormous loophole in U.S. countervailing duty law.\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 24.) Domestic Producers predict a company will be able to avoid the imposition of countervailing duties simply by giving the government, in return for the provision of funds, a right to receive repayment of those funds if and when the company liquidates. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">b. Measuring the Benefits from the OCPCs-to-Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries Conversions:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">First, Domestic Producers argue the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions were inconsistent with commercial considerations because no rational private investor would have traded OCPCs for parts b\u00e9n\u00e9fi-ciaries, given the inferior characteristics of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries and their much lower potential for return. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 2 (footnote omitted).) Domestic Producers summarize their argument that the conversions were \u201cclearly inconsistent with commercial considerations\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">The O.C.PC.s were repayable on a date certain, bore interest and, under certain circumstances, entitled the holder to a five percent dividend. No reasonable investor would have exchanged such securities for securities that were required to be repaid only upon liquidation, did not bear interest and carried the remote possibility of only a very small dividend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">(Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 16 (footnote omitted).) Thus, the conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries \u201cmust be countervailed, \u201d Domestic Producers charge, \u201cwhether or not the transaction fits neatly into the Department\u2019s existing methodology and whether or not the \u2018parts b\u00e9n\u00e9-ficiaries\u2019 are determined to be grants, debt or equity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Second, Domestic Producers contend that Commerce\u2019s use of the secondary market price of Cockerill\u2019s and Clabecq\u2019s common stock was an unreasonable benchmark for measuring the countervailable benefit from the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 49; <em>see also </em>Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 19-21.) Domestic Producers assert the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Proposed Regulations</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>provide for the use of a market-determined benchmark price \u201conly where there is a contemporaneous purchase of \u2018the <em>same form </em>of equity purchased directly from the firm.\u2019\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 49 (footnote omitted).) Because parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries are clearly inferior to common shares and have significantly different terms, Domestic Producers maintain, it was unreasonable for Commerce to compare the secondary market price of common shares to the price the GOB paid for the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries. <em>(Id. </em>at 20, 50.) Domestic Producers maintain they have set forth \u201coverwhelming proof\u201d that the benchmark used by Commerce to measure the benefits from the conversions are distorted and deficient, and therefore the use of such a benchmark is in error. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 23-24.) Because there is no proper market-determined price for the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries, Domestic Producers insist Commerce should have employed its equity-worthiness test. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 51.) In this way, Domestic Producers argue, Commerce should countervail the entire infusions as grants if the issuers are found to be unequity worthy. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Finally, Domestic Producers take issue with what they label Commerce\u2019s discriminatory treatment of Sidmar on one hand, and Cockerill and Clabecq on the other, in determining whether the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions provided countervailable benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at 20.) Domestic Producers claim Commerce made a false distinction between failing to initiate an equityworthiness <em>investigation, </em>as in the case of Sidmar, and failing to make an equityworthiness <em>determination </em>in the case of Cockerill and Clabecq.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 21-22.) Moreover, \u201c[rjegardless of whether a company is equityworthy,\u201d Domestic Producers suggest, \u201cwhen a government trades one class of securities in that company for a different class with significantly inferior characteristics, a countervail-able subsidy has been provided.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 21.) Domestic Producers argue the recent CIT decision of <em>Aimcor, Alabama Silicon, Inc. v. United States, </em>18 CIT _, 871 F. Supp. 447 (1994), supports their argument that Commerce may not rely solely on the equityworthiness of the recipient in determining whether countervailable benefits have been bestowed. <em>(See </em>Tr. at 98, 104-05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">a. Classifying OCPCs and Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Commerce responds its determination that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries are equity and not debt is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is in accordance with law. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 51.) After discussing the basis for Commerce\u2019s new methodology of classifying hybrid instruments and its application to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries in this case, Commerce contends it \u201chas discretion to evaluate the facts on the record and to decide which are the most informative as to the nature of [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries]. \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 59 (citation omitted).) Commerce dismisses Domestic Producers\u2019 claims to the contrary and contends, \u201c[arguments by [Domestic Producers] to the effect that [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] have more in common with debt and are in fact contingent liability interest-free loans, simply confirm the hybrid nature of [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] and invite the Court to second-guess the Department.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Commerce argues that several aspects of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries suggest they should be treated as equity instruments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(i) [ ]; (ii) holders are entitled to a one percent subordinated dividend, which may be paid only after payment of a two percent dividend to holders of preferred shares and a seven percent dividend paid on common shares; (iii) after dividends, holders are entitled to share the remaining profit balance with common shareholders, provided that the yield on the [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] can never be higher than the yield on the common shares; and, (iv) in the event of liquidation, holders would be paid, if at all, after the preferred and common shareholders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-9\"><em>(Id. </em>at 54-55 (footnotes omitted).) While recognizing that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9fi-ciaries also have attributes of debt, <em>(see id. </em>at 55), Commerce contends the application of the agency\u2019s hierarchical methodology reveals parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries \u201chave characteristics more in line with equity than loans, \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 59). Commerce also rejects Domestic Producers argument that the conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constituted the forgiveness of debt, because, Commerce argues, Domestic Producers have confused the issue of how Commerce should quantify the benefit from the conversions with the issue of whether parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries are debt or equity. <em>(Id. </em>at 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">b. Measuring the Benefits from the OCPCs-to-Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries Conversions:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">Commerce contends it acted in accordance with law when it measured the countervailable benefits accruing to Clabecq and Cockerill by comparing the price paid by the GOB for the equity to the share price of publicly traded common shares. <em>(Id.) </em>The agency maintains market-determined benchmarks provide the best means of determining whether equity infusions confer a subsidy. <em>(Id. </em>at 61.) Commerce asserts its equi-tyworthiness test, which Domestic Producers contend should have been employed here, is a second-best solution the agency turns to only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>mark\u00e9t benchmarks are unavailable. <em>(Id. </em>at 63.) The agency prefers using market-determined benchmarks over the equityworthiness test, Commerce argues, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">\u201c[t]he publicly traded price, we believe, is a much more accurate indicator of the company\u2019s future earnings potential and worth than any hypothetical measurement which we could devise. It is a much more reliable and accurate gauge as to whether, and if so, to what extent, government equity infusions are inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><em>(Id. </em>at 65 (quoting <em>Subsidies Appendix, </em>49 Fed. Reg. at 18,023).) The equityworthiness inquiry, Commerce explains, is but a \u201creasonable surrogate for the ultimate arbiter of economic valuation \u2014 the marketplace. If there existed a reasonably accurate and administratively feasible method to calculate proxy stock market prices when no such prices exist, Commerce would use such a method instead of an equityworthiness test.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 70-71 (footnote omitted).) Commerce rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that an equityworthiness determination was required in this case and maintains the Domestic Producers\u2019 argument misconstrues the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>and \u201cattempts to narrow.the choice of appropriate equity benchmarks to the point where a comparison to a market price for equity would rarely, if ever, be possible. \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Commerce agrees with Domestic Producers that the agency\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>state that Commerce will, whenever possible, compare identical instruments when comparing market-determined prices. <em>(Id. </em>at 82 (quoting <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,371 (preamble to regulation to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)) (\u201c[A]n equity infusion confers a countervailable benefit when the market-determined price for equity * * * is less than the price paid by the foreign government for the same form of equity * * *.\u201d)).) Here, however, Commerce claims it verified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">these companies\u2019 [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9f\u00edciaries] are not publicly traded. Thus, Commerce was forced to compare the GOB\u2019s purchase price for [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9f\u00edciaries] with the next most similar publicly traded equity instrument issued by Cockerill and Clabecq \u2014 common shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">In the present case, private investors <em>were </em>purchasing equity in Cockerill and Clabecq. The price at which the common shares were traded provides a market-determined benchmark against which Commerce could measure the benefit from the GOB\u2019s purchase of [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9f\u00edciaries].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>(Id.) </em>Commerce concludes it properly countervailed the conversion of Clabecq\u2019s and Cockerill\u2019s OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries to the extent of any premium paid by the GOB for the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries. <em>(Id. </em>at 83.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Commerce counters Domestic Producers\u2019 argument alleging discriminatory treatment of Sidmar vis-\u00e1-vis Cockerill and Clabecq by pointing out first that \u201cCockerill and Clabecq had publicly traded shares. These shares provided Commerce with the benchmark it needed to value their [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries]. Sidmar\u2019s shares, on the other hand, are not publicly traded.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 100.) Second, Commerce responds the only way Commerce could have countervailed Sidmar\u2019s debt-to-equity conversion would have been if Commerce had determined Sidmar was unequi-tyworthy during the year of infusion. <em>(Id.) </em>Because Domestic Producers did not \u201cestablish the factual predicate for questionning [sic] Sidmar\u2019s equityworthiness,\u201d Commerce contends it had a rational basis for distinguishing between the different companies. <em>(Id. </em>at 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Clabecq rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 contentions and argues Commerce properly determined parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constitute equity securities and properly analyzed the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions. <em>(See </em>Resp. Br. of Clabecq in Opp\u2019n to Pis. \u2019 Mot. for J. on Agency R. Regarding Certain Country-Specific Issues (Clabecq\u2019s Br.) at 12-13.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Sidmar argues there is substantial evidence to support Commerce\u2019s finding parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries to be equity and not debt, and Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments to the contrary \u201cwould require the Court to substitute its own judgment for that of the Department. \u201d (Def.-Intervenors Sidmar and TradeARBED Resp. Br. in Opp\u2019n to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. Upon Agency R. (Sidmar\u2019s Br.) at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Sidmar also contends Commerce\u2019s finding that the conversion of OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries was consistent with commercial considerations and therefore not countervailable is also based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. <em>(Id. </em>at 18.) Sidmar rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 argument that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries are worthless and thus have \u201c\u2018significantly inferior\u2019 characteristics\u201d compared to OCPCs. <em>(Id. </em>at 21.) Commerce has verified, Sidmar asserts, that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries are bought and sold in Belgian commercial markets in some cases. <em>(Id. </em>(citation omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Finally, Sidmar rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 complaint that Commerce should not have reached different results for Cockerill and Cla-becq than it did for Sidmar. <em>(Id.) </em>This outcome is explained in part, Sidmar argues, because \u201c[b]oth Cockerill and Clabecq have publicly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>traded stock that can be used as a benchmark to evaluate whether an equity infusion confers a countervailable benefit. Sidmar does not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) Thus, there was no need to invoke the equityworthiness inquiry in the case of Cockerill and Clabecq, because under Commerce\u2019s methodology, Commerce simply \u201cdetermine[d] whether or not the government paid \u2018too much\u2019 for its equity based on publicly traded market prices prevailing at the time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 24.) In the case of Sidmar, Sidmar alleges, Commerce determined three times that no evidence indicated Sidmar was unequityworthy. <em>(Id. </em>at 23 (footnote and citations omitted).) Thus, given that a reasonable investor could expect a reasonable rate of return in Sidmar shares, Sidmar claims Commerce correctly determined that the conversion from OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries did not confer a countervailable benefit. <em>(Id. </em>at 23-24 (footnote omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">As defendant-intervenor, Fabfer supports Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that Commerce erred in determining that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constitute equity. (Resp. to Pis.\u2019 Mot. Under R. 56.2 for Summ. J. on the Administrative R. (Fabfer\u2019s Resp. Br.) at 1-2.) Fabfer contends Commerce should be directed to countervail the benefits from the OCPCs-to-parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions as amortizable grants in the principal amounts of the debts forgiven. <em>(Id. </em>at 2.) Additionally, Fabfer agrees with Domestic Producers\u2019 position that Commerce erred in using the secondary market price of common shares as a benchmark for the value of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries and preferred shares.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) Commerce\u2019s action, Fabfer argues, is contrary to the requirement in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>that a secondary market price may be used as a benchmark only where there is a contemporaneous purchase of \u201c\u2018the <em>same form </em>of equity purchased directly from the firm. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>(quoting <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(l)(i))).) Because Commerce failed to provide any justification for using the market price of one form of equity as a benchmark for another, Fabfer concludes, Commerce\u2019s determination cannot be upheld. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">D. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">1. <em>Classifying OCPCs and Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The definition of the term \u201csubsidy\u201d in the countervailing duty (CVD) statute is necessarily broad as Congress could not possibly contemplate and describe all those transactions that could give rise to a countervail-able subsidy. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(A) (1988) (defining \u201csubsidy\u201d for purposes of CVD statute).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, Commerce has erected numerous methodologies to enable the agency to evaluate transactions in light of the directives outlined in the statute. One such methodology is Commerce\u2019s new methodology employing a hierarchical set of criteria to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>classify hybrid securities as grants, debt, or equity. To distinguish between debt and equity, the methodology calls for an examination of four characteristics hybrid securities may possess: \u201c(1) Expiration/Maturity Date/Repayment Obligation, (2) Guaranteed Interest or Dividends, (3) Ownership Rights, and (4) Seniority.\u201d <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,254. Commerce chose this methodology after considering and rejecting several other options. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe examined several options for addressing these issues (for a complete discussion of those options, <em>see </em>Mem. from Staff to Joseph A. Spetrini, dated June 21, 1993) * * *.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In adopting this hierarchical approach, Commerce explained in detail how it would consider each criterion as it applied to a hybrid security:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">Loans typically have a specified date on which the last remaining payments will be made and the obligation of the company to the creditor is fulfilled. Even if the instrument has no pre-set repayment date, but a repayment obligation exists when the instrument is provided, the instrument has characteristics more in line with loans than equity. Equity, on the other hand, has no expiration date. The rights to ownership theoretically extend to infinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE-\">If after applying the first set of criteria, we are unable to establish whether the hybrid instrument is debt or equity, we will turn to the second set of criteria. Debt instruments guarantee the creditor a certain payment (i.e., the firm is obligated to pay). The rate may be fixed or variable but the requirement for, or schedule of, payments is pre-determined. Any interruption in payment results in a default on the loan by the company. Equity on the other hand, has no guaranteed return. Companies are not required to issue a dividend to their stockholders. There is no counterpart to default for failure to pay a dividend on equity by the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">The next set of criteria in the hierarchy is ownership rights. Equity, unlike debt, confers ownership rights. (See Principles of Corporate Finance, by Richard A. Brealey and Stewart C. Meyers (McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1988, page 305) which states that stockholders have ultimate control, through voting rights, on the company\u2019s affairs). Stockholders also have a claim on the profits of the firm, manifested in the form of dividends or capital appreciation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">Finally, the last set of criteria in the hierarchy, seniority, refers to the order of reimbursement in case a company liquidates. The order of payment of funds from liquidated assets are as follows: taxes and administrative expenses, wages, creditors (secured, priority, and unsecured), and, lastly, shareholders. Id. at 743.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">Following the hierarchy outlined above, if an instrument has an expiration/maturity date or a clear repayment obligation, it will be treated as a loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">The remaining three characteristics of criteria in the hierarchy should be used to classify the instrument if the first set of criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fails to provide a clear indication of the proper classification. A guaranteed payment, whether interest or dividend, is more characteristic of debt than equity and can be an important element in calculating the subsidy. Ownership rights are considered more important than seniority in this hierarchy because they are definite characteristics of equity whereas seniority exists in a continuum. In this continuum, creditors come before owners but there is no definite line of distinction as to where one begins and the other ends. In addition, unlike ownership rights where potential profit sharing could affect subsidy calculations, seniority plays no quantitative role in determining countervailable benefits. Seniority matters only when the company is liquidated, whereas ownership rights are significant throughout the life of the company. Seniority does, however, play a qualitative role in discerning debt from equity which is why it is included in the hierarchy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Because the CVD statute does not speak directly to the precise question of how to examine hybrid securities, the question for the Court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (footnote omitted), <em>quoted in Texas Crushed Stone Co. v. United States, </em>12 Fed. Cir. (T) _, _, 35 F.3d 1535, 1540 (1994). Commerce may not, however, \u201ccontravene or ignore the intent of the legislature or the guiding purpose of the statute.\u201d Cer<em>amica Regiomontana, </em>10 CIT at 405, 636 F. Supp. at 966 (citations omitted). Given the broad definition of a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d in the statute,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Congress has delegated to Commerce as the administering agency the authority to carve out the specific methods to apply in identifying a bounty or grant. There is no requirement that the methodology adopted by Commerce be the most comprehensive or the most exact \u2014 it need only be reasonable and in accord with legislative intent. <em>See U.H.F.C. Co. v. United States, </em>9 Fed. Cir. (T) 1, 10, 916 F.2d 689, 698 (1990) (\u201cIt is well settled that an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it has been entrusted by Congress to administer is to be upheld unless it is unreasonable.\u201d) (citations omitted). Commerce\u2019s analysis as explained above sets forth a reasonable method of identifying and classifying those bounties or grants that take the form of hybrid securities. Furthermore, it is consonant with the intent of Congress to afford Commerce wide latitude in defining a bounty or grant. <em>See PPG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>9 Fed. Cir. (T) 71, 74, 928 F.2d 1568, 1572 (1991). Accordingly, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s hierarchical method of classifying hybrid securities to determine whether such securities are grants, debt, or equity under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the CVD statute is based on a permissible construction of the statute and is in accord with congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As explained above in section one, part I.A, Commerce moved the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries through the hierarchical set of criteria and deemed the instruments to be equity. The agency considered the characteristics of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries in light of the first criterion, the \u201cexpiration/maturity date/repayment obligation,\u201d and found this criterion militated in favor of classifying the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries as equity. <em>(See </em>Confid. R. 52 at 2 (cited in <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,255).) Although it was not necessary under the methodology, Commerce stated in an internal memorandum that it examined the \u201cguaranteed interest or dividends\u201d criterion and found business proprietary evidence relevant to this factor supported the agency\u2019s determination that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficia-ries constituted equity instruments. <em>(See id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The Court is unpersuaded by Domestic Producers\u2019 and Fabfer\u2019s attempt to discredit Commerce\u2019s determination that parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries constituted equity because parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries did not have all the characteristics generally associated with equity shares. This argument proves little because it is plain parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries did not possess all the characteristics of equity otherwise they would not have been called hybrid securities and there would have been no need for Commerce to design a methodology to determine whether they were grants, debt, or equity. More important, Commerce applied the hierarchical criteria to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries by considering evidence on the record. The Court finds no reason to second-guess the expertise of Commerce even if the Court were to disagree, which it does not, with Commerce\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Domestic Producers and Fabfer do little more than recite other evidence on the record they argue militates against the determination reached by Commerce. This Court will not overturn Commerce\u2019s determination merely because Domestic Producers and Fabfer produce evidence supporting their arguments and opposing the determination reached by Commerce. <em>See Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966) (\u201c[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Tehnoimportexport v. United States, </em>15 CIT 250, 253, 766 F. Supp. 1169, 1173 (1991) (explaining \u201cCommerce\u2019s determination will not be overturned merely because the plaintiff is able to produce evidence * * * in support of its own contentions and in opposition to the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted). The Court holds Commerce\u2019s use of the hierarchical method of examining hybrid securities to find parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>constituted equity is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">2. <em>Measuring the Benefits from the OCPCs-to-Parts B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries Conversions:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Domestic Producers\u2019 and Fabfer\u2019s claim that Commerce improperly used secondary market prices to calculate the benefit from the equity infusions occasioned by Cockerill\u2019s and Clabecq\u2019s parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions is equally misguided. The first issue here is whether it was proper for Commerce to use the \u201cnext most similar publicly traded equity instrument\u201d as a benchmark when the agency\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>call for an examination of the \u201csame form of equity.\u201d <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(l)(i)). The second issue is whether Commerce\u2019s examination of both the primary and secondary markets for a benchmark was proper given that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>explicitly mention only the primary market. The Court finds Commerce\u2019s application of its <em>Proposed Regulations </em>was proper in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">a. Use of the \u201cNext Most Similar Publicly Traded Equity Instrument\u201d as a Benchmark:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The Court agrees with Commerce that at its core, the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>express a preference for a market-determined benchmark before permitting the agency to turn to its equityworthiness inquiry. <em>See, e.g., Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(1)(ii)) (directing Commerce to invoke its equityworthiness inquiry when there \u201cis no market-determined price\u201d). The preamble to the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>cites the <em>Subsidies Appendix </em>in its discussion of Commerce\u2019s existing practice of determining when a government provision of equity confers a countervailable benefit. <em>Id. </em>at 23,371. In the <em>Subsidies Appendix, </em>Commerce explained \u201c[i]f the government buys shares directly from the company * * * and <em>similar shares are traded in a market, </em>a subsidy arise [sic] if the government pays more than the prevailing market price.\u201d <em>Subsidies Appendix, </em>49 Fed. Reg. at 18,020 (emphasis added). Thus, it is consistent with the tenor of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>for Commerce to turn to the \u201cnext most similar publicly traded equity instrument\u201d as a benchmark when the \u201csame form of equity\u201d does not exist. The Court finds Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>in this instance is based on substantial evidence, and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Because Cockerill and Clabecq\u2019s parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries were not publicly traded, Commerce selected the companies\u2019 common share prices as the benchmark because the common shares were \u201cthe next most similar publicly traded equity instrument issued by Cockerill and Clabecq.\u201d (Def\u2019s Br. at 82.) Commerce has not, however, invited the Court\u2019s attention to any record evidence showing that the common shares were the \u201cnext most similar publicly traded equity instrument\u201d after the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries. Commerce\u2019s failure to do so is all the more glaring given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>that Commerce did perform such an analysis when it compared Cla-becq\u2019s common shares and preference shares in deriving a market benchmark to measure the benefits from Clabecq\u2019s debt-to-preference shares conversion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court remands the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended to Commerce to permit the agency to explain the basis upon which it determined Cockerill\u2019s and Clabecq\u2019s common shares were \u201cnext most similar publicly traded equity instrument\u201d after the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries and to indicate the record evidence the agency relied upon in reaching its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">b. Use of a Secondary Market Price to Derive a Market Benchmark When No Primary Market Price Exists:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Court finds Commerce\u2019s examination of secondary market price in its search for a market benchmark under the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>when no primary market price existed was proper. First, a close reading of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>demonstrates they do not foreclose the use of secondary market prices as a benchmark, as Domestic Producers argue.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, in the <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>Commerce explained its preference for secondary market prices over the agency\u2019s equity-worthiness test. <em>See General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,251. The agency\u2019s reasoning that market prices of publicly traded instruments are a \u201cmuch more accurate indicator of [a] company\u2019s future earnings potential and worth than any hypothetical measurement which [Commerce] could devise,\u201d <em>see Subsidies Appendix, </em>49 Fed. Reg. at 18,023, is well within the discretion of the agency to adopt. In its expertise, Commerce regards the comparison of the price paid for equity to the secondary market price as a \u201creliable and accurate gauge as to whether * * * government equity infusions are inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>See id. </em>If the marketplace is the \u201cultimate arbiter of economic valuation,\u201d certainly a plausible if not irrefutable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>position, Commerce\u2019s preference to look to market-determined prices before resorting to its equityworthiness inquiry, which it calls a <em>reasonable surrogate </em>for valuation, is a proper exercise of Commerce\u2019s discretion. The Court holds Commerce\u2019s use of secondary market price to derive a market benchmark when no primary market price exists for measuring subsidy benefits is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">c. Application of the Equityworthiness Test:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As explained above, if the primary and secondary markets do not yield a reliable benchmark, Commerce turns to its equityworthiness test. If a company is found unequityworthy under Commerce\u2019s methodology, the equity infusion is treated as a grant and countervailed accordingly. <em>See British Steel plc, </em>19 CIT at 245, 879 F. Supp. at 1309-10 (upholding Commerce\u2019s grant methodology, which treats equity infusions into unequi-tyworthy companies countervailable as grants). In this case, Domestic Producers contest Commerce\u2019s decision not to countervail Sidmar\u2019s conversion of parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries simply because, Domestic Producers argue, Commerce did not make an equityworthiness determination as to Sidmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce stated it did not initiate an equityworthiness investigation with respect to Sidmar and \u201c [therefore, we have determined that the GOB\u2019s conversion of its debt [OCPCs] to equity [parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries] does not provide a countervailable benefit to that company.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. There is little in the record to support Commerce\u2019s decision not to countervail Sidmar\u2019s parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversion other than an internal memorandum stating that Commerce \u201cfound no reason to believe or suspect that Sidmar was unequityworthy and, so, no basis to conclude that the equity infusion was made on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d (Pub. R. 62 at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u201cAccording to Commerce\u2019s traditional methodology, where a company\u2019s stock is not publicly traded, a government\u2019s infusion of equity will only confer a countervailable benefit if the company is not equity-worthy.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 98 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.ER. \u00a7 355.44(e)(1))).) It appears then, Commerce has adopted the position that once it determines a company without a market benchmark is equityworthy, equity infusions to that company are consistent with commercial considerations and not coun-tervailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The Court finds this limited analysis is not in accord with Commerce\u2019s statutory mandate to countervail a bounty or grant or \u201c[t]he provision of capital * * * on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(A)(ii)(I). That is, there is insufficient evidence on the record demonstrating that Commerce analyzed the conversion of Sidmar\u2019s OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries to determine if the conversion was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Commerce simply appears to have concluded that because it found no reason to suspect that Sidmar was unequityworthy, it did not need to examine whether the equity infusions via the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries conversions were countervailable as \u201c[t]he provision of capital * * * on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d As aptly stated by the Court in a recent case wherein Commerce applied this same practice,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">where a company is equity-worthy, as here, it does not necessarily follow that the purchase of stock from that company will be consistent with commercial considerations. Commerce appears to establish a blanket rule that the stock issued by an equity-worthy company would be equity-worthy as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">The court does not agree * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">* * * This court cannot, consistent with the intent of Congress, permit Commerce to base its decision in this matter solely upon the equity worthiness of the issuing company. Congressional intent, rather, dictated the imposition of countervailing duties to offset the provision of capital when made on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>Aimcor, </em>18 CIT at 1124-25, 871 F. Supp. at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">This Court finds no fault with Commerce\u2019s methodology of turning to its equityworthiness inquiry after determining a reliable benchmark in the primary or secondary market does not exist. Furthermore, as stated above, Commerce is on solid ground when its equityworthiness inquiry leads the agency to countervail as grants equity infusions made to unequityworthy companies. The shortcoming of Commerce\u2019s methodology is Commerce\u2019s failure to determine whether an equity infusion is \u201con terms inconsistent with commercial considerations\u201d notwithstanding Commerce\u2019s finding that the company is equity worthy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In light of the foregoing, this Court finds Commerce\u2019s determination not to countervail Sidmar\u2019s conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries is not based on substantial evidence and is not otherwise in accordance with law. Therefore, the Court remands the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended to Commerce for a determination whether Sidmar\u2019s conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations and to indicate the record evidence the agency relied upon in reaching its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">II. <em>Commerce\u2019s Decision Not to Make Equityworthiness Determinations of Cockerill and Clabecq in Certain Years:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The next issue concerns Commerce\u2019s decision not to initiate equity-worthiness investigations of Cockerill for the years 1980 through 1988, and Clabecq for the years 1980 through 1989. In such an investigation, Commerce attempts to determine whether a company demonstrates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ability to generate a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,244 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations). </em>Using financial criteria described in the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>Commerce examines whether the ability to generate such a return is evident \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time the government equity infusion was made.\u201d <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(2)). The equityworthiness test plays a key role in the agency\u2019s grant methodology, which \u201ctreats equity infusions into unequityworthy companies as grants. \u201d <em>See General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,241.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">As explained above in section one, part I.B, the equityworthiness test is used to measure the countervailable benefit only when a company receiving an equity infusion does not have a market-determined price or where such market benchmark is shown to be deficient, tainted, or distorted. <em>See id. </em>at 37,252. Commerce\u2019s rationale is that \u201c[a]s long as a company\u2019s shares are being traded in the secondary market, we obviously cannot reach * * * a conclusion [that no reasonable investor would have invested in the company]. Reasonable investors are investing in the company, albeit only at a certain price. \u201d <em>Id. </em>In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce found \u201cClabecq\u2019s and Cockerill\u2019s shares were publicly traded on Belgian markets.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,277. Thus, Commerce did not make an equityworthiness determination for Cockerill or Clabecq because \u201cthe market price [of their publicly traded shares] serve[d] as a benchmark price for the value of the shares.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,275.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Domestic Producers first claim Commerce erred in failing to investigate the equityworthiness of Cockerill and Clabecq despite substantial evidence on the record regarding the unequityworthiness of both. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 32.) If the agency had done so and determined the companies were unequityworthy, Domestic Producers argue, Commerce would have countervailed the infusions as grants. <em>(Id. </em>(citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,239).) Moreover, Domestic Producers fault Commerce\u2019s practice of proceeding to an equityworthiness determination only when there is no market-determined price for the company\u2019s existing shares as based on faulty reasoning and inconsistent with Commerce\u2019s own pronouncements on the meaning of equi-tyworthiness. <em>(Id. </em>at 33 (citation omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Second, Domestic Producers argue Commerce\u2019s resort to an equity-worthiness determination only when there is no market-determined price reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevance of the secondary market to a company\u2019s equityworthiness. <em>(Id. </em>at 39.) Domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tic Producers suggest that equityworthiness \u201crelates to a company\u2019s ability to attract <em>new </em>capital from reasonable private investors. * * * When investors buy a company\u2019s existing stock on the secondary market from existing owners, they are not investing <em>in the company. \u201d (Id.) </em>Commerce its\u00e9lf, Domestic Producers argue, has found that sales on the secondary market do not provide a benefit to the company whose stock is being traded. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 15 n.36 (citing <em>Certain Steel Products From Belgium, </em>47 Fed. Reg. 39,304, 39,319 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1982) (final determ.) <em>(1982 Final Determination) </em>(\u201cIf the government buys previously issued shares on a market or directly from shareholders rather than from the company, there is no subsidy to the company.\u201d)) (further citations omitted).) Furthermore, Domestic Producers suggest, Commerce\u2019s use of the secondary market to measure the value of shares creates an enormous loophole in CVD law as a \u201cgovernment could pour unlimited amounts of capital into a company, regardless of its ability to produce a reasonable return on that capital.\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 46.) In this way, a company could avoid countervailing duties \u201cso long as [the government] received in return the number of shares which, when divided into the amount of the infusion, yielded the then prevailing secondary market price.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Third, Domestic Producers contend Commerce\u2019s position that the presence of a secondary market in a company\u2019s shares is proof of the firm\u2019s equityworthiness is contrary to Commerce\u2019s prior recognition that firms with publicly traded shares can be unequityworthy. <em>(Id. </em>at 40.) Domestic Producers point to the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>wherein Commerce considered the soundness of investments in Cockerill at a time when the company\u2019s shares were publicly traded in the secondary market. <em>(Id.) </em>In that determination, Commerce declared, \u2018\u201cwe do not regard these Belgian steel companies [those that merged to create Cock-erill] as representing sound commercial investments at the time the GOB acquired equity positions in them.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(quoting <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 39,307).) Domestic Producers contend Commerce endorsed this finding in the current investigation. <em>(Id. </em>(citing <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,279).) Finally, Domestic Producers cite record evidence supporting their claim that Cockerill and Clabecq were unequity worthy in the years of the equity infusions. <em>(See id. </em>at 42-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">As discussed above in section one, part I.C.2.b, Commerce argues the equityworthiness test is a substitute for the market price benchmark and is only employed where no market price exists or where such benchmark is deficient, tainted, or distorted. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 63 (citations omitted).) Commerce explains it prefers using a \u201cmarket-determined price as a benchmark for measuring subsidies before substituting its own judgment in an equityworthiness determination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 65.) Because it has consistently preferred to use the share price in the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ondary market before resorting to the equityworthiness test, Commerce argues, it found no reason to abandon its practice in this determination. <em>(Id. </em>at 63-64 (citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,251).) Commerce is quick to point out, however, \u201cthere may be instances where the market might not operate optimally.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 74.) If evidence of tainted, deficient, or distorted share prices is present, Commerce acknowledges it can reject the market benchmark as it has done in other investigations. <em>(Id. </em>at 73 (footnote omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Commerce argues Domestic Producers\u2019 attempt to show Cockerill and Clabecq were unequityworthy misses the point. The issue is not the equityworthiness of those firms, Commerce insists, but rather the reasonableness of Commerce\u2019s long-standing policy of employing actual market prices before invoking the equityworthiness test. <em>(Id. </em>at 69.) Moreover, Commerce believes it is inappropriate for Domestic Producers to argue the merits of an equityworthiness determination as to Cock-erill and Clabecq when such a determination was never considered or briefed in the administrative proceeding below. <em>(Id. </em>at 69 n.143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">There is no danger, Commerce assures the Court, that the use of stock market prices creates a loophole in CVD law as argued by Domestic Producers. <em>(Id. </em>at 73.) Commerce rejects the scenario that a foreign government could pour unlimited capital into a company, and avoid creating a countervailable subsidy by dividing the infusion amount by the prevailing market price to yield an appropriate pumber of shares purchased. <em>(Id.) </em>In such a case, Commerce suggests, the market would respond to this dilution of equity by devaluing share prices. Furthermore, if the agency had substantial evidence of inflated share prices, Commerce reasons, it would adjust share prices accordingly. <em>(Id. </em>(citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,252-53).)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Finally, Commerce concedes it erred in the <em>Final Determination </em>by mischaracterizing the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>as having made the determination that Cockerill was unequity worthy. <em>(Id. </em>at 75 n.160 (citing <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,279).) In light of its lengthy explanation and justification for the use of market prices as benchmarks, and Commerce\u2019s long-standing policy of preferring market-determined prices as benchmarks before resorting to the equityworthiness inquiry, however, Commerce argues Domestic Producers\u2019 focus on this and other \u201charmless errors\u201d is unavailing. <em>(Id. </em>at 76-77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Clabecq argues Commerce properly refused to undertake an equity-worthiness investigation of Clabecq because the company\u2019s stock was publicly traded on the Belgian stock exchange. (Clabecq\u2019s Br. at 3.) \u201c[A] company whose shares are publicly traded is plainly \u2018equityworthy,\u201d\u2019 Clabecq argues, because \u201cindependent investors are willing to take equity ownership positions in the company.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) After discussing the <em>Subsidies Appendix </em>and Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>Cla-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>becq concludes Commerce\u2019s decision not to proceed with an equity-worthiness determination in the case of Clabecq was fully consistent with the agency\u2019s longstanding policies and practices. <em>(Id. </em>at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As defendant-intervenor, Fabfer supports Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that Commerce erred in failing to make an equityworthiness determination with respect to Cockerill and Clabecq. (Fabfer\u2019s Resp. Br. at 2.) Fabfer concedes that publicly traded shares presumptively establish a market-determined price for the company\u2019s shares. <em>(Id. </em>at 2-3.) Fabfer cautions, however, this does not necessarily establish that the company\u2019s financial condition is sound, or that the company would be able to produce a reasonable return on additional capital. <em>(Id. </em>at 3.) Given the financial evidence on the record, Fabfer argues, Commerce should have conducted equityworthiness determinations for Cockerill and Clabecq despite the fact their shares were publicly traded. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Domestic Producers and Fabfer have simply raised another attack on Commerce\u2019s use of secondary market prices as a benchmark to value subsidy benefits. In section one, part I.D.2.b <em>supra, </em>the Court upholds Commerce\u2019s use of secondary market prices in lieu of the agency\u2019s equi-tyworthiness inquiry. The only issue here is whether Commerce properly chose not to make equityworthiness determinations as to Cockerill and Clabecq. The Court finds Commerce\u2019s decision not to make such an equityworthiness determination is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Commerce adequately set forth why there was no need to make equityworthiness determinations as to Cock-erill and Clabecq. The agency cited record evidence demonstrating the shares of both companies were publicly traded on Belgian markets. Thus, Commerce properly reasoned it need not make an equityworthiness determination for Cockerill or Clabecq because \u201cthe market price [of their publicly traded shares] serves as a benchmark price for the value of the shares.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,275.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Court is not persuaded by the evidence raised by Domestic Producers and Fabfer attempting to show that notwithstanding the availability of a market benchmark for the value of Cockerill\u2019s and Clabecq\u2019s shares, the companies still showed signs of being unequityworthy. Under Commerce\u2019s methodology, there is no need to examine evidence of a firm\u2019s equityworthiness if an adequate market benchmark exists for the firm.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is a reasonable exercise of Commerce\u2019s discretion to express a preference for market-based benchmarks before substituting its own judgment by invoking the equityworthiness test. <em>See Wheatland Tube Corp. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1230, 1245, 841 F. Supp. 1222, 1234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>(1993) (\u201cCommerce has broad discretion to choose a methodology to satisfy the statutory mandate.\u201d). The Court holds Commerce\u2019s determination not to make equityworthiness determinations as to Cockerill and Clabecq is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">III. <em>The Use of the Secondary Market Price of Clabecq\u2019s Existing Common Stock on the Date the 1985Debt-to-Equity Conversion </em>Was <em>Agreed to as the Benchmark:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Even if the Court were to agree with Commerce\u2019s determination that Clabecq was equity worthy and that the secondary market price of common stock is an appropriate benchmark for valuing the shares at issue, Domestic Producers argue, Commerce still erred in using as a benchmark the market price of the shares at the time Clabecq and the GOB agreed to the transaction. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 77.) Domestic Producers contend the <em>General Issues Appendix </em>provides that \u201cwhen using publicly traded shares as a benchmark to determine countervail-able benefits, the Department will use the market price at the time of the infusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,253).) In the present case, Domestic Producers argue Commerce has offered no explanation for its departure from this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Commerce concedes it erred and states \u201cit should have used the share price at the time of the infusion\u201d in accordance with the practice outlined in the <em>General Issues Appendix. </em>(Def.\u2019s Br. at 85.) Accordingly, if appropriate after Commerce\u2019s consideration on remand of the use of Clabecq\u2019s common shares as the \u201cnext most similar publicly traded equity instrument,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Commerce shall recalculate the countervailing duty rate for the conversions of BF 211,835,100 and BF 1.288 billion Clabecq debt held by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale pour des Reconstruction des Secteurs Nationaux (SNSN)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to ordinary and non-voting preference shares, pursuant to the approval of the Belgian Council of Ministers on December 30, 1983, based on the date of the GOB\u2019s equity infusion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">IV <em>The Use of Sidmar\u2019s 1991 Consolidated Group Sales as the Sales Denominator:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Sidlnvest N.V (Sidlnvest) was created in 1982 as a holding company jointly capitalized by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale d\u2019Investissement (SNI), a government agency, and Sidarfin, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sidmar. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,281. The GOB created Sidln-vest and similar holding companies as part of its plan to restructure the steel industry. Although the original goal in creating the holding companies was to develop state-of-the-art steel companies, in 1983 the GOB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>revised the statutory purpose to include the start up or expansion of all industrial or commercial companies that contribute to Belgian economic development. Commerce verified that few of Sidlnvest\u2019s investments have been steel-related. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The GOB gave Sidlnvest drawing rights on SNI to finance specific projects. The drawing rights took the form of conditional refundable advances (CRAs), which were interest free but repayable to SNI based on Sidlnvest\u2019s profitability. <em>See id. </em>After the GOB sought to accelerate Sidlnvest\u2019s repayment of the CRAs, the GOB swapped its uncertain repayment schedule for a fixed schedule. <em>Id. </em>at 37,282. \u201cThe face value of the outstanding CRAs would be repaid in 32 years. In the meantime, no interest would be paid [by Sidmar].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce determined this transaction created a 32-year interest free loan, which constituted a countervailable benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Commerce also found the GOB sought immediate repayment of at least some of the money owed to it. Thus, Commerce determined SNSN effectively sold the 32-year interest free loan back to Sidlnvest for new shares in Sidlnvest and cash. The new shares were then sold for cash. Commerce found the transaction consisting of the exchange of the 32-year interest free loan for shares in Sidlnvest and Sidlnvest\u2019s cash payment to SNSN gave rise to a countervailable benefit because the total amount of money received by SNSN was less than what Sidlnvest should have paid to repurchase its loan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Commerce concluded these transactions bestowed countervailable benefits on Sidmar, and not Sidlnvest, because \u201cany subsidies provided to Sidlnvest are not tied to Sidlnvest or to the specific activities in which it invested. Instead, any benefits flow to the Sidmar Group as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce explained that Sidlnvest was organized as an \u201cinvestment\u201d joint venture, meaning it would not engage in the production of any products. <em>Id. </em>at 37,291. Instead, Sidlnvest would invest the funds in unspecified projects and use the returns from these projects to repay the CRAs and thejoint venture partners. <em>Id. </em>at37,292 \u201c[W]here the government provides assistance to a non-producing joint venture (or subsidiary) and where there are no specific conditions on how or where the funds should be invested,\u201d Commerce explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">it is reasonable to conclude that the subsidy benefits the participants in thejoint venture rather than specific investments funded by the joint venture. In our view, subsidies to an investment joint venture, with no conditions on the use of the funds, are analogous to the receipt of \u201cuntied\u201d subsidies. The Department\u2019s practice in such instances is to allocate the benefit over the total sales of the recipient company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><em>Id. </em>In accord with this reasoning, Commerce treated the subsidies as untied benefits to the Sidmar Group. Commerce then calculated the benefits from the two subsidies using Sidmar\u2019s company-specific benchmark for 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 37,282. The benefits from the interest-free loan were allocated over the life of the loan, and the benefits from the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the loan were allocated over fifteen years. Commerce then divided these amounts by the total 1991 sales of the Sidmar Group.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">First, Domestic Producers claim Commerce improperly used Sid-mar\u2019s consolidated group sales as the sales denominator in its subsidy calculation and should have used only Sidmar\u2019s total sales as the denominator. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 56-57.) Domestic Producers contend the Sidmar Group sales figure includes non-Belgian revenue and revenue generated in transportation charges, etc., which are not properly included in any countervailing duty denominator. <em>(Id. </em>at 57-58 (citing <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,231).) \u201cA review of Sidmar\u2019s annual report, \u201d Domestic Producers argue, \u201c confirms that [Sidmar] has at least nine fully consolidated foreign subsidiaries\u201d and thus \u201cuse of the Sidmar Group figure artificially reduced the subsidy rate on Sidmar\u2019s sales.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 58.) \u201c[I]t simply makes no sense to apply the Sidmar Group total sales figure when calculating the subsidy rate to Sidmar for the Sidlnvest program,\u201d Domestic Producers contend, when all enterprises within the Sidmar Group were not investigated for subsidies. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 35 (footnote omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Second, assuming Commerce used the proper denominator, Domestic Producers argue Commerce should not have used the unverified worldwide sales figure for Sidmar. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 57.) Domestic Producers allege that unlike the sales data for Sidmar, the Sidmar Group sales figure was not verified by Commerce and therefore the agency should have used the verified sales of Sidmar and its related service center as best information available (BIA). <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\n<em>2. Commerce:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Commerce responds it properly used the total sales figure for the Sid-mar group in the denominator of the subsidy rate calculation for the Sidlnvest program. By employing its \u201ctraditional tying analysis,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Commerce argues it found any subsidies provided to Sidlnvest are not tied to Sidlnvest or to the specific activities in which it invested, but rather, flow to the Sidmar Group as a whole. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 108 (footnote omitted).) Furthermore, in response to Domestic Producers\u2019 charge that Commerce improperly included transportation charges in its calculations, Commerce concedes it normally would use total sales of the Sidmar Group for the POI adjusted to an F.O.B. (port) value as the sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>denominator. <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this investigation, however, the record contained only the relevant total sales figure, as set forth in Sidmar\u2019s Annual Report, but not the necessary data to make the F.O.B.

Thus, Commerce \u201cused its \u2018best estimate\u2019 given the state of the record\u201d and did not resort to BIA. <em>(Id. </em>at 110 (footnote omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Commerce defends its verification of the total sales figure for the Sid-mar Group as contained in Sidmar\u2019s Annual Report and argues the agency enjoys \u201csignificant latitude in implementing its verification procedures.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 111 (citations omitted).) The agency\u2019s \u2018\u201cdecision to select a particular method of verification rests solely within the agency\u2019s sound discretion,\u201d\u2019 Commerce argues, and should be sustained if reasonable. <em>(Id. (quoting Floral Trade Council v. United States, </em>17 CIT 392, 399, 822 F. Supp. 766, 772 (1993) (citation omitted)).) In this investigation, Commerce contends its spot-check of the information submitted was a reasonable method of verification as Commerce is not required to conduct an exhaustive examination of all information. <em>(Id.) </em>Furthermore, Commerce notes Sidmar\u2019s Annual Report had been audited by an independent accounting firm giving Commerce no reason to inquire further into the accuracy of the report as Commerce routinely accepts audited data as accurate for verification purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at 112 (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Sidmar supports Commerce and agrees the agency properly used the Sidmar Group\u2019s 1991 total sales figure as the denominator in its calculations regarding Sidlnvest. <em>(See </em>Sidmar\u2019s Br. at 42-44.) Sidmar also sides with Commerce to defend the agency\u2019s verification process in this investigation and to reject Domestic Producers\u2019 argument that Commerce should have used only Sidmar\u2019s and its related service center\u2019s total sales as BIA for the sales denominator. <em>(See id. </em>at 44-46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Sidmar raises an additional attack on Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments and contends Domestic Producers are barred from raising the issue of the inclusion of foreign sales in the sales denominator because this issue was briefed, argued, and decided in another phase of this proceeding.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 47-49.) Sidmar asserts Domestic Producers failed to raise the issue of the denominator used in Commerce\u2019s Sidlnvest calculations at that time and therefore Domestic Producers should be barred from being heard on this issue. <em>(Id. </em>at 48.) To allow otherwise, Sidmar argues, would be prejudicial to Sidmar because, relying on the absence of any discussion by Domestic Producers of the Sidlnvest denominator in their briefing on the general issue of sales denominator, Sidmar did not actively participate in the denominator portion of the General Issues proceeding. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The Court addresses as a threshold issue Sidmar\u2019s contention that Domestic Producers are precluded from raising an argument concerning the calculation of the sales denominator because of the Court\u2019s earlier consideration of that issue in <em>British Steel plc. See British Steel plc, </em>19 CIT at 245-59, 879 F. Supp. at 1310-20. Sidmar is correct in arguing that parties are generally barred from re-arguing issues discussed in <em>British Steel plc </em>as general issues. <em>See supra </em>note 34. In this case, however, the Court finds Domestic Producers are not precluded from raising their arguments because in this <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce did not employ the refined sales denominator methodology at issue in <em>British Steel pic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The refined sales denominator methodology at issue in <em>British Steel pic </em>was erected by Commerce to calculate the appropriate sales denominator</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">to be used in subsidy calculations when a respondent\u2019s total sales include not only sales of domestically produced merchandise, but also sales of merchandise -produced in one or more foreign countries. This issue arises in the Certain Steel Products investigations where the respondent is a parent company producing the subject merchandise in the country under investigation and in one or more other countries, typically through subsidiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\"><em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,231. In this investigation, however, Commerce determined Sidlnvest \u201cwas set up as an \u2018investment\u2019 joint venture, i.e., it would not itself engage in production of any products.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,291. Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>stated that \u201csubsidies to an investment joint venture, with no conditions on the use of the funds, are analogous to the receipt of \u2018untied\u2019 subsidies. The Department\u2019s practice in such instances is to allocate the benefit over the total sales of the recipient company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,292. Thus, Commerce treated the subsidies as untied benefits to the Sidmar Group and therefore, Commerce had no reason to apply its refined tying analysis in this case. <em>(See also </em>Def. \u2019s Br. at 114n.270 (\u201cCommerce did not have any basis for applying its new tying presumption (for firms with multinational production) in this case.\u201d).) The Court finds the refined tying methodology at issue in <em>British Steel pic </em>was not employed by Commerce in this <em>Final Determination. </em>Therefore, Domestic Producers are free to raise their claims challenging the denominator calculation in this action and are not precluded from doing so by the terms of the scheduling order set down in <em>British Steel pic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The Court is persuaded Commerce\u2019s decision to use Sidmar\u2019s consolidated group sales as the sales denominator in its subsidy calculation is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. There is substantial evidence to support Commerce\u2019s finding that given the state of the record in this investigation, the agency\u2019s use of the Sid-mar Group total sales figure without adjusting for transportation charges and including non-Belgian company revenue was a proper exercise of the agency\u2019s discretion in these matters. The Court recognizes that Commerce has substantial license to determine what evidence it needs to carry out its statutory functions. <em>See Creswell Trading Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>12 Fed. Cir. (T) _, _, 15 F.3d 1054, 1062 (1994) (\u201cCommerce is presumably in the best position to know what it means by its own requirements and what evidence will satisfy these requirements * * *.\u201d). Domestic Producers have raised no credible evidence leading the Court to question Commerce\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Additionally, the Court perceives no reason to overturn Commerce\u2019s finding that the evidentiary gaps in the record were inadvertent and not due to any lack of openness on the part of Foreign Producers. Commerce explained that \u201c[g]iven the way in which the investigations developed * * * the record only contained the relevant total sales figure * * * but not the necessary data to adjust to an F.O.B. (port) value.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 108-09 (footnote omitted).) That is, \u201cthe record did not contain all of the data ideally available.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 109.) Whatever the deficiencies in the record, there is no evidence that Commerce deemed respondents responsible for such deficiencies. Indeed, Commerce explains, the \u201cinadvertent evidentiary gap in the record, [is] not due to any failure on the part of the respondent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 110.) It appears then the use of BIA is not appropriate in this instance as the statute \u201cclearly requires <em>noncompliance with an information request </em>before resort to the best information rule is justified, whether due to refusal or mere inability.\u201d <em>Olympic Adhesives, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 69, 79, 899 F.2d 1565, 1574 (1990) (discussing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) (1982) redesignated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>1988 as \u00a7 1677e(c)<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>) (citation omitted). Commerce is in the best position to know if respondents have been forthcoming and whether resort to BIA is proper, the Court sees no reason to disturb Commerce\u2019s decision not to resort to BIA. <em>See Timken Co. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 486, 489, 852 F.

Supp. at 772 (further citation omitted). Commerce\u2019s decision to employ a spot-check of the information submitted was a reasonable method of verification as there is no obligation on Commerce to conduct a comprehensive examination of all information submitted. <em>See Monsanto Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 937, 944, 698 F. Supp. 275, 281 (1988). The Court sustains in all respects Commerce\u2019s use of Sidmar\u2019s 1991 consolidated Group Sales as the sales denominator as based on substantial evidence on the record and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>V. The Countervailing of Benefits from the 1970 Economic Expansion Law Only to the Extent They Exceeded Benefits Already Available Under the 1959 Expansion Law:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">On July 17, 1959, the GOB passed an economic expansion law (1959 Law) providing for interest rebates, grants for capital investments, government loan guarantees, and other benefits designed to promote economic expansion and modernization in Belgium. <em>See 1982 Preliminary Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 26,305. Because the programs under the 1959 Law were available to companies in all regions in Belgium and were not directed to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, Commerce declined to countervail benefits flowing from the 1959 Law. <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 39,310; <em>see also Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,275 (\u201cThe 1959 Law was found to be non-specific in Belgian Steel and, thus, not countervail-able.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The Economic Expansion Law of December 30, 1970 (1970 Law), offered similar \u201cincentives to promote the establishment of new enterprises or the expansion of existing ones which contribute directly to the creation of new activities and new employment within designated development zones. \u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,275. Commerce determined the 1970 Law provided benefits specifically to firms in certain regions of the country. Therefore, Commerce found the benefits dispensed under the 1970 Law were provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries and were countervailable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Commerce determined that firms qualifying for benefits under the 1970 Law would also qualify for benefits under the 1959 Law, albeit at a somewhat lower benefit level. <em>Id. </em>at 37,289. Thus, Commerce countervailed benefits under the 1970 Law only to the extent they exceeded benefits available under the 1959 Law. <em>Id. </em>at 37,275, 37,289.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Domestic Producers charge Commerce\u2019s determination that it need only countervail benefits provided under the 1970 Law to the extent they exceeded benefits available under the 1959 Law is not supported by substantial record evidence, is not in accordance with law, and is unprecedented and unexplained. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 59.) Domestic Producers do not challenge Commerce\u2019s determination that the 1970 Law is specific and that the 1959 Law is not specific. <em>(Id. </em>at 58-59, 59 n.169.)<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Rather, Domestic Producers argue the 1959 Law is entirely separate from the 1970 Law and Commerce erred in linking the two programs without making the requisite finding that the programs were integrally linked. <em>(Id. </em>at 60 (footnote omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">First, Domestic Producers challenge Commerce\u2019s calculation of benefits provided under the 1970 Law and contend it is contrary to the agency\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations. (Id. </em>at 61.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Domestic Producers assert the regulations provide Commerce \u201cwill countervail benefits under a program only to the extent that the benefits exceed the most favorable non-selective benefits available under that same program.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(discussing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,382 (to be codified at 19 C.ER. \u00a7 355.44(n))).) Domestic Producers claim Commerce is \u201csimply mistaken\u201d when the agency argues that \u201c\u2018by its terms the regulation is not limited to a single program.\u2019\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 27 (quoting Def.\u2019s Br. at 103).)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Second, Domestic Producers complain that Commerce\u2019s calculation of the benefits is inconsistent with the agency\u2019s past decisions, and further that Commerce has failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its departure from these precedents. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 61, 62.) For example, Domestic Producers contend that in the <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>Commerce rejected the argument that because the 1970 Law provided only marginally higher benefits than those available under the 1959 Law, only the incremental benefits should be countervailed. <em>(Id. </em>at 61.) Domestic Producers claim Commerce has failed to cite any new evidence justifying a different approach in this investigation. (Domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 31.) Further, Domestic Producers cite <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy, </em>53 Fed. Reg. 27,197 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1988) (final determ.) <em>(Certain Granite Products From Italy) </em>where Commerce \u201cnot only applied the multi-tiered analysis to a single program, but clarified that the analysis is to be used \u2018where the level of benefits under <em>a particular </em>program was tiered.\u2019\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 62 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy, </em>53 Fed. Reg. at 27,200).)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Third, Domestic Producers argue that because the 1959 Law and the 1970 Law are separate programs and there is no basis for applying a tiered-level of benefits analysis in the case of multiple programs, Commerce should \u201ccountervail the full amount of the benefits provided to Respondents under the 1970 Law, at least absent a finding that the two laws were in effect a single program, <em>i.e., </em>that they were integrally linked. \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 63.) Domestic Producers argue an integral linkage analysis is useful for determining whether two programs are, in effect, one program for purposes of Commerce\u2019s tiered-level analysis. <em>(Id. </em>(footnote omitted).) Applying the integral linkage analysis factors \u2014 \u201c\u2018the administration of the programs, evidence of a government policy to treat industries equally, the purposes of the programs as stated in their enabling legislation, and the manner of funding the programs\u2019\u201d and whether the programs are linked at inception \u2014 Domestic Producers survey the record evidence and conclude an examination of these factors demonstrates no integral linkage between the 1959 Law and the 1970 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 64 (quoting <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,380 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.43(b)(6))); <em>id. </em>at 64-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Commerce defends its actions and contends it acted in accordance with law when it determined it need only countervail benefits provided under the 1970 Law to the extent they exceeded beriefits available under the 1959 Law. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 101.) Commerce responds to Domestic Producers\u2019 argument concerning the agency\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>and the tiered-level analysis by noting that although \u201cthis policy typically applies in situations involving a single program with more than one level of benefits * * * by its terms the regulation is not limited to a single program.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 103.) In any event, the agency argues, \u201cCommerce did not actually apply its two-tiered policy to this case. Instead, Commerce reached the same result by analogy. \u201d <em>(Id.) </em>To apply the two-tiered policy, Commerce continues, two conditions must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">First, the firm receiving the benefits from the specific portion of the program must have been eligible to receive the non-specific benefits. Second, Commerce must be able to determine the exact amount of benefits that would have been available under the nonspecific portion of the program in order to measure the difference between the benefit levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>(Id.) </em>Commerce contends both conditions were met in this case, first because steel producers in Belgium could have received benefits under the 1959 Law notwithstanding the 1970 Law, and second because Commerce was able to determine the exact amount of benefits that would have been available to the steel producers under the 1959 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 104 (footnotes omitted).) Commerce rejects Domestic Producers\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s action here was unprecedented and cites several determinations \u201cinvolving multi-tiered subsidy programs in which Commerce has applied its tiered policy for determining the amount to be countervailed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Commerce also disputes Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that Commerce\u2019s action in this case was inconsistent with the agency\u2019s determination in <em>the 1982 Final Determination. (Id. </em>at 105.) At that time, Commerce contends, it \u201chad not yet developed its policy toward programs with varying levels of benefits. Indeed, there is no instance where Commerce applied the policy before 1985.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>For this reason, Commerce argues, it was not required to cite to new facts or evidence as Domestic Producers claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Commerce also faults Domestic Producers\u2019 reliance on the integral linkage policy to determine whether to apply the two-tiered policy. The integral linkage policy, Commerce explains, only applies \u2018\u201cwhen we are attempting to make a specificity determination for programs.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 106 (quoting <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,289).) Because Commerce already had determined the 1970 Law was specific, Commerce contends there was no reason for the agency to apply its integral linkage analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Sidmar agrees with Commerce and argues Commerce properly determined the 1959 and 1970 Laws were not entirely separate programs because \u2018\u201cfirms qualifying for benefits under the 1970 Law would also qualify for benefits under the 1959 Law,\u2019 albeit at different levels.\u201d (Sid-mar\u2019s Br. at 50 <em>(quotingFinal Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,289).)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Sidmar rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 argument that \u201cit is \u2018unprecedented for the Department to look to an entirely separate program * * * when applying the multi-tiered analysis to another program. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 51 (quoting Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 60).) To the contrary, Sidmar contends this appears to be exactly what the CIT instructed Commerce to do in <em>Comeau Seafoods Ltd. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 923, 724 F. Supp. 1407 (1989). <em>(Id.) </em>In that decision, Sidmar argues, the Court \u201capparently recognized that even if two separate programs exist, one specific and one not, to the extent the programs provide parallel, complementary benefits, the benefits obtained from the specific program are coun-tervailable only to the extent they exceed benefits available from the non-specific program.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 53-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Finally, Sidmar insists record evidence supports Commerce\u2019s determination that the 1959 and 1970 Laws are not entirely separate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>grams. For example, Sidmar states Commerce verified that: (1) the purpose of the two laws is the same; (2) an overlap exists in benefits provided under the two laws; (3) the application forms and the general administration guidelines used for both laws is the same; and (4) the language of the decrees awarding benefits under both laws is essentially the same. <em>(Id. </em>at 54 (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Fabfer concurs in Commerce\u2019s determination and agrees that the integral linkage analysis only applies when Commerce is making a specificity determination for two or more programs. (Fabfer\u2019s Resp. Br. at 6.) Accordingly, Fabfer argues Commerce properly countervailed benefits provided under the 1970 Law only to the extent the benefits exceeded those bestowed pursuant to the 1959 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 6-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Domestic Producers argue the language of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>restricts the tiered-level analysis to \u201cbenefits available under that same program. \u201d The Court does not read the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>so strictly. Additionally, insofar as the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>are proposed and not final regulations, the Court interprets the rules as expressions of agency practice and not as promulgated final rules. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Moreover, Commerce explains it did not directly employ the tiered-level analysis described in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>in making its determination to countervail only certain benefits. Instead, Commerce reached the same result by analogy. Commerce is afforded considerable leeway in erecting and applying methodologies to interpret the CVD statutes. <em>See Ipsco, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 80, 83, 899 F.2d 1192, 1194-95 (1990) (\u201c[The Court] give[s] due weight to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers, and we accept that interpretation if it is \u2018sufficiently reasonable.\u2019\u201d) <em>(quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978) (further citations omitted)). This Court holds Commerce\u2019s decision to apply the tiered-level analysis described in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>by analogy is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The Court finds little merit in Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that Commerce has departed from its prior decision in the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>not to treat benefits provided under the 1970 Law as if they were provided under the 1959 Law. <em>See 1982 Final Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 39,313. Commerce explains it \u201chad not yet developed its policy toward programs with varying levels of benefits\u201d at that time and therefore does not have to substantiate the position it took in the current investigation with new facts or evidence. The Court finds no persuasive evidence undermining Commerce\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Domestic Producers\u2019 quarrel with Commerce\u2019s reliance on <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy </em>as support for its treatment of benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>this investigation is similarly unpersuasive. In <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Commerce explained that in past cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">where the level of benefits under a particular program was tiered, <em>i.e., </em>varied between regions, but the tiers together covered all regions of the country, we calculated countervailable benefits based on any additional benefits received over and above the lowest tier of benefits that was available under the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Certain Granite Products From Italy, </em>53 Fed. Reg. at 27,200 (citation omitted). Domestic Producers insist that Commerce\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunder a particular program\u201d in <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy </em>dictates that the tiered-level analysis only applies to a single program. Commerce agrees the analysis \u201ctypically applies in situations involving a single program with more than one level of benefits, \u201d but observes that \u201cby its terms the [proposed] regulation is not limited to a single program.\u201d As discussed above, the Court agrees and finds no inconsistency between Commerce\u2019s determination in <em>Certain Granite Products From Italy </em>and its determination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Finally, the Court finds Commerce has provided a reasonable explanation for its decision not to employ the integral linkage analysis either explicitly or by analogy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">The discussion of integral linkage in section 355.43(b)(6) of the Proposed Regulations makes it clear that the test for integral linkage applies only when we are attempting to make a specificity determination for programs, which when considered on their own might be specific, but, when taken together, might be found non-specific. Before considering programs jointly for purposes of our specificity test, we must determine them to be integrally linked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">We have found the 1970 Law to be specific because benefits under the law are restricted to firms located in certain regions. Linking the 1970 Law with another law or program for purposes of determining its specificity is inappropriate because the law will always remain regionally specific. Therefore, the question of linkage does not apply here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\"><em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,289. It is evident from the preamble to \u00a7 355.43(b) (6) of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>that the integral linkage analysis is a tool used to evaluate the specificity of a program\u2014 not for determining whether two programs are one. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,368 (\u201c[RJespondents have argued that in determining the specificity of a program * * * the Department should consider the existence of comparable programs providing similar benefits to other industries. The Department\u2019s position has been to reject such an analysis unless it finds that the programs are integrally linked to one another.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Because Commerce reasonably determined the 1970 Law is specific, a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that is not challenged in this proceeding, there is no need for Commerce to turn to its integral linkage analysis when that analysis by its terms is employed only to evaluate the specificity of a program. The Court finds Commerce\u2019s decision not to invoke the integral linkage analysis is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s countervailing of the benefits from the 1970 Law only to the extent they exceeded benefits already available under the 1959 Law is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">VI. <em>The Calculation of Interest Rate Subsidies Provided to Clabecq Pursuant to the 1959 Law and the Gandois Plan:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Commerce determined Clabecq received an interest subsidy in the amount of BF 102 million pursuant to the 1959 Law, a program Commerce found not countervailable in the <em>1982Final Determination. Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,285. In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Domestic Producers alleged this amount was given to Clabecq under the Gandois Plan,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> a restructuring plan benefitting solely the steel industry. <em>Id. </em>Commerce stated, however, it \u201cfound no evidence that Interest Rate Subsidies under the 1959 Law were given subject to the Gandois Plan [to Clabecq].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,289.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Domestic Producers argue the Gandois Plan was a \u201cprogram\u201d under Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>and was selective because its benefits were limited to the steel industry. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 65-66.) Under the Gandois Plan, Domestic Producers contend, the GOB approved interest rate subsidies to Clabecq in the amount of BF 102 million pursuant to the government\u2019s authority derived from the 1959 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 66.)<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Consequently, Domestic Producers argue, \u201c\u2018when 1959 Law benefits [we]re [selectively] targeted using one of the specific restructuring plans, those benefits are countervailable.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(quoting <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,289) (bracketed material inserted to conform text to <em>Final Determination </em>quotation).) Fabfer agrees arguing Commerce ignored record evidence that indicates Cla-becq received a countervailable benefit from interest rate subsidies provided by the GOB under the Gandois Plan. (Fabfer\u2019s Resp. Br. at 5.) In its papers before the Court, Commerce concedes it erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">Upon review of the record and further analysis of the calculations concerning interest rate subsidies provided to Clabecq pursuant to the Gandois Plan and the 1959 Law, the Department concedes error in its calculation and requests a remand to correct the matter. Specifically, the Department\u2019s review of its calculations reveals that, while it countervailed the amount of the loan which petitioners designated insofar as that loan was issued at an interest rate less than the agency\u2019s benchmark interest rate, Commerce failed to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>an amount for the further interest rate reduction which Clabecq admitted that it was granted. Commerce will correct this error upon remand by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">(Def.\u2019s Br. at 114-15 (footnote omitted).) Thus, it appears Commerce agrees with Domestic Producers and Fabfer that the interest rate subsidies were provided to Clabecq pursuant to the Gandois Plan. Accordingly, the Court remands the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended to Commerce with instructions to recalculate the countervailing duty rate for the loan received by Clabecq, which was outstanding as of June 30, 1991, to include the interest rate reduction, resulting from interest rebates, under the Gandois Plan.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">VII. <em>The Reimbursement of Worker Training Costs Program:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Pursuant to the Royal Decree of December 20, 1963, the Belgian National Employment Office provided reimbursement to firms for various in-plant and outside professional training costs. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,285. Commerce determined the program was funded by the GOB. Commerce found Sidmar, Clabecq, and Cockerill received reimbursements of worker training costs from 1977 to 1991. Fabfer also received reimbursements, but subsequent to the relevant POI. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Commerce determined the reimbursement program was not <em>de jure </em>limited to any region or enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. With respect to <em>de facto </em>limitations, the agency verified that training reimbursements had been provided to firms in many economic sectors throughout the Walloon, Flanders, and Brussels regions of Belgium.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> After comparing the share by value of benefits received by respondents to those provided to all other users and recipients of the program, Commerce concluded the distribution of benefits under the program did not provide disproportionate benefits to the steel industry. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Commerce determined the program providing for the reimbursement of worker training costs was not countervailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Domestic Producers allege Commerce erred in determining the reimbursement of worker training costs was neither <em>de jure </em>nor <em>de facto </em>limited to any region, enterprise, industry, or group. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 68-69 (footnote omitted).) Thus, Domestic Producers contend Commerce has abrogated the CVD law and its own <em>Proposed Regula</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>tions </em>by failing to countervail selective benefits flowing from the reimbursement of training costs program. <em>(Id. </em>at 72.)<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Domestic Producers insist record evidence indicates the reimbursement of training costs program provides <em>dejure </em>selective benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at 70.) First, they argue, the Belgian National Employment Office provides, as a matter of law, higher worker training benefits to qualifying companies in certain regions. <em>(Id. </em>at 72.) Second, Domestic Producers point to the GOB\u2019s response to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire wherein the GOB states the Belgian National Employment Office \u201cassumes part of the \u2018technical training costs inherent in investments\u2019 for qualifying companies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 69 (quoting Pub. R. 82 at 37).) Third, Domestic Producers recount the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>where Commerce concluded the benefits provided under the reimbursement of worker training costs were countervailable because of the program\u2019s regional nature. <em>(Id. </em>at 70 (citing <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 39,308).) Fourth, Domestic Producers argue generally \u201c[t]he GOB\u2019s Response and Sidmar\u2019s Response in this investigation both confirm that only firms in particular regions are eligible for increased benefits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(footnote omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">To advance their argument that the benefits of the program are <em>de facto </em>specific, Domestic Producers contend one of the factors to determine <em>de facto </em>specificity is whether there are dominant users of a program. <em>(Id. </em>at 70-71 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,379 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.43(b)(2)(iii))).) Under this standard, Domestic Producers allege Fabfer, Cockerill, and Sidmar are all part of a group of enterprises or industries that is the dominant user of the reimbursement program in their respective regions. <em>(Id. </em>at 71-72.) The question for this Court, Domestic Producers claim, is to \u201cdecide if it is appropriate to define the group of enterprises or industries by region.\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 33.)<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Commerce responds it properly determined the reimbursement of worker training costs by the GOB was neither <em>de jure </em>nor <em>de facto </em>specific to a region or to an industry or group of industries. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(footnote omitted).)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Commerce concedes that in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>it appeared that the reimbursement program was <em>de jure </em>specific to companies in certain regions of Belgium. <em>(Id. </em>at 47 (citing <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 57,752).) In an internal memorandum, however, Commerce explains that after verification it determined the program was not <em>de jure </em>specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\">We note that in the preliminary determination, we countervailed this program because the response seem [sic] to point to the fact that the Brussels region did not qualify for benefits. At verification, we found that the Brussels region did, in fact, receive reimbursements. However, no steel companies are located in this region. Thus, it was not possible for the steel sector to receive benefits in this region.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">(Confid. R. 53 at 29, <em>quoted in </em>Def's Br. at 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Commerce also rejects what it perceives as Domestic Producers\u2019 attempt to erect a new test for specificity. If Domestic Producers\u2019 argument were adopted, Commerce contends, a program could be deemed specific if it provided disproportionate benefits to a group of regions. (Defs Br. at 49 (citing Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 71).) Commerce notes that not only have Domestic Producers failed to point to a single instance where Commerce has invoked such a test, but also that a \u201cfinding of specificity based on such a grouping and calculation would be ludicrous.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 50-51.) Commerce explains the distribution of benefits under the reimbursement program \u201creflects nothing more than the fact that certain regions are more heavily industrialized and populated than others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 50.) \u201c[I]f Commerce were to apply a strict disproportion-ality analysis, as if regions were industries,\u201d Commerce continues, Domestic Producers\u2019 \u201canalysis shows nothing more than that one half of the regions receive more benefits than the other half.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>A finding of specificity on such grounds would be without merit, Commerce concludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Fabfer and Sidmar contend Commerce correctly determined the reimbursement of worker training costs program is not specific and does not confer countervailable benefits. <em>(See </em>Fabfer\u2019s Resp. Br. at 7-8; Sid-mar\u2019s Br. at 56-60.) Sidmar points to record evidence demonstrating that a wide number of firms in a wide variety of industries used the reimbursement program, and that all regions of Belgium used the program. (Sidmar\u2019s Br. at 57 (citations omitted).) In accordance with Commerce\u2019s prior practice, Sidmar states, \u201cif all sectors of the economy can partid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>pate in a program providing assistance for worker training, those benefits are not countervailable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 58 (citation omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Sidmar also rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 argument that the benefits under the reimbursement program are <em>de facto </em>specific because certain provinces within the three regions of Belgium received a disproportionate share of the benefits. <em>(Id. </em>(citing Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 70-72).) Specifically, Sidmar cites to the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>indicating Commerce <em>\u201cmay </em>consider the proportion of enterprises or industries located in the regions in question\u201d when examining specificity under the <em>Proposed Regulations. (Id. </em>at 59 n.21 (discussing Proposed <em>Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,379 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.43(b)(3))).) \u201cThis is as close to a disproportionality test as the Department comes with respect to regional specificity,\u201d Sidmar contends. <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, Sidmar argues, Domestic Producers\u2019 argument falls short as it \u201cdoes not consider the proportion of industries in the provinces it claims receive disproportionate benefits. [Domestic Producers] merely state that because three of five provinces received 89.7% of the benefits, the program is regionally specific.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citing Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 72).)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The CVD statute provides that for Commerce to countervail a bounty or grant, the agency must determine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">whether the bounty, grant, or subsidy in law or in fact is provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries. Nominal general availability, under the terms of the law, regulation, program, or rule establishing a bounty, grant, or subsidy, of the benefits thereunder is not a basis for determining that the bounty, grant, or subsidy is not, or has not been, in fact provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5) (B).

In its questionnaire response to Commerce, the GOB listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the eligibility criteria for firms seeking reimbursement under the program in one region and stated, \u201c [eligibility is not limited to any industry or group of industries, nor to any area or subregion within the Flemish Region of Belgium.\u201d (Pub. R. 82 at 44.) Additionally, Commerce found upon verification that \u201ccompanies in various industries in all three administrative regions of Belgium (Flanders, Walloon, and Brussels) have used this program* * *. We verified that the program is not <em>de jure </em>limited to any region or enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d (Confid. R. 53 at 29.) Domestic Producers unearth no persuasive evidence establishing the reimbursement program was <em>de jure </em>specific. The Court holds Commerce\u2019s finding that the reimbursement of worker training costs program was not <em>de jure </em>limited to any region or enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">To determine whether the steel firms received a disproportionate share of benefits and thus whether the program was <em>de facto </em>specific, Commerce compared the share of benefits received by the steel firms under investigation to the share of benefits provided to all other users and recipients of the reimbursement program. <em>See Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,285; <em>see also id. </em>at 37,280.

Moreover, for the period 1987-1990, the Flemish steel industry received 7.3 percent by value of benefits disbursed under the program in Flanders. At least fifteen industrial sectors received benefits over this time period in Flanders. During the period 1988-1991, the Walloonian metals sector (which includes the steel industry) received 17.3 percent by value of the benefits disbursed under the program. At least 20 sectors received benefits over this time period in Walloon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 37,285. Commerce considered this record evidence in concluding that the distribution of benefits from the reimbursement of training costs to the steel firms under investigation did not constitute disproportionate benefits to the steel industry and thus was not <em>defacto </em>specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Domestic Producers criticize Commerce\u2019s finding and contend the Court must decide whether Commerce should define a group of enterprises or industries by region in applyingthe \u201cdominant user\u201d criteria of the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,379 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.43(b)(2)(iii)). <em>(See </em>Domestic Producers\u2019 Reply Br. at 33.) The Court declines Domestic Producers\u2019 invitation. Commerce enjoys considerable deference in erecting methodologies and procedures for implementing the CVD laws. <em>See Wheatland Tube Corp., </em>17 CIT at 1245, 841 F. Supp. at 1234. This Court is in no position to require Commerce to modify its <em>de facto </em>test so long as the test as applied is reasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>conforms to congressional intent. Hence, the Court rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 argument that Commerce define a group of enterprises or industries by region in applying the \u201cdominant user\u201d criteria in its <em>Proposed Regulations. </em>The Court upholds Commerce\u2019s determination that the reimbursement of worker training costs program was not <em>de jure </em>nor <em>defacto </em>specific as based on substantial evidence and as otherwise in accordance with law.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">VIII. <em>The Redemption of Sidmar\u2019s Preferred Shares:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Pursuant to a Royal Decree of December 31,1983, the GOB made two share subscriptions in Sidmar in 1984. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,278. The decree permitted the GOB to make preference share subscriptions in the steel industry provided the subscriptions did not exceed one-half of the social capital of the company. Commerce explained that SNSN, the government agency purchasing the shares, paid cash for the first subscription, which consisted of ordinary shares in the company. <em>Id. </em>Because Commerce did not initiate an equityworthiness investigation with respect to Sidmar, it did not investigate SNSN\u2019s first subscription of ordinary shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">SNSN purchased a second subscription consisting of preference, or preferred, shares issued in return for the cancellation of certain debt claims held by SNSN against Sidmar. <em>Id. </em>Commerce verified the characteristics of Sidmar\u2019s preference shares issued in the transaction and found: (1) they bore a <em>2% </em>priority dividend upon liquidation of the company; (2) they were non-voting, except under certain circumstances;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and (3) they were subject to redemption but not at a price lower than 80% of the nominal face value of the shares. (Confid. R. 41 at 21.) In the event the shares were not redeemed by 2004, they automatically converted to ordinary shares. (Confid. R. 4 at 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Commerce examined the attributes of Sidmar\u2019s preference shares in light of Commerce\u2019s hierarchical set of criteria used to distinguish debt from equity in cases of hybrid securities. As explained above in section one, part I.A, Commerce applies the following criteria to determine whether hybrid securities have the qualities of debt or equity: \u201c(1) Expiration/Maturity Date/Repayment Obligation, (2) Guaranteed Interest or Dividends, (3) Ownership Rights, and (4) Seniority.\u201d <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,254. Once a characteristic is clearly indicative of debt or equity, Commerce ends its analysis and categorizes the hybrid as debt or equity. Commerce applied this analysis to Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares and concluded the shares constituted equity. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>37,255. Because the reasons for Commerce\u2019s determination were based on business proprietary information, the explanation was included in a separate memorandum to the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As explained by Commerce, Sidmar subsequently redeemed the preference shares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">In 1987, the GOB requested that Sidmar redeem the preference shares early for budgetary reasons. Therefore, in 1989, Sidmar and the GOB agreed to fix the amount due in the year 2004. However, in order to receive some money back immediately, the GOB asked Sid-mar to pay the net present value in 1991 for the total due in 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,278. Commerce verified the GOB asked Sidmar to redeem the preference shares early because the GOB had to finance coal mine closures immediately. (Confid. R. 41 at 22.) After examining the redemption, Commerce concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">We have determined that the redemption of the preferred shares in 1991 did not give rise to a countervailable benefit. In selling the preferred shares.back to Sidmar, we analyzed whether Sidmar paid the net present value in 1991 of the amount due in 2004. Using Sid-mar\u2019s benchmark interest rate for 1991, we determined that the total amount of money received by the GOB was more than what Sidmar should have paid for the preferred shares. Therefore, we find that this redemption does not provide a countervailable benefit to Sidmar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\"><em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,278.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">1. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Domestic Producers complain Commerce incorrectly determined Sid-mar\u2019s preferred shares redeemed in 1991 were equity. Under Commerce\u2019s methodology for classifying hybrid securities, Domestic Producers claim, Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares constituted debt. <em>(See </em>Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 27-29.) First, Domestic Producers argue, the shares had a repayment obligation \u2014 indicative of debt \u2014 as evidenced by Commerce\u2019s finding that \u2018\u201cSidmar and the GOB agreed to fix the amount due [on the preference shares] in the year 2004.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28 (brackets added in brief) (quoting <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,278).) Second, although the shares were initially entitled to dividends, Domestic Producers argue, the dividends were capped at 2%. Thus, the dividends merely represented\" a \u201ccontingent interest, not a claim on profits of the firm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 29.)<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Third, Domestic Producers claim that although the preference shares as issued had limited voting rights, an attribute of equity, \u201cthese rights were stripped away by amendment to Sidmar\u2019s by-laws in 1984 and were never reinstated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>(Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).) Finally, according to Domestic Producers, preferred share holders were given reimbursement priority upon liquidation ahead of other classes of Sidmar stock. Domestic Producers conclude \u201cnone of the four criteria used by [Commerce] to distinguish between equity and debt indicate that the preferred shares were equity. \u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Domestic Producers also claim Commerce erred in concluding Sid-mar\u2019s redemption of the preferred shares in 1991 did not give rise to a countervailable benefit. This argument is tied to Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that Commerce should have treated the preferred shares as debt, in which case Commerce \u201cwould have applied its benchmark interest rate to countervail the absence of a return on these instruments, at least through the repayment date in 1991.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 31.) Thus, Domestic Producers argue that \u201c[a]s of the date of repayment, the Department would have countervailed either the difference between the amount repaid and the full principal owed, or the interest-free feature of the shares as if they had been outstanding through their due date in 2004. \u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In either case, Domestic Producers conclude, Sidmar repaid far less than it owed and Commerce erred in failing to countervail this benefit. In light of the above, Domestic Producers ask the Court to direct Commerce to treat the preferred shares as debt and find that the amount of the debt forgiven \u2014 the amount owed minus the amount repaid \u2014 be countervailed as a grant. <em>(Id. </em>at 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Additionally, at oral argument Domestic Producers claimed the Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Aimcor </em>supports their argument that Commerce failed to properly countervail the redemption of the preferred shares. Specifically, Domestic Producers argue that Commerce\u2019s refusal to countervail is improper because \u201cif [the preferred shares] were equity and even if the company is equity worthy, under <em>[Aimcor] </em>that doesn\u2019t dispose of the question of whether this was an investment on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d (Tr. at 94.) A review of the record, Domestic Producers insist, reveals there is no indication Commerce considered whether this transaction was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <em>(Id. </em>at 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Commerce rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 criticism and argues Commerce\u2019s determination that the redemption of Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares did not give rise to a countervailable benefit is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 86.) Commerce contends it acted in \u201cstrict accordance\u201d with its hierarchical criteria and properly categorized Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares as equity. <em>(Id. </em>at 92 (footnote omitted).) Commerce explains it first addressed whether the preferred shares should be categorized as grants. <em>(Id. </em>at 94 n.222.) Finding [ ], Commerce determined the shares were not outright grants. <em>(Id. </em>(quoting Confid. R. 52 at 2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Commerce argues it next applied the agency\u2019s hierarchy to determine whether the shares constituted debt or equity. Turning to the first criterion, Commerce explained if Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares contained an expiration or maturity date, they would be treated as debt. <em>(Id.) </em>Upon examination, however, Commerce noted that it was \u201c[ ]\u201d (Confid. R. 52 at 2.) Because the evidence regarding the first criterion was inconclusive, Commerce argues, it considered the second criterion, guaranteed interest or dividends.

From Commerce\u2019s viewpoint, this established that the preferred shares did \u201c[ ]\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Commerce argues it did not need to examine the third criterion, ownership rights, and the fourth criterion, seniority, because the second criterion had already established that the preferred shares were equity. Nonetheless, Commerce explains, these criteria support the finding that the shares were equity. As to ownership rights, Commerce relates it found [ ] (Confid. R. 52 at 2, <em>quoted in </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 93.) Commerce disagrees with Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that the voting rights of the preferred shares were \u2018\u201cstripped away by amendment to Sidmar\u2019s by-laws in 1984.\u2019\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 94 n.221 (quoting Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 29).) Commerce argues that nothing in the evidence cited by Domestic Producers establishes the limited voting rights of the shares were extinguished. <em>(Id. </em>(citing Confid. R. 4 Ex. 13a).) Finally, regarding seniority, Commerce agrees that Sid-mar\u2019s preferred shares, by their nature, gave holders \u201ccertain rights that were superior to the rights possessed by holders of common shares.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 93 n.220.) Commerce, however, rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 contention that the preferred shares were debt because they had reimbursement priority over other classes of Sidmar stock: \u201c[TJhere is nothing in the record which indicates that holders of Preferred Shares were to be given priority over Sidmar\u2019s creditors in the event of liquidation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 95 n.222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Commerce also dismisses Domestic Producers\u2019 second contention that the agency improperly failed to countervail the redemption of Sid-mar\u2019s preferred shares. <em>(Id. </em>at 95-97.) First, Commerce argues it reasonably determined Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares were equity and not debt as alleged by Domestic Producers. Second, Commerce contends it has wide latitude to determine what constitutes a subsidy and has sufficient discretion to disregard sham transactions or those intended to hide the receipt of countervailable subsidies. <em>(Id. </em>at 96-97.) Commerce states there is no evidence that the redemption <em>of </em>Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares was a sham transaction. To the contrary, Commerce argues there is substantial evidence indicating the transaction was intended to provide the GOB immediate access to funds. Additionally, Commerce points out, the redemption of the shares, if anything, hurt Sidmar by reducing its liquidity. <em>(Id. </em>at 97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>As to Domestic Producers\u2019s claim at oral argument that Commerce failed to examine whether the redemption was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations as required by <em>Aimcor, </em>Commerce responds that although the <em>Final Determination </em>is \u201ca bit oblique on this point,\u201d (Tr. at 138), Sidmar\u2019s Verification Report contains the findings of two accounting firms and six experts who determined \u201cwhether or not the preferred shares was a fair value for the debt swap, for the assumption of the debt by the government,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 139 (citing Confid. R. 40 at 12-13)). Counsel for Commerce stated, \u201cfrom my reading of the record, the independent accounting firm found that this was certainly commercially feasible.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Additionally, Commerce argues the issue posed in <em>Aimcor </em>is not reached here because if Commerce had stopped its inquiry after finding Sidmar was equityworthy, as Commerce apparently did in <em>Aimcor, </em>there would have been no reason for Commerce to discuss the results of the accounting firms\u2019 inquiries as Commerce did in Sidmar\u2019s Verification Report. <em>(Id. </em>at 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">3. <em>Foreign Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Sidmar supports Commerce\u2019s treatment of Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares and the redemption of those shares and finds nothing in Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments to undermine Commerce\u2019s conclusions. <em>(See generally </em>Sidmar\u2019s Br. at 27-42.) Discussing the hierarchical analysis Commerce employed, Sidmar argues there is substantial evidence supporting Commerce\u2019s determination that Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares were equity and not debt. <em>(Id. </em>at 28-36.) Additionally, Sidmar contends the redemption of the preferred shares did not give rise to a countervail-able benefit. <em>(Id. </em>at 36-42.) For example, Sidmar suggests that Commerce found Sidmar paid more than it should have to redeem the preferred shares, and therefore the redemption conferred no benefit on Sidmar and no countervailable subsidy was bestowed. <em>(Id. </em>at 41 (citing <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed.

Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The Court is not persuaded by Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments challenging Commerce\u2019s finding that Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares constituted equity. In defense of its findings described above, Commerce sets forth substantial evidence on the record that the preferred shares constituted equity. <em>See supra </em>section one, part VIII. A.2. Commerce gathered record evidence and worked it through its hierarchy for hybrid instruments, criterion by criterion, reaching the conclusion the preferred shares were equity instruments. Although the agency need not have examined each criterion in its hierarchy, that Commerce was able to advance substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tial evidence for each criterion to support its characterization of the shares as equity is persuasive evidence that the agency\u2019s finding is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. <em>See supra </em>section one, part I.D.l (upholding Commerce\u2019s hierarchical analysis of hybrid securities). Domestic Producers\u2019 argument in opposition does little more than advance an alternative reading of the record evidence. It is clear that \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620 (citations omitted). The Court holds Commerce\u2019s determination that Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares constituted equity is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The Court finds, however, Commerce erred in reaching its determination not to countervail the redemption of Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares. The Court\u2019s finding is not based on Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that the preferred shares constituted debt \u2014 an argument the Court has rejected \u2014 but instead is driven by Commerce\u2019s failure to explicate what record evidence it reviewed to determine whether the redemption of preferred shares as equity was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. As explained above in section one, part I.D.2.C, Commerce must countervail \u201c[t]he provision of capital * * * on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(A)(ii)(I). At oral argument, counsel for Commerce made a spirited effort to demonstrate that the findings of independent auditors as recited in Sidmar\u2019s Verification Report are evidence that Commerce considered such concerns. <em>(See </em>Tr. at 139.) When pressed on this point, however, counsel conceded it is not clear if the decision maker considered this evidence in determining whether the redemption of preferred shares was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <em>(See id. </em>at 157; <em>see also id. </em>at 158 (\u201cCommerce verifiers * * * did receive statements from the company officials about reports that were given by the two independent accounting firms. From that point on, I do not know what the verifiers did with that information and how that impacted upon the fact \u2014 \u201d).) As explained above in section one, part I.D.2.C, Commerce abrogates its statutory mandate when it concludes \u201ca government\u2019s infusion of equity will only confer a countervailable benefit if the company is not equity worthy,\u201d without also examining whether such infusions of equity are \u201con terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">It is unclear from the record whether Commerce performed its statutorily mandated task of examining whether the redemption of preferred shares was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <em>See SEC v. </em>Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947) (\u201c[I]f [an]administrative action is to be tested by the basis upon which it purports to rest, that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.\u201d) Accordingly, the Court remands the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended to determine whether Sidmar\u2019s redemption of preferred shares as equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations and to indicate the record evidence the agency relied upon in reaching its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">SECTION TWO:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi, S.A. <em>v. </em>United States</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">I. <em>The Aggregation of Cash Grants and Interest Subsidies Received Pursuant to the Economic Expansion Law of 1970:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The GOB adopted the Economic Expansion Law of December 30, 1970 (1970 Law) to offer \u201cincentives to promote the establishment of new enterprises or the expansion of existing ones which contribute directly to the creation of new activities and new employment within designated development zones.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed.

(Mot. Under R. 56.2 for Summ. J. on the Administrative R. (Fabfer\u2019s Br.) at 8.) In contravention of Commerce\u2019s proposed regulations, Fabfer argues, Commerce cumu-lated grants received in the same year even though the grants were received pursuant to entirely independent programs. <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) Fabfer maintains the grants should have been treated separately because: (1) the amounts received were installments on two separate grants; (2) the grants underwent separate approval processes in different years and were earmarked for different projects; and (3) some of the grants were not part of a \u201cparticular program\u201d received in the same year as required by the <em>Proposed Regulations.

Although the regulation defines a ministerial error to include \u201cany other type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial,\u201d Fabfer cautions that this provision should not be read as a grant of unbridled discretion for Commerce to determine when an act is ministerial. <em>(Id.) </em>This provision is \u201cvery limited,\u201d Fabfer argues, \u201cand what it\u2019s limited by are the specific acts that are enumerated before it \u2014 ejus-dem generis.\u201d (Tr. at 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Commerce maintains its decision to aggregate the grants received in the same year is a reasonable determination based upon substantial evidence because the grants received by Fabfer were provided under a single program \u2014 the 1970 Law. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 21-22.) Commerce first points out that the 1970 Law provides benefits to companies located in specific development zones and Fabfer is located within one of these zones. <em>(Id. </em>at 22-23 (footnotes omitted).) Second, Commerce asserts that although the grants \u201cmay have been approved at different times and for different purposes * * * each came from the same government agency applying the same criteria. Indeed, Commerce verified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>application forms for each grant were essentially identical. * * * [and] the actual amount of the grants was calculated according to the same formula.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Commerce argues its authority for aggregating the grants is based in part on the <em>Proposed^Regulations, </em>which provide in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u00a7 355.49 Allocation of countervailable benefits over time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">(a)(1) <em>General Rule. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">}{? <em>% % </em>* \u2756 sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">(3) The Secretary will allocate the following nonrecurring coun-tervailable benefits over two or more years:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">(i) Grants and equity infusions found to confer a countervailable benefit pursuant to \u00a7 355.44(e) (1) (i) where the <em>total amount of grants or equity infusions received under a particular program during a year </em>is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">(A) In the case of grants or equity infusions provided pursuant to a domestic program, equal to or greater than 0.50 percent of all sales of the firm in question during the same year * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-10\"><em>Proposed </em>Regulations, 54 Fed.

(Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. in Resp. to Fabfer\u2019s R. 56.2 Mot. for Summ. J. on the Administrative R. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Resp. Br.) at 10-14.) Domestic Producers maintain Fabfer did not present a timely challenge of Commerce\u2019s definition of the program of cash grants under the 1970 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 12-14.)<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Beyond the exhaustion of remedies argument, Domestic Producers contend that Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>define a program as \u2018\u201cany act or practice of a government.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 17 (quoting <em>Proposed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,379 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.2(r))).) There is no question, Domestic Producers contend, that all four of these grants were received under the same program, the 1970 Law. <em>(Id. </em>at 15 (footnote omitted).) The 1970 Law is the germane program at issue, Domestic Producers argue, and thus Fabfer\u2019s assertion that the individual grants themselves constitute the program is simply wrong. <em>(Id. </em>at 17-18.) Domestic Producers also claim Commerce\u2019s aggregation of the cash grants received under the 1970 Law is consistent with prior agency practice, <em>(id. </em>at 19-20 (footnote omitted)), and prevents the creation of a loophole in the CVD laws, <em>(id. </em>at 17).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Congress has directed that this Court \u201cshall, where appropriate, require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637(d) (1988). Unless exhaustion of administrative remedies is mandated by statute, however, it is within the discretion of the court to apply the exhaustion doctrine. <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 358, 359 (1992) (citations omitted); <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 86, 92-93, 630 F. Supp. 1327, 1334 (1986) (citations omitted). The Court declines to apply the exhaustion doctrine here because it is arguable Fabfer was not aware of Commerce\u2019s decision to aggregate certain grants until <em>the Amended Determination. </em>In Commerce\u2019s questionnaire to Fabfer requesting information about cash grants under the 1970 Law, it is not so clear Commerce intended to aggregate grants under the 1970 Law.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Additionally, the one reference in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>giving notice that Commerce aggregated the cash grants was the single sentence under a section entitled \u201cCash Grants Under the Economic Expansion Law of 1970\u201d wherein Commerce stated, \u201cFabfer, Cockerill, and Sidmar received grants for capital equipment under <em>this program </em>to be used in basic steel production.\u201d <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 57,752 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court is reluctant to bar Fabfer from raising its challenge here given Commerce\u2019s limited indication that it would consider grants the 1970 Law as \u201cone program\u201d and thus aggregate the grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Fabfer apparently does not dispute that the cash grants at issue were received pursuant to the 1970 Law. <em>(See </em>Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 5-6.) The issue here is whether Commerce properly aggregated cash grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>received pursuant to the 1970 Law despite Fabfer\u2019s claim that the grants underwent separate approval processes in different years, that they were earmarked for different projects, and that some of the grants were not part of a \u201cparticular program\u201d received in the same year as required by the <em>Proposed Regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The Court finds there is substantial evidence on the record to support Commerce\u2019s decision. For example, as Fabfer concedes, the grants were approved by the same government agency using the same criteria.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Furthermore, as Fabfer also admits, <em>\u201call </em>programs under the 1970 Law and the 1959 Law use the same application form\u201d and \u201cthe same general administrative guidelines are used for <em>all </em>programs under both laws. \u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Although Fabfer argues this evidence illustrates that under Commerce\u2019s rationale, \u201call programs under the 1970 Law would have to be <em>one </em>program,\u201d (Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 4), the Court disagrees. Fabfer\u2019s alternative reading of the evidence does not undermine Commerce\u2019s determination as \u201c [i]t is well settled that substantial evidence may exist in a record to support several inconsistent conclusions.\u201d <em>Metallverken Nederland B.V. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 1013, 1017, 728 F. Supp. 730, 734 (1989) (citing <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966)), <em>cited in Mantex, Inc. v. U.S., </em>17 CIT 1385, 1399-1400, 841 F. Supp. 1290, 1303 (1993). The Court finds the evidence advanced by Commerce \u2014 that the grants came from the same government agency applying the same criteria and that the actual amount of the grants was calculated according to the same formula \u2014 is substantial evidence supporting Commerce\u2019s determination that Fabfer\u2019s grants under the 1970 Law were provided pursuant to a particular program. That the grants underwent separate approval processes in different years and were earmarked for different investment projects does not render Commerce\u2019s decision to aggregate the grants under a particular program in error. Indeed, to find otherwise would undermine Commerce\u2019s ability to countervail benefits from a grant program as a foreign government could simply divide grants provided under a particular program and earmark each for a separate purpose, thereby circumventing CVD laws. Accordingly, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s aggregation of the cash grants received in the same years is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The Court is unpersuaded by Fabfer\u2019s argument that the <em>Amended Determination </em>setting forth Commerce\u2019s correction of its ministerial error was an improper use of the ministerial error provision. The statute upon which 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.28(d) is based defines a ministerial error as including \u201cany other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671d(e) (1988). The Court finds Commerce\u2019s failure to aggregate the grants received was an unintentional error, as evidenced by the agency\u2019s statement, \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>inadvertently </em>failed to add together grants received by Fabfer given in the same year under the same program.\u201d <em>Amended Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 43,750 (emphasis added). Additionally, because there is substantial evidence to support Commerce\u2019s decision to aggregate the grants under the 1970 Law, the Court finds the agency\u2019s error in failing to correctly calculate the aggregate grant amounts in the <em>Final Determination </em>was a ministerial error properly corrected in the <em>Amended Determination. </em>Accordingly, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s correction of its unintentional error via the <em>Amended Determination </em>was a proper use of the ministerial error provision based on substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Such a finding does not, as Fabfer argues, give the agency \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d to determine when an act is ministerial. <em>(See </em>Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 8.) Rather, it reflects the deference courts afford agency interpretations of statutes and the regulations implementing such statutes. <em>See Daewoo Elecs. Co., Ltd. v. Int\u2019l Union of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO, </em>11 Fed. Cir. (T) 100, 112, 6 F.3d 1511, 1522 (1993) (\u201cWhen the issue is the validity of a regulation issued under a statute that an agency is charged with administering, it is well established that the agency\u2019s construction is entitled to great weight.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>114 S. Ct. 2672 (1994). It appears to the Court that Commerce simply \u201cmade an error, not resulting from ill-considered judgment or wayward discretion, but from oversight.\u201d <em>See Companhia Brasileira Carburete de Calcio, </em>Slip Op. 94-48 at 7 (footnote omitted) (denying plaintiff\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction in part because of the unlikelihood plaintiff would prevail on the merits). Commerce\u2019s use of the ministerial error provision to correct the agency\u2019s failure to add together cash grants received in the same year under the same program is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">II. <em>The Reduction of the Amount of Benefits Received from Cash Grants by the Amount of Taxes Paid on the Cash Grants:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In its investigation, Commerce found that in Fabfer\u2019s case, assets purchased in part with cash grants under the 1970 Law were required to be depreciated for tax purposes based on the asset value less the cash grant amount. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37, 289. \u201cAs a result, the cash grants [had] the effect of reducing deductions for depreciation and, hence, higher taxes. \u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce also verified Fabfer was required to amortize capital grants over the life of the investment, while the amortized amount was reflected on Fabfer\u2019s income statement as \u201cOther Financial Income\u201d and ultimately was taxed. (Confid. R. 43 at 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The CVD statute provides that Commerce may exclude from the gross countervailable subsidy certain costs that may offset the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>subsidy received. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6). The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">(6) Net subsidy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">For the purpose of determining the net subsidy, the administering authority may subtract from the gross subsidy the amount of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the subsidy,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">(B) any loss in the value of the subsidy resulting from its deferred receipt, if the deferral is mandated by Government order, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">(C) export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended to offset the subsidy received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6).

Commerce acknowledged that the assets Fabfer purchased in part with cash grants must be depreciated for tax purposes, but concluded \u201cthe Department\u2019s longstanding practice is to disregard the secondary tax effects on subsidies.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,289.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">1. <em>Fabfer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Fabfer maintains Commerce improperly refused to offset the amount of benefits received from cash grants under the 1970 Law by the amount of taxes paid on the grants in proportion to the amortization of the investment. (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 11.) Because Fabfer includes the amount of the amortized grant as \u201cOther Financial Income\u201d on its income statement and pays income tax on that amount, Fabfer claims Commerce should offset the gross amount of the cash grant by the amount of tax paid to calculate the net countervailable benefit. <em>(Id. </em>at 12, 14.) Fabfer reads the CVD statute as \u201csilent on the question of whether a subsidy should be offset by the amount of taxes payable as a result of the subsidy,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 12 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6))), and states the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>are of \u201clittle use\u201d in determining whether a subsidy may be offset by taxes, <em>(id. </em>at 12-13 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,383 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.46(b)))). Furthermore, Fabfer argues \u00a7 355.46(b) of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>does not apply in this case because Fabfer\u2019s tax payments are not a secondary tax consequence, but rather are the \u201cprimary tax consequence of receiving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>grant. \u201d (Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 9.) Fabfer also contends Commerce\u2019s rationale for not considering secondary tax consequences is faulty, as it is founded solely upon Commerce\u2019s perceived \u201cdifficulty and complexity\u201d of determining the \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201cuncertain\u201d effects tax consequences may have on subsidy calculations. (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 13-14 (citing <em>Michelin Tire Corp. v. United States, </em>6 CIT 320 (1983), <em>vacated as moot per stipulation, </em>9 CIT 38 (1985)) (further citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Commerce contends it acted in accordance with law and agency practice by refusing to offset countervailable benefits by the taxes paid as a result of the benefits. First, Commerce maintains the statute identifies only certain offsets that may be deducted from gross subsidies received by a foreign producer or exporter. (Def.\u2019s Br. at 25 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6)).) Second, Commerce asserts that <em>Michelin Tire, </em>the only CIT case Fabfer cites, <em>supports </em>Commerce\u2019s position as the Court in that case rejected a claim that after-tax considerations should be included in the calculation of a subsidy. <em>(Id. </em>at 26 (quoting <em>Michelin Tire, </em>6 CIT at 328 (\u201c[S]econdary effects * * * are too uncertain to be considered a necessary part of a subsidy calculation.\u201d)).) Third, Commerce argues it has a long-standing practice of disregarding the secondary tax effects on subsides, <em>(id. </em>at 24 (citation omitted)), and stresses it has consistently refused to engage in expansive reading of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6), <em>(id. </em>at 26-27 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">3. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Domestic Producers first argue the statute provides an exclusive list of offsets and the income tax offset Fabfer seeks is not among them. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Resp. Br. at 23-24.) Second, Domestic Producers cite the preamble to the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>wherein Commerce observed it would ignore the fact that cash grants treated as revenue may be subject to income taxation. <em>(Id. </em>at 22 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,374).) Finally, Domestic Producers discuss several cases, including <em>IPSCO, Inc. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 359, 687 F. Supp. 614 (1988), in which, they argue, the Court rejected an argument that certain tax consequences were relevant to calculating net counter-vailable benefits bestowed by grant subsidies. <em>(Id. </em>at 24-25 (citing <em>IPSCO, Inc., </em>12 CIT at 367, 687 F. Supp. at 621).)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The Court sees little merit in Fabfer\u2019s argument given the clear language of the statute and this Court\u2019s previous rejection of similar arguments. To begin, Fabfer is incorrect in stating the statute is silent on the point at issue as the law provides an exclusive list of offsets that may be deducted from the amount of a gross subsidy and an offset for income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>payments is not among them. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(6).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Any doubt as to the scope of the statute is removed by considering the statute\u2019s legislative history: \u201cFor purposes of determining the net subsidy, there is subtracted from the gross subsidy <em>only the items specified in section 771 (6). The list is narrowly drawn and is all inclusive.\u201d </em>S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 86 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 381, 472 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Commerce recognized the limited scope of the offset provision in its <em>Proposed Regulations </em>wherein Commerce included one regulation substantially the same as the statutory provision and another that explicitly rejects a consideration of the secondary tax consequences of subsidy benefits. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,383 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.46(a), (b)). This Court need not undertake a detailed analysis of prior cases considering the scope of the offset provision as these cases consistently have held that Congress intended the provision to be read and applied narrowly.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s refusal to offset countervailable benefits by the taxes paid as a result of the benefits is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">III. <em>The Countervailing of Early Retirement Benefits Pursuant to the Collective Labor Conventions:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">To alleviate social hardships stemming from an economic downturn, the GOB negotiated Collective Labor Convention Number 17 of 1974 (CLC 17) with Belgian industries and labor unions. <em>Final Determination </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,276. CLC 17 instituted an early retirement plan for all Belgian workers, and established certain legal obligations for companies whose workers take early retirement. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,258. Under CLC 17, all industries were required to provide additional allowances over and above GOB unemployment benefits for certain laid-off workers. <em>Final Determination </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,276. CLC 17 further allowed \u201cnational sector\u201d industries<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> to negotiate their own collective labor conventions (CLCs) with the GOB and labor unions thereby modifying the industries\u2019 obligations under CLC 17. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,258. In its questionnaire response, the GOB explained the national sector industries enjoyed a \u201cprocedural discrimination\u201d in that those industries did not have to show economic distress to negotiate separate CLCs as did other industries. <em>(See </em>Pub. R. 82 at 50-51.) In 1978, Belgian steel companies negotiated their own CLC (the Steel CLC) in light of the massive restructuring in the industry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the large numbers of workers affected. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,276.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The Steel CLC was confirmed by the Claes Plan, a restructuring program approved later that year. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,258. The Steel CLC modified CLC 17 in three ways. First, the steel companies\u2019 obligations to pay the additional allowance under CLC 17 were reduced or eliminated via grants, loan guarantees, and the assumption of interest costs. Second, pre-pensioned steel workers received a supplemental allowance of BF 2,500 per month<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> paid by the company and reimbursed by the government. Third, the Steel CLC exempted steel companies, until 1990, from obligations to replace workers who took early retirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Commerce determined the first component of the Steel CLC conferred a countervailable benefit because it relieved steel companies of their obligation to pay the additional allowance and such relief was specific to the steel industry. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,276; <em>see also General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,258.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The second part, the supplemental allowance, generally did not confer a counter-vailable benefit, Commerce found, because the GOB created and forgave the obligation at the same time and under the same program. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,258; <em>see also Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,276. Commerce determined the third component of the Steel CLC provided a countervailable benefit to steel companies because it relieved firms, until 1990, of the obligations and costs associated with hiring and paying new workers to replace pre-pen-sioned employees, which otherwise was required under CLC 17. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,276.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Turning to the recurring/nonrecurring nature of the benefits, Commerce first determined in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>that the GOB\u2019s reimbursements to Fabfer and other steel companies for the additional allowances required under CLC 17 were nonrecurring coun-tervailable benefits. <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 57,753. Thus, Commerce allocated the grants over a 15-year period. At the same time, Commerce declared it was reexamining the three-part test it employed to distinguish recurring from nonrecurring benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 57,751.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Although the general rule is that nonrecurring benefits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>allocated over a period of time, <em>see supra </em>section two, part I, in Fabfer\u2019s case Commerce expensed the benefits accruing to Fabfer in the year of receipt because the amount of the net subsidy, 0.06%, was less than 0.50% of Fabfer\u2019s sales. <em>(See </em>Confid. R. 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce adopted a modified recurring/ nonrecurring test that the agency first employed in several final determinations issued between the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>and the <em>Final Determination </em>in this case. <em>General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,226 (citing <em>Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From France, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 6221 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1993) (final determ.) <em>(France Bismuth)). </em>In <em>France Bismuth, </em>Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">We have considered the grants * * * described below to be non-recurring * * * because the benefits are exceptional, the recipient cannot expect to receive benefits on an ongoing basis from review period to review period, and/or the provision of funds by the government must be approved every year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>France Bismuth, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223 (citation omitted), <em>quoted in General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,226. Commerce adopted this revised test in the <em>Final Determination. General Issues Appendix, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,226. Applying the test to the benefits bestowed by the Steel CLC, Commerce determined that the replacement workers benefits were recurring benefits. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,276. Commerce did not expressly determine whether other counter-vailable benefits resulting from the Steel CLC program were recurring or nonrecurring, but stated in the <em>Amended Determination </em>that the <em>Final Determination </em>had found it \u201cappropriate to treat early retirement grants as recurring.\u201d <em>Amended Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 43,750. A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">1. <em>Fabfer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Fabfer contends the GOB\u2019s assistance in paying pre-pension financing costs<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> is generally available to all Belgian industrial sectors and therefore is not specific to the steel industry. (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 15.) Reciting a previous determination on this issue, Fabfer further maintains Commerce erred in determining that -pre-pension payments to steel workers were originally the obligation of Fabfer. <em>(Id. </em>at 16-17 (discussing <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>47 Fed. Reg. at 39,309 (finding that under provisions for early retirement of certain workers, the GOB \u201cassumed responsibility for funding costs for which the company would not normally be obligated. * * * [T]his government assistance does not confer countervailable benefits to the companies because it is really assistance to the workers passed through the companies.\u201d)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Assuming arguendo Commerce was correct in finding the pre-pension financing program countervailable, Fabfer argues, the agency erred in calculating the benefit to Fabfer. <em>(Id. </em>at 17.) Fabfer alleges Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>made no findings and presented no rationale explaining why the agency deemed the additional allowance benefits recurring benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at 19.) In the <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>Fabfer argues, Commerce countervailed the additional allowances benefits as nonrecurring grants, but calculated the duty in the preliminary calculation as if the grants were recurring. <em>(Id. </em>at 18.) Fabfer contests Commerce\u2019s finding in the <em>Amended Determination </em>that \u201c[i]n the final determinations, the Department determined it appropriate to treat early retirement grants as recurring.\u201d <em>Amended Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 43,750, <em>quoted in </em>Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 18. Although Commerce found in the <em>Final Determination </em>that the replacement worker benefits were recurring, Fabfer argues, Commerce \u201cmade no such finding with regards to the second benefit [the additional allowance benefits].\u201d (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 19 (emphasis omitted).) Therefore, Fabfer contends Commerce should recalculate Fabfer\u2019s additional allowance benefits to comport with the finding in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>that these benefits are nonrecurring. <em>(Id. </em>at 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">2. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">As Defendant-Intervenors in <em>Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi, S.A. v. United States, </em>Court No. 93-09-00599-CVD, Domestic Producers claim Fabfer \u201cmischaracterizes and confuses CLC 17\u201d with the Steel CLC, which Commerce properly countervailed. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Resp. Br. at 26.) The benefits under the Steel CLC are different from other CLCs entered into by the GOB, Domestic Producers argue, as the benefits from the Steel CLC are provided selectively to the steel industry. <em>(Id. </em>at 27 (footnote omitted).) As one example of selectivity, Domestic Producers point to Commerce\u2019s verification of the Steel CLC program where Commerce found that \u201c\u2018as a concession to the steel industry, the GOB did not require steel companies to replace pre-pensioned workers until 1990. <em>In other industries, </em>companies were obliged to replace pre-pensioned workers * * <em>(Id. </em>at 27-28 (quoting Pub. R. 272 at 17).)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Domestic Producers also reject Fabfer\u2019s argument that, in light of the <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>Commerce erred in determining that pre-pension payments to steel workers were originally the obligation of Fab-fer. The 1982 investigation is not germane in the instant case, Domestic Producers argue, because it was based on different record evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at 29-30.) For example, Domestic Producers point out the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>failed even to make distinctions between the three levels of benefits as Commerce did in the <em>Final Determination </em>under review. <em>(Id. </em>at 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Turning to Fabfer\u2019s argument that Commerce must recalculate the amount of the benefits, Domestic Producers contend Commerce consistently calculated the early retirement pension grants as recurring benefits even though the agency apparently mischaracterized the benefit as nonrecurring in the <em>Preliminary Determination. (Id. </em>at 35.) The <em>Amended Determination, </em>Domestic Producers argue, corrected Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>merce\u2019s error of failing to include the proper benefits in its calculations of the CVD rate in the <em>Final Determination. (Id. </em>at 35-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">As plaintiffs in <em>Geneva Steel, </em>et al. <em>v. United States, </em>Court No. 93-09-00566-CVD, Domestic Producers claim Commerce erred by failing to set forth its rationale for treating the additional allowance benefits as recurring grants. (Domestic Producers\u2019 Br. at 73.)<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> If Commerce had applied its modified recurring/nonrecurring analysis, Domestic Producers contend, the Department should have found the benefits to be nonrecurring. <em>(Id. </em>at 74.) Domestic Producers insist there is no evidence on the record satisfying the first part of Commerce\u2019s modified analysis \u2014 a showing that Fabfer can expect to receive assistance from the GOB in meeting its obligations on an ongoing basis. <em>(Id. </em>at 75.) Indeed, even under Commerce\u2019s former analysis, which Domestic Producers argue Commerce may still consider relevant, the additional allowance benefits should be considered nonrecurring, Domestic Producers argue, because the Claes Plan was exceptional and cannot be considered longstanding. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">3. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Commerce explains the benefits from the Steel CLC are specific to the steel industry because under CLC 17, \u201conly five \u2018national industries,\u2019 including steel, were <em>per se </em>eligible to negotiate their own CLCs. * * * Other industries were not automatically eligible, but rather had to make a showing of economic \u2018distress\u2019 before the GOB would permit them to negotiate a separate CLC.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 31-32 (citingPub. R. 82 at 54).) This alone, Commerce contends, establishes the benefits from CLC 17 were <em>de jure </em>specific to the steel industry as CLC 17 \u201cprovided a benefit the availability of which was limited by the law itself.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 32 n.54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Concerning Fabfer\u2019s argument centered on the <em>1982 Final Determination, </em>Commerce argues that determination involved a different benefit accruing from the Steel CLC than that which was countervailed in the <em>Final Determination </em>under review. <em>(Id. </em>at 34.) Specifically, Commerce argues the <em>1982 Final Determination </em>did not address the benefits from the GOB\u2019s reimbursement of additional allowance costs, nor did it examine the relief from the obligation to replace pre-pensioned workers \u2014 two benefits that were countervailed in the <em>Final Determination </em>under review. <em>(Id. </em>at 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Commerce maintains it correctly calculated Fabfer\u2019s benefits under the pre-pension financing program. First, Commerce argues there is no inconsistency in finding the program benefits nonrecurring in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>and recurring in the <em>Final Determination </em>because in the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce adopted a modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of its test for determining whether a program providing grants is recurring or nonrecurring. <em>(Id. </em>at 37-39.) Further, Commerce explains that although it found the benefits nonrecurring in the <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>Commerce still expensed the benefits in the year of receipt because of the 0.50%-of-sales exception to the general rule that nonrecurring benefits are allocated over time. <em>(Id. </em>at 39.)<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Commerce contends Fabfer \u201cfails to notice that the general rule was not applied to Fabfer\u2019s grants under the Steel CLC because of the 0.5% rule\u201d and this \u201coversight explains much of Fabfer\u2019s confusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 38 n.65.) Second, Commerce explains that although it \u201cinadvertently failed to include its calculation of the financial benefit from the relief for financial obligations in the final determination, in the memorandum correcting such ministerial errors Commerce explicitly stated that \u2018[i]n the final determinations, the Department determined it appropriate to treat early retirement grants as recurring.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 40 (emphasis added in brief omitted) (quoting Confid. R. 62 at 3).) Furthermore, because Commerce expressly stated the replacement worker benefits were recurring benefits, Commerce contends, it stands to reason that other benefits from the same program should be deemed recurring as well even though Commerce failed to state as much in the <em>Final Determination. (Id. </em>at 40-41.) Absent factual distinctions, Commerce asserts, \u201cwhere two types of benefits under the same program are distributed under precisely the same circumstances* * * Commerce should not find that one was recurring while the other was non-recurring.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Commerce rejects Domestic Producers\u2019 contentions that the Steel CLC must be considered a nonrecurring program, and refutes the claim there is no evidence on the record that would lead the recipient to expect ongoing benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at 42.) Commerce argues</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">the duration of the program, the statements by the GOB about the future of the program, and the fact that the benefits under the program are provided upon retirement of each worker with no further \u25a0 approval by the government required, all indicate that a recipient of benefits under the Steel CLC can expect such benefits to continue on a continuing basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>(Id. </em>at 42-43.) Commerce also disputes Domestic Producers\u2019 assertion that the benefits are exceptional and are not longstanding. First, Commerce argues benefits under the Steel CLC are \u201cautomatic\u201d benefits and thus cannot be construed as \u201cexceptional\u201d as Commerce defines that term. <em>(Id. </em>at 43-44.) Pursuant to the Steel CLC, Commerce alleges, steel companies benefit every time a worker takes early retirement and neither the companies nor the government need take any additional action for the companies to benefit. <em>(Id. </em>at 44.) Second, Commerce maintains that although the issue of a program\u2019s duration is no longer considered particularly relevant in determining whether a benefit is recurring, duration may be relevant to demonstrate that a recipient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>may expect to continue to receive benefits on a continuing basis. In the present investigation, Commerce points out, the Steel CLC continually has provided benefits to steel companies for over thirteen years, in contrast to \u201cone-time \u2018shot-in-the-arm\u2019 programs * * * which provide all benefits at once, and which require specific government action in order to be repeated.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Court finds there is substantial evidence to support Commerce\u2019s determination that the Steel CLC program was specific to the steel industry. For example, in its response to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire, the GOB explained how a firm applied for a CLC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">No application form is used. Upon submission of a company\u2019s [CLC], the Ministry first requested confirmation from the Ministry of Economics Affairs that the company belonged to one of the national sectors (if applicable) and in the event it did, granted the requested derogations with regard to minimum age, possible reduction of the notice period, and replacement. The procedure for national sector firms was similar to the one for companies in distress, <em>except that the </em>* * * <em>former must produce evidence </em>* * * <em>in order to gain the recognition (hat the latter received automatically.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">(Pub. R. 82 at 50-51 (emphasis added).) It is readily apparent the GOB transposed \u201cformer\u201d and \u201clatter\u201d in the above text as evidenced by the following statement, which appears in the same general discussion: \u201cAs stated above, no firms or industries can be said to have received benefits, <em>except for the procedural discrimination in favor of the national-sector firms </em>* * <em>(Id. </em>at 51 (emphasis added).)<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Thus, firms in the steel sector did not have to demonstrate economic distress as a condition precedent to negotiating their own CLC. Furthermore, Commerce verified that <em>\u201cas a concession to the steel industry, </em>the GOB did not require steel companies to replace pre-pensioned workers until 1990. In other industries, companies were obliged to replace pre-pensioned workers with younger workers.\u201d (Confid. R. 41 at 17 (emphasis added).)<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support Commerce\u2019s determination that \u201ca CLC was negotiated in 1978 specifically for steel companies.\u201d <em>See Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,276. The Court holds Commerce\u2019s finding that the Steel CLC was specific to an enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The Court agrees with Fabfer and Domestic Producers, however, that Commerce has failed to provide an explanation and evidence to support the agency\u2019s finding that the additional allowance benefits were recur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ring benefits. In discussing the replacement worker benefits, Commerce explained, \u201c[w]e have determined this first type of benefit to be recurring based on the criteria outlined in the Allocation section of the General Issues Appendix.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce, however, makes no mention in the <em>Final Determination </em>whether the additional allowance benefits were recurring benefits. Although Commerce explains in <em>the Amended Determination </em>that \u201c[i]n the final determinations, the Department determined it appropriate to treat early retirement grants as recurring,\u201d <em>see Amended Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 43,750, the Court sees no discussion in the <em>Final Determination </em>of record evidence Commerce considered in determining the additional allowance benefits were recurring. Commerce admits it \u201cinadvertently failed to include a discussion of the calculation of the second type of benefit [the additional allowance benefit],\u201d but argues \u201cthe fact that the first type [the replacement worker benefit] was found to be recurring makes Commerce\u2019s determination as to the second clear.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 41.) The Court disagrees. Commerce must set forth its reasoning and the evidence it relied upon to reach its determination that the additional allowance benefits were recurring benefits. <em>See Bowen v. American Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>476 U.S. 610, 626 (1986) (\u201cIt is an axiom of administrative law that an agency\u2019s explanation of the basis for its decision must include \u2018a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Court may not entertain statements made in papers before this Court as the evidentiary basis for the Department\u2019s decision in the <em>Final Determination. See Timken Co. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 36, 39, 894 F.2d. 385, 389 (1990) (\u201c\u2018[A]gency action cannot be sustained on <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations supplied during judicial review. \u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Tabor v. Joint Bd. for Enrollment of Actuaries, </em>566 F.2d 705, 709-10 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (citation omitted)). Therefore, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s finding that the additional allowance benefits were recurring benefits is not supported by substantial evidence and is not otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the Court remands the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended for an explanation of the record evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Commerce relied upon in reaching its determination that the Government of Belgium funding of additional allowance benefits under the Steel CLC bestowed recurring benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">IV <em>The Assignment of a Country-Wide Countervailing Duty Rate to Fabfer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In each CVD investigation Commerce calculates the net subsidy provided with respect to merchandise under investigation.

In this investigation, Commerce calculated a country-wide rate for each countervailable program. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,275.

In the <em>Amended Determination, </em>however, Commerce assigned Fabfer a country-wide rate of 5.85% because Fabfer\u2019s 1.05% company-specific rate fell within five percentage points of the weighted-average net subsidy calculated on a country-wide basis. <em>(See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 19 (footnotes omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-22\">A. Contentions of the Parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-23\">1. <em>Fabfer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-24\">Fabfer contends Commerce\u2019s decision in <em>the Amended Determination </em>to assign Fabfer the country-wide rate thereby increasing its subsidy rate 557% from 1.05% to 5.85% operates as a <em>de facto </em>penalty that is inconsistent with the purpose of the CVD statute. (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 24-25.) In this context, Fabfer apparently does not contest the increase in its company-specific rate from 0.96% to 1.05% as a result of the correction of ministerial errors. Instead, Fabfer contends this small increase did little to affect the country-wide rate calculated for all three Belgian steel companies under investigation weight-averaged in proportion to each firm\u2019s share of exports because Fabfer\u2019s share of Belgian exports of cut-to-length plate was low. <em>(Id. </em>at 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-25\">Fabfer cites <em>Saha Thai Steel Pipe Co. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 727, 828 F. Supp. 57 (1993), and argues the plaintiff in that case, like Fabfer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>this investigation, fully cooperated in the investigation, was assigned a low company rate at the preliminary determination and then was assigned a higher country-wide rate in the <em>Final Determination </em>because its company-specific rate fell within the five percentage points differential. <em>(Id. </em>at 25.) In <em>Saha Thai, </em>Fabfer contends, the Court found it would be equitable for Commerce to reconsider its decision to include a firm in the country-wide rate when the country-wide rate operated as a de facto penalty against the company. (Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 14.) Fabfer argues the Court in <em>Saha Thai </em>concluded that \u201cneither the statute nor respective case law reflects a policy of punishing the country through the use of country-wide rates, \u2018regardless of incidental effects on individual [companies].\u2019\u201d (Tcf. (emphasis added in brief omitted) (quoting <em>Saha Thai, 17 </em>CIT at 738, 828 F. Supp. at 65) (bracketed material inserted to conform text to <em>Saha Thai </em>quotation).)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Additionally, Fabfer criticizes Commerce\u2019s definition of a significant differential as unfair when applied to firms with low company-specific rates.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Although Fabfer apparently recognizes the preference for country-wide rates stems from a desire to avoid placing an unwieldy burden on Commerce, (Fabfer\u2019s Br. at 22 (citing <em>Saha Thai)), </em>the \u201cjustification for applying a country-wide rate has evaporated\u201d in this case because only three companies are involved and company-specific rates already have been calculated for each, <em>(id. </em>at 26). Thus, \u201c[bjecause of the inherent unfairness in the assignment of a punitive rate, [Fabfer] should not be included in the country-wide rate.\u201d (Fabfer\u2019s Reply Br. at 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">2. <em>Commerce:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Commerce argues it acted in accordance with the statute, the regulations, and case law when it assigned Fabfer the country-wide CVD rate for cut-to-length plate. (Def. \u2019s Br. at 16.) First, Commerce notes the statutory presumption in favor of country-wide CVD rates. <em>(Id. </em>at 16-17 (footnote and citations omitted).) Commerce defends the presumption by arguing it is necessary to avoid the administrative burden of calculating and assessing company-specific rates. <em>(Id. </em>at 17-18 (citing <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>53 Fed. Reg. 52,306, 52,325 (Dep\u2019t Comm. 1988) (final rule) <em>(Countervailing Duties) </em>(codified at 19 C.F.R. Part 355) (implementing in part the provisions of Title VI of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-573, 98 Stat. 2948 (1984))).) Commerce also contends the basic purpose of the CVD statute is better served by country-wide rates as such rates properly focus the statutory regime on government. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and government-sponsored activity and not on individual companies. <em>(Id. </em>at 18 (citing <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>53 Fed. Reg. at 52,325).)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Second, Commerce argues that although the statute is silent on the measurement of a significant differential, Commerce\u2019s regulations explicitly provide the definition and that regulation is reasonable and binding on Commerce. <em>(Id. </em>at 19-20 (citing <em>Saha Thai, </em>17 CIT at 737, 828 F. Supp. at 65).) Third, despite Fabfer\u2019s claim that application of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.20(d)(3) leads to an unfair result in this instance, Commerce insists it cannot and should not engage in <em>ad hoc </em>determinations of what constitutes a significant differential. <em>(Id. </em>at 20.) To do otherwise, the agency maintains, \u201cwould consume vast resources and undoubtedly produce a patchwork of seemingly arbitrary results. \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 20 (footnote omitted).)<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">3. <em>Domestic Producers:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Domestic Producers agree with Fabfer that <em>Saha Thai </em>is instructive in this case, but point out the Court in that case refused to reverse the application of a country-wide rate \u201c\u2018even though the result may appear cruel to plaintiff.\u2019\u201d (Domestic Producers\u2019 Resp. Br. at 37 (emphasis added in brief omitted) (quoting <em>Saha Thai, </em>17 CIT at 737, 828 F. Supp. at 65).) Domestic Producers explain Commerce\u2019s broad policy for preferring country-wide rates is to ensure the CVD law \u201cis directed at discouraging government and government-sponsored activity rather than company-specific activity.\u201d. <em>(Id. </em>at 38 (citing <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>53 Fed. Reg. at 52,325).) Thus, the administrative burden relieved by erecting a preference for country-wide rates is not, Domestic Producers contend, merely the mathematical calculation of company-specific rates as Fabfer argues, but rather the \u201cmassive administrative burden of \u2018piecemeal policing of individual companies to encourage them not to use programs offered by those foreign governments.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(quoting <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>53 Fed. Reg. at 52,325).) Therefore, Domestic Producers argue, Fabfer\u2019s contention that Commerce apply a company-specific rate to Fabfer must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">B. Discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The Court agrees the statute creates a presumption in favor of applying country-wide CVD rates. The language of the statute states as much, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671e(a)(2), and case law is in accord, <em>see Ipsco, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 80, 86, 899 F.2d 1192, 1197 (1990), <em>Saha Thai Steel Pipe Co. v. United States, </em>17 CIT at 736, 828 F. Supp. at 64, and <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, </em>16 CIT at 363-64. It is also evident Congress expressly delegated to Commerce the power to define what measurement constitutes a significant differential as that term is used in the statute. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1156 at 180, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5297 (\u201cThe administering authority is expected to determine under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>what conditions company-specific rates are appropriate when one of the requirements of [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671e(a)(2)] are met.\u201d). Commerce\u2019s acted on this grant of authority by promulgating 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.20(d), which has been held reasonable and binding on Commerce. <em>See Saha Thai, </em>17 CIT at 737, 828 F. Supp. at 65 (\u201cThe Department\u2019s practice of setting the scope of the country-wide rate as including all rates within five percent [sic] is well established and reasonable.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The Court is unpersuaded by Fabfer\u2019s claim that the application of the ' significant differential and the assignment of the country-wide rate to Fabfer results in a <em>de facto </em>penalty. Notwithstanding the dicta in <em>Saha Thai </em>wherein the Court stated Commerce \u201cis urged but not ordered to reconsider its decision to include Saha Thai in the country-wide rate * * * [because] it would be equitable to restore plaintiff\u2019s [company-specific rate],\u201d <em>id., </em>17 CIT at 737, 738, 828 F. Supp. at 65, the Court finds no reading of the CVD statute or its legislative history that requires this Court to examine the equitable consequences of Commerce\u2019s application of the statute and regulations pertaining to the significant differential between country-wide and company-specific CVD rates. The statute establishes Commerce\u2019s authority to erect and apply a significant differential provision and the regulation Commerce adopted is reasonable.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Court will not foist upon Commerce the obligation to engage in <em>ad hoc </em>determinations of what constitutes a significant differential each time a respondent complains the application of the differential as reflected in the statute and regulations leads to an allegedly unfair result. To do so would not only place an onerous and perhaps unworkable burden on the agency, it would also contravene the legislative intent of the provision \u201cto lessen the administrative burden on [Commerce] stemming from implementing company-specific rates. \u201d <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1156 at 180, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5297. For the foregoingreasons, the Court holds Commerce\u2019s application of the significant differential provision to the Belgian country-wide CVD rate and Fabfer\u2019s company-specific CVD rate in this investigation is based upon substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">After considering all of the parties\u2019 arguments and the presentations made during oral argument on this matter, the Court holds with respect to Domestic Producers\u2019 and Fabfer\u2019s challenges to the <em>Final Determination </em>as amended, that all of Commerce\u2019s determinations are supported by substantial evidence on the record and are otherwise in accordance with law, except those pertaining to: (1) Commerce\u2019s use of Cockerill\u2019s and Clabecq\u2019s common shares as the \u201cnext most similar publicly traded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>equity instrument\u201d after the parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries; (2) Commerce\u2019s treatment of Sidmar\u2019s conversion of OCPCs to parts b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaries; (3) Cla-becq\u2019s debt-to-equity conversion and the use of market price as of the date of the transaction; (4) the calculation of interest rate subsidies provided to Clabecq pursuant to the 1959 Law and the Gandois Plan; (5) the redemption of Sidmar\u2019s preferred shares; and (6) Commerce\u2019s determination that the Government of Belgium funding of additional allowance benefits under the Steel CLC bestowed recurring benefits.
