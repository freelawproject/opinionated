The second count of the declaration, which was by way of amendment to the first count, contained the following allegations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201c And the plaintiff says that heretofore, to wit, on the eighth day of November, a.d. 1888, the defendant was the owner of, and had the management and control of, a certain vessel, to wit, a boat or barge named and called the Mabel Stoddard; that said vessel was then lying at a certain wharf in said Boston, to wit, at the wharf of or used by the Bay State Gas Company, so called ; that the plaintiff was then and there at work on said vessel, to wit, as a laborer, to shovel, and shovelling coal in the hold or holds of said vessel, and at discharging the cargo of coal from said vessel to said wharf; that the plaintiff was then and there in the employ of one White, a stevedore then doing the work of discharging the said cargo of said vessel; that the plaintiff, while so employed and at work on said vessel, and in the exercise of due, ordinary, and reasonable care, fell through and into a certain dangerous hole or opening in the floor or flooring of said vessel \u201d; that said hole or opening existed through the negligence of the defendant; and that the plaintiff, who was in the exercise of due care, and supposed that such floor or flooring was safe and suitable to work upon, and who had received no notice and had no knowledge of its unsafe and dangerous condition, as a result of such fall received severe personal injuries, to his great damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-3\">The defendant demurred to the above count, on the ground that it did not set forth a legal cause of action. The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and ordered judgment for the defendant ; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-4\"><em>J.

Balney, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-6\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5-\">The second'count of the declaration alleges that the defendant was \u201c the owner of, and had the management and control of, a certain vessel,\u201d on a certain day; that the plaintiff \u201c was then and there at work on said vessel ... as a laborer, . . . shovelling coal,\u201d and \u201c discharging the cargo,\u201d etc.; and that he \u201c was then and there in the employ of one White, a stevedore then doing the work of discharging the said cargo of said vessel.\u201d We are of opinion that, upon a general demurrer not pointing out any specific defect, the foregoing allegations must be taken to mean that White was doing the defendant\u2019s work, and discharging the cargo in the course of business, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that he and the plaintiff were lawfully there in pursuance of an arrangement of some kind between the defendant and White. The language quoted, taken in its natural meaning, is not equally consistent with White\u2019s being a trespasser, or with the possibility that he and the plaintiff were engaged in stealing coal. We do not construe declarations quite so adversely nowadays as indictments were construed a hundred years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The defendant does not deny that, if the declaration is read as we read it, it discloses a duty to the plaintiff. If a stevedore is employed to discharge a cargo, the laborers whom he employs are within the scope of the invitation to come upon the vessel, irrespectively of the relation of master and servant, or of privity of contract. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Harvard </em>College, 12 Allen, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">It is now settled that the St. of 1887, c. 270, does not take away the common law right of action. <em>Ryalls </em>v. <em>Mechanics\u2019 </em>Mills, 150 Mass. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"APH\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
