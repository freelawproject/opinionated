Pub. Sts. c. 187, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 25. <em>Ex parte </em>Packard, 10 Mass. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">It does not appear that any evidence was erroneously admitted, and the matter of granting a petition for review, which is in substance and effect a motion for a new trial, was within its jurisdiction. In such cases, the right of exception is very limited. The petition with the evidence supporting it having presented a proper case for the exercise of the discretion of the Superior Court, to the exercise of that discretion, no exception lies. <em>Boston </em>v. Robbins, 116 Mass. 813. <em>Dearborn </em>v. Mathes, 128 Mass. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-14\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
