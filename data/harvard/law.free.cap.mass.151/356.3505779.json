At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, the evidence as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the defendant sold intoxicating liquors in the tenement on August 3 or September 3 was conflicting; and there was no evidence as to when the case was tried in the district court other than its record, which showed that the defendant was tried and found guilty in the district court on September 18, 1889. The judge instructed the jury, that the date of such trial appeared of record, and might be considered by them if it afforded any assistance in determining the weight to be given to the conflicting testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>II.

But in case of an appeal, the record is always treated as before the appellate court, and may be referred to for the establishment of any fact of which it is the proper evidence. Oral testimony cannot be r\u00e9eeived to contradict it as to such facts; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>135 Mass. 519; and independent evidence of the time of the trial was therefore not called for. It is to be assumed that the record correctly stated the time of the trial in the district court, and, if that fact would aid the jury, it was proper to tell them what was shown in the record. We see no error in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\"><em>\u00bfExceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
