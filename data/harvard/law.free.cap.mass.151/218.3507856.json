The claimant objected to the admission of this evidence, but the judge admitted it, and the claimant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">At the close of the evidence, the claimant requested the judge to rule, among other things, \u201c that on all the evidence in the case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d The judge refused so to rule, and found for the plaintiff; and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-8\"><em>F.

As it is a well known practice for people who have deposited in their own names the full amount allowed, to open new accounts ostensibly as trustees for others, but in fact for their own benefit, evidence that the intestate had deposited the full amount allowed to his own use was admissible as offering a possible explanation of the form adopted other than the intention to make a gift. <em>Brabrook </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings </em>Bank, 104 Mass. 228. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for </em>Savings, 128 Mass. 159. <em>Northrop </em>v. Hale, 72 Maine, 275, 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">If the judge was satisfied that the money deposited did not belong to the claimant, and that the claimant was never informed of the deposit, the cases first cited show that it hardly needed the explanation of the form of deposit to allow, if not to require, him to reject the claim, and to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
