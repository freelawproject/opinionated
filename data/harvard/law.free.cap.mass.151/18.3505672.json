At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Sherman, </em>J., the defendant set up, among other defences, that certain devices for opening and fastening the ventilators were, under the agreement between the parties, to be made and furnished to the satisfaction of the architect supervising the construction of the building. The plaintiff testified that he went to the architect\u2019s office before the agreement was made, but denied that the openers and fasteners in question were to be made to the architect\u2019s satisfaction or subject to his approval. Thereupon the defendant asked him, upon cross-examination, to state what the architect said to him in relation to the fasteners. The judge, upon the plaintiff\u2019s objecting, excluded the question. Subsequently, after the defendant had offered evidence as to what the architect had said to the plaintiff during that interview, the plaintiff again testified in rebuttal, and the defendant was permitted to cross-examine him in relation to the architect\u2019s statements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the ruling excluding the question put by him to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-10\"><em>M.

On the contrary, this had been distinctly denied by the plaintiff. The declarations of the architect were, therefore, properly excluded as incompetent until some evidence was offered to show that the fasteners and openers were to be made to his satisfaction. Without such evidence his declarations were simply those of a third person. If this were otherwise, as the order of the trial in the admission of evidence is in the discretion of the presiding judge, and as at a subsequent time, after evidence had been offered tending to show' that the fasteners and openers were to be made to the satisfaction of the architect, the defendant had ample opportunity, of which he 'availed himself, to cross-examine the plaintiff on this subject, it is not easy to see how he could have any ground of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
