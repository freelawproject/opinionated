A police officer, a witness for the government, was allowed to be asked, against the defendant\u2019s objection, what he had seen in the defendant\u2019s tenement on January 5, and replied that he saw through the window the defendant\u2019s wife pouring beer into the sink in the defendant\u2019s presence. The officer was also asked, against the defendant\u2019s* objection, what he had seen there before January 5, and he replied, that two weeks before, as he approached the defendant\u2019s tenement, he saw three men leave the house of the defendant and jump over a fence in the rear of the house; and that a week before January 12 seven men were in the defendant\u2019s tenement, none of whom lived or boarded there. There was no evidence of any sale to these seven men, or of their drinking or being intoxicated. The judge instructed the jury, that the evidence of what was seen by the witness on January 5, and before that date, and the fact of the seven men being in the defendant\u2019s tenement, was competent evidence for the government, and might be considered by them in finding their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>A.

It does not appear that the government relied alone upon this evidence to secure a conviction, but the contrary. Evidence of the possession and disposition by the defendant and his wife of liquors there a few days prior to the day when the offence of unlawfully exposing and keeping for sale intoxicating liquors was charged, of the fact that men were seen to escape from the house at the approach of an officer a short time before, and that a large number of men who were neither residents nor boarders were seen there a week previous, was proper to be considered in connection with such other evidence as was offered in the case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>138 Mass. 493. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>138 Mass. 500. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>140 Mass. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
