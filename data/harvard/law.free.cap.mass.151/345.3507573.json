The judge refused so to rule, but instructed the jury, in substance, that if they should find that a false representation with reference to the quantity of the carpeting was made by the defendant to the intestate with a view to induce him to make the purchase, which representation was known by the defendant to be false, and was relied upon by the intestate as one of the inducements to make the purchase, and if the intestate was in the exercise of due care, and thus relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>upon it, they would be justified in returning a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-6\"><em>O. JR. </em>Elder, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-7\"><em>8. J. </em>Thomas, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-8\">Keowltos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3q\">The carpets bought by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate covered four floors, consisting of twelve rooms, besides the hall and stairs, in a dwelling-house. The number of yards of material contained in' them was an important element in determining their value, which might be the subject of a fraudulent representation. The representation of the defendant was not a mere estimate, but a statement purporting to be made as of her own knowledge; and there was evidence tending to show that it was known by her to be false. There was also evidence that the purchaser relied upon it; and if the testimony introduced by the plaintiff was true, the defendant was liable for fraud, unless the purchaser was bound to measure the carpets for himself, or to avail himself of his other opportunities of ascertaining the quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Upon the evidence presented, it could not properly have been ruled, as matter of law, that the facts were so obvious or so easily discoverable that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had no right to rely on the defendant\u2019s representations. In this Commonwealth, and in other American States, in regard to representations by a vendor in a sale of land, it has been held that, in the absence of other fraud, a vendee to whom boundaries are pointed out has no right to rely on the vendor\u2019s statements as to quantity, but if he deems the quantity material, he should ascertain it for himself. <em>Gordon </em>v. Parmelee, 2 Allen, 212. <em>Noble </em>v. Googins, 99 Mass. 231, and cases cited. <em>Parker </em>v. Moulton, 114 Mass. 99. We are of opinion that this rule should not be extended so as to include a case like the present, and that the instructions under which the questions were submitted to the jury were correct and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
