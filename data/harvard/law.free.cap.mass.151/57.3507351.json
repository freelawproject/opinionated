The government then offered to introduce evidence that on the same day the officers searched a house fifty feet distant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>from the defendant\u2019s, belonging to one Rattigan, a brother-in-law of the defendant; that three jugs of whiskey were there found; that the officers on different occasions during the tim\u00e9 alleged, while the defendant was sitting on the piazza of his house, had seen the defendant\u2019s wife and sons going from his house to that of Rattigan, and returning to the defendant\u2019s house carrying with them a can similar in appearance to that found on the premises in question; that on one occasion they saw the defendant's wife carrying from Rattigan\u2019s house a bag containing what resembled in form a jug.

As bearing upon this question, all the evidence indicating that sales were made in his house was competent, together with the facts that Rattigan was his brother-in-law; that Rattigan\u2019s house was only fifty feet away ; that three jugs were found there, containing the same kind of liquor as that of which a small quantity was found in the defendant\u2019s house ; that there was a little whiskey in the can in the defendant\u2019s house; that at different times the defendant\u2019s wife and sons had been seen carrying such a can from Rattigan\u2019s house to the defendant\u2019s house; that the defendant\u2019s wife had been seen at one time carrying there a bag containing what resembled in form a jug; and that these things were done within the observation of the defendant. We are of opinion that the evidence was competent, in connection with the other circumstances of the case. The weight of it was for the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>116 Mass. 27. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kahlmeyer, </em>124 Mass. 822. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCullow, </em>140 Mass. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
