My entire estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, of which I die possessed, or which I may own at the time of my decease, I will and bequeath to Daniel V. Folts and Julius C. Folts, my trustees hereinafter named, for the benefit of my three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>children, Margaret Almira Beard, George Webb Woollard, and Mary Elizabeth Holmes, or their heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">\u201c Item III. I hereby authorize and empower my said trustees to sell all my estate at public auction, and give proper deeds to all purchasers of such real estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">The will was duly admitted to probate, and the trustees appointed under it subsequently sold the demanded premises in due form, and conveyed them to the demandant. The tenant was the husband of the testator\u2019s daughter, Margaret A. Beard, named in the will, who died before the testator, and he claimed title to the demanded premises through his wife and their children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">The tenant asked the judge to rule that no valid trust was created by the will, and that the sale and deed to the demand-ant were of no force. The judge refused so to rule, and found for the demandant; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-8\"><em>J.

The demandant claims title under a sale in due form by trustees having an express power to sell under the will of one who died seised of the premises. The only ground on which the validity of the sale is denied is that the trust is invalid. It is enough for us to say that we perceive no ground for doubting that the trust is valid. The trust is of the testator\u2019s \u201c entire estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, . . . for the benefit of my three children [naming them] or their heirs.\u201d There is no uncertainty, in the sense of <em>Olliffe </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>130 Mass. 221, cited for the tenant, although there might be a doubt as to the proper construction which it is not necessary for us to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">In some cases, especially of devises of land, \u201cor\u201d has been read \u201c and,\u201d so as to make \u201c heirs \u201d a word of limitation. <em>Read </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>2 Atk. 642, 645. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Ves. Sen. 409. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Collyer, 416, 423. <em>Lachlan </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Hare, 796, 798. <em>Greenway </em>v. <em>Greenway, </em>2 DeG., F. &amp; J. 128, 139. <em>Adshead </em>v. <em>Willetts, </em>29 Beav. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">A more likely construction, since words of inheritance are not now necessary in order to carry the absolute interest, is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201c or \u201d makes a substituted gift, as is provided by the Pub. Sts. c. 127, \u00a7 23, in case either of the testator\u2019s children should die before him, and as has been held in England with regard to gifts of personalty or of real and personal estate together. <em>Grittings </em>v. M'Dermott, 2 Myl. &amp; K. 69, 75. <em>Wingfield </em>v. <em>Wingfield, </em>9 Ch. D. 658. <em>Keay </em>v. Boulton, 25 Ch. D. 212. See <em>Hall </em>v. Hall, 140 Mass. 267, 270. Probably the time of substitution is the testator\u2019s death, so that any child who survived him took an absolute title. <em>Montagu </em>v. Nucella, 1 Russ. 165, 170, 171. <em>Salisbury </em>v. Petty, 3 Hare, 86, 93. <em>Whitcher </em>v. Penley, 9 Beav. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We do not suppose that the counsel for the tenant meant seriously to suggest that a trust estate in fee simple is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
