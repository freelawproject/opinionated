After mature deliberation, I have decided to ask you to give me the sum of two thousand ($2,000) dollars a year during my life; the same to date from June 1, 1886, and to be paid to me in instalments as I may desire, by your faithful attorney, the Hon. George S. Hale, or whomever he may designate, and in acknowledgment of this favor I will bind myself to remain with you during your life, and in every way minister to your comfort and happiness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>as I have tried most faithfully to do during the last four years. If this is satisfactory to you, will you kindly affix your name to this compact, and greatly oblige, Yours most loyally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">The plaintiff further offered to prove that the testator, a few days after the date of the above letter, affixed his name to it and returned it to her; that she told him she would not leave him, but would attend to him during his life, and in fact did so until his death, on September 13, 1887; that while she continued to live with him, both before and after the agreement in question, regular monthly payments were made to her for her services and attendance, for which she gave him receipts; and that after his death she had made a demand upon the defendants for payment, under the agreement set out in the letter, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">The defendants contended that, even if the writing was to be considered as a valid contract, duly executed by the testator and binding upon him and his executors, yet, upon the true construction thereof, the plaintiff could recover thereon only for the period from June 1,1886, to the date of the testator\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\">The judge, at the request of both parties, reported the case-for the consideration of the full court. If the agreement was. to be construed in accordance with the defendants\u2019 contention, judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiff for her services during that period only; otherwise, the case was to stand for-trial upon issues raised by the pleadings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ada\"><em>iS.

The only question is, whether the words used import such a promise. The plaintiff\u2019s letter proposed that the intestate should promise \u201c to give me [the plaintiff] the sum of two thousand ($2,000) dollars a year during my life,\u201d from June 1,1886,\u2014 about a year after her letter. The testator assented to the proposition. The meaning of the words thus adopted by the testator is sufficiently plain, and is not cut down by the reference to \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>subject of my salary,\u201d or by the suggestion that the money be paid by the testator\u2019s attorney. As the case is to be tried upon other issues, we refrain from further discussion, beyond saying that the facts stated disclose no reason for a different construction from the one we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">\n<em>Case to stand for trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
