It appears that the petitioner has obtained in the Superior Court a judgment against the respondent in an action at law; that this judgment remains unsatisfied; and that the respondent, who is a woman, intends to come within the Commonwealth, and, after remaining a few days, to depart from it. The complaint of the petitioner is, that the statutes which prescribe the proceedings which can be taken against the person of a woman, in order to compel her to satisfy an execution issued on a judgment at law, do not afford an adequate remedy; and he asks that the chancery writ of <em>ne exeat </em>may is\u00a7ue, that she may be arrested and compelled to give bail or security that she will pay the judgment. See Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6-17. The statutes must be considered as providing the only remedies which the Legislature intended that a plaintiff should have to enforce an execution at law against the person of a woman, and the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>has never been issued in aid of legal, as distinguished from equitable process, or for the purpose of obtaining security from a defendant in an action at law. 2 Dan.
