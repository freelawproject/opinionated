The writ, which was dated August 5, 1887, commanded the sheriff \u201cto attach the goods aud estate of George C. Osgood, administrator estate of Josiah Webber deceased,\u201d and to summon him to answer to the plaintiff in an action of contract. The declaration was entitled \u201c Jerome F. Manning <em>vs. </em>Geoi\u2019ge C. Osgood, administrator of the estate of Josiah Webber deceased,\u201d and averred that the defendant owed the plaintiff eight hundred dollars \u201c for work, labor, and services performed by the plaintiff for the defendant, and at his request, and for expenses incurred and paid according to the account hereto annexed. And the plaintiff further says, he is entitled to the said sum of eight hundred dollars by virtue of the laws, practices, and usages of the District of Columbia, where the. contract between the plaintiff and defendant was performed.\u201d The account annexed was made up of items for services rendered by the plaintiff, and for expenses incurred by him, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>prosecution of a claim before the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Mason, J., there was evidence that the plaintiff, an attorney at law, was employed by one Deshon, acting for himself and Josiah Webber and others, joint owners of certain vessels and cargoes, to prosecute a claim for war premiums paid by them for insurance thereon during the late civil war; that afterwards, on January 2, 1883, the plaintiff filed a petition on behalf of such joint owners, signed by Deshon, in the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, for the recovery of such premiums, and praying for judgment for each of them in separate sums, including a considerable sum in the name of \u201c George C. Osgood, administrator of the estate of Josiah Webber deceased\u201d; that afterwards, in accordance with the requirement of that court that each claimant should file a separate petition therein, an amendment to the original petition was prepared and filed by the plaintiff, and signed by the defendant, on or about May 12, 1883, which amendment set forth, in the concluding paragraph, the defendant\u2019s appointment as such administrator, his post-office address, \u201cand that his attorney in this case is Jerome F. Manning\u201d; that subsequently the plaintiff performed services for the defendant in the prosecution of the claim; and that on June 29, 1883, an award was made for substantially the sum asked for in the petition, and paid over to the defendant for the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">After the evidence was all in, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that the plaintiff contended that the defendant was only liable in his individual capacity, and that the words \u201c administrator \u201d and \u201cadministrator of the\u201d estate of Josiah Webber deceased, used in the writ and declaration, were only <em>descriptio persona; </em>and asked the court to rule that the action could without any amendment be maintained against the defendant in his individual capacity. The judge so ruled, and found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the above ruling and finding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-7\"><em>J. E. Abbott, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>J. E.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9ba\">The writ on its face is a writ of summons and attachment against the defendant personally. The order is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to attach the goods and estate of the intestate in the hands of the defendant as administrator, but to attach the goods and estate of George G. Osgood, administrator. Unless there is something to control the apparent meaning of the words, this cannot be taken as a writ against the estate of the intestate, which would authorize the taking of it on attachment. The defendant is described by the addition of administrator, but the writ does not in terms order the attachment of his goods as administrator. There is nothing in the record which can control the apparent meaning of the writ. The same addition to the defendant\u2019s name is made in the title to the declaration as in the writ. The declaration is that the defendant owes for services performed \u201c by the plaintiff for the defendant, and at his request, . . . according to the account hereto annexed,\u201d and for money to which the plaintiff is entitled by the laws of the place \u201c where the contract between the plaintiff and defendant was performed,\u201d setting up a cause of action against the defendant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Yarrington </em>v. Robinson, 141 Mass. 450, the writ ordered an attachment of the goods and estate of several defendants, described as administrators, but the declaration was that the defendants as administrators, etc., owed the plaintiff according to the account annexed, and the account was against the estate of the deceased. The court say, \u201c The court could not properly rule that the words in the writ and declaration designating the defendants, \u2018 as they are administrators . . . deceased,\u2019 were surplusage, because they characterize the action as one against the estate, and not against the defendants personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In the case at bar, after the evidence was all in tending to show a cause of action against the defendant personally, and not against the estate of the deceased, the plaintiff contended that the words administrator, etc., were only <em>descriptio personae, </em>and the court ruled that the action could without any amendment be maintained against the defendant in his individual capacity. We think that the ruling was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The evidence was clearly sufficient to authorize the finding of the court that the defendant was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
