(hereafter appellant or the minor) contends that the court committed reversible error when it conducted a portion of the jurisdiction hearing in his absence. We hold that the juvenile court properly found that appellant had voluntarily absented himself from the proceedings and that no error occurred when the court continued to conduct the hearing although appellant was not present. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The details of the underlying offenses are not relevant to the published portion of this opinion. Briefly, the salient facts are these. About 9 p.m. on August 19, 1982, a citizen approached Officer Wilson at the Monterey County Fairgrounds and told him that appellant \u201c \u2018just tried to sell [him] some cocaine.\u2019 \u201d As officers approached appellant, age 16, and his companion, the latter two walked very fast, and Officer Wilson observed appellant place or stuff something inside the front of his pants. A later search revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>a plastic bag containing seven bindles in appellant\u2019s underwear and $150 cash on his person. This incident formed the basis of a petition filed September 2, 1982, alleging that appellant had possessed cocaine for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The incident which gave rise to a second petition alleging that appellant had committed an assault with a deadly weapon occurred on September 19, 1982. Appellant stopped a car which he was driving and accused the victim, who was driving another vehicle, of having hit his (appellant\u2019s) car. Within moments appellant pulled a knife and inflicted a wound so severe that the victim\u2019s intestines were observed hanging out of his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">II. <em>Discussion</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The question whether a juvenile court may properly proceed with a jurisdiction hearing where the minor has voluntarily absented himself or herself appears to be one of first impression in this state. The following facts raise the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Petitions alleging that appellant came within Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 because of possession of cocaine for sale and assault with a deadly weapon were filed on September 2 and 28, 1982. On October 8, 1982, appellant admitted possession of cocaine, and the court dismissed the charge of possession for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The jurisdiction hearing on the assault petition began on November 3, 1982, with the minor, his mother, his attorney, and all other interested parties and counsel present. Three witnesses testified for the petitioner (the district attorney), including the victim and the only witness who saw appellant draw his knife and plunge it into the victim\u2019s body. After their testimony both attorneys and the court agreed to continue the hearing to November 5, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">On November 5, appellant failed to appear, and the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. The district attorney stated that he only wanted to put the knife and its case into evidence, but that he did not know \u201cif I can technically move at this time to do it when [the minor is] not here.\u201d The court replied, \u201cWell, let\u2019s wait.\u201d The proceedings were continued to an indefinite time.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The minor appeared in court on December 13, 1982. He indicated that he had fled because he was afraid of being committed to the Youth Authority or to prison for something he did not do. The court reassured him that he would have a fair trial, and appellant stated he now understood that, having talked to his mother and having realized his mistake. He asked that he be released to his mother,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the court ordered that he be detained, and it continued the hearing to December 22, 1982, at which time the matter was continued to January 5, 1983, due to lack of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On January 3, 1983, a petition was filed alleging that appellant had escaped from juvenile hall on or about Christmas Day, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">When court convened on January 5, appellant\u2019s counsel suggested that the matter be continued two weeks, \u201cand then if Sidney\u2019s not here, if the court wishes, we could proceed with what witnesses we have.\u201d On January 26, appellant was still absent, and his attorney suggested that the district attorney present his last witness, \u201cso he doesn\u2019t have to keep coming back. \u201d The minor\u2019s counsel continued, \u201cI have one witness here. Two other people were supposed to be here, [\u00b6] But I prefer to leave the warrant out until Sidney\u2019s picked up, and then finish the rest of it. I know of no provision in the Welfare and Institutions Code for willful absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The petitioner\u2019s last witness, Officer Madarang, then testified that he had seen appellant about two hours after the stabbing incident and that appellant had a cut on his thumb covered with a hospital-type bandage. Cross-examination revealed that the witness had seen blood on the victim\u2019s knife sheath. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>On redirect he testified to having seen a discoloration on the paint of the car appellant was driving. On recross appellant\u2019s counsel elicited the fact that a prosecution witness had been unable to identify appellant from a photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then called the only witness whom he had present, appellant\u2019s sister, who had taken him to the hospital for treatment of his cut thumb. The court asked appellant\u2019s counsel why his other witnesses were not present, to which counsel replied that he did not know, but that each had returned to court up to three times previously. The district attorney indicated that \u201c. . . we\u2019ve got to get the trial over with sometime.\u201d It was agreed that the matter would be continued a few weeks, giving appellant\u2019s counsel the opportunity to gather his witnesses, and hopefully the authorities time to pick up appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On February 16, 1983, the matter was continued to February 18. At the opening of proceedings on the latter day, the court observed, \u201cThis is the matter of Sidney M . . ., and we\u2019ve continued it over and over and over again.\u201d The minor\u2019s counsel then presented three witnesses. The first was one of the passengers in appellant\u2019s car, who testified that the victim appeared to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The second was appellant\u2019s mother, who also testified to one of petitioner\u2019s witnesses (apparently the victim) having been intoxicated on the evening of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Finally, a 15-year-old acquaintance of appellant testified that he saw the victim come at appellant with a knife during the incident in question. He said that when the victim dropped the knife, appellant gained possession of it and stabbed the victim in defending himself against further attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">After this testimony appellant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cThe only witness I have left, Your Honor, is Sidney, and he\u2019s necessary.\u201d The court indicated its willingness to give counsel \u201ca little more time to have Sidney here.\u201d The court and both attorneys briefly discussed whether Penal Code section 1043 (proceeding with trial where defendant voluntarily absent) applies to juvenile proceedings, and the court continued the matter for one month.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">On March 30, 1983, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the matter should not proceed even if appellant was willfully absent, but stated that he was prepared to argue the case if the court so desired. After extensive argument the court made its jurisdictional finding that appellant had committed the assault as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Appellant was returned to court on the bench warrant on July 11, 1983. He was advised of his rights relating to the January 3 (escape) petition, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the matter was continued. On July 15, the minor admitted the escape and was referred for psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On July 27, 1983, court convened to hear appellant\u2019s motion to reopen the jurisdiction hearing. Counsel conceded that appellant\u2019s absence was \u201chis [own] fault,\u201d but argued that he must be given an opportunity to testify and, again, that Penal Code section 1043 is inapplicable to juvenile proceedings. The district attorney\u2019s office was unprepared to argue the motion to reopen due to alleged lack of notice. The court said it was inclined to find that the minor should have an opportunity to testify, but that it would grant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At this point appellant\u2019s attorney interjected, \u201cSpeaking to Sidney, just now, he knows he\u2019s been convicted of other charges, and he knows he\u2019s going to be sentenced on those. At this point, except perhaps as part of sentencing him, he would like to mention his version of the facts, and I think he wishes to proceed.\u201d Everyone then agreed to proceed with disposition of the case. After a recess during which the minor and counsel reviewed the probation report, the court asked appellant if he had anything he wanted to add to it. The minor declined. After hearing argument from both sides, the court ordered that appellant continue as a ward of the juvenile court and that he be committed to the California Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Appellant contends that the juvenile court committed prejudicial error when it conducted a significant portion of the jurisdiction hearing in his absence. The Attorney General counters that the trial court properly relied on Penal Code section 1043 in ruling that the proceedings could continue because of appellant\u2019s voluntary absence. We hold that section 1043 is inapplicable to juvenile proceedings, but that no error occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Section 679 of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides in relevant part: \u201cA minor who is the subject of a juvenile court hearing ... is entitled to be present at such hearing. . . .\u201d No provision in that code establishes exceptions or qualifications to this right.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   California Rules of Court, rule 1351(c), which deals with the time limit for holding the jurisdiction hearing, seems to imply that the jurisdiction hearing should be suspended in the minor\u2019s absence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, this rule relates to the right to \u201cspeedy trial\u201d and clearly was not intended to address the right to be present at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>proceedings. Furthermore, the rule has no firm basis in the Juvenile Court Law, but was established by analogy to the criminal speedy trial statute. (Advisory Committee com. to rule 1351(c), 23 West\u2019s Ann. Code, Civ. &amp; Crim. Rules (1981 ed.) pt. 2, p. 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">It might be argued (though the Attorney General has not done so) that the juvenile court properly proceeded in appellant\u2019s absence under Code of Civil Procedure section 594, which provides that a party in superior or municipal court may bring an issue to trial or hearing in the absence of the adverse party, with certain provisos. We think, however, that the section does not apply here for three reasons. First, by its terms the section applies to superior, municipal, and justice courts, not to juvenile courts. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 245.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, had the Legislature intended this provision of the Code of Civil Procedure to apply as an exception to the rule established in Welfare and Institutions Code section 679, it would have expressly so provided. (See, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 678 [incorporating the provisions of Code Civ. Proc. regarding variance and amendment of pleadings].) And third, while it is true that the Welfare and Institutions Code provides that juvenile court proceedings shall not be deemed criminal proceedings (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 203 [former \u00a7 503]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>), and in the past it has been said they are \u201ccivil in nature\u201d (e.g., <em>In re Johnson </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 37, 39 [38 Cal.Rptr. 405]), in the wake of <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], the validity of this viewpoint is highly questionable.  It is now settled that \u201c[\u00a1juveniles are entitled to the fundamental protection of the Bill of Rights in proceedings that may result in confinement or other sanctions, whether the state labels these proceedings \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Richard M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 370, 375 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428].)  Now it may reasonably be said that proceedings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 are \u201cbasically criminal in nature.\u201d <em>(In re Joseph T. </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 120, 126 [101 Cal.Rptr. 606].) We therefore deem it inappropriate for this court to establish a rule applying the Code of Civil Procedure provision under consideration to juvenile court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">On the other hand, neither do we find persuasive the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that Penal Code section 1043 applies. That section provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the defendant in a felony case shall be personally present at the trial. [\u00b6] (b) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>absence of the defendant in a felony case after the trial has commenced in his presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to, and including, the return of the verdict in any of the following cases: [f] . . . [1] (2) Any prosecution for an offense which is not punishable by death in which the defendant is voluntarily absent. . . .\u201d It is apparent from the language of the statute that the Legislature did not intend that it apply to juvenile court proceedings. The use of the words \u201cdefendant,\u201d \u201cfelony case,\u201d \u201ctrial,\u201d \u201cprosecution,\u201d and \u201cpunishable\u201d preclude such application. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 203 [former \u00a7 503]; <em>In re David G. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 247, 252 [155 Cal.Rptr. 500] [Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5 inapplicable to juvenile court proceedings]; and see, e.g., <em>In re Mitchell P. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 946, 949 [151 Cal.Rptr. 330, 587 P.2d 1144] [Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111 (sufficiency of accomplice testimony for \u201cconviction\u201d) inapplicable to juvenile court proceedings]; <em>In re Joseph H. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 627, 631 [159 Cal.Rptr. 681] [Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118 (motion for acquittal after waiver of jury) inapplicable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">It does not follow, however, that a jurisdiction hearing which was begun in the juvenile\u2019s presence cannot continue when he or she voluntarily absents himself or herself.  While it is certainly true that a minor subjected to the juvenile court system is entitled to fundamental due process and fairness (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702.5; <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. 1; <em>In re Aaron N. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 931, 941 [139 Cal.Rptr. 258], and cases cited therein), it is equally settled beyond question that a minor may be capable of knowingly and intelligently waiving his or her rights <em>(e.g., In re Charles P. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 768, 771 [184 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>In re Robert H. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 894, 899 [144 Cal.Rptr. 565]), including the right to a jurisdiction hearing. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 657; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1351(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"> Accordingly, we hold that a minor who is the subject of a juvenile court hearing and who has a right, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 679, to be present at that hearing, may properly be found to have waived that right if the juvenile court finds a knowing and intelligent waiver, considering the minor\u2019s age and other relevant circumstances, including intelligence, education, experience, and ability to comprehend the meaning and effect of his or her acts. (See <em>In re Charles P., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 768; <em>In re Robert H., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 894, 899; <em>State in re Schreuder </em>(Utah 1982) 649 P.2d 19, 23; see also <em>N. P. A. </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1979) 604 P.2d 599.) Stated another way, Welfare and Institutions Code section 679 simply requires that the state not do anything that would preclude the minor from being present and that if the minor is voluntarily absent, thereafter he or she cannot complain of the situation thus created; the minor cannot take advantage of his or her own wrong and stop the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>hearing simply by walking out. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 44, 52 [95 Cal.Rptr. 576].)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">When we apply this rule to the facts of the case at bench, which we set out in detail above, it is readily apparent that the court did not err. Appellant, age 16, appears to be within the normal range of intelligence and education. He had extensive experience with the juvenile court system and clearly understood that he had a right to be present throughout the jurisdiction hearing as well as what the consequences of that hearing might be. Ample evidence supported the juvenile court\u2019s finding that appellant was voluntarily absent and that the hearing should proceed without him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Furthermore, we are persuaded by analogy to the Penal Code section 1043 situation that even if a violation of the minor\u2019s right to be present occurred, it would not per se require reversal. Rather the question would be one of whether his substantial rights were prejudiced. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 196, 200 [140 P.2d 461].) Here there is no question that they were not, first because no crucial witness testified in his absence, and second because after his return he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to reopen the proceedings and testify in his own behalf. (See generally Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1983 supp.) Trial, \u00a7 388, pp. 642-643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">White, P. J., and Anderson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 21, 1984, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 31, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-12\"> Our discussion of other issues raised by appellant does not merit publication.

That\u2019s why you left?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">\u201cThe Minor: Yes, because, see, I knew I was going to get in trouble for something that I\u2019m not even guilty of.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, but, see, that\u2019s what scares everyone is you have a right to a trial on this thing.
