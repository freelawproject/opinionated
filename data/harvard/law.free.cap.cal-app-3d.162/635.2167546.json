(Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. 1; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352.) On appeal he contends the trial court erroneously denied his motions seeking to suppress evidence seized pursuant to several search warrants (\u00a7\u00a7 1538.5-1540) and attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Abbott and his brother-in-law Mark Mead were involved in a cocaine distribution business. Between November 3, 1981, and December 29, 1981, law enforcement officers surveilled a women\u2019s clothing store, the Jealous Ear Boutique. Several times they saw Abbott and Mead together at the boutique. The two usually arrived in the early evening, after normal business hours. On four occasions the officers saw Abbott arrive between 5:30 and 6 p.m.; he stayed approximately 45 minutes and carried a black shoulder bag into and out of the boutique. Mead carried a similar bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The officers also noticed an unusual pattern to the boutique\u2019s clientele. The traffic was five times greater in the evening than in the day. The daytime customers were predominantly female while at night they were primarily male.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The officers obtained search warrants for the Jealous Ear Boutique as well as Mead\u2019s person, car and residence. They served these warrants on January 21, 1982, and recovered 1,523 grams of cocaine and a ledger book from Mead\u2019s car. At trial Glenn Foreman testified entries in the book reflected monies he owed to Mark Mead for cocaine he had purchased from him at the Jealous Ear Boutique between April 1981 and February 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">An officer recovered a locksmith\u2019s business card from Mead\u2019s pocket with a lock combination written on one side. Later that day the locksmith told the officers he had, in the presence of Mead, changed a floor safe\u2019s combination at Abbott Magnetics on January 21, 1982, and gave Mead the business card.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">And to complete the day\u2019s activities, Foreman received, presumably before Mead\u2019s arrest, a quantity of cocaine from Mead. Foreman was to pay him later.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The next day the officers served a search warrant on Abbott\u2019s place of business, Abbott Magnetics. The officers seized a sport bag containing cocaine from a safe. There was also a note inside the bag, near the cocaine, which said, \u201cThis is what Roger has been getting.\u201d Through expert testimony the prosecution established the handwriting on the note was Mead\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The officers obtained a search warrant for Abbott\u2019s residence. They served it on January 26, 1982, and recovered a ledger from the filter compartment of a vacuum cleaner found in the garage. One of the investigators testified as an expert that entries in the two ledgers signified \u201cRoger\u201d was purchasing cocaine from \u201cMark\u201d and then reselling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Between January 21, 1982, and February 9, 1982, Glenn Foreman met with law enforcement officers investigating Mead and Abbott. Foreman arranged with Mead to meet again so he could pay Mead for the January 21 quantity of cocaine and purchase more cocaine. This transaction was culminated on February 9, 1982, and Mead was again arrested. Officers took $1,200 from him in recorded money they had earlier given Foreman to consummate the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">III<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Abbott urges the locksmith\u2019s revelation of the location of the safe to law enforcement officers without a search warrant violated his constitutional right to privacy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He argues this violation invalidates the Abbott Mag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>netics warrant and, in turn, taints the warrant for his residence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Three California Supreme Court cases guide us in resolving this issue\u2014 <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 98 [201 Cal.Rptr. 628, 679 P.2d 62]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 640 [159 Cal.Rptr. 818, 602 P.2d 738]; and <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 238 [118 Cal.Rptr. 166, 529 P.2d 590]. In <em>Burrows, </em>the Supreme Court held a bank depositor has a reasonable expectation a bank will maintain the confidentiality of the depositor\u2019s records. As a general rule, such papers cannot be provided to law enforcement officers without the aid of legal process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Blair </em>the court recognized a similar expectation of privacy in the records of charges by a credit card holder and in a list of telephone calls made from a hotel room.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence these records could not be secured without legal process. <em>Blair </em>primarily relies on <em>Burrows. </em>(See also <em>People </em>v. <em>McKunes </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 487 [124 Cal.Rptr. 126].) In <em>Chapman </em>the Supreme Court held law enforcement officers could not obtain a telephone subscriber\u2019s unlisted name, address and telephone number from company records without the aid of legal process. <em>Chapman, </em>in turn, primarily relies on <em>Burrows </em>and <em>Blair.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The rationale behind recognizing a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the sort of information at issue in <em>Burrows, Blair </em>and <em>Chapman </em>is encapsuled in this passage from <em>Burrows-. </em>\u201cThe underlying dilemma in this and related cases is that the bank, a detached and disinterested entity, relinquished the records voluntarily. But that circumstance should not be crucial. For all practical purposes, the disclosure by individuals or business firms of their financial affairs to a bank is not entirely volitional, since it is impossible to participate in the economic life of contemporary society without maintaining a bank account. In the course of such dealings, a depositor reveals many aspects of his personal affairs, opinions, habits and associations. Indeed, the totality of bank records provides a virtual current biography. While we are concerned in the present case only with bank statements, the logical extension of the contention that the bank\u2019s ownership of records permits free access to them by any police officer extends far beyond such statements to checks, savings, bonds, loan applications, loan guarantees, and all papers which the customer has supplied to the bank to facilitate the conduct of his financial affairs upon the reasonable assumption that the information would remain confidential. To permit a police officer access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>these records merely upon his request, without any judicial control as to relevancy or other traditional requirements of legal process, and to allow the evidence to be used in any subsequent criminal prosecution against a defendant, opens the door to a vast and unlimited range of very real abuses of police power.\u201d <em>(Burrows </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal. 3d 238, 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In <em>Blair </em>the court noted \u201c[n]o less than a bank statement, the charges made on a credit card may provide \u2018a virtual current biography\u2019 of an individual. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blair, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 640, 652.) The <em>Chapman </em>opinion does the same. \u201cIn many cases, [the government] is seeking the name and address of a person in order to provide an essential link to establish a \u2018virtual current biography.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, protection of the individual\u2019s name and address is the only way to protect the \u2018virtual current biography.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 98, 110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Certain general principles guide our resolution of Abbott\u2019s contention. \u201c[T]he standard for determining what is an illegal search is whether defendant\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy was violated by unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Triggs </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 884, 891 [104 Cal.Rptr. 408, 506 P.2d 232], disapproved on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Lilienthal </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 891, 896 [150 Cal.Rptr. 910, 587 P.2d 706].) \u201cWhat constitutes a \u2018reasonable\u2019 expectation of privacy depends on the circumstances . . . <em>(In re Deborah C. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 125, 137 [177 Cal.Rptr. 852, 635 P.2d 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Abbott argues the location of a safe for security reasons carries a high expectation of privacy. As a general proposition, this is true. We would not expect a locksmith to routinely give information about the location of a safe or related matters to the general public.  But \u201c[t]he privacy one may reasonably expect can depend, of course, on the identity of the intruder or the purpose or intensity of the intrusion. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 138, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The concerns expressed in <em>Burrows </em>and its progeny are not present here. Abbott and Mead\u2019s use of a locksmith was entirely volitional in the sense that term is used in <em>Burrows. </em>Retaining a locksmith\u2019s services is certainly not a prerequisite to participating in contemporary society. Dealing with a locksmith, one does not \u201creveal . . . many aspects of his [or her] personal affairs, opinions, habits and associations.\u201d We cannot conclude the location of a safe has anything to do with providing government a \u201cvirtual current biography.\u201d Nor do we envision revealing such information opening \u201cthe door to a vast and unlimited range of very real abuses of police power.\u201d The information is of an entirely different character emanating from a different <em>type </em>of source than that involved in <em>Burrows, Blair </em>and <em>Chapman. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 241, 245 [130 Cal.Rptr. 656]; <em>People </em>v. Cain (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 687, 694 [93 Cal.Rptr. 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The locksmith was a <em>witness </em>in a criminal investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Witnesses often receive information from a suspect or observe events which the suspect expects to be held in the strictest confidence. But, as the United States Supreme Court has said, \u201cNeither this Court nor any member of it has ever expressed the view the Fourth Amendment protects a wrongdoer\u2019s misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.\u201d <em>(Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 293, 302 [17 L.Ed.2d 374, 382, 87 S.Ct. 408]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mastin </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 978, 987 [171 Cal.Rptr. 780]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Metzger </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 338, 343 [99 Cal.Rptr. 264].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The same reasoning applies here to article I, section 13 of our state Constitution. Although the information did not directly concern \u201cwrongdoing\u201d confided to the locksmith, it was relevant to a criminal investigation. Abbott in essence evinces a misplaced belief the locksmith would never reveal the information, at least without legal process. But this belief does not by its mere existence give rise to a cognizable constitutional protection.  \u201cLaw enforcement officials make a search within the purview of constitutional prohibitions only when they jeopardize <em>an individual\u2019s </em>expectation of privacy that <em>society has recognized as justified. </em>\u201d <em>(In re Deborah C., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 125, 135, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Society is not prepared to recognize an expectation of privacy in the location of a safe when law enforcement properly seeks the information during the course of an investigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Were we to hold otherwise, the permissible scope of warrantless criminal investigation would be unreasonably hampered by malefactors\u2019 desire to keep virtually every aspect of their illegal enterprises out of government view. There was no proscription against confirming the location of the safe from the locksmith, a knowledgeable witness. <em>Burrows, Blair </em>and <em>Chapman </em>do not apply under these circumstances. The search warrants did not rely on illegally seized evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The doctrine of inevitable discovery (see <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 431 [81 L.Ed.2d 377, 104 S.Ct. 2501]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Tunch) </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 665 [145 Cal.Rptr. 795]) has application here, although our resolution of Abbott\u2019s primary contention means we are not compelled to resort to this doctrine. The officers <em>had </em>the combination to the safe without the aid of the locksmith. They also had probable cause to believe the safe contained evidence concerning a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The combination came from Mark Mead\u2019s pocket when he was arrested with a large quantity of the drug. Abbott Magnetics was <em>one </em>of the locations which had come to the officers\u2019 attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The officers merely wanted to confirm the safe\u2019s location. The locksmith\u2019s testimony indicates the officers asked if the safe was located at Abbott Magnetics and he told them it was. He was able to pinpoint the location of the safe to permit the officers to obtain a search warrant specifically for Abbott Magnetics rather than <em>several </em>locations for which they had probable cause to believe a safe with evidence of the conspiracy might be located. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 323, 331-332 [182 Cal.Rptr. 430].) The officers had probable cause to search Abbott\u2019s business without the locksmith\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Wallin, Acting P. J., and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 14, 1985. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 635.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\">This section is certified for publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Abbott relies on the constitutional right to privacy recognized in California Constitution, article I, section 1, which provides: \u201cAll people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.\u201d However, the applicable cases, as we discuss <em>post, </em>rely on California Constitution, article I, section 13, which provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be violated; and a warrant may not issue except on probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.\u201d We too analyze whether the law enforcement activity in the present case constituted an unreasonable search and seizure inasmuch as it was accomplished without a warrant. We are not persuaded the right to privacy cases Abbott cites (see <em>Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977]; <em>Dompeling </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 798 [173 Cal.Rptr. 38]) apply in the present context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We note, in passing, the United States Supreme Court finds no protectable Fourth Amendment interest in such records. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Payner </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 727 [65 L.Ed.2d 468, 100 S.Ct. 2439].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">As <em>Blair </em>itself notes <em>(id., </em>at p. 654), the United States Supreme Court also takes a different view on the expectation of privacy in telephone records. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 735 [61 L.Ed.2d 220, 99 S.Ct. 2577].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In fact, he was a witness at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The law enforcement officers here were not on a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d They lawfully possessed the combination to the safe and already suspected the safe was in one of the locations discovered during the surveillance. The locksmith merely <em>confirmed </em>the location of the safe upon inquiry by one of the officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> Abbott also makes much of the fact the officers represented to the locksmith they already had a search warrant for the safe when this was not the case. Assuming, arguendo, the officers made such a representation, this does not change the result. The locksmith\u2019s testimony reveals it is doubtful, at best, any such statement <em>forced </em>him to give information he would not otherwise have given. Rather, he indicated it was the authority of the officers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>which he was responding. In addition, the determinative issue is whether the officers had a right to the information the locksmith had without a warrant, not the method used to extract the information. Abbott has cited no case applying any sanction in this context for any misstatement, innocent or malicious, assuming there was one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 635.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
