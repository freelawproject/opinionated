Shoemaker Co. (\u201cShoemaker\u201d), the lowest bidder. Appellant contends that the Shoemaker bid should have been rejected because it was untimely submitted and because it did not fully conform to the bidding specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">After a careful review of the reeord and the arguments presented, we affirm the agency\u2019s decision to award the contract to the lowest bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">According to the notice to bid, the bids had to be received at the New Jersey Transit (\u201cNJT\u201d) Office on or before 3:00 p.m. on the designated day. The notice further provided that \u201cbids received after the designated time will be considered late and not accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">At 3:00 p.m. that day, NJT had received three bids, including the appellant\u2019s bid. A NJT representative asked if there were any other bids in the room for delivery and then announced that the time to receive bids was closed. As the representative began to open the first bid, an administrative assistant on the NJT staff appeared in the doorway of the room with three persons. Each of the three persons represented an additional bidder. The assistant said that the three bidders had been sent by the security guard in the lobby to the wrong desk on the sixth floor and that they had arrived at that wrong location before 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">After consulting with the Deputy Attorney General representing NJT, the representative decided to accept the three bids. He said that they would be accepted because each of the bidder\u2019s representatives had been in the building before 3:00 p.m. and had been misdirected by the security guard to the wrong receiving location on the sixth floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The six bids were opened and read. Shoemaker\u2019s bid at $38,-816,947 was lowest. Appellant\u2019s bid at $39,690,900 was the second lowest. Shoemaker was awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">NJT is an instrumentality of the State. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-11. Purchases, contracts or agreements of NJT are made or awarded only after public advertisement for bids in the manner set forth in the New Jersey Public Transportation Act of 1979. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-11(a); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-2; <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:25-11; Local Public Contracts Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:11-21; <em>D\u2019Annunzio Bros. v. Transit Corp., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 531, 586 A.2d 301 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Awards should be made \u201cto the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be the most advantageous to the State, price and other factors considered.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:25-ll(e). A contract involving a governmental instrumentality such as NJT \u201cmust be let only after the broadest opportunity for public bidding is given in order to secure competition, and guard against favoritism, improvidence, extravagance and corruption.\u201d <em>D\u2019Annunzio Bros., supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 532, 586 A.2d 301; <em>see also George Harms Const. v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth. </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>8, 36, 644 A.2d 76 (1994) (the underlying operation and policy of the local public contracts law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>48:11-1 to -49, regarding competitive bidding is identical to that of the law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:23-6.1(a), which governs contracts and agreements by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">NJT may accept bids containing \u201cminor informalities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-11(e); <em>see also Terminal Construction Corp. v. Atlantic County Sewerage Authority, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>403, 411, 341 A.2d 327 (1975) (material conditions contained in bidding specifications may not be waived; however, minor or inconsequential discrepancies and technical omissions may be waived). In determining whether a defect may be waived, two factors are considered: (1) whether the effect of the waiver would be to deprive the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>body of its assurance that the contract will be entered into, performed and guaranteed according to its specified requirements; and (2) whether it is of such a nature that its waiver would adversely affect competitive bidding by placing a bidder in a position of advantage over other bidders or by otherwise undermining the necessary common standard of competition. <em>See Meadowbrook Carting Co. v. Borough of Island Heights, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>307, 315, 650 A.2d 748 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Also to be considered is the <em>prima facie </em>presumption that the power and discretion of the government has been properly exercised. <em>Miller v. Passaic Valley Water Commission, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 14, 611 A.2d 128 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>601, 617 A.2d 1222 (1992). However, this consideration must be balanced with the duty of the courts to be vigilant against the ever present risk of favoritism, improvidence, extravagance and corruption. <em>See Terminal Construction Corp., supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 341 A.2d 327; <em>Hillside Township v. Sternin, 25 N.J. </em>317, 322, 136 A.2d 265 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Applying these factors, we find that the brief delay in the submission of the Shoemaker bid under the circumstances here is not a material violation of public bidding law and procedures. Admittedly, the untimely submission was a technical violation. The regulations regarding NJT procurement procedures require that bids be submitted so as to be received in the office designated in the Invitation for Bids not later than the exact time set for opening of bids. <em>N.J.AC. </em>16:72-2.7. Further, the regulation provides that bids not received prior to or at the time designated for formal bid opening shall not be considered and shall be returned to the bidder unopened. <em>N.J AC. </em>16:72-2.10. Additionally, the regulations require that \u201c[t]o be considered for award, a bid must comply in all material respects with the Invitation for Bids so that, both as to the method and timeliness of submission ... all bidders may stand on an equal footing and the integrity of the formal advertising system may be maintained.\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>16:72-2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>However, the regulations also authorize NJT to waive certain non-conformities in a bid proposal. <em>N.J.AC. </em>16:72-2.17 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">(a) NJ TRANSIT reserves the right to waive any minor informalities or irregularities in a bid not in compliance with the specifications, terms and conditions of the Invitation for Bids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">1. A minor informality or irregularity is one which is merely a matter of form or is some immaterial variation from the exact requirements of the Invitation for Bids, having no effect on quality, quantity or delivery of the supplies or performance of work being procured, and the correction or waiver of which would not affect the relative standing of, or be otherwise prejudicial to, other bidders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">2. NJ TRANSIT may give the bidder the opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid, or may waive any such deficiency where it is to the advantage of NJ TRANSIT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Furthermore, award of a contract to a late bidder has been approved in two of our decisions. <em>William M. Young &amp; Co. v. West Orange Redevelopment Agency, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 444-45, 311 A.2d 390 (App.Div.1973) (bidder was held up by incl\u00e9ment weather; the court found no disadvantage to the other bidders); <em>Kingston Bituminous Products Co. v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth., </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 36, 192 A.2d 836 (App.Div.1963) (a delay in opening the bids caused by a bidder being held up in traffic).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In <em>Young, </em>we said that there was no indication of fraud .or collusion and that the delay was a minor irregularity which was \u201cproperly waived by the agency under its inherent discretionary power ancillary to its duty to secure, through competitive bidding, the lowest responsible offer.\u201d <em>William M. Young &amp; Co., supra, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 444-45, 311 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Here, as in <em>Young, </em>we find no suggestion of fraud or collusion nor significant disadvantage to any of the other bidders. The delay was very short. The other bids had not been opened and read. The delay was not intentional or for the purpose of obtaining any competitive advantage. NJT properly exercised its discretion by waiving this minor deviation in order to protect the public interest in obtaining the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Appellant argues that in two respects the Shoemaker bid is non-conforming or non-responsive. The first is the failure of Shoemaker to initial a cross-out in its lump sum bid price for one item. Shoemaker bid zero dollars for that item. Next to the bid was a number which had been crossed out. NJT\u2019s pre-award general provisions required that each erasure or other change be initialed by the person signing the bid. Another provision required that the person signing the bid proposal be an authorized officer of the corporation. <em>N.J.AC. </em>16:72-2.16 provides that \u201c[p]rice changes in bids shall be initialed by the vendor and the price submitted to NJ Transit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">NJT concluded that this was a \u201cminor waivable deficiency.\u201d In its letter rejecting appellant\u2019s objection to the award of the contract, NJT stated \u201c[t]he speculation of [appellant] that Shoemaker could have used this lapse to disclaim its bid is just that\u2014 speculation. Shoemaker could not successfully do so since NJ Transit would not permit it to rely upon such an inconsequential defect in its bid.\u201d NJT also informed appellant in the letter that despite the failure of Shoemaker to initial the bid change, it was \u201cabsolutely clear to NJT what is the bidder\u2019s intention.\u201d We agree that the cross-out was a minor deficiency which could be waived. No purpose would be served in rejecting this low bid for such a picayune reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that the bidder\u2019s zero dollar bid for the item is equivalent to no bid at all and that this makes the entire bid unbalanced. Under the pre-award general provisions, a proposal that contains prices that are obviously unbalanced will be considered irregular and may be rejected; also, where no figure is provided by the bidder, the bid will be considered to be non-conforming and shall be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">An unbalanced bid is one \u201cbased on nominal prices for some work and enhanced prices for other work;\u201d <em>Frank Stamato &amp; Co. v. City of New Brunswick, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 344, 90 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>34 (App.Div.1952). However, a \u201creasonable unbalancing is perfectly proper.\u201d <em>Riverland Construction Co. v. Lombardo Contracting Co., </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 47, 380 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>522, 388 A.2d 626 (1978). Thus, the submission of an unbalanced bid standing alone does not invalidate the bid. <em>Frank Stamato &amp; Co., supra, </em>20 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 344, 90 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The submission of a zero bid is similar to that of a nominal \u201cpenny\u201d bid. A nominal bid is not \u201cinherently evil or destructive of fair and competitive bidding.\u201d <em>Riverland Construction Co., supra, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 46, 380 A.2d 1161. \u201cEvery contractor may apply his own business judgment in the preparation of a public bid, and his willingness to perform one of the items for a nominal amount is but his judgmental decision in an effort to underbid his competitors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 380 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">As we stated in <em>Riverland:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">[ i ]n the absence of a factual showing that such a decision subverts the principles of fair and competitive bidding there is no reason to invalidate the resulting bid. The pejorative connotation of the phrase \u2018unbalanced bid\u2019 comes into play only when the nominal bid on one item is unbalanced because of an excessive bid on other items, or because of other elements pointing to fraud, collusion, unfair restriction of competition or other substantial irregularity. Reasonable unbalancing is perfectly proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\"><em>[Ibid..; of. Hall v. N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Authority, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>629, 685 A.2d 983 (App.Div.1996) (A nominal or no charge bid is not the same as no bid at all and the latter may be a material deviation).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Here, the Transit Authority concluded that there was no proof of collusion or fraudulent conduct on the part of the bidder or the procuring agency nor was there proof of any other substantial irregularity affecting fair and competitive bidding. Accordingly, the authority concluded, and we agree, that this objection is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In sum, the deficiencies and irregularities were minor and therefore waivable, especially where, as here, there is no evidence of fraud, favoritism, corruption or any improper competitive advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
