The issues raised in Point II of defendant\u2019s main brief and in Points I, II and III of defendant\u2019s supplemental pro se brief are entirely without merit and do not warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">The issues raised in Point I of defendant\u2019s brief and in Point IV of his supplemental pro se brief are the same: that the trial judge gave a faulty jury instruction on accomplice liability which violated the principles established in <em>State v. Bielkiewicz, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 632 A.2d 277 (App.Div.1993), thus requiring reversal. This issue requires some discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">The relevant facts of the case are essentially as follows: The State presented evidence that the murder arose out of an alterca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tion between Robert Lee Dodson, a/k/a \u201cSilk,\u201d and the victim, Jeffrey Glanton, a/k/a \u201cNewark,\u201d on East Hanover Street in Trenton. Shinnette Williams, Harriette Stephens and Terrence Darnell Williams witnessed this event. Dodson apparently thought that Glanton stole drugs and money from Dodson\u2019s girlfriend. Dodson struck. Glanton with an aluminum baseball bat. Glanton grabbed the bat as it slipped out of Dodson\u2019s hands and then hit Dodson in the leg with it. Dodson limped around the corner and placed a call from a pay phone and asked Terrence Williams to call \u201cBones\u201d (Tyrone Williams) and tell him to \u201cget over here\u201d because he .and Glanton were fighting. Tyrone Williams said he would be over in ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Tyrone Williams soon appeared carrying a blue bag and asked where Glanton was. Stephens then pointed him in Glanton\u2019s direction, at which time Tyrone Williams walked up to Glanton and hit him with his fist. At this point, a blue Hyundai drove up and the occupants, four black men, jumped out at the same time and ambushed Glanton. These men, each armed with handguns, used the guns to beat Glanton. One of the assailants was identified as defendant. Witnesses said Glanton was essentially defenseless and th\u00e1t his head was split \u201cwide open\u201d and was \u201cpulsating\u201d with blood \u201cbubbling\u201d at the top \u201clike his head was about to explode.\u201d During the beating, one of the hand guns discharged, apparently accidentally. This, in turn, caught the attention of Trenton Police Officers Maldonado and Medina who were on routine patrol. The assailants continued to beat Glanton until they saw the police car. The assailants then scattered in different directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Defendant and Rory Bryson walked \u201cvery quickly\u201d toward the unoccupied blue Hyundai. Both \u201cappeared to be very nervous.\u201d Defendant had a gun in his left hand which was pointed at the ground. Officer Maldonado informed his partner that defendant was armed and both officers alighted from their car. Officer Maldonado grabbed Bryson before he could enter the Hyundai. Bryson was in possession of an operable, unloaded Smith &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Wesson .357 Magnum. Defendant opened the passenger side door of the Hyundai, tossed a gun (a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson) inside, and fled with Officer Medina in pursuit. Officer Medina caught defendant and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Glanton died after surgery at Saint Francis Medical Center. The autopsy disclosed that the cause of death was \u201cextensive fractures of the skull, lacerations of the brain due to blunt trauma to the head.\u201d The injuries to the skull included severed fractures at the top as well as a \u201cgaping hole\u201d and a \u201cdeep scalp laceration\u201d at the base of the skull. .In the opinion of the medical examiner, such injuries would have required \u201cinnumerable blows\u201d of \u201cmassive force.\u201d A forensic examination disclosed human blood on the gun which defendant discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Defendant testified that he met with Bryson, Tyrone Williams, and Robert Williams to discuss a report that Dodson had been in a fight. They decided to investigate the matter and \u201cscare the guy up.\u201d When Tyrone Williams left his mother\u2019s house, he brought a blue bag to the car that Bryson was driving. Just before stopping at East State Street to pick up Dodson, Tyrone Williams handed out guns from the blue bag, commenting on whether or not each gun was loaded. He then handed one to defendant, telling him to give it to Dodson, who was about to get into the back seat with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">According to defendant, while Tyrone Williams walked to East Hanover Street, the others proceeded there in the car. Dodson directed Tyrone Williams to Glanton, who was standing in the street. Because defendant recognized Glanton as someone he had known since childhood and regarded him as his \u201cuncle,\u201d defendant told the others that they were \u201crelated\u201d and that they should not \u201cmess with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Defendant claimed that he remained in the back seat of the Hyundai, when the others got out. The initial altercation was between Tyrone Williams and Glanton. The others soon joined the fight, striking Glanton on the head and shoulders with the guns. Dodson\u2019s gun discharged. When the police arrived, Bryson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>and Tyrone Williams ran back to the Hyundai, threw their guns inside, and told defendant to run. Defendant states that he ran to East State Street and was arrested outside of Dodson\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Defendant testified that until he recognized Glanton, his only intention was \u201cto scare the guy up.\u201d Prior to the attack on Glanton, defendant stated that he was unaware of anyone else\u2019s intention to kill or injure Glanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Defendant now argues for the first time that the accomplice charge given by the judge was erroneous. In light of his failure to object to the instruction, any error in it should be disregarded by us unless it was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 341, 605 A.2d 230 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The State concedes that the jury was \u201cnot specifically instructed that in a homicide prosecution, even though the principal had committed purposeful or knowing murder, the accomplice [can] be found guilty of a lesser offense involving recklessness (i.e., aggravated or reckless manslaughter) if he intended that an assault be committed upon the victim but did not share the principal\u2019s intent that the assault cause death or serious bodily injury.\u201d It is thus unnecessary to set forth the trial judge\u2019s instruction in detail. It falls to us to determine whether, on the facts of the ease, the trial judge\u2019s omission could have led the jury astray. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on <em>State v. Bielkiewicz, supra. </em>In that case, the victim, a tow truck driver was removing unauthorized ears from a restaurant parking lot. As a result, an altercation with Jermaine Pitts ensued. The victim was winning the fight when Bielkiewicz and another person came to Pitts\u2019 assistance. The victim ran and Pitts shot him in the back. We held, that on those facts, it was plain error not to explain to the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>[ I ]t could find one defendant guilty of murder as a principal and the other defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter or assault as an accomplice. Indeed, the court implied the contrary when it told the jury that \u201cone cannot be held as an accomplice unless you find as a fact that he shared the same purpose required to be proven against the person who actually committed the act.\u201d [Bielkiewicz, <em>supra, 267 N.J.Super. </em>at 531, 632 A.2d 277 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In <em>Bielkiewicz, </em>the jury, as here, had questions regarding accomplice liability. The judge in <em>Bielkiewicz, </em>like this judge, gave a supplemental instruction in response to the jury\u2019s question. However, both the instruction in <em>Bielkiewicz </em>and in this ease omitted telling the jury that it could find the principal guilty of murder and the accomplice guilty of a lesser offense. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 632 A.2d 277. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">The court did <em>not </em>inform the jury that it could conclude, in accordance with <em>Bridges, </em>that even though the principal had committed purposeful or knowing murder, the accomplice could be found guilty of a lesser offense involving recklessness if he intended that an assault be committed upon [the victim] but did not share the principal\u2019s intent that that assault cause death or serious bodily injury. <em>[Id. </em>at 533, 632 A.2d <em>277 </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The difference between this case and <em>Bielkiewicz </em>is that the evidence in that ease could have supported a finding that defendant Bielkiewicz did not share Pitts\u2019 homicidal state of mind. A jury could reasonably have concluded from his actions that Bielkiewicz was intent on inflicting bodily injury on the victim to help Pitts win the fight, but that he did not share Pitts\u2019 intent to cause death or serious bodily injury. That is not the case here. The parties presented the jury with two scenarios. The first was the state\u2019s version that defendant himself participated in the vicious beating of the victim which caused the death. The second was that defendant remained in the car and did not participate at all in the crime. Neither of those versions warranted a <em>Bielkiewicz </em>charge, the former because defendant\u2019s culpability was as a principal; the latter because defendant was not guilty of a crime at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Defense counsel suggests that the jury could have pieced together a third scenario and that that scenario compelled a <em>Bielkiewicz </em>instruction. The defense posits that a jury could conclude that defendant participated in the beating with the intention to \u201cscare the victim up\u201d and not to kill him, based on defendant\u2019s statement (albeit out of context) to that effect. The problem with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>this suggestion is two fold: first there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever from which a jury, once having identified defendant as an actual participant in the beating of Glanton, could differentiate between his culpability and that of the other perpetrators of this crime. For example, defendant was not hitting the victim with his fists while the others were using steel weapons, nor was he hanging back while the others were enthusiastically striking the victim with their guns. He did what they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Second, and more important, a defendant\u2019s state of mind at the inception of a criminal act is subject to change. Thus, even if defendant began beating Glanton with the intention of scaring him, his continued striking of Glanton\u2019s skull, which was split open and pulsating with blood therefore evidencing catastrophic injury, revealed nothing less than an intention to cause him serious bodily injury or death. In short, on the evidence presented, once having rejected defendant\u2019s claim of non-complicity, that jury could not have concluded that defendant had the mental state for a lesser crime than that of the other participants. As such, the trial judge\u2019s instruction was not erroneous under <em>Bielkiewicz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> Co-defendant, Rory Bryson, was convicted of being an accomplice to first degree purposeful or knowing murder and for unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit. He was sentenced to a life term with thirty-years of parole ineligibility on the murder and to a concurrent five-year custodial term on the weapons offense. We upheld his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Rory Keith Bryson, </em>A-5887-92T4, decided January 13, 1995. Bryson's petition for certification to the Supreme Court was denied on March 14, 1995. <em>State v. Bryson, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 <em>A.2d </em>300 (1995). Co-defendant, Robert Dodson, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to serve an aggregate term of 30 years with a 15 year mandatory minimum. Co-defendant, Robert Williams, also pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to serve an aggregate term of 25 years with a 12 and 1/2 year mandatory minimum. The disposition of co-defendant, Tyrone Williams, is unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
