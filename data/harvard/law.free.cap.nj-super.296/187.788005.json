By a notice of motion filed December 11, 1995, defendants moved \u201cfor an order awarding counsel fees and costs pursuant to <em>N.J.SA. </em>2A:15-59.1, the New Jersey Frivolous Claims Act.\u201d After oral argument of the motion, the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">It is clear to this Court by reading the [allegedly defamatory] article as written on September 23rd, 1994 [that] someone trained in the law would recognize that that article was not slanderous, that it was an expression of a First Amendment right involving a public issue by parties who have been involved in a public issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">It is also clear to the Court that, Mr. Czura, you filed that complaint in a manner which was frivolous because you were trying to put these people off....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Nevertheless, based upon the time that has elapsed between that filing of the motion for summary judgment granted by this Court and the application now made, I think that it would not be appropriate at this time to allow fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">An order dated January 18, 1996 was entered in accordance with this ruling denying counsel fees and costs \u201cas being untimely.\u201d Defendants have appealed. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1, the Frivolous Litigation Statute, does not state explicitly whether attorneys\u2019 fees can be awarded on an application filed after the entry of a final judgment. The statute mentions timing of the application only in subsections a(l) and a(2). Both references condition eligibility for the award of fees on a judicial determination made \u201cat any time during the proceedings or upon judgment____\u201d The reference to \u201cupon judgment,\u201d rather than, for example, upon or after judgment, suggests that the fee application may not properly be delayed until substantially after the time when judgment is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><em>R. </em>1:4-8 in its present form, which became effective September 1, 1996, prescribes the current motion procedure applicable to fee applications under the statute. The occasion for the adoption of the rule was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McKeown-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, 626 A.2d 425 (1993), which restricted the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1 to instances in which the parties themselves, and not their lawyers, were factually responsible for frivolous claims or defenses. However, <em>R. </em>1:4-8 as amended governs the procedure for fee applications both against parties under the statute and against lawyers under the rule. <em>See R. </em>l:4-8(b)(3) and -8(f); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>1:4-8 (1996). <em>R. </em>l:4-8(b)(2) expressly fixes the time for filing fee applications to which it is applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">Time for Filing; Attorney\u2019s Fees. A motion for sanctions shall be filed with the court prior to the entry of final judgment, notwithstanding the provisions of any other rule of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Applications filed prior to September 1, 1996, like the one at issue here, were governed by the procedure which <em>R. </em>4:42-9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>prescribes for \u201call eases where counsel fees are permitted by statute.\u201d <em>See R. </em>4:42\u20149(a)(8). <em>R. </em>4:42-9(d), \u201cProhibiting Separate Orders for Allowances of Fees,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">An allowance of fees made on the determination of a matter shall be included in the judgment or order stating the determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The necessary implication of <em>R. </em>4:42-9(d) is that an application for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees in a case governed by that rule has to be presented before the entry of the final judgment or, possibly, at the latest, within ten days thereafter by a motion to alter or amend the judgment. <em>See R. </em>4:49-2; <em>cf. Brennan v. Brennan, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 358, 454 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1982); <em>Ramirez v. County of Hudson, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 458-59, 404 A.2d 1271 (Ch.Div.1979). In this respect, the procedure under <em>R. </em>4:42-9 is consistent with the procedure under <em>R. </em>1:4-8. Since defendants in the present case did not make their application for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1 within the prescribed time period, their application was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
