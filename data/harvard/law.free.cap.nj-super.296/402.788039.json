The organization is essentially an advocacy organization for the disabled whose members have an interest in the accessibility of places of public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Plaintiff notified defendant that its motel in Fort Lee, New Jersey, violated laws governing accessibility for the disabled. When remedial action was not forthcoming, plaintiff instituted this action seeking remediation, counsel fees, and costs. Plaintiff alleged that defendant\u2019s motel had not been constructed, altered, or modified to be accessible to persons with disabilities in that the entrance barred access by wheelchair users, there was an absence of parking for the disabled, an absence of an accessible room and other architectural barriers. In the First Count of the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>plaintiff charged that defendant\u2019s failure to render its motel premises accessible to persons with disabilities violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>New Jersey Handicapped Access Law (HAL), <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:32-4, and regulations of the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code, specifically the Barrier Free Design Code (BFDC), <em>N.J AC. </em>5:23-7. In the Second Count, plaintiff charged that defendant\u2019s failure to render the motel premises accessible to persons with disabilities violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 12181 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">After issue was joined, plaintiff and defendant entered into a stipulation of partial dismissal in which defendant agreed to undertake certain remedial measures sought by plaintiff which were readily achievable within the meaning of 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 12181. Plaintiff agreed to dismiss with prejudice and without costs and counsel fees all of the state claims under the First Count. Defendant did not agree that plaintiff was entitled to counsel fees and costs with respect to the ADA claims under the Second Count and the parties, therefore, agreed to submit that issue to the court. The precise terms of the stipulation are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">1. The Defendant shall, on or before October 1, 1996, cause one of its motel rooms to be rendered wheelchair accessible by altering it to comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines adopted pursuant to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">2. The Defendant shall, on or before August 1, 1996, provide two designated handicapped parking spaces, including one with a sixteen foot width, sized and signed in conformance with the ADA and applicable state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">3. The Defendant shall, on or before August 1,1996, provide an accessible route of travel from the designated parking spaces to the Defendant\u2019s motel office and ground floor, guest rooms. The route of travel shall conform with Title III of the ADA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">4. The Defendant will, on or before August 1, 1996, equip one motel room with a text telephone and visual alarms for the hearing impaired in conformance with Title III of the ADA provided the cost does not exceed $250.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">5. As to Plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to an award of counsel fees and costs, the Parties have reached no agreement. They will seek to negotiate their differences and, failing agreement, shall submit those issues to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>6. Plaintiff dismisses all state law claims, with prejudice and without costs, and without fees, as set forth in Count I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">7. Defendant stipulates that the alterations agreed to herein are \u201creadily achievable\u201d within the meaning of Title III of the ADA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">At the conclusion of the counsel fee hearing, Judge Lawrence B. Smith in the Law Division held that plaintiff had standing to maintain the ADA action and awarded plaintiff counsel fees of $4,000 and costs of $366.20 for a total of $4,366.20. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Defendant seeks a reversal of the judgment awarding plaintiff counsel fees and costs, contending that plaintiff lacks standing to commence a private action under Title III of the ADA. Defendant argues that plaintiff was not \u201ca person aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the ADA and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it suffered no injury in fact and failed to comply with the administrative prerequisites to a suit under the ADA and the Civil Rights Act. We disagree and affirm. We have carefully considered the record and arguments presented and are satisfied the trial court properly held that plaintiff had standing to maintain this action against defendant under the ADA and that plaintiff was entitled to counsel fees and costs under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">We turn first to the critical issue of whether plaintiff has standing to maintain an action under the ADA. Standing refers to the plaintiffs ability or entitlement to maintain an action before the court. <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>57, 67, 411 A.2d 168 (1980); <em>Al Walker, Inc. v. Borough of Stanhope, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>657, 660, 130 A.2d 372 (1957). Courts will not entertain matters in which plaintiffs do not have sufficient legal standing. <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>10, 34, 355 A.2d 647, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>922, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>319, 50 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 289 (1976); <em>Al Walker, Inc. v. Borough of Stanhope, supra, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>at 660, 130 A.2d 372. In order to possess standing, the plaintiff must have a sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation, a real adverseness with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>subject matter, and there must be a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will suffer harm in the event of an unfavorable decision. <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 411 A.2d 168; <em>Crescent Pk. Tenants Ass\u2019n v.

Further, the relationship of plaintiffs to the subject matter of the litigation and to other parties must be such to generate confidence in the ability of the judicial process to get to the truth of the matter and in the integrity and soundness of the final adjudication. Also, the standing doctrine serves to fulfill the paramount judicial responsibility of a court to seek just and expeditious determinations on the ultimate merits of deserving controversies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\"><em>[New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 69, 411 A.2d 168.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Though the concept of standing is clear when viewed in isolation, it is unclear exactly how the concept relates to jurisdiction, justiciability, and real party in interest. Our Supreme Court, in <em>Watkins v. Resorts Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>398, 424, 591 A.2d 592 (1991), stated that standing is \u201ca threshold justiciability requirement [which] must be determined before a court may proceed to consider the substantive merits of the case.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">Standing is ... a threshold issue. It neither depends on nor determines the merits of a plaintiffs claim. Standing, like jurisdiction, involves a threshold determination of the court\u2019s power to hear the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">Although a dismissal for lack of standing may involve considerations similar to those involved in a dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, the two types of dismissals are distinct. Standing involves \u201climits on the exercise of ... jurisdiction.\u201d A dismissal for lack of standing, like one for lack of jurisdiction, amounts to a refusal by the court to resolve the matter. A dismissal for failure to state a claim, on the other hand, occurs only after the court has agreed to resolve the controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 417-18, 591 A.2d 592 (citations omitted) (second omission in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYG\">In <em>Gilbert v. Gladden, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>275, 280-81, 432 A.2d 1351 (1981), the Court stated that subject-matter jurisdiction and justiciability must be distinguished from each other and analyzed separately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>[T]he justiciability inquiry must be distinguished from the issue of whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists. The latter question involves merely a threshold determination as to whether the Court is legally authorized to decide the question presented. If the answer to this question is in the negative, consideration of the cause is \u201cwholly and immediately foreclosed.\u201d See <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 <em>U.S. </em>186, 198, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>691, [700], 7 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 663, 674 (1962). In respect of justiciability, however, the inquiry proceeds beyond the threshold determination \u201cto the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>[Id,.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Clearly, subject-matter jurisdiction and justiciability are both threshold issues, that is, issues which must be addressed before considering the substantive merits of the matter. Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to \u201cthe power of a court to hear and determine cases of the class to which the proceeding in question belongs. It solely rests upon the court\u2019s having been granted such power by the <em>Constitution </em>or by valid legislation, and cannot be vested by agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>State v. Osborn, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>117, 122, 160 A.2d 42 (1960). Justiciability refers to whether a matter is appropriate for judicial review. Because standing affects whether a matter is appropriate for judicial review rather than whether the court has the power to review the matter, and standing is a <em>judicially constructed </em>and <em>self-imposed </em>limitation, it is an element of justiciability rather than an element of jurisdiction. <em>See In re Boardwalk Regency Corp., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>361, 368, 447 A.2d 1335, <em>appeal dismissed sub nom., </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>1081, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>562, 74 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 927 (1982); <em>Salorio v. Glaser, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>482, 490-91, 414 A.2d 943, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>874, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>215, 66 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 94 (1980); <em>Al Walker, Inc. v. Borough of Stanhope, supra, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>at 660,130 A.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> The justiciable doctrine of standing fulfills an important purpose, but it is no more than its requirements. It is the requirements of standing (sufficient stake in the outcome, real adverseness, etc.) which fulfill the doctrine\u2019s purpose. A plaintiff does not meet standing\u2019s requirements simply because the defendant, as here, may not have raised the issue or objected to the plaintiffs lack of standing in the trial court. Hence, in order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>standing to have real meaning, standing cannot be waived. If standing were waivable, the public could no longer be \u201cassure[d] that the invocation and exercise of judicial power in a given case are appropriate.\u201d <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 69, 411 A.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Case law of other states reveals that the standing waiver issue is split among them though it is difficult to say exactly how because there is confusion as to the exact meaning of standing and as to how standing relates to jurisdiction and how it is distinguished, if at all, from \u201creal party in interest.\u201d Some states distinguish between the concepts of standing and real party in interest and hold that the real party in interest defense is waivable whereas the lack of standing defense is not waivable. <em>See generally Texas Ass\u2019n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., </em>852 <em>S.W.2d </em>440, 443-45 (Tex.1993); <em>Kumar Corp. v. Nopal Lines, Ltd., </em>462 So.2d 1178, 1182-83 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.), <em>review denied, </em>476 So.2d 675 (1985). Federal courts also recognize a distinction under federal law between standing and real party in interest and hold that the real party in interest defense is waivable whereas the lack of standing defense is not waivable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Bachman, </em>894 F.2d 1233, 1235-36 (10th Cir.1990); <em>Allegheny Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>40 F.3d 1416, 1431 (3d Cir.1994); <em>Lucas v. Lucas, </em>946 F.2d 1318, 1322 n. 6 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>New Jersey law does not recognize any distinction between the concepts of standing and real party in interest. In fact, the discussion of standing as it relates to associations as sole party plaintiffs occurs in the comments to <em>R. </em>4:26-1. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>4:26-1 (1996). <em>R. </em>4:26-1, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">Every action may be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest; but an executor, administrator, guardian of a person or property, trustee ... may sue in the fiduciary\u2019s own name without joining the person for whose benefit the suit is brought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The rule indicates that associations need to have standing in order to qualify as \u201creal parties in interest,\u201d but it does not indicate any substantive distinction between the concepts. In fact, \u201creal party in interest\u201d has been described generally by language which is strikingly similar to the language usually employed to describe standing. For instance, the essential meaning of the real party in interest rule is that each party bringing an action must be beneficially entrusted or rightfully or substantially interested in the outcome of the litigation \u201cso that the judgment, when entered, will be binding and conclusive and the defendant will be saved from further harassment or vexation at the hands of other claimants to the same demand.\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Commonwealth Trust Co., </em>19 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 46, 87 A.2d 555 (Law Div.1952). <em>See also Board of Ed., Tp. of Woodbridge v. Kane Acoustical Co., </em>51 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 329, 143 A.2d 853 (App.Div.1958). Consequently, plaintiff must have standing to qualify as a real party in interest in order to maintain this action because defendant cannot waive that justiciability requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The legislative history of the ADA clearly indicates that associations may bring ADA claims on behalf of disabled individuals. \u201cThe term \u2018person\u2019 is used in the enforcement section to make it clear that organizations representing individuals with disabilities shall have standing to sue under the ADA.\u201d Staff of House Comm, on Education and Labor, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Report on The Americans With Disabilities Act 489 (Comm. Print 1990); H.R.Rep.

Of course, the association representing the individual(s) must satisfy the standing requirements of the court and other procedural hurdles such as, real party in interest requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 12188(a)(1) of the ADA, which governs enforcement of Subchapter III\u2014Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">The remedies and procedures set forth in section 2000a-3(a) of this title are the remedies and procedures this subchapter provides to any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of this subchapter or who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of section 12183 of this title.

In sum, based on the record before us, plaintiff is an organization whose members \u201chave a genuine interest in the accessibility of places of public accommodation,\u201d and, therefore, the trial court properly found that it had standing to maintain this ADA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The issue then remains as to whether plaintiff is entitled to counsel fees and costs under the ADA. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12205 of the ADA, which governs attorneys\u2019 fees, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>In any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, including litigation expenses, and costs, and the United States shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201cTo prevail [under the ADA], a party must succeed on any significant issue in litigation and obtain a result that affects the defendant\u2019s behavior towards the plaintiff____ Success does not always require a formal monetary judgment; a plaintiff may prevail by obtaining a settlement or injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Frey v. Alldata Corp., </em>895 <em>F.Supp. </em>221, 225 (E.D.Wis.1995) (citation omitted). <em>See also Fowler v. New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, </em>885 <em>F.Supp. </em>66, 68-69 (W.D.N.Y.1994). Federal courts have also looked to other federal statutes for guidance in defining \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the ADA because \u201c[tjhe analytical considerations for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under ... the ADA [is] essentially the same as the analysis under [42 <em>U.S.C.A.'] </em>Section 1988.\u201d <em>Alexander S. ex rel. Bowers v. Boyd, </em>929 <em>F.Supp. </em>925, 930 (D.S.C.1995). Thus, in determining whether a plaintiff was a prevailing party for purposes of the ADA, one court relied on 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1988 under which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">a plaintiff must obtain relief on the merits that directly benefits him or her through an enforceable judgment, or a plaintiff must obtain comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement. <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>103, 111, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>566, 572-73, 121 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>494 (1992). A plaintiff prevails \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d 506 <em>U.S. </em>at 111-112,113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 573.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\"><em>[Pedigo v. P.A.M. Transport, Inc., </em>98 <em>F.3d </em>396, 397-98 (8th Cir.1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Another court also relied on 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988 in determining whether plaintiffs were prevailing parties under a number of federal statutes including the ADA. <em>Alexander S. ex rel. Bowers v. Boyd, supra, </em>929 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 930. The court discussed the requirements of a prevailing party under that section, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">\u201cTo qualify as a \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 a plaintiff need not prevail in every claim or issue raised, but only \u2018on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer v. General Elec. Co., </em>706 <em>F.Supp. </em>1234, 1236 (E.D.Va.1989) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>424, 433, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)) (other citations omitted) <em>aff'd, </em>894 <em>F.2d </em>651 (4th Cir.1990). Moreover, \u201c[a] party may prevail by virtue of a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>action by the opposing party through settlement or a consent decree.\u201d <em>Child v. Spillane, </em>866 <em>F.</em>2d 691, 692 (4th Cir.1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">The \u201cprevailing party\u201d inquiry essentially asks whether a causal connection exists between plaintiffs litigation and the relief plaintiff has obtained. <em>Spencer, </em>706 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1236-37 (citing <em>Spillane, </em>866 ,F.2d at 693). The party seeking the fees must show that the lawsuit \u201ccontributed in a significant way to the winning of benefits or relief from the factual/legal condition that the fee claimant has sought to change.\u201d <em>Spillane, </em>866 <em>F.</em>2d at 693 (citations omitted). The court may award fees where a party\u2019s efforts have merely served as a catalyst to the beneficial result which has occurred. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">At the very least, a plaintiff must show that \u201cactual relief on the merits of his claim materially alter[ed] the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefit[ed] the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farrar, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>at 111, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 573.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[Id. at 930-931 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It cannot be seriously challenged that plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in this case. Plaintiff succeeded on significant issues in litigation by obtaining beneficial relief through a modification of defendant\u2019s behavior. There is no doubt that plaintiffs lawsuit was not only significant in achieving that beneficial relief, but was in fact the direct causal force behind plaintiffs success.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Defendant also argues that even if plaintiff has standing to recover attorney\u2019s fees, plaintiff is barred from recovering any fees because it has failed to comply with the administrative prerequisites of the ADA and the Civil Rights Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000a-3. Defendant contends that \u201c[satisfaction of the administrative procedures provided in Section 2000a-3(c) is a condition precedent to bringing an action under Title III of the ADA.\u201d Therefore, according to defendant, because plaintiff failed to follow these procedures, it is barred from any private right of action under the ADA, including any action for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">42 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 2000a-3(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">In the case of an alleged act or practice prohibited by this subchapter which occurs in a State, or political subdivision of a State, which has a State or local law prohibiting such act or practice and establishing or authorizing a State or local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, no civil action may be brought under subsection (a) of this section before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged act or practice has been given to the appropriate State or local authority by registered mail or in person, provided that the court may stay proceedings in such civil action pending the termination of State or local enforcement proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Defendant cites <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>the Law Against Discrimination, and specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5.1,10:5-6, and 10:5-10, as the State laws which prohibit the \u201cact or practice\u201d challenged in the underlying suit and which creates an authority which NJCA should have contacted before filing its ADA action. Plaintiff counters that \u201cNew Jersey has no law that required this Defendant to make itself handicap accessible and so, there was no prerequisite to suit under the ADA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument assumes that 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000a-3(c) is applicable to actions brought under the ADA. In fact, there is no indication within the ADA that this section is applicable to actions brought under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12188. Section 12188 confines itself to the remedies and procedures set forth in 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2000a-3(a). There is no mention of Section 2000a-3(e) in Section 12188, and, thus, plaintiff did not have to comply with the procedural requirements of Section 2000a-3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Accordingly, the judgment awarding plaintiff counsel fees and costs is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>17(a) Real Party in Interest provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Every action <em>shall </em>be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian ... may sue in that person\u2019s own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought____ No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.
