We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Paragraph one of the order declares that \u201c[t]he standard for deductibility of a partnership expense is the standard set out in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb; that is, whether the expense was paid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>incurred in the course of the business, profession or other activity of the partnership\u201d and paragraph three declares \u201c[ejxample 7 of <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>18:35-1.14(c)(8) ] is void and of no further force and effect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pertinent to the issues before us, the disputes between the Director of the Division of Taxation (Director) and the taxpayer arise in the context of the taxpayer\u2019s 1985 New Jersey gross income tax return which included a calculation of net income received by the taxpayer from his partnership. In that calculation, the taxpayer had deducted his proportionate share of certain contributions made by the partnership to various organizations and reported by the partnership for federal tax purposes as a \u00a7 170 expense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the taxpayer took that deduction on his individual federal tax return. There is also no dispute that the New Jersey gross income tax law does not permit a separate deduction for charitable contributions. Nonetheless, the taxpayer asserted that in fact his proportionate share of the partnership contribution should be deducted from his partnership income in arriving at his net income therefrom pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5~lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb refers to the net income from the operation of a business \u201cafter provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof____\u201d Based upon its existing regulation and \u201clong-standing\u201d practice, the Director rejected the taxpayer\u2019s position. In this respect, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:35-1.14(c)(3) requires partnerships to determine their net profits \u201cin the same manner an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>individual taxpayer determines his or her \u2018net profits from business\u2019 pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>18:35-1.25____\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>18:35-1.25(e) provides that \u201c[n]o deduction shall be allowed for any expense or loss which is not incurred in the <em>ordinary course </em>of the conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus,- in his final determination of December 15, 1992, the Director concluded that the contributions here, reported by the partnership for federal purposes as \u00a7 170 charitable contributions and not as ordinary business expenses under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 162 (26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 162, hereinafter referred to as \u00a7 162 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), were not deductible ordinary business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Moreover, because the expenses were reported for federal purposes as other than ordinary business expenses, that is as \u00a7 170 charitable contributions, the Director rejected the taxpayer\u2019s efforts to demonstrate that such contributions, in fact, were ordinary business expenses. <em>See AP. Smith Mfg. Co. v. Barlow, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>145, 154, 98 A.2d 581 (1953) (\u201cmodern conditions require that corporations acknowledge and discharge social as well as private responsibilities as members of the communities within which they operate____ [Ijneidental to their proper objects and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>in aid of the public welfare [is] the power of corporations to contribute corporate funds ... in support of academic institutions .... [S]uch expenditures may ... be justified as being for the benefit of the corporation; indeed ... the matter may be viewed strictly in terms of actual survival of the corporation in a free enterprise system.\u201d). The Director, thus, issued a final determination assessing a tax deficiency assessment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Ultimately, after the taxpayer had filed a complaint with the Tax Court challenging the assessment, the Director withdrew the final determination. In addition, amendments to the critical regulations were proposed. Notice of these amendments was published in 47 <em>N.J.R. </em>475-479 (February 6,1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Although the dispute over the particular deductions involved in the deficiency determination as to the taxpayer\u2019s 1985 return was, thereby, rendered moot, the Tax Court determined that both the \u201c[taxpayers and the Director continue to have \u2018genuine\u2019 disagreement regarding [taxpayers\u2019 reporting responsibilities under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-1 <em>[et seq. ] </em>and the Director\u2019s regulations ... as to the contributions.\u201d 14 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 512. Because we believe the Tax Court erred substantively, we do not address whether it should have simply dismissed the complaint as moot. Our silence on this issue, however, does not necessarily reflect agreement with the Tax Court\u2019s denial of the Director\u2019s motion to dismiss on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Critical to the issues before us, the dispute that the Tax Court deemed appropriate for declaratory judgment concerned \u201cthe standard for deductibility\u201d under N.J.S.A 54A:5-lb for the purposes of determining reportable net income from a business. In particular, and as phrased by the Tax Court: \u201c[m]ust [taxpayers demonstrate that the contributions were \u2018ordinary and necessary\u2019 expenses of the partnership\u2019s business, or merely that they were \u2018incurred in the conduct of the partnership\u2019s business\u2019?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 14 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>54A:5-lb defines net profits from business as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">net income from the operation of a business, profession, or other activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Viewing this language literally, and in answering the question posed on the issue for declaratory judgment, the Tax Court agreed with the taxpayer\u2019s contention, renewed here, \u201cthat the phrase \u2018all costs and expenses\u2019 as it is used within <em>N.J.S.A </em>54A:5-lb, was held by the Supreme Court in <em>Smith [v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 527 A.2d 843 (1987) ] to mean just that; that is, that the \u2018ordinary and necessary\u2019 standard for deductibility borrowed by the Director from Federal law must be rejected in favor of the following\u2014\u2018was the expense incurred in the conduct of the partnership\u2019s business\u2019?\u201d 14 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">We think the Tax Court misread <em>Smith </em>and, thus, erroneously accepted the taxpayer\u2019s position. We, moreover, are of the view that the appropriate issue is actually twofold. The first inquiry is whether the Legislature intended the phrase \u201call costs and expenses\u201d to mean, literally, all and any costs and expenses without limitations. Depending upon the answer, the second inquiry is whether and to what extent the Director may promulgate regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tions implementing and fleshing out that phrase within the confines of his broad regulatory powers. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54A:9-17(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The answer to the first inquiry has already been provided by <em>Smith </em>and it is not what the Tax Court concluded. In <em>Smith, </em>Justice Garibaldi said: \u201c[t]he Legislature intended that all income, including gains and dividends, realized by a partnership <em>in the ordinary course of its business </em>be taxed----\u201d 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 527 A.2d 843 (emphasis added). In emphasizing the limits of its decision and its focus upon \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses, the Court observed: \u201c[h]ere, business expenses incurred by a partnership in the ordinary course of its business are being applied against that partnership\u2019s income, also earned in the ordinary course of its business. No business expenses are being applied against income derived from an unrelated source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 527 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Thus, just as all business income does not mean all \u201cordinary\u201d business income, neither do all business expenses connote all \u201cordinary\u201d expenses. This qualification of what costs and expenses are deductible under <em>N.J.S.A </em>54A:5-lb in arriving at the net income of a business is implicit in the express provision that such costs and expenses are those \u201cincurred in the conduct\u201d of the business. Facially, then, the Tax Court erred in its reading of <em>Smith </em>and, thus, in its interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb. \u201c[A]ll costs and expenses\u201d are not deductible simply because the business incurred them. They must be \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses. That is precisely what the present regulation requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">We note the Director\u2019s emphasis now, and in his proposed regulations, upon the term \u201cordinary and necessary.\u201d Whether \u201cordinary\u201d expenses within the meaning of <em>Smith </em>is the equivalent of \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d was not addressed by the Tax Court and not posed by the parties here. We decline to resolve that on our own. But what we do decide is that the Tax Court erred in its conclusion that \u201call costs and expenses\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-lb means, virtually, any and all expenses of a business, whether related or unrelated to the conduct of that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The second inquiry then becomes whether the Director\u2019s regulation reasonably implements <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb as construed by <em>Smith. </em>As to that we are not inclined to express a view. Not only is the critical regulation in the process of being amended, but this issue was not addressed by the Tax Court beyond its view that the regulation was invalid. We think the issue should, in the first instance, be decided by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Moreover, as to charitable contributions, we also decline to consider the proposed regulations\u2019 presumptive reliance upon a taxpayer\u2019s designation of expenses on the federal return as \u00a7 170 or \u00a7 162 expenses. We make the following observations, however. In the course of the Tax Court\u2019s decision, the following language from <em>Smith </em>was quoted in the context of the court\u2019s analysis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lk<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and its rejection of the Director\u2019s efforts to incorporate the federal tax provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201cWe disagree that the Legislature patterned the ... Gross Income Tax Act on the Internal Revenue Code____ No evidence has been presented that the Legislature intended to equate \u2018distributive share\u2019 ... or ... \u2018income\u2019 and \u2018gain\u2019 with analogous terms used in the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, when the Legislature intended to incorporate federal income tax concepts, it did so explicitly____ The Act\u2019s legislative history clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to and did reject the federal income tax model in favor of a gross income tax act in order to avoid tax loopholes under federal law. Since the Legislature rejected the federal model of taxing income, other branches may not superimpose the Code upon the Gross Income Tax Act in the guise of statutory construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">[ 14 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 514 (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 32-33, 527 A.2d 843) (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">What the Tax Court left out of this quote was rather critical as to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb. The Court in <em>Smith </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">No evidence has been presented that the Legislature intended to equate \u201cdistributive share\u201d with \u201cdistributive share of partnership income\u201d or to equate \u201cincome\u201d and \u201cgain\u201d with analogous terms used in the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, when the Legislature intended to incorporate federal income tax concepts, it did so explicitly. <em>For example, N.J.S.A. 5iA:5-lb provides that net profits from business be determined in \u201caccordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal tax purposes. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">[ 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 527 A.2d 843 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The thrust of this <em>dicta </em>would indicate that the reference to \u201cthe method of accounting allowed for federal tax purposes\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb does incorporate the federal tax structure, including the dichotomy between \u00a7 170 and \u00a7 162, and the distinction therein between \u00a7 170 charitable contributions and \u00a7 162 \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>And see Walsh v. State, Dept. of the Treasury, Div. of Taxation, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>447, 462 (Tax 1989), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 572 A.2d 222 (App.Div.1990); <em>Baldwin v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>273 (Tax 1988), <em>aff'd, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 567 A.2d 1021 (App.Div.1990). <em>But see Estate of Guzzardi v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>395 (Tax 1995), aff'd,-N.J.Tax-(Tax 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Suffice it to say, whether and to what extent the reference to the \u201cmethod of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes\u201d reflects legislative intent to incorporate more of the federal tax structure than what ordinarily might be considered accounting methods, and whether it is a reasonable exercise of regulatory authority to so incorporate in implementing the \u201cordinary\u201d business loss and expense provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb as construed by <em>Smith, </em>is not before us. This is so because the Tax Court did not address this issue beyond the confines of its faulty reading of <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The issue is fraught with complexities and should be resolved at the Tax Court level. It is our perception that the Director has on occasion relied upon the federal taxing principles and on other occasions not. Compare the position he has taken before us and his position in <em>Guzzardi supra, </em>(\u201c[t]he Director responds ... that the reference to federal income tax accounting methods in <em>N.J.S.A </em>54A:5.1c goes no further than <em>permitting </em>the use <em>of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>federal accounting methods,\u201d and not the incorporation of the substantive provision of the Code relating to gains and expenditures.). It is also our perception that the issue becomes further complicated and less clear when it is pursued in a vacuum, that is outside of the context of a particular dispute. It is more complicated here because the underlying regulatory framework is in the process of change.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">At the very least we do not think we should resolve any more than we have. That is to say, <em>N.J.S.A </em>54A:5.1b encompasses \u201cordinary\u201d business losses and expenses. It does not permit deduction of any and all losses and expenses incurred by the business. We remand to the Tax Court the issues of whether \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses is the equivalent of \u201cordinary and necessary,\u201d whether the proposed regulations are an appropriate exercise of the Director\u2019s rule-making authority, and whether the Director may, as to charitable contributions, conclusively rely upon the federal return of the partnership, <em>cf. AT &amp; T Co. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>13 <em>N.J.Tax </em>534, 544 (Tax 1993) (the Legislature \u201cdid not intend, nor did it allow, taxpayers to elect one tax option for federal income tax purposes and another tax option for the State tax purposes____ Absent a specific statutory provision, taxpayers cannot vary from their federal elections.\u201d). In doing so, we observe that nothing we have here said would prevent the Tax Court from, on remand, declining to exercise further jurisdiction in light of the absence of any real dispute between the taxpayer and in light of the pendency of the proposed amendments to the critical regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Finally, as to those amendments, we urge the Director to consider promulgating a mechanism, applicable to reported \u00a7 170 partnership charitable contributions, that would allow the taxpayer to rebut the presumption (irrebuttable under the proposed regulations) that such contributions are not ordinary business expenses. We note, in this respect, that such a mechanism has been proposed in the amendments as to unreimbursed expenses. Aside from the Director\u2019s claims that such a procedure would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>too difficult to administer, we do not fully understand why a similar mechanism could not be fashioned for contributions federally reported as \u00a7 170 expenses yet which might well be \u201cordinary\u201d business expenses. In this respect, we note the Court\u2019s rejection in <em>Smith </em>of the Director\u2019s administrative simplicity and convenience contentions. <em>Smith, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 38, 527 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Reversed and remanded.
