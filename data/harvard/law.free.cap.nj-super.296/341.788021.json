Defendants contend that the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts was insufficient to establish that defendants\u2019 negligent maintenance of a seat belt proximately caused plaintiff Martina Thorn\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs injuries would have been the same or worse even if she had been wearing a seat belt, and therefore she had the burden to demonstrate by expert testimony that an operable seat belt would have prevented those injuries. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Plaintiff was injured while riding in defendants\u2019 invalid motor coach. She had hired the coach to transport her daughter, who is wheelchair-bound, to the dentist. While in transit, the coach stopped abruptly and caused plaintiff to be forcibly thrown from her bench-type seat across the aisle into her daughter\u2019s wheelchair. Although <em>the </em>coach was equipped with a seat belt, it was inoperable due to a missing buckle. When the coach stopped abruptly to avoid being \u201ccut-off\u2019 by another vehicle, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>experienced a rapid \u201cacceleration and deceleration\u201d movement of her body as she was thrown across the coach. As a result, plaintiff sustained a \u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d permanent in nature, as well as damage to her cervical and lumbar spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Plaintiffs instituted a personal injury action against defendants alleging negligent operation of the motor coach and negligent failure to properly maintain the seat belt. At trial, plaintiffs introduced four expert witnesses, all of whom concluded, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that plaintiff had suffered a permanent \u201cclosed head injury,\u201d as well as cervical and lumbar injuries, and that her injuries were caused by the accident. In regard to plaintiffs head injury, the experts testified that the acceleration and forceful deceleration of plaintiff\u2019s brain caused a collision between her brain and skull, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Dr. William Mullally, a Harvard University trained neurologist, who is board certified in neurology and internal medicine, testified on behalf of plaintiffs. He described the field of neurology as being concerned with the forces of acceleration and deceleration as they relate to the movement of the brain within the skull. Describing these forces, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">[ I ]n space and time, if the body is moving, the brain is moving at the same speed. If the body is stopped at any time, the brain will continue to move just like any other object. It may bounce against the skull. It goes forward and then backwards, and it also turns, rotates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">He gave as an example, \u201cshaken baby syndrome,\u201d where continuous shaking of a baby \u201cbounces the brain around,\u201d causing impact with the skull, sometimes producing such significant trauma to the brain that death occurs. Dr. Mullally concluded that plaintiffs chronic head pain and cognitive deficits were the result of the \u201cclosed head injury\u201d she sustained in the accident. Neither he nor the other experts presented by plaintiffs specifically testified concerning what, if any, injuries plaintiff would have'sustained had she been wearing her seat belt. Defendants did not present any medical experts or introduce evidence that plaintiffs injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>would have been the same or worse had a properly functioning seat belt been employed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Defendants moved for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, arguing that plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof with respect to proximate cause on the negligent maintenance of the seat belt claim. The trial judge denied defendants\u2019 motion, ruling that \u201c[t]he plaintiff is not required to prove that if [she] had used a good safety belt ... she would not have sustained ... injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury absolved defendants of liability on the claim of negligent operation of the motor coach, but determined that defendants were negligent in failing to properly maintain the seat belt, which negligence proximately caused plaintiffs injuries. After judgment was entered, defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, again arguing that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that plaintiff would not have been injured had she been wearing a seat belt. The trial court denied the motion, stating that the jury \u201ccould have reasonably concluded that defendants\u2019 negligence in failing to maintain the vehicle was clearly a proximate cause of the injuries sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Defendants make the same argument on appeal. They maintain that the trial court erred in failing to grant their motions for judgment because plaintiffs were required to specifically prove through expert testimony that the absence of an operable seat belt proximately caused plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Defendants maintain, as earlier noted, that had plaintiff been wearing a seat belt, the abrupt acceleration/deceleration forces experienced by her body when the motor coach stopped short would have been the same or greater and therefore would have produced the same or worse injuries than those she sustained. In other words, defendants contend that plaintiff would have experienced \u201cthe same whiplash type motion\u201d whether or not she had been wearing a seat belt, and therefore their failure to maintain a proper safety restraint was not the cause of her injuries. Accordingly, defendants insist that it was plaintiffs\u2019 burden to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>strate through expert testimony that plaintiffs injuries would not have occurred had she been wearing a seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">It is fundamental that in order to impose tort liability upon a defendant, a plaintiff must prove the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, injury and proximate cause. <em>See, e.g., Dawson v. Bunker Hill Plaza Associates, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 322, 673 A.2d 847 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>569, 683 A.2d 1164 (1996). Hence, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct is a cause-in-fact of the plaintiffs injury. <em>See Kulas v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>311, 317, 196 A.2d 769 (1964); <em>see also Battista v. Olson, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 148-49, 516 A.2d 1117 (App.Div.1986). Moreover, an act or omission is not regarded as a cause-in-fact of an event if the event would have occurred without such act or omission. <em>Kulas, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 196 A.2d 769. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]his rule has been tempered by cases holding that, even if damage would have occurred in the absence of a defendant\u2019s negligence, liability still may be imposed upon a showing that the negligent conduct was a <em>substantial factor </em>in causing the harm alleged.\u201d <em>Battista, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 516 A.2d 1117. <em>See Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 417, 419, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996) (discussing \u201ccausation in fact,\u201d and specifically noting that \u201cour concepts of causation for failure to act are expressed in terms of whether the negligent conduct may be considered a substantial factor contributing to the loss\u201d); <em>see also Grassis v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super </em>446, 457, 591 A.2d 671 (App.Div.1991) (noting that the law does not require a plaintiff to prove a single cause, only that defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In <em>Battista, supra, </em>we explained that the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d exception to the general rule of proximate causation rests largely on our courts\u2019 acceptance of the following tort principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">[ An ] actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm---- [2 <em>Restatement, Torts 2d, </em>\u00a7 431 at 428 (1965) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">&gt;;; * <em>% </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">(2) <em>If two forces are actively operating, one because of the actor\u2019s negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor\u2019s negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing about it. fId., </em>\u00a7 432 at 430 (Emphasis supplied) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">[ 213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 516 A.2d 1117 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">In short, although tort law recognizes that there may be multiple causes of an injury, these causes \u201c \u2018need not, of themselves, be capable of producing the injury; it is enough if they are \u2018a substantial factor\u2019 in bringing it about.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conklin, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 419, 678 A.2d 1060 (quoting <em>Scott v. Salem County Memorial Hosp., </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 34, 280 A.2d 843 (App.Div.1971) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">In determining whether a cause is a substantial factor \u201cwe do not tell a jury that a significant factor must be\u201d' a particular percentage to be deemed substantial, but leave that determination to the fact finder itself. <em>See Grassis, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 446, 457 n. 8, 591 A.2d 671 (noting that the jury in <em>Stephenson v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>194, 199, 510 A.2d 1161 (1986) had \u201cfound that a 5% causative factor on the part of a manufacturer was [sufficiently] significant\u201d to constitute a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs harm). Further, although plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causation, \u201cthey are not obliged to establish it by direct, indisputable evidence.\u201d <em>Kulas, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 319, 196 A.2d 769. Instead, \u201c \u2018[t]he matter may rest upon legitimate inference, so long as the proof will justify a reasonable and logical inference as distinguished from mere speculation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Beyer v. White, </em>22 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 144, 91 A.2d 606 (App.Div.1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">In the instant case, plaintiffs alleged that two negligent acts by defendants produced plaintiffs injuries, the negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>operation of the coach and the negligent maintenance of the seat belt. Applying the foregoing principles, plaintiffs were not required to specifically prove which of those acts was <em>the </em>cause of plaintiffs injuries; they need only have demonstrated that either or both acts of alleged negligence were a substantial factor in producing plaintiffs injuries. <em>See Grassis, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 591 A.2d 671. In other words, plaintiff need not have demonstrated that the impact resulting from being thrust from her seat was \u201cexclusively capable of producing her injury.\u201d <em>Dawson, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 673 A.2d 847 (citing <em>Scott, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34, 280 A.2d 843).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When reviewing motions for judgment, we accord the non-moving party the benefit of all legitimate inferences, and, if reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969); <em>see R. </em>4:40-1 and - 2. Plaintiffs presented expert testimony indicating that the acceleration and forceful deceleration plaintiff experienced when her body was ejected forward into the coach caused her to suffer a closed head injury to the brain as well as severe cervical and lumbar injuries. The jury heard testimony establishing that the brain has a tendency to move at the same speed the body is moving and will continue to do so until it collides with the skull. Construing all inferences in favor of plaintiffs, we conclude that a jury could draw \u201ca reasonable and logical inference\u201d that defendants\u2019 negligent failure to furnish an operable seat belt was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs injuries, a conclusion clearly predicated upon more than \u201cmere speculation.\u201d <em>See Kulas, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 319, 196 A.2d 769. To the extent that plaintiff might have experienced a whiplash had she worn a seat belt, a reasonable jury could decide, based on the expert testimony plaintiffs presented, that the movement of the brain within the skull resulting from that type of aeceleration/deceleration is substantially less than what occurred when plaintiff was thrown across the coach. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendants\u2019 motions for judgment. <em>Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 258 A.2d 706; <em>see R. </em>4:40-1 and -2. In reaching this determination, we reject as without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>merit defendants\u2019 arguments derived from the holding in <em>Waterson v. General Motors Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>238, 544 A.2d 357 (1988). <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Waterson </em>is a \u201cseat belt\u201d case. The case requires a defendant seeking to limit its liability to affirmatively prove through expert testimony that a plaintiff\u2019s concurrent negligence resulted in enhanced injuries so that a jury may apportion the harm between the causes associated with each party\u2019s negligent conduct. <em>Waterson, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 264, 275, 544 A.2d 357. Relying on <em>Waterson, </em>defendants argue that the instant case \u201cis essentially a \u2018reverse\u2019 seat belt case, <em>i.e., </em>rather than the defendant asserting the plaintiffs failure to use a seat belt as a shield to limit damages, the plaintiff has used the unavailability of an operable seat belt as a sword in an effort to obtain damages.\u201d Consequently, defendants contend that plaintiffs were required to prove through expert testimony that plaintiff would not have been injured had she been wearing a seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">As we discussed previously, plaintiffs were only required to prove that defendants\u2019 failure to provide an operable seat belt was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s harm. Essentially, defendants seek to limit their liability by placing the burden upon plaintiffs to establish which portions of plaintiffs injuries are attributable to the forces resulting from her inability to wear a seat belt and which, if any, are attributable to the forces stemming from the coach\u2019s initial abrupt stop. Consistent with New Jersey decisions regarding apportionment of harm in other tort law contexts, defendants retain this burden. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Picciotti, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>195, 212, 676 A.2d 127 (1996) (medical malpractice case holding that where plaintiff does not urge that defendant\u2019s negligence increased her risk of harm from a pre-existing disease, defendant has \u201c \u2018burden to segregate recoverable damages from those solely incident to the preexisting disease.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Fosgate v. Corona, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>268, 273, 330 A.2d 355 (1974)); <em>Schwarze v. Mulrooney, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 540-41, 677 A.2d 1144 (App.Div.1996) (\u201csecond collision injuries\u201d case holding that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>dant had burden of demonstrating the extent to which plaintiffs negligence contributed to increasing her injuries); <em>Dafler v.
