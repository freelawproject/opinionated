Walker, 153 Pa. 132. Before the act of 1891, in order to deprive the subcontractor of his right, the contract which authorized the erection of the building must have clearly prohibited liens: Nice v. Walker, supra. That the right of the subcontractor was measurably independent of the contract is shown by the fact that liens might be entered in excess of the contract price: Taylor v. Murphy, 148 Pa. 337. The court in Schroeder v. Galland, 134 Pa. 284, held the subcontractor was fixed with notice of the terms of the contract of the owner with the contractor. This line of decisions rests upon the principle of implied waiver; the act of 1891 requires a written waiver by the subcontractor. The legislature gave the right of lien to the subcontractor without any assent on the part of the owner; it can preserve such right against the dissent of the owner: Taylor v. Murphy, supra; Best v. Baumgardner, 122 Pa. 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">The case of Johns Spry Lumber Co. v. Savings Bank Co., 77 Mich. 199, is not in point, as will appear by an examination of the Michigan act and the construction which the court put upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-10\">The case of Godcharles v. Wigeman, 113 Pa. 437, was one in which the legislature undertook to dictate the character of compensation which the laborer should receive; here the legislature simply gives a remedy whereby the payment of that which the laborer or material man is entitled to receive maybe secured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-11\">Cannot the legislature declare that, in order to prevent fraud and imposition, a subcontractor shall have a right of lien, unless he has waived such right in writing ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The statute does not conflict with section 9 of the Bill of Rights: Craig v. Kline, 65 Pa. 413; Fetter v. Wilt, 46 Pa. 460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\">The act of 1891 does not affect the obligation of contracts; it only relates to the remedy and is therefore not unconstitutional: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. 346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">There is no unreasonable hardship to the owner in the act of 1891, as he can secure himself by sureties from the contractor and by reserving the right <em>to </em>supervise the employment of the subcontractors. But questions of convenience are purely for the legislature; the court can only inquire whether the act transcends the limits of the constitution: Weister v. Hade, 52 Pa. 478; R. R. v. Riblet, 66 Pa. 164; Com. v. Maxwell, 27 Pa. 444; Powell v. Com., 19 W. N. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">It is unnecessary to discuss section 2 of the act of 1891, as section 1 is complete in itself and can stand alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">The act of 1891 cannot be declared unconstitutional, unless its invalidity is plainly manifest: Sharpless v. Mayor, 21 Pa. 164; R. R. v. Casey, 26 Pa. 287; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. 197, 201, 202, 216.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-8\"><em>R. Jones </em>Monaghan, <em>J.

David McMaster, the plaintiff, contracted verbally with him to furnish the building stone, and delivered the same under his contract to the value of $2,461.90, and for this filed a mechanic\u2019s lien. The contract of McMaster with Pennock was in the spring of 1892, and the stone was delivered under it between June 22d and September 27th of that year. Pennock\u2019s contract with the Normal School was dated March 8, 1892, and by it he contracted to erect \u201c Recitation Hall,\u201d for the price of $54,000, he to employ all workmen, and furnish all materials. In the contract was this covenant: \u201cThe contractor, for himself and his subcontractors, hereby waives and relinquishes any rights he or they may have under statute or act of the legislature to file any lien or claim against the owner, or the property owned by them as a corporation, and hereby agrees, for himself and subcontractors, to file no mechanic\u2019s or other lien or claim for work and material furnished under this contract, and to save the owner harmless from all loss or damage by reason of anjr such lien or claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant filed an affidavit of defence to sei. fa. on the lien, setting up the foregoing covenant as a protection, against liens by either contractor or his subcontractor. To this, was replied the act of June 8, 1891, declaring invalid this covenant against the subcontractor, because not consented thereto by him in writing. To this, was the rejoinder by defendant, that the act of 1891 was unconstitutional. On the rule for judgment notwithstanding the affidavit of defence, Hemphill, J., in a very able opinion, decided the act unconstitutional, and discharged the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">This appeal is ruled by Waters v. Wolf, argued at Pittsburg November 8, 1893, in opinion filed this day [above p. 153]. For the reasons therein given, the decree in this case is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-8\">Mr. Justice Mitchell dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
