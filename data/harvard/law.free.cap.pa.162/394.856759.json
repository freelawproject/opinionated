Subsequently plaintiff executed a paper revoking the authority of the assignee to collect the judgment and an order to satisfy the judgment. <em>Held </em>that the rule to open the judgment should be made absolute, and an issue awarded to determine how much was equitably due to the assignee, the judgment to be satisfied as to all above such amount.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-7\">In such a case the burden is on the assignee to show the amount of his expenses, that they were proper in nature and amount, and that they had been actually incurred in good faith before he was notified that his power had been revoked.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b418-8\">Argued March 13, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsX5\">Appeal, No. 219, Jan.

There are also produced from plaintiff a power of attorney to Crimmins, and an order on the prothonotary to satisfy the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Prima facie on this state of facts the judgment was void from the beginning, and should not only be opened but vacated absolutely and taken off the record. But it appears that other parties have intervened on the faith of the judgment and must be considered. In June 1893 an assignment was filed of record, dated June 6, 1892, and the whole trouble in the case seems to have arisen from the extraordinary misconception by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, of the nature of this assignment, and their powers and duties under it. The paper is spread at large on the record, and is an assignment of the judgment by the plaintiff to A. B. Markham, \u201cto collect and account to me therefor, after deducting his fees, expenses, and the fees and expenses of James Wood.\u201d This is nothing more or less than a power of attorney to collect, with a pledge of the judgment as security for the fees and expenses named. The property in the judgment remains in the plaintiff, and he can resume control over it, satisfy it, or terminate the authority of the attorneys at any time, subject to the equity they have to be reimbursed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>their fees and expenses. It is of no consequence that, as the learned counsel for the appellee seem to think, the whole amount of the judgment is really due the plaintiff, and he is being persuaded out of it. That is his business, not theirs, and if he chooses to give away his rights for family peace or any other reason, no objection can be heard from them beyond the protection of their interest for fees and expenses incurred before notice of revocation. As to such fees and expenses the burden of proof is upon them. Markham took the assignment with a duty to account, and to pay over after deducting fees and expenses. It is upon him to show what these were, that they are proper in nature and amount, and that they rvere actually incurred in good faith before notice of any of the plaintiff\u2019s acts which are equivalent to a revocation of the assignment, and especially before notice of the execution of the power of attorney to Crimmins in March 1893 formally revoking their authority. These, if the parties cannot agree, are matters for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">Order reversed, and rule made absolute; an issue to be awarded to determine how much is equitably due to the assignees, and the judgment to be satisfied as to all above such amount.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
