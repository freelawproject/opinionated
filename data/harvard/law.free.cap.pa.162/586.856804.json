King, Esq., and William J. Meyers, Esq., were dismissed by the court, in the following opinion by Simonton, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">\u201c The facts are sufficiently found in the auditors\u2019 report, and we shall not restate them except so far as may be necessary with respect to the special cases to which the exceptions relate. In People v. Security Life Insurance Co., 78 N. Y. 114, it is shown that where a life insurance company has been adjudged insolvent and has been dissolved, it has broken its engagements with its policy holders and becomes liable to them on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>of such breach, and the policy holders then have a claim for damages ; and it is said that the decisions have uniformly been to this effect. The policy holders are in the same position as any other person would be who had running contracts of value with the company which it had broken \u2014 claimants for damages <em>; </em>citing several cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">\u201c As to the measure of the damages, there can be no question that when a claim has become due before the date of the decree of dissolution, the amount of the damage for failure to pay is the amount of the valid claim, just as in all cases of failure to pay a just debt when due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">\u201c But where policies are running at the date of dissolution,, the measure of the damage suffered in each case by the policy holder is, as is said in the same case, \u2018 the value of the policy which has been destroyed. When such value has been ascertained, the true measure of damage has been arrived at, but the difficulty is to determine the value. In any given case the precise value cannot be ascertained. If the time of death were certain, and the rate of interest determined, there would be no-difficulty ; then the present value of the amount to be paid at death, diminished by the amount of the present value of all the premiums to be paid, would give the value. But.the time of death is uncertain, and hence the present value of the running policy must always be speculative and uncertain.\u2019 And after discussing the mode of determining this value, the conclusion is arrived at\u00bfthat the net value of the policies, without regard to the health of the holder, and calculated as of the date of the dissolution of the corporation, according to the tables of mortality used in the business of life insurance, less the outstanding premium notes, if any, fixes the true value!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">\u201c The rules thus stated were adopted by the auditors in this case, and no exception has been taken to their action, except as to certain special cases, and it is therefore to these only that we shall direct our attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">\u201c In one of these special cases, in which exceptions to the report of the auditors have been filed, the claim was due at the date of the decree of dissolution, and the facts are as follows : Mary A. Miller was the beneficiary in a policy of $5,000 on the life of her husband, who died prior to the date of the decree of dissolution, and due proof having been made of the loss, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>sight draft to her order was drawn on the company in her favor by its treasurer and sent to her in Texas, where it was indorsed by her and sent through a bank for collection, and was presented for payment, and payment refused, and shortly thereafter the decree of dissolution was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">\u201c On these facts it is contended on her behalf that \u2018 the draft of this company, drawn upon itself, was an equitable assignment of funds to meet the claim,\u2019 and that hence this is a preferred claim, and entitled to be paid in full. In Nesmith v. Drum, 8 W. &amp; S. 9, it was held that a draft on a particular fund in the hands of a third party is an equitable assignment of the fund, although the draft be not accepted. And in Clemson v. Davidson, 5 Binn. 398, it is said by Tilg-hman, O. J.: \u2018 Any order, writing or act which makes an appropriation of a fund amounts to an equitable assignment of that fund; \u2019 but as is added in Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 24 Pa. 232, at page 240: \u2018 The appropriation must be in express terms, or the intent to make it must be clear. An order drawn upon one who has in his hands funds belonging to the drawer will not of itself amount to the assignment of the fund or any part of it, unless it plainly appears that the fund claimed was one designated out of which payment was to be made. If- a debtor appropriates particular moneys to pay a certain debt, and it is as far delivered as the nature of the case will admit of, equity will control the appropriation, but if the act of appropriation is uncertain, or the subject-matter doubtful, the right of property in the fund is unchanged.\u2019 And in 3 Pom. Eq. Jur. 1284, it is said: \u2018 An ordinary bill of exchange or draft drawn generally and not upon any particular fund, whether accepted or not by the drawee, does not operate as an equitable assignment. Its operation is not changed even when funds have been placed in the drawee\u2019s hands as a means of payment.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">\u201c These authorities sufficiently show that there was no equitable assignment of any particular funds in the case we are considering. It is not acceptance by the drawee, but appropriation of the fund by the drawer which effects the assignment. By acceptance the drawee becomes the debtor to the holder, but if the draft be drawn on a particular fund it constitutes an assignment and binds the fund in the hands of the drawee on mere notice to him, whether he accepts the draft or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201cEven if Mary A. Miller has become an equitable assignee by the delivery of the draft to her, she would not thereby have become a preferred creditor, but would have become an equitable owner of the fund assigned, and would have been entitled to follow it into the hands of the receiver if she could designate it and prove that it had come into his possession. But manifestly she can do neither. No fund is specified in the draft, and there are absolutely no indicia by which any fund can be designated or followed. There is, therefore, no basis on which her claim to be paid in full can rest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">\u201c Exceptions have also been filed in respect of a special class of cases in which certain policies have matured by the death of the assured since the date of the decree of dissolution and before the filing of the auditors\u2019 report, and the beneficiaries in these policies contend that they are entitled to a dividend on the face value of their policies, and that the auditors erred in awarding them only a dividend on the net value calculated as of the date of the dissolution. The argument on their behalf concedes that the rule adopted by the auditors is correct when applied to policies still running at the date when the proofs were taken; but it is contended that this is at best a calculation of chances which is adopted from the necessity of the case, and that it should not be' used where at the time it is applied the data for the ascertainment of the exact value of the policies were furnished by the death of the assured. There have been cases decided in New York and in England in which the rule contended for was adopted ; among others, People v. Security Life Insurance Co., 78 N. Y. 180, and Craig\u2019s Case, L. R. 9 Eq. 711. In the first case, Eabx, J., delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u2018 This company was dissolved and a receiver appointed December 14, 1876; Thomas J. Lockwood, holding a life policy upon which the' premium had been paid, died March 15,1877. . . . The referee allowed the beneficiary only the reserve value of his policy at the date of the dissolution of the company, computed in the same way as the value of running policies were computed, disregarding entirely the fact of the subsequent death of the assured. In this he erred. The claimant was entitled to be allowed as his damage the value of this policy. There is no statute regulating how such value as between the receiver and the claimant shall be determined. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The rules by which the referee determines the value of running policies will not in all cases do justice. In some cases they may give the claimant more damage than he has sustained, and in other cases less. In their general application, however, they will work out results sufficiently accurate for judicial action. In general they furnish the only practicable basis of computation, and hence are sanctioned. But these rules adopted from the necessity of the case should not be used where, upon facts existing, the precise value of the policy may be easily ascertained. Their use is not then justified by any necessity or considerations of convenience. Here the whole premium had been paid, and at the time the claim was presented the precise value of the policy at the time of the dissolution could easily be shown. It was free from uncertainty or speculation. . . . There can be no embarrassment in allowing the valuation of such policies to be computed in this way where the death occurs and the proofs of death are furnished at any time before-the expiration of the time for presenting claims.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">\u201cWe think this course of reasoning overlooks an essential element in the problem, and places the question on a false basis. It is not a question between the receiver and the claimant. The receiver is no party to the litigation, and has no interest in it. He would not be heard on exceptions to the report of the auditors, or on appeal to the Supreme Court. It is a proceeding to marshal and distribute the assets of the insolvent corporation, and the parties to it are the several claimants, who-are parties adverse whenever their interests clash, as they do if they belong to different classes. Hence their relative equities are involved, and the rights of one class cannot be determined without considering those of all other classes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">\u201c But it would be clearly inequitable, as between the several classes of claimants whose rights had not been fixed prior to the date of the decree of dissolution, to fix some of them at that date and allow others the benefit of contingencies that might happen within an indefinite time- thereafter. They could not change the equilibrium of their equities as against each other by anything they could do themselves, and it ought not to be changed by lapse of time or the course of events. The question is not what claim any one has or would have by the lapse of time and the event of death, but what claim had each as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>against the others when the corporation disappeared from the scene and they were turned over to a fund insufficient to pay them all in full. And this suggests an answer to the argument of counsel in favor of these claims, who says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">\u201c \u2018 Suppose a dissolution and distribution of assets should occur in the case of a company, which upon liquidation of its estate should turn out entirely solvent. It could not be contended that the defunct company could escape from its legal obligations at the date of probate of claims by paying less than the full amount of a policy to a holder whose claim had matured by reason of the death of the assured since the decree of dissolution was entered .... Now whether the dissolved company be solvent or insolvent, the equities of the policy holders are the same .... Each policy holder entered into his individual contract with the insurance company without regard to the terms of the contract of any other policy holder. Each should be entitled to come before the auditors for the amount due on his contract at the time fixed by law to take the proof of his claim.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">\u201c If the corporation was solvent, there would be no balancing of equities between the several classes of claimants, and the question would simply be what sum each, without any reference to the others, had a right to receive from the corporation, and justice would be done by sequestrating all its assets needed to pay all the claims in full; but we cannot agree to the proposition of counsel that \u2018 whether the dissolved corporation be solvent or insolvent, the equities of the policy holders are the same,\u2019 if by this is meant their equities as between each other; for if the corporation be solvent they have no equities as against each other, and no one of them could meddle with the dealings between the corporation and any other; while, if the corporation be insolvent, each is directly interested in what is paid to the other, as is manifested by the fact that they are litigating their conflicting claims in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">\u201cWe think, therefore, that when it is conceded that the rule adopted by the auditors is to be applied to the claims of those whose policies were running when the audit was held, as of the date of the decree of dissolution, the equities between the claimants require the same rule to govern in cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tbe assured have died since the dissolution, but before the audit was closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">\u201c It must not be overlooked that the breach of contract by the corporation, on which the claim for damages in all these cases is founded, occurred at the date of the decree of dissolution, and the damages to be recovered are the value of tbe claims at that date. But at that date the value of the claims now in question was not the value on which a dividend is now claimed, but merely the net value of a running policy, calculated with reference to the expectation of life. If the corporation at that date had paid the claims according to that value tbe legal damage for tbe breach of contract would have been paid. On the other hand, if the net value of the policies still running had been calculated as of the date when the audit was held as damages on each, it would in each case have been different from the amount arrived at by calculating it as of the date of the dissolution. This brings into view the inequality, and, therefore, want of equity, which would result from calculating the damages as of different dates, even if the calculations were in other respects made in the same manner; and the inequality would be still greater where not only the date was different, but where the expectation of life, according to the tables, was. taken in some cases, and a fixed date, ascertained by the prior accident of death, was adopted in others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">\u201cCounsel for the claim of Josephine McGouch, the beneficiary in a paid-up policy on the life of William McCoucb, who died nearly two jmars after the date of the decree of dissolution, seems to have recognized the force of one of these suggestions, as he claims not that the dividend should be based on the face value of the policy when the death happened, but on the net value at the date of the decree, calculated by ascertaining the present value of an amount equal to the face of the policy payable twenty-three months hence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\">\u201c This is a slight modification of the rule claimed to be applicable to the eases above considered, but it is open to the same objection that it does not adopt the value of the policy as it was at the date of the dissolution, which the auditors have found was $9,273.44, but as it afterwards was ascertained by the death of the assured to be $13,275.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-8\">\u201c The claim in all these cases, as is shown in the case first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>above quoted, is in the nature of damages for a breach of contract, and this breach occurs at the date of the decree of dissolution. The right of action for the damages suffered accrues at that date, and the damages in each case are the net value of each policy at that time. But if the damages are calculated by using data afterwards furnished by the death of the assured in particular cases, the amount, as is shown above, is different from that suffered at the date when the breach of contract occurred, and a value is fixed, as of that date, upon the policy, different from its actual value at that date. This being so, we think it would be inequitable to allow the amount to be fixed in that way, and that equity requires the same rule to be applied to all policies which were running at the date of dissolution, without regard to the fact that some have since matured by the death of the assured <em>; </em>and we do not base our conclusion on the act of 1873 (Purd. 904, sec. 6), but on the general principles of equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-5\">\u201c Much was said in the arguments of counsel for and against the authority of Dean\u2019s Appeal, 98 Pa. 101, as affected by the difference in principle between life and fire insurance. There is a radical difference, as is pointed out by Park, B., in Dalby v. India and London Life Insurance Co., 15 C. B. 365. A life policy is a contract to pay a certain sum at an indefinite time; a fire policy is a contract to indemnify in case of loss. But this does not affect the authority of Dean\u2019s Appeal on the only point pertinent to this case, which is that the status of creditors of an insolvent corporation is fixed as of the date of the decree of dissolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-6\">\u201c We have not been furnished with any data from which we can determine that the auditors erred in calculating the amount to be awarded on the so-called mutual policies by the same rule as that applied to the other policies. On this subject the auditors say and find, \u2018 Counsel for death-claims on mutual policies contend that the auditors should separate the so-called mutual policy holders from the other policy holders, determine what proportion of one fund for distribution is the result of mutual premiums, and to that proportion of the entire fund apply the rule the courts have laid down with respect to purely mutual companies. This is asking the auditors to do what the company itself never did. . . . The company never kept a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>separate fund for the payment of mutual policies, but all death-claims were paid indiscriminately out of whatever funds it had in bank. It would be impossible for the auditors to do what the company never, in the many years of its existence, attempted.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">\u201c Assuming the facts just stated to be true, as we must, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we cannot say that the auditors erred in their conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">\u201c It is contended that the auditors erred in failing to allow interest on the claim of Elizabeth Reich between July 18,1889, when the poliej'- on which the claim is based matured, and May 13, 1890, the date of the decree of dissolution. We can see no reason why interest should not have been calculated upon this claim between these dates, unless it be that interest was not allowed on any matured claims. Whether this be so or not, we are unable, from the data before us, to determine. If it should appear hereafter that this claim is equitably entitled to interest, it can be allowed on the second distribution, and we overrule this exception without prejudice to the right of the claimant hereafter to recover interest, if entitled thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, dismissal of exceptions, quoting them, and confirmation of report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-8\"><em>Joseph W.

Plummer\u2019s Exrs., 4 Peters, 172.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-7\"><em>Henry H. Fox </em>and <em>David Wallerstein, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM6\">Mary A. Miller. \u2014 The delivery of a draft or check upon a third party and its acceptance by the drawee constitute an equitable assignment or transfer of the funds to the payee of the draft or check: 2 Dan. Neg. Inst., 4th ed., \u00a7 1638; Atty. Gen. v. Ins. Co., 71 N. Y. 325; Jordan\u2019s Ap., 10 W. N. 37; Coates v. Bank 91 N. Y. 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-8\">The person in whose favor the assignment is made is to be treated as a preferred creditor and to be paid the amount of his claim in full from assets in the hands of a receiver: Le Blanc\u2019s Case, 4 Abb. N. C. 221; Le Roy v. Ins. Co., 2 Edward\u2019s (N. Y.) 657; Lowene v. The American Fire Ins. Co., 6 Paige (N. Y.) 482.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-9\">The claim of Mrs. Miller was an actual matured claim, an outstanding debt, the refusal to meet which was a refusal to meet an obligation of the class to which the assets were to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>applied, before any of the assets of the insurance company were to be applied to meet the net value of the outstanding policies: Act of April 4, 1873, \u00a7 5, par. 3, P. L. 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-5\">The subsequent possession of the assets of the insurance company by the receiver could have no effect upon Mrs. Miller\u2019s right to be paid in full if the refusal of the company to pay her after the order of the insurance commissioner was invalid and in violation of the law. The receiver stood in no better position than the insurance company, and the assets in his hands were subject to the lawful claim of appellant: Beach on Receivers, \u00a7 204.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-6\"><em>William G. </em>Hannis, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aos\">This is not a suit against a corporation. The corporation is for all purposes dead; no suit could be maintained against it, and its assets are in the custody of the law for distribution among its creditors, sufficient only to pay a small dividend to such creditors: Bank v. Colby, 21 Wal. 609; Dean\u2019s Ap., 98 Pa. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\">The appellant can gain no advantage over other claimants of the same class at the date of the dissolution of the company, by the mere accident of the death of the insured in the short interval elapsing between the dissolution of the corporation and the closing of the proofs, and which death in no manner grew out of, or resulted from, the breach of the contract of the defunct corporation, which breach was caused by its insolvency and dissolution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-8\">The decree of dissolution changed instantly the character of every policy. From that moment these policies were no longer living, running policies. The policy holder was at once relieved from all obligation to pay future premiums and the claim on the policy became instantly converted into a claim for damages for the breach of the contract of insurance. These damages are the net value of the policies: May on Ins. \u00a7594.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-9\">The following cases establish the position that the insolvency and dissolution of the company relieves the policy holder from the obligation to pay future premiums, terminates the contract of insurance, and converts it into a present claim for damages: Shaw v. Ins. Co., 69 N. Y. 286; Hayner v. Ins. Co., 69 N. Y. 435; Leslie v. Ins. Co., 63 N. Y. 27; Meer v. Ins. Co., 73 N. Y. 516; Blewett v. Baker, 58 N. Y. 611; Peyster v. Pulver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>3 Barb. 284; Young v. Hunter, 6 N. Y. 203; Jones v. Ins. Co., 7 K. L. R. 1; People v. Ins. Co., 92 N. Y. 105; Att\u2019y Gen. v. Ins. Co., 82 N. Y. 336; Att\u2019y Gen. v. Ins. Co., 33 Hun, 138; People v. Ins. Co., 32 Hun, 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">It has been urged in argument that there is no authority in Pennsylvania which obliged the auditor to define and ascertain the rights of creditors, as those lights existed at the period of the dissolution of the corporation. Both Dean\u2019s Ap., 98 Pa. 101, and the statute of April 4, 1873, P. L. 22, and the supplement of May 1, 1876, see. 49, P. L. 66, creating the insurance department, required the auditors to ascertain the rights of all parties as they existed at the date of the decree of dissolution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\">There was no priority of claim: May on Ins. \u00a7 594; Relfe v. Ins. Co., 76 Mo. 594; People v. Ins. Co., 71 N. Y. 222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\">There was no equitable assignment: Harrisburg Nat. Bank\u2019s Ap., 10 W. N.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-8\">The method of calculating net value is provided by acts of April 4, 1873, P. L. 22; May 1, 1876, P. L. 66; May 9, 1889, P. L. 150; see also McDonnell v. Ins. Co., 85 Ala. 401; Carr v. Hamilton, 129 U.
