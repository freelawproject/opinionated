Plaintiff testified that all his papers had been destroyed by fire, that he had purchased his machinery from a man named Gray, but he did not know his whereabouts, and that he manufactured nearly all his extracts and goods from substances which he purchased for cash. He further testified that he made no effort to get duplicates of vouchers. Defendants were notified of the loss in August, 1893, and demanded certified copies of vouchers, Sept. 28, 1893, under the terms of the policy, recited in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-16\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201c [If he did not know how to obtain the duplicate copies of the bills, or did not remember where the goods were purchased, then, of course, there could be no compliance with the terms, and he would be excused. If you believe his testimony, that he did not remember where the goods were purchased, then the noncompliance with this condition will not affect his right to recover for any loss that he sustained.] [2] [If he concealed the knowledge of where his goods were purchased, or if he, knowing where he got his goods, refused to make an effort to get duplicate copies of those bills, then it would be a violation of this condition, which would defeat his right to recover by your verdict.]\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">Defendant\u2019s sixth point was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">\u201c 6.

If he was unable to produce duplicates of the bills, the burden was on him to show, at least, that he made a reasonable effort to do so, and was unsuccessful: Mispelhorn v. Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co., 53 Md. 473; O\u2019Brien v. Com. Ins. Co., 63 N. Y. 108. In the former it is said: \u201c Whether it was possible or impossible for the plaintiff to produce duplicate bills of purchase, was purely a question of fact to be determined by the jury from all the evidence before them, and although it might be found that it was impossible to produce duplicate bills of purchase of a certain class, that fact did not excuse the non-production of those that could have been obtained by a bona fide effort on his part. The plaintiff could not be relieved from the duty imposed on him by his contract, by simply sending out his wife to procure duplicate bills from parties with whom he had been in the habit of dealing; nor could he meet the requirement of the condition of the policy by showing that he supposed or believed that duplicate bills could not be obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In the case at bar, the plaintiff not only failed to show that he could not procure the duplicate bills demanded, but he proved by his own testimony, most conclusively, that he never made the slightest effort to obtain them. Without referring in detail to his testimony, his answers to the following questions will show the utter indifference he manifested to the demand of the company: \u201c Q. Did you make any effort to get duplicates ? A. I did. Q. What efforts did you make ? A. I didn\u2019t make any in particular. Q. The fact is you made none ? A. I didn\u2019t make any, no. Q. You made none ? A. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">It- follows, from what has been said, that there was no testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>mony to warrant the instructions contained in those portions of the charge recited in the second and third specifications; and, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that he made no effort to comply with the just and reasonable demand of the company, the learned trial judge should have directed a verdict for defendant, as requested in the sixth point.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">While insurance companies, in dealing with their patrons, are held to the exercise of entire good faith, a like duty is due by the insured to their underwriters. That duty the plaintiff in this case evidently determined to shirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
