L. 1041; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 12th ed. 298. An examination of all the statutes relating to the common schools, shows that the legislature has nowhere given to school boards in express- terms the power to prescribe vaccination as a necessary qualification for admission into the common schools, or to suspend or expel pupils who fail to comply with a rule requiring vaccination: Brenninger v. Belvidere, 44 N. J. L. 350; Green\u2019s Brice\u2019s Ultra Vires, 2d ed. 29; Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Stat. 255; Van Horn v.

Over the children it has but a limited control, derived entirely from the parents, viz: that of restraint and correction and then only for educational purposes: 1 Bl.

Mizner, 32 Am. R. 128; Morrow v. Wood, 17 Am. R. 471. And this control is concurrent with that of the parent.

Reg. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">Where there is nothing but an indiscreet exercise of a clearly granted discretion, a party will vex the judicial ear in vain, for the judicial arm can redress no such wrong: Wharton v.

Leg. Reg. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">Plaintiff contends that the personal liberty of the individual is encroached upon by this act of defendant. The right of personal liberty is defined by Blackstone to consist in the free power of locomotion, without illegal restraint or banishment. In this case the personal liberty of the entire school is sought to be destroyed by the one against the many. It was never intended that the safety of the community should be jeopardized to satisfy the whim of a small minority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">Vaccination is not a medical treatment, as contended by appellant, but a preventive, a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of disease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-9\">Defendant has discretionary powers to prescribe sanitary measures for the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases. By the admitted facts in this case there was grave danger in the city of Williamsport from the spread of the disease of smallpox at the time of the action complained of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the danger continued up to the date of the trial in the court below. In excluding plaintiff\u2019s child from the public schools, until he complied with the order for the vaccination, defendant acted in good faith, and for the best interest of the public schools, and in so doing exercised a clearly granted discretion that this court has no power to disturb by mandamus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\">Although the proposition that the legislature of a state is alone competent to make laws is true, yet it is also settled that it is competent for the legislature to delegate to municipal corporations the power-to make by-laws and ordinances, with appropriate sanction, which, when authorized, have the force, in favor of the municipality, and against the persons bound thereby, of laws passed by the legislature of the state: 1 Dillon\u2019s Mun. Corp. \u00a7 308; Par. 17, \u00a7 2, act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 322.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ApjY\">July 11, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFC\">Mr. Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">.- The plaintiff seeks to compel by a writ of mandamus the admission of his minor son to the common school of the city of Williamsport. The board of school directors admits that the child is of proper age, is in good health, and possesses the qualifications that are enumerated in the general school laws as those that entitle him to admission. They allege however that he is excluded because of non-compliance with a regulation adopted in the exercise of a proper measure of care for the public health. The facts appearing in the answer are substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">First. That the city of Williamsport provided by an ordinance adopted in 1872 and still in full force that'no pupil \u201cshall be permitted to attend any public or private school in said city without a certificate of a practicing physician that such pupil has been subjected to the process of vaccination.\u201d Second. That smallpox now exists in Williamsport and \u201cis and has been epidemic in many near by cities and towns.\u201d Third. That in view of this situation the attention of the school board was drawn to the subject by a communication from the board of health requesting them to take action \u201c to the effect that no pupil shall attend the schools of this city except they be vaccinated or furnish a certificate from a physician that such vaccination has been performed.\u201d Fourth. That upon considering this communication \u201c and from the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>eral alarm prevailing in the city over the report that a case of smallpox was in the city \u201d they adopted a resolution in conformity with the recommendation of the board \u2022 of health. Fifth. That this resolution is not enforced against those not at present in a condition to undergo <em>vaccination; </em>and as to those unable to bear the expense, the board provide vaccination without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">The plaintiff demurred to this answer, and the questions thus raised are over the power of the school board to adopt reasonable health regulations for the benefit of their pupils and the general public, and over the reasonableness of the particular regulation complained of in this case. It should be borne in mind that there is no effort to compel vaccination. The school board do not claim that they can compel the plaintiff to vaccinate his son. They claim only the right to exclude from the schools those who do not comply with such regulations of the city and the board of directors as have been thought necessary to preserve the public health. It would not be doubted that the directors would have the right to close the schools temporarily during the prevalence of any serious disease of an infectious or contagious character. This would be a refusal of admission to all the children of the district. They might limit the exclusion to children from infected neighborhoods, or families in which one or more of the members was suffering from the disease. For the same reason they may exclude such children as decline to comply with requirements looking to prevention of the spread of contagion, provided these requirements are not positively unreasonable in their character.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Is the regulation now under consideration a reasonable one ? That is to be judged of in the fiist instance by the city authorities and the school board. It is only'in the case of an abuse of discretionary powers that the court will undertake to supervise official discretion. Vaccination may be, or may not be, a preventive of smallpox. That is a 'question about which medieal men differ and which the law affords no means of determining in a summary manner. A decided majority of the medical profession believe in its efficacy. The municipal regu-' lations of many, and I have no doubt of most, of the cities of this state and country, provide for it. In the present state of medical knowledge and public opinion upon this subject it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>would be impossible for a court to deny that there is reason for believing <em>in </em>the importance of vaccination as a means of protection from the scourge of smallpox. The question is not one of science in a case like the present. We are not required to determine judicially whether the public belief in the efficacy of vaccination is absolutely right or not. We are to consider-what is reasonable in view of the present state of medical knowledge and the concurring opinions of the various boards and officers charged with the care of the public health. The answers of the city and the school board show the belief of the proper authorities to be that a proper regard for the public health and for the children in the public schools, requires the adoption of the regulation complained of. They are doing, in the utmost good faith, what they believe it is their duty to do; and though the plaintiff might be able to demonstrate by the highest scientific tests that they are mistaken in this respect,, that would not be enough. It is not an error in judgment, or-a mistake'upon some abstruse question of medical science, but an abuse of discretionary power, that justifies the courts in interfering with the conduct of the school board or setting aside its action. It is conceded that the board might rightfully exclude the plaintiff\u2019s son if he was actually sick with, or was just recovering from, the smallpox. Though he might not be affected by it, yet if another member of the same family was, the right to exclude him, notwithstanding he might be in perfect health, would be conceded. How far shall this right, to exclude one for the good of many be carried ? That is a question addressed to the official discretion of the proper officers; and when that discretion is honestly and impartially exercised the courts will not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The learned judge of the court below reached a correct conclusion in this case, and his decree is now affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
