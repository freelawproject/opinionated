The bill of particulars was headed with the name of the contractor, James Hood* and \u201c premises Fortieth and Fairmount avenues, Aspen Union street,\u201d etc., etc., and showed the different kind of bricks furnished, the prices charged therefor and the time when the same were furnished, beginning April 23, 1891, and ending Sept. 30, 1891; the charges were made almost daily. At the end of the bill of particulars, from a total thereby shown to be due, there was deducted $5,675 as the \u201c amt. apportioned to premises not in this lien but under this contract.\u201d The contract was to furnish all bricks needed for 65 houses \u201c on the lot of ground subdivided into 65 building lots bounded by 40th street, Fairmount avenue, Aspen street and Union street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">The affidavit of defence showed that the terre tenant had purchased three of the 20 houses, and continued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">\u201c That plaintiff has filed two apportioned mechanics\u2019 liens against the said sixty-five houses, both to C.

Where the claimant would have a right to file an apportioned lien, he may also file a separate lien against each property: Millett v. Allen, 3 W. N. 374; Davis v. Farr, and Harper v. Keely, supra; Pennock v. Hoover, 5 Rawle, 291. While, therefore, the claimant here could have filed one joint apportioned lien against the 65 houses, or a separate lien for the pro rata apportionment against each house, it is submitted that the two apportioned liens which he did file did not violate any principle of mechanic\u2019s lien law, and should be sustained: Boyle v. Mole, 9 Phila. 118; Livezy v. Garvin, 16 W. N. 439; Armbrust v. Galloway, 2 W.

It can also be said that it is a doubtful question, and that its solution, at least in some of its aspects, depends upon facts which are challenged by the affidavit of defence. Thus the affidavit alleges that \u201c the lien is filed more than six months after the materials were furnished, and that some, if not all, of the before-mentioned houses, were completed more than six months prior to the filing of the aforesaid bill.\u201d It is true the last date in the bill of particulars is Sept. 30, 1891, and the lien was filed March 28, 1892, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>bill of particulars was for an enormous quantity of bricks furnished for 65 buildings, and the lien was only upon three of them. Moreover there were two apportioned liens, one upon a block of 45 buildings and another upon a block of twenty, and it was only upon three of this latter block that the present lien was filed. There was no individuation of the quantity of bricks furnished to each building, nor any defined statement as to whether the bricks that were furnished for these three particular buildings were furnished within six months before the buildings were finished. The claim of lien merely apportioned a sum of $3,640 among twenty buildings by an equal proportion of the gross sum upon each. As there are but two entries in the bill of bricks furnished within six months before the filing of the lien, and these are only for a small quantity, it can easily be understood that out of so large a number as 65 buildings they were not all furnished at the same time. The affidavit of defence alleges that some of them were finished more than six months before the lien was filed, and thus a disputed question of fact arises, which ought to be determined by a verdict before the legal question resulting can be properly decided. The affidavit also alleges that a certain street, called Sloan street, running through the whole block which faced on four different streets, was not dedicated or placed on the city plan until after the contract for the entire 65 buildings was made, and therefore there was no right in the plaintiff to file two apportioned liens. This also raises a question of fact which may be, and probably is, essential to the determination of two legal questions, to wit, one whether two apportioned liens on parts of one entire block can be filed in any case, and, if so, whether they can be so filed when, as a matter of fact, the land upon which the whole number of buildings was erected was a unit and undivided by any streets running through it at the time of the contract. In the present state of the record these questions cannot be decided by the court of common pleas or by this court. It will be necessary to have the precise state of the facts determined upon a trial before a jury, and we therefore feel obliged to reverse the judgment of the learned court below, in order that the case, upon all its questions of fact, may be decided by a jury, and, upon its resulting ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tions of law, may be intelligently considered and decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">See also the preceding ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
