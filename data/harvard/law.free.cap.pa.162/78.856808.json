R. Co.\u2019s Ap., 70 Pa. 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">The proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of the property, franchises, etc., of a corporation, under the act of 1870, are to be distributed among all the creditors as in the case of insolvency, and the levy under such execution does not create a lien on the property seized: Bayard\u2019s Ap., 72 Pa. 453.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-11\">The legislature did not intend that an execution issued under the act should be a lien on the property, franchises and rights of the defendant for the sole use and benefit of the plaintiff, and that he should be first paid out of the proceeds of sale: Guest v. Water Co., 142 Pa. 610.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-12\">It may be needless to observe that the sale in the case now at bar was not under the 72d section of the act of 1836. A reference to the return made by the sheriff is decisive of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>point. Not being sold under the act of 1836, it follows that the proceeds are not applicable to the liens in their order: Bank v. Coke Co., 137 Pa. 601; Act of April 7, 1870, P. L. 58; Hogg\u2019s Ap., 88 Pa. 195; Hopkins\u2019 Ap., 90 Pa. 69; Steiner\u2019s Ap., 27 Pa. 313.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-3\">Where real propertj^ of a corporation is sold under an ordinary fieri facias and vend. ex. allowed by the 72d section of the act of 1836, the proceeds are to be distributed to the liens in the order of their priority; and where personal property is sold under the ordinary fieri facias allowed by the same section, the fund goes to the writs of execution in their order as in other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-4\">The act of 1870 and the remedy by special fieri facias allowed by it, being in lieu of the remedy by sequestration provided by the 73d section of the act of 1836, are effectual only to divest the title of a defendant corporation to its franchises, rights and personal property; real estate cannot be sold thereunder, the remedy provided by the 72d section of the act of 1836 being exclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">The proceeds of a sale under the act of 1870 are to be distributed amongst all the creditors according to the rules established in the case of the insolvency of individuals, \u00a7 1, \u201c excepting any mortgage or mortgages which may legally exist at the time of levy thereupon, the lien of which shall not be affected in any manner by said sale.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">The mortgaged premises are lands held in fee: Com. v.

Johnson, 54 Pa. 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">As to the franchises and personal property, the appellants had the right to an execution and sale, in satisfaction of their debt. But the defendant being a corporation and insolvent, the fund realized by the sale of the franchises and personal property was distributable to all the creditors of the defendant pro rata.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-8\">In all cases cited by the learned auditor to sustain his conclusion, the property actually pledged was sold subject to the mortgage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-9\"><em>A.

Wilson, 84 Pa. 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">In Cross v. Stahlman, 48 Pa. 129, it was decided that a judgment on a bond secured by a first mortgage is not payable out of the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of the mortgaged premises under a junior judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">The staying of the writ on the judgment which represented a part of the mortgage debt was for the specific purpose of having the property sold subject to the mortgage: Trickett on Liens, sec. 848; Bittinger\u2019s Ap., 6 W. N. 231; Shryock v. Jones, 22 Pa. 303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">It has been conclusively established by the proceedings in this case that the defendant has no lands held in fee, in the sense of the act of 1870: Guest v. Water Co., 142 Pa. 615. The description of the property mortgaged shows that fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">There is nothing in the description that could be called \u201c lands held in fee \u201d unless it be a \u201c gas well upon said premises,\u201d or \u201c all of the natural gas in or underlying the said tract or piece of land : \u201d Westmoreland Nat. Gas Co. v. DeWitt, 130 Pa. 249. \u201c Land comprehends all things of a permanent substantial nature: \u201d 2 Bl. Com. 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-11\">Another reason for thinking that the mortgaged premises are not \u201c lands in fee,\u201d within the meaning of the act of 1870, is that that reference is only to such lands as are held in fee and not essential to the corporate purposes of the company, while the mortgaged premises, even if lands (which we deny), are essential to the corporate purposes of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>All the lands which ever could have been sold by the 72d section of the act of 1836 are yet sold in the same manner; but only lands essential to corporate purposes can pass by a sale under the act of 1870: Plymouth R.

Colwell, 39 Pa. 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-4\">When another than the mortgagee buys a property subject to a mortgage the mortgage forms a part of the price of the property, and as between the mortgagor and purchaser, the latter contracts to pay the mortgage: Carpenter v. Koons, 20 Pa. 222; Act of April 6, 1830, P. L. 393; The Dollar Savings Bank v. Burns, 87 Pa. 491; Cock v. Bailey, 146 Pa. 828; Scott v.

At the sale the mortgagee became the purchaser, for the sum of #7,150, of the property and franchises sold, and it now claims that it is entitled to share pro rata with the other creditors of the Irwin Company in the distribution of the proceeds. This claim was successfully resisted before tbe auditor, and in the court below, by the stockholders and unsecured creditors of the Irwin Company, on the ground that the Southwest Company purchased the property subject to its mortgage. No question is made respecting the validity or regularity of the sale. It may therefore be considered as agreed by the parties interested in the distribution that the Southwest Company has, by virtue of its purchase, all the property and franchises of the Irwin Company, excepting its lands.held in fee. B ut the Southwest Company contends that the property covered by its mortgage is within the exception mentioned in the levy, and was not sold on the special fi. fa. In other words its contention is that the mortgaged property is \u201cland held in fee \u201d which cannot be sold under the act of April 7, 1870, but is subject to levy and sale under the 72d section of the act of June 16,1836. The question thus raised naturally leads us to a consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the scope and meaning of the act of 1870. Prior to its passage the franchises of a public corporation and its real and personal property appropriated to corporate objects and necessary to the exercise of its corporate functions were exempt from levy and sale on execution. The remedy of its creditors against such property was by sequestration. But property, real or personal, not devoted or essential to the purposes of the corporation, might be levied on and sold pursuant to the provision of the 72d section of the act of 1836. The act of 1870 provided for the levy and sale, on execution, of the real, personal and mixed property (excepting lands held in fee), franchises and rights of the corporation, subject to any mortgage or mortgages legally existing thereon. It was expressly declared to be \u201c in <em>addition </em>to the provisions of the 72d section of the act of June 16,1836, relating to executions, and in <em>lieu </em>of the provisions or proceedings by sequestration under said act.\u201d It was obviously intended to furnish a method of disposing of such corporate property as before that time was exempt from levy and sale on execution. Previous thereto lands which were a component part of the corporate plant and necessary to the enjoyment of the corporate franchises were so exempt, whether the corporation acquired title to it by purchase or by its delegated right of eminent domain; but land not dedicated to corporate purposes or essential to corporate functions was liable to be levied upon and sold in the same manner and with the same effect as the land of other debtors. Laird which before the act of 1870 could be sold on execution under the act of 1836 is to be sold in the same manner and with the same effect now as then. Land which could not then be sold on execution under the act of 1836 may now be sold on the special fi. fa. under the act of 1870. We think therefore that the exception in the act of 1870 is limited to the land which the corporation holds in fee and which, is not dedicated to corporate purposes, or essential to the exercise of the corporate franchises. It was the purpose of the act in question to allow the creditors of the corporation to sell its franchises and property dedicated and essential to the purposes for which it was chartered, and not to disintegrate such property and thus defeat such purposes, and prevent the performance of the duties which the corporation owes to the public. The property covered by the Southwest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Company\u2019s mortgage was not \u201cland held in fee\u201d within the meaning of the exception referred to. It was inseparably connected with and essential to the performance of the mortgagor\u2019s public duties under its charter. It consisted of the mortgagor\u2019s right to take natural gas from seven acres and eighty-three perches of land, and of its rights of way and appliances required in obtaining the gas and transporting the same to the consumers. It was the property which the mortgagor acquired from the mortgagee by deed of even date with the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">Independent of the reasons already given for our conclusion that it was not \u201cland held in fee \u201d within the meaning of the act under which it was sold, there are other considerations which confirm this view. These arise from the nature and quality of the property mortgaged. A right to take gas from the land, or water from the spring of another, for private use or consumption, is not land held in fee, and the appliances and privileges necessary to the enjoyment of the right are not: Westmoreland Natural Gas Co. v. De Witt, 130 Pa. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The property levied on in this case was sold subject to any mortgage or mortgages legally existing thereon, and the only mortgage upon it was held by the Southwest Company. It was so sold on writs evidently controlled by the mortgagee and purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">A mortgage, the lien of which is not discharged by a sheriff\u2019s sale, cannot share in the proceeds of the sale. In such case all that the purchaser takes by the sale is the equity of redemption, and his bid is for such sum as he is willing to pay for the property above the amount of the mortgage debt. If the purchaser is the mortgagee his mortgage is in equity satisfied; his claim is paid in the purchase of the property sold subject to it: Commonwealth v. Wilson, 34 Pa. 63; Cross v. Stahlman, 43 Pa. 129; Carpenter v. Koons, 20 Pa. 222; Bryar\u2019s Appeal, 111 Pa. 504; Dollar Savings Bank v. Burns, 87 Pa. 491, and Cock v. Bailey, 146 Pa. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The Southwest Company chose to make the sale subject to its own mortgage. It might have sold the property on its own writ issued on a judgment obtained on a note secured by the mortgage, and in that case the purchaser would have taken it clear of all liens. But for its own purposes it sold the property subject to the mortgage, and having taken possession of it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>virtue of its purchase, its claim that it was not sold on the special fi. fa. is in conflict with its action in the premises, and without substantial merit. In issuing a special fi. fa. on its own judgment there was a plain concession by it that the property included in its mortgage was not subject to levy and sale under the 72d section of the act of 1836. There is no evidence in the case which places the claim of Mellon &amp; Sons upon higher ground in reference to the fund than the claim of the Southwest Company, or which affords any basis for determining what portion of the fund, if any, was realized by the sale of property not included in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In accordance with the foregoing views the specifications of error are overruled, the decree is affirmed .and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
