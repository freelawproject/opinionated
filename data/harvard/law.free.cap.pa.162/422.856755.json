S. Kemmerer and Wm. Powell assumed the obligations of McNair under the instrument of June 1, 1878. This instrument acknowledged \u201cthe debt of $6,000 therein mentioned as the price of certain buildings and fixtures thereby sold to said Thomas S. McNair is due and payable, with interest from the da3&gt;- of the date of the said indenture of lease, and that the monthly rent from miners\u2019 houses, etc., reserved by the said lease is $200.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\">By agreement of Jan. 12, 1885, Powell assigned his interest in said lease to Kemmerer, and by agreement of April 30,1886, plaintiff of the one part, and Kemmerer and Powell of the other part, extended the term of the lease from June 1, 1888, to June 1, 1900, and released Powell, and accepted Kemmerer as the party liable as lessee of the demised premises, with the same effect as if he had been originally named in place of Mr. McNair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">Defendant gave evidence to prove that there were floods during the months of December, 1885, and January, 1886; and that the result was that said mines were injured to such an extent, and so much water turned into them from the creek as to render it impossible for defendant to remove the water from them by an3&gt;- machinery then on the ground or that could be put into the mines of the Harleigh Colliery, and that by reason thereof it was rendered impossible to remove any coal from the demised premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">Defendant also gave evidence to prove that after the first of these floods, and after work had been stopped by the mine inspector, plaintiff, through its superintendent and agents, came upon the ground and agreed that the only way the mines could be preserved was by a change of the creek channel around the outcrop upon the veins at Harleigh Colliery, and that an arrangement was entered into by which defendant agreed to pump a portion of the water from Old Harleigh mine, which he was not compelled to do under his lease, and the landlord of the plaintiff in this case, with other mine owners, agreed to construct a new channel or canal from the creek around the outcrop in such a manner as to preserve the mines from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>future flood.; that this was so defectively done, and that there was such negligence, not only in the construction, but that it was delayed to such a length of time in being completed, according to the understanding between the parties, that subsequent and heavier floods came, passing over the demised premises and partially destroying the work done, resulting in the permanent and entire destruction of the mine, and making it impossible for the water to be taken out from them by any machinery that could have been put there by the ordinary operation of mining in that region.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-4\">Upon the lease plaintiff brought this action against defendant: (1) For the sum of $14,000 a year for rent for the years 1886, 1887, 1888 and 1889, less a certain small credit, which claim however was at the trial confined to the years ending December 31, 1886, 1887 and 1888. (2) For the sum of $6,000 for breaker and improvements, with interest from June 1, 1878. (3) For the sum of $200 a month for the miners\u2019 houses, etc., for forty-six months. (4) There were also other claims for damages for failing to keep the mine properly drained, digging canal defectively, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">It further appeared that plaintiff company, by deed not printed in the paper-books, dated Dec. 31, 1889, conveyed to G. B. Maride et al., trading under the firm name of G. B. Maride &amp; Co., for the consideration of $150,000, all that certain tract or piece of land therein bounded and described and being that part of the demised premises lying east of the Wilkesbarre road whereon the collieries were situate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-8\">There was also a contemporaneous agreement between the same parties, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-9\">\u201cWhereas, by indenture bearing date the first day of June, 1878, the party of the first part demised certain premises therein described to Thomas S. McNair, with the privilege of mining coal therein for a term of years, which has been extended to the first day of June, 1900, yielding rent as therein stated, and which premises thus demised are situated in the county of Luzerne, upon both sides of the road leading from Hazleton to Wilkesbarre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-10\">\u201cAnd whereas, by indenture of even date herewith the party of the first part (the Improvement Co.) granted and conveyed to the parties of the second part (G. B. Maride &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Co.), their heirs and assigns, all its lands and tenements lying to the eastward of said road, intending thereby to convey to them all its rights and remedies under the above recited lease (now vested in Mahlon S. Kemmerer as lessee), and in and to so much of the demised premises as is situate to the eastward of the Wilkesbarre road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-3\">\u201cAnd whereas it has been agreed between them for divers valuable considerations that the parties of the second part should have, possess and enjoy all the rights and remedies which it, the party of the first part, has in the said demised premises, situate, lying, and being on the westwardly side of the said Wilkesbarre road, as hereinafter limited, including the right to the rents payable out of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-4\">\u201cNow this indenture witnesseth: That for the better securing to the parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, the estate of the party of the first part in the demised premises lying to the westward of the Wilkesbarre road during the term of the recited lease and one day, as the same are herein described and granted, the party of the first part has granted, leased, and demised, and by these presents does grant, lease, and demise to the parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, all the estate and property of the party of the first part situate, lying, and being in the county of Luzerne and state of Pennsylvania, which are described in and demised by the recited lease, and situate on the west side of the said road leading from Wilkesbarre to Hazleton, in the same manner and to the same extent, and subject to the same qualifications and restrictions as the same are granted and demised in and by the recited lease, for a term of years ending on the second day of June, A. D. 1900, at midnight, together with all the rights and remedies of the party of the first part, and the rents, issues, and profits of the granted premises, under and subject, nevertheless, to all the rights of the lessee of the demised premises under the recited lease, his executors, administrators, and assigns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">\u201c Yielding and paying to the party of the first part during the term one grain of wheat in each and every year as rent, if demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">\u201c And the parties of the second part, for themselves, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenant with the party of the first part, its successors and assigns, that during the term hereby demised all taxes on the demised premises shall be paid by them, and that at the termination of the term they will deliver peaceable possession of the demised premises to the party of the first part, its successors and assigns, and the said premises shall then be free of all liens and charges by reason of anything done or suffered by them, the parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, during the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">\u201c And the parties of the second part covenant with the party of the first part, its successors and assigns, that, in the event of the demised mines being drained and capable of being worked, and if they are in fact worked either by themselves, their tenant, or agent, all the covenants in the recited lease contained in respect to the mode of mining which are intended to operate for the protection of the interest of the lessors or reversioners shall be kept and performed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">The court instructed the jury to find for plaintiff for the value of the buildings and fixtures, and for the rent of the miners\u2019 houses, and for defendant as to claim for damages for failure to construct canal. [1-3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">\u201c 1. Under the deed of Dec. 31, 1889, by the Big Black Creek Improvement Company to G. B. Maride &amp; Co., and the agreement of the same date between the same parties, in evidence in this case, the plaintiff has assigned and conveyed all its rights under the lease now sued on to G. B. Maride &amp; Co., including its right to the sums claimed in this suit, and therefore cannot maintain this action.\u201d Refused. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">\u201c2. That the deed of plaintiff to G. B. Maride &amp; Co., of Dec. 31, 1889, conveyed all the coal under the land described in the deed, and the written agreement executed by the plaintiff and bearing the same date with the deed granted unto the same grantee all the coal in the demised premises lying east of the lands described in the same deed that might be mined under the Kemmerer lease up to the year 1900, for ten grains of wheat, or a rent of one grain of wheat per year, and thereby declared that the intention of the parties to the above deed was to convey all the rights and remedies and rents payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>under the Kemmerer lease to the said G. B. Maride &amp; Co. The effect of this deed and the contemporaneous agreement was to convey all rents accrued and the light to sue for and recover the $6,000 mentioned in said lease for certain buildings and property, as well as the right to sue for and recover the minimum rents on unmined coal, and the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4S\">\u201c 11. If the jury find that in July, 1885, there was a large body of water accumulated in the \u2018present Harleigh Colliery\u2019 (so called in the lease), and that said body of water did endanger the lives of the miners working in the demised premises and in the Ebervale Colliery, and that James E. Roderick, mining inspector under the mining laws of Pennsylvania, notified the defendant to stop work in the demised premises until such body of water should be removed, inasmuch as under the terms of the lease the said defendant was not obliged to pump said body of water, said defendant was justified in ceasing to work the demised premises and was exonerated from the payment of royalty on all coal not actually mined by him after that date. <em>Answer: </em>As I understand it, the notice from the mine inspector was withdrawn and the working of the mine was resumed. It is, therefore, impossible for me to say to you with proprietjq as it seems to me, that the defendant was relieved from responsibility because of that notice. If that notice had operated during the whole year, if the mines were closed during the whole year, or so much of the year as prevented the defendant from working out a sufficient amount of coal to have enabled him to pay the $14,000, then to that extent I should have said that the point was correct; but this is an absolute date which is intended to cover all subsequent time, and it is, therefore, too broad, in my judgment.\u201d [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACf\">\u201c 13. And if the jury find that the defendant agreed to pump the water from the \u2018 present Harleigh Colliery \u2019 (so called in the lease), and made preparation therefor and complied therewith so far as was possible to do, and -that the plaintiff company agreed to remove the Black Creek from its natural bed and transfer the same to another part of the demised premises, but so negligently prosecuted said work in respect to time and manner of construction, including the location, width, depth, and grade of the new channel,.as that by reason thereof the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>waters of the said creek, during the storms of December, 1885, and. January, 1886, were not carried off, but, on the contrary, did overflow into and fill up the mine on the demised premises, and did prevent defendant from continuing to mine said demised premises, then the plaintiff is liable to the defendant for all damages caused him thereby, and the defendant is entitled to set off the same in this action against any sums otherwise due by him to the plaintiff under the instrument sued on.\u201d Refused. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">\u201c 14. The measure of such damages is the value of the defendant\u2019s lease at the time of the final stoppage of work in 1886-; that is to sajq the difference in value between the royalty agreed to be paid thereunder and the value of the coal in place upon such number of tons as the defendant might reasonably be expected to mine and take out of said premises during the term.\u201d Refused.

The first of these claims was not allowed by the jury for the reason that they found that the defendant was prevented from mining coal by causes beyond his control, and with that claim fell the many vexed questions which it involved. As to the remaining claims, a peremptory instruction was given to find for the plaintiff, and unless there was error in this the judgment should be affirmed. As to these claims, the liability which the plaintiff sought to enforce was for the price of a breaker and improvements sold by it to its lessee, and by him transferred to the defendant when the lease was assigned, and the payment of which the defendant assumed by covenant with the plaintiff; and his liability as assignee of a lease of dwelling houses for a fixed rent expressly assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">All liability as to these claims was denied on the ground that the conveyance of the reversion by the plaintiff carried with it to the grantee the right to recover for the breaker and improvements, and the right also, if any existed, to the rents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the dwellings due at the time of .the conveyance, and that the occurrence which excused the defendant from his covenant to mine relieved him from his obligation to pay rent for the miners\u2019 houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The conveyance of the land would not carry accrued rent or at all affect the price of buildings sold to a tenant in possession, and the obligation to pay rent rested upon agreements both expressed and implied. The exemption from liability claimed could arise only from the agreements, and we think they are open to no other construction than that given them by the learned judge before whom the case was tried. The covenants to mine and pay, rent for houses were not made dependent upon each other, and the only exemption from liability is for coal not actually mined for causes beyond the control of the lessee. The exemption being expressed as to one should not be implied as to the other, unless there is between them a clearly necessary dependence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The claim to set off damages for the failure of the plaintiff to construct a canal to divert the water which flooded the mine was properly denied. The plaintiff owed no duty to the defendant in the matter, either under the contract or independently of it, and it assumed no obligation to him in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The case was carefully and ably tried, and we see no just cause for complaint on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
