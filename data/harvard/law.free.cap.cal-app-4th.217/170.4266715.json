The parcel on which the Project is located is subject to the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act) (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Project includes approximately 125 luxury homesites on an oceanfront slope.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The homesites are to be situated between a newly created public park at the top of the slope and a newly dedicated public beach at the bottom of the slope. Public access trails run through the residential portion of the Project, linking the public park at the top of the slope with the beach below.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">As portions of the Project neared completion, including the new public park at the top of the slope, the City adopted an ordinance that mandated limited hours of operation for the trails at the Project site that traverse the partially completed residential subdivision, and the installation of pedestrian gates on those trails. Several individuals and an entity filed administrative appeals of the ordinance with the California Coastal Commission (the Commission). In ruling on the appeals, the Commission concluded that the limited hours of operation for the trails and the gates require a coastal development permit under the Coastal Act (\u00a7 30600, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The dispute in this case centers around whether the installation of the gates and the limited hours of operation for the trails fall within the City\u2019s nuisance abatement powers under the Coastal Act and therefore does not require a coastal development permit, or instead, exceeds those powers and thus requires that the City seek a coastal development permit in order to undertake such development.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The City filed an action (City\u2019s Case) seeking to set aside the Commission\u2019s decision and restrain any future attempt on the part of the Commission to exercise jurisdiction over the development mandated by the ordinance. The City contended that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over its actions because the limited hours of operation and installation of the gates were required to abate nuisance conditions at the site, and the Coastal Act provides that no provision of the act is a limitation on \u201cthe power of any city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances\u201d (\u00a7 30005, subd. (b)). The City argued that the statute deprived the Commission of all jurisdiction under the Coastal Act to prohibit development mandated by the nuisance abatement ordinance for the sole reason that the City claimed that it was acting pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b). The City sought declaratory relief, including declarations that \u201cthe Coastal Commission lacks jurisdiction under Coastal Act section 30005[, subdivision] (b) to place limitations on the enforcement of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance,\u201d and that \u201cthe adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance did not require any City \u2018coastal development permit application.\u2019 \u201d The City also requested that the trial court enjoin the Commission \u201cfrom undertaking any enforcement action arising from said ordinance.\u201d In sum, the City asked the trial court to rule that the City was legitimately exercising nuisance abatement powers under section 30005, subdivision (b) and that the Commission therefore lacked jurisdiction to restrict any action that the City might take pursuant to those powers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Surfrider Foundation (Surfrider), a nonprofit environmental organization, filed a separate action (Surfrider Case) against the City in which Surfrider claimed that the Commission had jurisdiction over the development mandated by the ordinance, and that the development violated the Coastal Act and various land use regulations governing the Project, including the City\u2019s local coastal program (see \u00a7 30500).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Surfrider also claimed that the City lacked a rational basis for adopting the ordinance and that the ordinance impinged on various state and federal constitutional rights of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In the City\u2019s Case, the trial court invalidated the Commission\u2019s determination that the development mandated by the ordinance required a coastal development permit. The trial court reasoned that section 30005, subdivision (b) divests the Commission of jurisdiction over such development, \u201cregardless of the merits\u201d of the validity of the City\u2019s nuisance declaration. The court granted the City\u2019s request for declaratory relief, and stated, \u201c[T]he . . . Commission lacks jurisdiction under Coastal Act section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>30005[, subdivision] (b) to place limitations on the enforcement of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance,\u201d and \u201cthe adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance did not require any city \u2018coastal development permit application.\u2019 \u201d The court also issued a judgment and a writ of mandate against the Commission. The Commission filed an appeal in the City\u2019s Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In the Surfrider Case, the trial court concluded that the City had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in the manner by which it declared a nuisance at the Project. The court entered a judgment stating that the ordinance was \u201cinvalid and void insofar as there was no properly declared nuisance and/or the manner of abatement was excessive.\u201d Both the City and Headlands appealed in the Surfrider Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In its appeal, the Commission claims that it had administrative appellate jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625 to consider the appeals of the City\u2019s ordinance. Section 30625 provides that \u201cany appealable action on a coastal development permit or claim of exemption for any development by a local government . . . may be appealed to the commission by an applicant, any aggrieved person, or any two members of the commission.\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (a).) The Commission also contends that the trial court erred in interpreting section 30005, subdivision (b) as restraining the Commission from taking future actions with respect to the development mandated by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly invalidated the Commission\u2019s determination that the development mandated by the ordinance requires a permit. The Commission lacked administrative appellate jurisdiction under section 30625 to consider the appeals of the ordinance because a municipality\u2019s enactment of an ordinance does not amount to an \u201cappealable action\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (a)) from which an administrative appeal to the Commission may be taken. However, we also conclude that the trial court erred in restricting the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the ordinance without first determining in the City\u2019s Case whether the City was acting properly within the scope of its nuisance abatement powers reserved to it pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b). Because the City asked the trial court to order the Commission to halt any action that would interfere with the City\u2019s nuisance abatement measures, the City was required to establish that it was exercising that authority legitimately. More specifically, we hold that before a municipality may obtain a writ of mandate restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over development that the municipality has authorized pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b), the municipality must demonstrate that it has exercised its nuisance abatement powers in good faith, in that the municipality has not utilized these powers as a pretext for avoiding its obligations under its own local coastal program. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>remand the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether the City properly exercised its nuisance abatement powers in this case, in light of our interpretation of section 30005, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion in the Surfrider Case that the City acted arbitrarily and capriciously in enacting the ordinance suggests that on remand in the City\u2019s Case, the court is likely to conclude that the City\u2019s claim that it enacted the ordinance in order to abate a nuisance is pretextual, and thus, that the Commission may exercise jurisdiction over the gates and hours of operation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Any future proceedings by the Commission against the City that are authorized by the trial court\u2019s ruling on remand in the City\u2019s Case are likely to moot the constitutional issues raised in the Surfrider Case. For this reason, we conclude that the appeals in the Surfrider Case should be held in abeyance pending a final resolution of the issues in the City\u2019s Case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aey\">A. <em>The Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In 2002, the City proposed amending its local coastal program to allow the development of the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">In January 2004, after requiring modifications to bring the local coastal program amendment into conformity with the Coastal Act, the Commission approved the- local coastal program amendment. The modifications included a provision that states, \u201cPublic beaches and parks shall . . . maximize hours of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>use to the extent feasible, in order to maximize public access and recreation opportunities. Limitations on time of use . . . shall be subject to a coastal development permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The local coastal program amendment required that the Project include various trails from the park to the beach, including two trails, referred to as the \u201cMid-Strand\u201d and \u201cCentral Strand\u201d trails (beach access trails), that run from the park, along streets through the proposed housing development, to the beach. With respect to gates, the local coastal program amendment provided: \u201cExcept as noted in this policy, gates, guardhouses, barriers, or other structures designed to . . . restrict access <em>shall not be permitted </em>upon any street (public or private) within the Headlands where they have the potential to limit, deter, or prevent public access to the shoreline, inland trails, or parklands. In the Strand residential area, gates, guardhouses, barriers, and other structures designed to regulate or restrict public vehicular access into the residential development may be authorized provided that 1) <em>pedestrian and bicycle access from Selva Road [at the top of the Project near the park] and the County Beach parking lot through the residential development to the beach .remains unimpeded </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The City subsequently adopted a plan entitled \u201cThe Headlands Development and Conservation Plan,\u201d which incorporated the local coastal program policies pertaining to the hours of use of the beaches and gates at the Project, mentioned above. The City later approved a coastal development permit for the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">B. <em>The City sets hours for the beach access trails and installs pedestrian gates at the entrance to the trails</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In May 2009, prior to the public opening of the park and beach access trails, the City established that the trails would be open from 8:00 a.m. to either 5:00 p.m. or 7:00 p.m., depending on the time of year. The City also installed gates at the top of the beach access trails that precluded pedestrian access to the trails during hours that the trails were closed. In October 2009, the Commission discovered that the City had installed gates and that it intended to restrict the hours that the trails would be open to the public. The Commission informed the City that its adoption of restrictive hours of operation for the beach access trails and its installation of pedestrian gates at the trailheads constituted violations of the Coastal Act, the local coastal program, and the coastal development permit. The Commission demanded that the City rescind the restrictive hours of operation for the beach access trails and remove the gates. The Commission also informed the City that the City would have to seek an amendment to the local coastal program and a coastal development permit if it wished to adopt such restrictive hours of operation or install gates in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>C. <em>The City adopts the nuisance abatement ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In November 2009, the Commission sent a notice of violation letter to the City, informing the City that it could be subject to enforcement proceedings concerning the gates and the hours of operation on the trails. After the City and the Commission engaged in further communications in an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the issue, the City Council held a meeting on March 22, 2010, at which it considered evidence pertaining to public safety issues at the Project. At this meeting, the City adopted an ordinance, ordinance No. 10-05 (Nuisance Abatement Ordinance), which declared that public nuisance conditions existed in the area of the beach access trails. The Nuisance Abatement Ordinance states, \u201cIn the absence of closure regulations, signs, and gates, restricting public access during closures . . . unlawful activities will occur within ... the general area of Mid-Strand Beach Access and Central Strand Beach Access.\u201d The Nuisance Abatement Ordinance reestablished that the trails would be open from 8:00 a.m. to either 5:00 p.m. or 7:00 p.m., depending on the time of year, and that pedestrian gates would be used to enforce the hours of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">D. <em>The Commission\u2019s hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Three days after the City adopted the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, the Commission issued a \u201cNotification of Appeal Period,\u201d advising the public that the ordinance could be appealed to the Commission. Three appeals were filed: one from a private citizen, Vonne M. Barnes, a second from Surfrider, and a third from two members of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The City filed a letter brief in opposition to the appeals. In its brief, the City argued that the Commission lacked appellate jurisdiction to review a local government\u2019s enactment of an ordinance. The City also argued that under section 30005, subdivision (b), the Commission lacked jurisdiction to review a local government\u2019s nuisance abatement measures. In addition, the City argued that its enactment of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance had been prompted by public safety conditions, and that the measures required by the ordinance were necessary to abate the nuisance conditions near the beach access trails.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On May 13, 2010, the Commission held a hearing at which it considered the appeals and the City\u2019s opposition. At the hearing, the Commission considered whether \u201cthe installation of gates, and the establishment of hours of operations that restrict . . . accessways to the beach\u201d in the Project were exempt from coastal permitting requirements under the Coastal Act. The Commission heard oral presentations from several individuals, including the Commission\u2019s executive director, the city attorney for the City, Barnes, and representatives of Surfrider.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The city attorney argued that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to \u201csecond guess\u201d the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, and that the concerns addressed by the ordinance represented a \u201creal public safety issue.\u201d The Commission\u2019s executive director stated that the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance represented \u201ca flagrant attempt to circumvent the public access policies of the Coastal Act, and circumvent the public access requirements that the Commission imposed on this project . . . .\u201d The executive director added, \u201c[B]ut for the public access that the City is now saying constitutes a nuisance, this project, I would guess[,] would not have been approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Several commissioners made comments indicating their agreement with the executive director. For example, Commissioner Sara Wan stated: \u201c[T]his Commission allowed the destruction of important environmentally sensitive habitat, it allowed the construction of a seawall, and the benefit was public access. [J[] But, from day one, the developer has made every attempt to close that access, and in fact, to never build it, and he came to this Commission in an attempt to get permission not to build it, and this, in my opinion, was a [w]ay for the City to get around the Commission\u2019s requirement for that access . . . . [][] And, that is the danger of this kind of precedent, that any time a community decides they don\u2019t want a public accessway, this is the pathway they can take, so it is very important we send a strong message, ... if you want to close the public accessway, you need to come to this Commission and need to appeal it in a way that if there are legitimate concerns, those concerns are dealt with, but also the public\u2019s rights are protected, and that is the key here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission unanimously denied \u201cthe claim of exemption for the proposed development, on the ground that the development is not exempt from the permitting requirements of the Coastal Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On May 17, the Commission sent the City a letter instructing the City to remove the gates and suspend the restrictive closure hours. The letter stated that if the City failed to comply with the Commission\u2019s directives, \u201cCommission staff will have no choice but to pursue formal enforcement action to resolve this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">E. <em>The City\u2019s petition and complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On May 24, the City filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Orange County Superior Court. In its petition and complaint, the City reiterated the arguments that it had made at the May 13 Commission hearing concerning its contention that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to consider the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. The City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>maintained that the Commission\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over the \u201cenforcement, scope or legality of the City\u2019s nuisance abatement legislation\u201d violated the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The City brought causes of action for traditional and administrative mandamus and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In its prayer for relief, the City requested that the trial court order the Commission to vacate and set aside its actions taken on May 13, 2010, and issue a writ of mandate restraining the Commission from undertaking any future actions to submit the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The City also requested that the court declare that the Commission \u201clacks jurisdiction under Coastal Act section 30005 [, subdivision] (b) to place limitations on the enforcement of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.\u201d In addition, the City sought a declaration that the adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance did not require a coastal development permit application. Finally, the City requested a \u201cstay and/or temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction\u201d barring the Commission from \u201cundertaking any enforcement action arising from [the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">F. <em>The Surfrider petition and complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On June 17, Surfrider filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in which it argued that the City had violated the Coastal Act and its local coastal program by undertaking the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Surfrider raised numerous arguments in support of its contention that the Commission had jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, including that \u201c[sjection 30005 is not a limitless exemption from Coastal Act permitting requirements declared in the name of \u2018nuisance abatement.\u2019 \u201d Surfrider also requested that the court declare that the \u201crecord fails to establish a public nuisance . . . .\u201d In addition, Surfrider contended that the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance should be subjected to a heightened standard of judicial scrutiny because the ordinance violated both a state constitutional guarantee to \u201cmaximum beach access\u201d as well as the right to free assembly guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Surfrider brought causes of action for traditional and administrative mandamus and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Surfrider requested that the trial court direct the City to remove the gates as well as the signs advising the public of the restrictive hours at the Mid-Strand and Central Strand trailheads. Surfrider also requested that the court declare the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance void. In addition, Surfrider asked the court to order the City to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>apply to the Commission for a coastal development permit prior to attempting to undertake the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">G. <em>The court\u2019s consideration of the petitions/complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The trial court consolidated the City\u2019s Case and the Surfrider Case and transferred the consolidated matter from the Orange County Superior Court to the San Diego County Superior Court. The parties lodged the administrative record related to the City\u2019s adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance and the appeals of the ordinance before the Commission, and submitted additional briefing on the petitions/complaints. On April 28, 2011, the court held a hearing on the petitions/complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">H. <em>The trial court\u2019s rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">1. <em>The City\u2019s petition and complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Two days before the hearing on the petitions/complaints, the trial court issued a tentative ruling that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cThe City\u2019s petition sought a writ of mandate commanding the . . . Commission to vacate and set aside its actions taken on May 13, 2010, and restraining the . . . Commission from undertaking any further actions to enforce the . . . Commission\u2019s May 13, 2010, decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">\u201cThe Court\u2019s tentative ruling is to grant this request finding that the . . . Commission lacked the jurisdiction to make a determination as to the appropriateness of the City\u2019s finding of a nuisance. In reaching this result, the Court concludes that the . . . Commission\u2019s actions in this regard were contrary to the express language of . . . section 30005[, subdivision] (b) providing that no provision of the Coastal Act shall limit \u2018the power of any city ... to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">\u201cIn this case, the City has declared a nuisance in the area of Strand Vista Park and mandated enforcement of closure hours for the Mid-Strand and Central Strand access trails. The . . . Commission disagrees with the City\u2019s findings of a nuisance and the manner of abatement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">\u201cRegardless of the merits of the Commission\u2019s arguments concerning the finding of a nuisance, the Court believes that the . . . Commission lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter and that such issues are reserved for adjudication by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cBased on this finding, the Court believes the writ of mandate should issue as requested and further makes the findings at [paragraphs 2 and 3] of the City\u2019s \u2018Request for Relief\u2019 ... of its petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Through its incorporation of the City\u2019s request for relief, the trial court indicated its intent to grant the following declaratory relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201ca. [T]he . . . Commission lacks jurisdiction under Coastal Act section 30005[, subdivision] (b) to place limitations on the enforcement of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cb. [T]he . . . Commission lacks jurisdiction under [the] California Constitution, pursuant to the separation of powers doctrine, to adjudicate whether the City\u2019s adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance was a legitimate and proper exercise of the City\u2019s police power; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201cc. [T]he . . . Commission lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the \u2018appeal,\u2019 and thus lacks jurisdiction to proceed with any subsequent actions based upon the \u2018appeal,\u2019 because the adoption of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance did not require any city \u2018coastal development permit application.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The court also indicated its intent to restrain the Commission from taking \u201cany further action to proceed with or to act upon the appeal of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance or from undertaking any enforcement action arising from said ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">At the conclusion of the April 28 hearing on the petitions/complaints, the trial court confirmed its tentative ruling on the City\u2019s writ petition and complaint, thereby granting the declaratory and injunctive relief described above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">On June 2, the court entered a judgment that states in relevant part: \u201c[T]he . . . Commission\u2019s actions taken on May 13, 2010 (i) determining that City Ordinance No. 10-05 (\u2018Nuisance Abatement Ordinance\u2019), an urgency ordinance adopted by the City Council of the City of Dana Point, raised a substantial issue under the Coastal Act, and (ii) determining that the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance is not exempt from the Coastal Act\u2019s permit requirements (collectively the \u2018Commission\u2019s May 13, 2010 Actions\u2019), are invalid and void insofar as the . . .

In its June 1 order, the court stated that an application of the \u201crational basis standard\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> revealed that the \u201cCity\u2019s record fails to support a public nuisance,\u201d and that \u201cthe [Nuisance Abatement Ordinance] should be set aside.\u201d The court reasoned: \u201cHaving reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties, the Court believes the record was entirely lacking in evidentiary support for declaring a nuisance and that the City acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making such a declaration. Additionally, even if a nuisance existed the Court finds the City acted arbitrarily and capriciously in the manner by which it abated the purported nuisance and that the manner of abatement was entirely lacking in evidentiary support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On July 29, the Court entered a judgment that stated that the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance is \u201cinvalid and void insofar as there was no properly declared nuisance and/or the manner of abatement was excessive.\u201d That same day, the court also issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to set aside the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance and not to take any further actions to enforce that ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">I. <em>The appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Commission appealed from the judgment on the City\u2019s writ petition/complaint and the City and Headlands each appealed from the judgment on Surfrider\u2019s petition/complaint.

The Commission also contends that the trial court erred in concluding that section 30005, subdivision (b) deprived the Commission of jurisdiction to find that the placement of gates at the Mid-Strand and Central Strand trail access points and the adoption of hours of operation for these trails mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance required a coastal development permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We conclude in part III.A.2., <em>post, </em>that the Commission did not have administrative appellate jurisdiction <em>pursuant to section </em>30625 to consider whether the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance required a permit. However, we conclude in part III.A.3., <em>post, </em>that the trial court erred in determining that <em>section 30005, subdivision (b) </em>precludes the Commission from finding that such development required a coastal development permit and in restraining the Commission from taking any future action to submit the development to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. In part IH.A.4., <em>post, </em>we explain how the trial court shall proceed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">1. <em>Overview of the Coastal Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">One of the core principles of the Coastal Act is to maximize public access to the coast, to the extent feasible (\u00a7 30000 et seq.): \u201cThe . . . Coastal Act was passed in 1976. In it, the Legislature announced five \u2018basic goals of the state for the coastal zone.\u2019 (\u00a7 30001.5.) One of these is to \u2018[m]aximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)\u201d <em>(City of Malibu v. California Coastal Com. </em>(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 549, 553 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The Coastal Act has several provisions that implement the act\u2019s public access goals. (See, e.g., \u00a7 30210 [\u201cIn carrying out the requirement of Section 4 of Article X of the California Constitution, maximum access, which shall be conspicuously posted, and recreational opportunities shall be provided for all the people consistent with public safety needs and the need to protect public rights, rights of private property owners, and natural resource areas from overuse.\u201d]; \u00a7 30212, subd. (a) [subject to certain exceptions, \u201cPublic access from the nearest public roadway to the shoreline and along the coast shall be provided in new development projects . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In <em>Citizens for a Better Eureka v. California Coastal Com. </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1580-1581 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 602] <em>(Citizens), </em>the court provided an overview of the regulatory framework contained in the Coastal Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201cA [coastal development permit] is generally required for a development within the coastal zone as defined in the Coastal Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 30103, subd. (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>30600, subd. (a).) A local government within the coastal zone is required to prepare a local coastal program ... for the portion of the coastal zone within its jurisdiction. (\u00a7 30500, subd. (a).) When the Commission has certified a[] [local coastal program] and actions to implement the [local coastal program] have become effective, authority to issue [coastal development permits] within the certified area is delegated from the Commission to the local government, subject to appeals to the Commission. (\u00a7 30519, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cLocal government actions on [coastal development permit] applications for certain types of developments, e.g., those within 100 feet of any wetland, are appealable to the Commission (\u00a7 30603, subd. (a)), and the Commission has appellate jurisdiction to determine whether a [coastal development permit] is consistent with the [local coastal program] and coastal access policies (\u00a7 30603, subd. (b)). In an appeal, the Commission first determines whether a substantial issue as to such consistency has been raised. (\u00a7 30625, subd. (b).) If a substantial issue is presented, the Commission reviews the [coastal development permit] application de novo. (\u00a7 30621, subd. (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 13115, subd.

The Commission has the ultimate authority to ensure that coastal development conforms to the policies embodied in the state\u2019s Coastal Act. In fact, a fundamental purpose of the Coastal Act is to ensure that state policies prevail over the concerns of local government. (See <em>City of Chula Vista v.

The commission may approve, modify, or deny such proposed development, and if no action is taken within the time limit specified in Sections 30621 and 30622, <em>the decision of the local government </em>or port governing body, as the case may be, shall become final, unless the time limit in Section 30621 or 30622 is waived by the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201c(b) The commission shall hear an <em>appeal </em>unless it determines the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201c(1) With respect to <em>appeals </em>pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 30602, that no substantial issue exists as to conformity with Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 30200).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">\u201c(2) With respect to <em>appeals </em>to the commission after certification of a local coastal program, that no substantial issue exists with respect to the grounds on which an appeal has been filed pursuant to Section 30603.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-12\">\u201c(3) With respect to <em>appeals </em>to the commission after certification of a port master plan, that no substantial issue exists as to conformity with the certified port master plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">\u201c(c) Decisions of the commission, where applicable, shall guide local governments or port governing bodies in their future actions under this division.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>b. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The plain language of section 30625 indicates that the statute grants the Commission administrative <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction to hear an <em>appeal </em>of a <em>decision </em>rendered by a local government that has <em>adjudicated </em>a claim related to either a coastal development permit or a claim of exemption from Coastal Act permitting requirements. The statute\u2019s references to <em>\u201cappeals </em>pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 30602\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (b)(1), italics added) and <em>\u201cappeals </em>to the commission after certification of a local coastal program . . . pursuant to Section 30603\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (b)(2), italics added) support that conclusion. Sections 30602 and 30603 provide that the Commission has appellate jurisdiction to review certain quasi-adjudicatory actions taken by local governments in the context of coastal development applications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A municipality\u2019s legislative action in adopting an ordinance is <em>not </em>a quasi-adjudicatory administrative decision as to which the Commission has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625. The City\u2019s enactment of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance thus did not constitute a quasi-adjudicatory \u201cappealable action\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (a)) by a \u201clocal government\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>from which <em>an appeal </em>pursuant to section 30625 could be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Not surprisingly, there is nothing in the Commission\u2019s administrative regulations implementing the Coastal Act that suggests that the Commission has ever interpreted section 30625 as granting it appellate jurisdiction to consider whether development mandated by a local government\u2019s nuisance abatement ordinance, or by any other local ordinance, requires a permit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even the administrative forms used by the Commission in this case indicate that the only matters over which the Commission exercises appellate jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625 are <em>permitting decisions </em>made by a local government. A form entitled \u201cCommission Notification of Appeal\u201d informed the City that \u201cthe coastal development permit decision described below has been appealed to the California Coastal Commission pursuant to . . . Sections 30603 and 30625.\u201d The Commission\u2019s \u201cNotification of Final Appeal Action\u201d states in relevant part, \u201cWhere the Commission vote is \u2018substantial issue,\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>then \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018approval with conditions,\u2019 or \u2018denial\u2019 on the de novo application, the Commission decision <em>replaces the local coastal pertnit </em>decision.\u201d (Italics added.) In this case, the City made no coastal development permit decision, but instead, acted in a legislative capacity in adopting the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Commission contends that the City\u2019s action in adopting the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance amounted to a \u201cclaim of exemption for any development by a local government\u201d within the meaning of section 30625, and is therefore appealable to the Commission. We disagree. The City and Headlands persuasively argue that this portion of section 30625 authorizes the Commission to exercise appellate jurisdiction over quasi-adjudicatory decisions made by a local government on applications for exemptions that are specifically referred to in the Coastal Act, including emergency projects pursuant to section 30610.2, and the construction of certain single-family residences pursuant to section 30600.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> More broadly, while the Commission reads the statute as authorizing review of a <em>local government\u2019s </em>claim of exemption, the statute actually authorizes the Commission to exercise appellate jurisdiction over \u201can appealable action ... by a local government\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (a)). Thus, section 30625, subdivision (a) authorizes the Commission to review the decision of a local government on an <em>applicant\u2019s </em>claim of exemption, not a <em>local government\u2019s </em>claim of exemption. In sum, we conclude that when a municipality acts legislatively in an attempt to exercise nuisance abatement powers pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b), this municipal action does not constitute a \u201cclaim of exemption\u201d as that term is used in section 30625, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Finally, we reject the Commission\u2019s suggestion, raised in its reply brief, that the Commission was authorized to review the City\u2019s enactment of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance because the Commission is authorized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>directly adjudicate certain claims for exemptions from the Coastal Act\u2019s permit requirements, such as vested rights claims pursuant to section 30608.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission appears to theorize that a party may directly challenge a local government\u2019s assertion of abatement authority under section 30005, subdivision (b) before the Commission, pursuant to section 30625, because \u201cvested rights claims are made directly to the Commission.\u201d We reject this argument because the Commission has not demonstrated that in adjudicating a section 30608 claim brought \u201cdirectly to the Commission\u201d it is exercising appellate jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In sum, section 30625 grants the Commission appellate administrative jurisdiction over certain appeals. In this case, the City took no \u201cappealable action\u201d (\u00a7 30625, subd. (a)) from which an appeal could be taken. Thus, the Commission did not have jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625 to consider the validity of the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Accordingly, the actions that the Commission took at the May 13 hearing were unauthorized and, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Notwithstanding our conclusion that the Commission did not have jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625 to consider whether the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance constituted a violation of the local coastal program and required a coastal development permit, we consider below whether the trial court erred in restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining whether the City was acting within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">3. <em>The trial court erred in restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining whether the City was properly acting within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Commission claims that the trial court erred in restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining whether the City was acting within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b). In order to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the Commission\u2019s claim, we must address three subsidiary issues. First, was the City permitted to seek a writ of mandate to preclude the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the City\u2019s actions on the ground that those actions are necessary to abate a nuisance? In part HLA.S.a., <em>post, </em>we conclude that under the unusual circumstances of this case, in which the Commission has already indicated its intent to direct the City to cease implementing the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, the City was entitled to seek a writ of mandate in the trial court to restrain the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the City\u2019s efforts to implement the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Second, what was the City required to demonstrate in order to obtain injunctive or writ relief restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance? In part HI.A.3.b., <em>post, </em>we conclude that the City, as the petitioner/plaintiff in this action, was required to demonstrate that it had exercised its nuisance abatement powers under section 30005, subdivision (b) in good faith, and that it had not adopted the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance as a pretext for avoiding its obligations under the City\u2019s local coastal program. Third, did the trial court err in concluding that the City demonstrated that it was entitled to a writ restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance? In part III.A.3.C., <em>post, </em>we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering the Commission to cease and desist exercising jurisdiction over development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining whether the City\u2019s enactment of the ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">a. <em>The City was entitled to seek a writ of mandate to preclude the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over its actions on the ground that those actions were necessary to abate a nuisance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In light of our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the action taken by the Commission at the May 13, 2010 hearing was void because section 30625 did not grant the Commission jurisdiction to hold such a hearing, we first consider whether the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires us to reverse the trial court\u2019s rulings insofar as the court ordered the Commission to cease and desist taking any <em>future </em>actions to exercise jurisdiction over the development mandated by the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Specifically, we consider whether the exhaustion doctrine requires that we direct the trial court to order the City to submit its contention that the Commission lacks jurisdiction under section 30005, subdivision (b) to the Commission, in the event that the Commission attempts to institute any further proceedings concerning development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the exhaustion doctrine did not preclude the City from seeking writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>relief to restrain the Commission from taking future actions to exercise jurisdiction over the development mandated by the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u201cIn general, a party must exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.

Citing the savings clause contained in former section 4514, subdivision (c), the <em>Pacific Lumber </em>court reasoned, \u201cIn light of the Forest Practice Act\u2019s <em>express </em>disclaimer of any interference with agency responsibilities, and the <em>absence of any irreconcilable conflict between the savings clause and other provisions of the Forest Practice Act, </em>we cannot accept Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument that the act <em>implicitly </em>allocates to the Department of Forestry exclusive responsibility for protecting state waters affected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>timber harvesting, in derogation of the Water Boards\u2019 statutory prerogatives.\u201d <em>(Pacific Lumber, supra, </em>at pp. 926-927, second italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In the course of its ruling, the <em>Pacific Lumber </em>court emphasized that the case did not present a scenario in which the Department of Forestry and the Water Boards had issued orders that directly <em>conflicted </em>with each other: \u201cWe are not faced here with a situation in which it would be literally impossible for a timber harvester to simultaneously comply with conflicting directives issued by the Department of Forestry and the Water Boards. We trust that agencies strive to avoid such conflicts, and express no opinion here regarding the appropriate outcome in a case involving irreconcilable orders. (Cf. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com.[ </em>(1985)] 39 Cal.3d [422,] 442, fn. 20 [217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354] [noting that \u2018any conflicts which may arise in this area can be resolved either by administrative accommodation between the two agencies themselves or, failing that, by sensitive application of evolving judicial principles\u2019].)\u201d <em>(Pacific Lumber, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 936, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In <em>Big Creek, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a county ordinance that regulated the location of helicopter staging, loading, and servicing facilities associated with timber operations was not preempted by a provision of the Forest Practice Act (\u00a74516.5, subd. (d)) that prohibited counties from \u201cregulating] the conduct of timber operations.\u201d (See <em>Big Creek, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 1162.) The <em>Big Creek </em>court supported its preemption conclusion by citing the savings clause contained in former section 4514, subdivision (a). (See <em>Big Creek, supra, </em>at p. 1162 [\u201cIn the case of the helicopter ordinance, which County apparently enacted to address citizens\u2019 fears created by helicopters transporting multi-ton logs by air over or near their neighborhoods, and citizen concerns with throbbing and unbearable noise, the conclusion is buttressed by the fact that ... the [Forest Practice Act] . . . expressly contemplate^] the survival of localities\u2019 power to abate nuisances endangering public health or safety.\u201d].) The <em>Big Creek </em>court did suggest that the nuisance abatement savings clause did not entirely eviscerate the effect of the preemption provision in the statute, noting, \u201cCounty concedes it lacks authority to prohibit timber removal by helicopters or to regulate the manner in which any such removal is conducted.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>Ranter v. Warner-Lambert Co. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 780, 791 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 72] [\u201ca savings clause should not be interpreted in such a way as to undercut or dilute an express preemption clause\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>v. <em>The savings clause of section 30005, subdivision (b) should not be interpreted so broadly as to authorize a local government to avoid the requirements of its local coastal program through a pretextual exercise of its nuisance abatement powers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In interpreting the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b), we consider an issue not directly addressed in the cases discussed above, namely, whether the Legislature intended to authorize a local government to avoid the requirements of its local coastal program by merely declaring a nuisance and prescribing abatement measures, regardless of whether those measures are an artifice for avoiding those requirements. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that section 30005, subdivision (b) may not be so broadly interpreted. In our view, if a trial court finds that a local government has abated a nuisance <em>for the specific purpose of avoiding its local coastal program obligations, </em>the local government is not acting within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b). We conclude that when a local government undertakes development that is directed at a true nuisance, and those abatement measures are narrowly targeted at abating the nuisance <em>(Citizens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1585), the declaration of the nuisance and the abatement measures must be undertaken in good faith, and not as a pretext for avoiding local coastal program obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We begin with the language of the savings clause at issue. Section 30005, subdivision (b) clearly does not expressly permit a local government to avoid the requirements of its local coastal program through a <em>pretextual </em>exercise of its nuisance abatement powers. Despite the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s apparent recognition that section 30005, subdivision (b) should not be interpreted to permit a municipality to exercise its nuisance abatement powers for the specific purpose of avoiding compliance with the municipality\u2019s own local coastal program, the City and Headlands suggest that this court should interpret the statute as stating that no provision of the Coastal Act is a limitation on the power of any city to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances for any reason whatsoever. However, the statute is not so broadly worded.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The City and Headlands ask this court to infer from the lack of express language restricting the scope of a city\u2019s abatement powers preserved under section 30005, subdivision (b), that the Legislature intended for cities\u2019 abatement powers to be unrestricted. In support of this contention, the City and Headlands note that section 30005, subdivision (a) authorizes cities to adopt certain additional regulations \u201cnot in conflict with this act,\u201d while section 30005, subdivision (b) contains no such limitation. The City and Headlands suggest that by negative implication, the Legislature adopted section 30005, subdivision (b) primarily for the purpose of permitting cities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>to abate nuisances in ways that <em>are </em>in conflict with Coastal Act policies. Yet, even though the Legislature intended to permit local governments to engage in legitimate nuisance abatement activities without a coastal development permit, we are not persuaded that the Legislature intended that section 30005, subdivision (b) authorize a city to evade its local coastal program obligations under the guise of nuisance abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">To begin with, this court has offered (albeit without considerable discussion) an interpretation of the statute that directly conflicts with this proposition. (See <em>Conway v. City of Imperial Beach </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 78, 87 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 402] (Conway) [stating that through the enactment of \u00a7 30005, subds. (a) <em>&amp; </em>(b), \u201cthe Legislature clearly intends that local governments retain authority to regulate land or water uses in the coastal zone when necessary to protect coastal resources. <em>This authority exists so long as the regulations enacted are \u2018not in conflict\u2019with the purposes of the Coastal Act.\u201d </em>(italics added)].) Further, neither section 30005, subdivision (a) <em>nor </em>(b) suggests that the Legislature intended that a city be allowed to utilize its abatement powers in ways that conflict with Coastal Act policies when a court determines that the local government\u2019s abatement is a <em>pretext </em>for avoiding local coastal program obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">A careful comparison of the text of the savings clause at issue in this case with the clauses discussed in <em>Big Creek </em>and <em>Pacific Lumber </em>suggests a second textual limitation on the scope of section 30005. As adopted in 1973, former section 4514 of the Forest Practice Act stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cNo provision of this chapter <em>or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the board </em>is a limitation on any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201c(a) On the power of a city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Three years later, in 1976, in adopting section 30005, the Legislature used language nearly identical to that contained in former section 4514, but <em>narrowed </em>the textual scope of the savings clause by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201cNo provision of <em>this division </em>[i.e., the Coastal Act] is a limitation on any of the following: [][]... [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201c(b) On the power of any city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The Coastal Act requires <em>local governments </em>within the coastal zone to adopt their <em>own </em>local coastal programs (\u00a7 30500, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and, after certification of such local coastal programs by the Commission, authorizes those governments to issue permits consistent within these local coastal programs (\u00a7 30519, subd. (a)). Thus, a strong textual argument can be made that the savings clause in section 30005, subdivision (b) does <em>not </em>preserve the authority of a city to exercise abatement powers as a means to avoid its <em>own </em>local coastal program because such local coastal programs are not \u201cprovision[s] of [the Coastal Act]\u201d (\u00a7 30005; see \u00a7 30500). To conclude otherwise would be to say that the Legislature intended that section 30005 be interpreted as broadly as former section 4514, notwithstanding the expressly narrower language in section 30005. In any event, the fact that section 30005 specifically refers to the <em>Coastal Act </em>is consistent with our conclusion that in order to obtain injunctive or writ relief restraining the Commission from enforcing the Coastal Act, a municipality must demonstrate that it is not exercising its nuisance abatement powers for the purpose of avoiding the municipality\u2019s obligations under its own <em>local coastal program </em>in order to demonstrate that its abatement activities are within the savings clause in section 30005, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In addition to the statutory text, the apparent purpose of section 30005, subdivision (b) supports a narrower interpretation of the statute. Section 30005, subdivision (b) preserves the authority of local governments to abate nuisances. Given that a nuisance is something that is \u201cinjurious to health, . . . offensive to the senses, . . . [or] interfere[s] with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3479), a local government\u2019s efforts to abate a nuisance will often be fully consistent with the Coastal Act\u2019s central purpose of \u201c \u2018[p]rotect[ing], maintain[ing], and, where feasible, enhancing] and restoring] the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and artificial resources\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 830, 840 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 354]). It is for this reason that Headlands\u2019s citation to <em>Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 370 [267 Cal.Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976] <em>(Napa </em>Valley) is unpersuasive. In <em>Napa Valley, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that an exemption in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; \u00a7 21000 et seq.) for projects that increased passenger rail services for rail lines already in use should be given effect, despite the fact that the project would have a significant impact on the environment. <em>(Napa Valley, supra, </em>at p. 377.) In rejecting an argument that the exemption should apply only to projects that would <em>not </em>have a significant impact on the environment, the <em>Napa Valley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>court reasoned, \u201cIt is precisely to avoid that burden for an entire class of projects that the Legislature has enacted the exemption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In <em>Napa Valley, </em>the entire <em>purpose </em>of the exemption at issue was to permit projects to be undertaken in a manner <em>contrary </em>to CEQA (i.e., to permit projects to be undertaken without the environmental review specified under CEQA). In this case, in contrast, despite the fact that the Legislature authorized cities to conduct legitimate nuisance abatement activities <em>without </em>a coastal development permit, there is nothing in the Coastal Act that suggests that the Legislature enacted section 30005, subdivision (b) for the specific <em>purpose </em>of ensuring that cities could abate nuisances in ways that <em>would conflict </em>with the Coastal Act\u2019s goals, including maximization of public access to the coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The context in which the nuisance abatement savings clause appears supports the conclusion that the Legislature likely envisioned that section 30005, subdivision (b) would most often be used by cities to abate nuisances in the coastal zone in ways that <em>further </em>the purposes of the Coastal Act. More specifically, the fact that the <em>other </em>provisions of section 30005 authorize actions that are generally taken in a manner <em>consistent </em>with the Coastal Act suggests that the primary purpose of subdivision (b) is to make clear that the Commission does not have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction to take action to protect the coast, and that municipalities may act to legitimately abate a nuisance within the coastal zone without having to obtain a coastal development permit. (See, e.g., \u00a7 30005, subd. (a) [Coastal Act is no limitation on certain regulations concerning \u201cactivity which might adversely affect the resources of the coastal zone\u201d]; <em>id., </em>subd. (c) [Coastal Act is no limitation on certain actions to \u201cenjoin any waste or pollution of the resources of the coastal zone or any nuisance\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Further, construing the generic savings clause in section 30005, subdivision (b) to permit cities to adopt pretextual nuisance abatement measures would have the potential to undermine a host of other California environmental statutes that contain generic nuisance abatement savings clauses similar to section 30005, subdivision (b).

For example, Health and Safety Code section 5411, which governs sewage waste, provides, \u201cNo person shall discharge sewage or other waste, or the effluent of treated sewage or other waste, in any manner which will result in contamination, pollution or a nuisance.\u201d Health and Safety Code section 5415, subdivision (b) states that no provision in the chapter governing sewage waste is a limitation on \u201c[t]he authority of any city or county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u201d Just as Health and Safety Code section 5415 cannot reasonably be interpreted as permitting a City to abate nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>conditions at a landfill by discharging waste as a pretext for avoiding waste discharge obligations under Health and Safety Code section 5411, Public Resources Code section 30005 cannot reasonably be read to authorize a City to abate a nuisance in the coastal zone by authorizing development as a pretext for avoiding local coastal program obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Excluding the pretextual use of nuisance abatement powers from the scope of the safe harbor of section 30005, subdivision (b) is also fully consistent with the narrow construction given the statute in <em>Citizens. </em>(See <em>Citizens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1586 [acknowledging that it was adopting a \u201cnarrow construction\u201d of \u00a7 30005, subd.

This interpretation is also consistent with case law in which courts have refused to interpret savings clauses in a manner that would authorize activity that directly conflicts with the statutory scheme containing the savings clause. (See <em>Dowhal v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 926 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1] (Dowhal) [\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has <em>never </em>interpreted a savings clause so broadly as to permit a state enactment to conflict with a federal regulation scheme.\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Geier v.

Although section 30005, subdivision (b) has been interpreted to permit local governments to engage in nuisance abatement activities without having to obtain a coastal development permit <em>(Citizens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1585), we decline to interpret the provision so broadly as to permit cities to exercise their nuisance abatement authority in a <em>pretextual </em>manner, to avoid local coastal program obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of section 30005, subdivision (b) is also consistent with several rules of statutory construction contained in the Coastal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Act itself. (See \u00a7\u00a7 30007.5 [\u201cThe Legislature further finds and recognizes that conflicts may occur between one or more policies of the division. The Legislature therefore declares that in carrying out the provisions of this division such conflicts be resolved in a manner which on balance is the most protective of significant coastal resources.\u201d], 30009 [\u201cThis division shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes and objectives.\u201d].) Such an interpretation is also consistent with the fact that \u201c \u2018a fundamental purpose of the Coastal Act is to ensure that state policies prevail over the concerns of local government.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Palisades, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that, where a city seeks a court order restraining the Commission from taking enforcement action against the city on the ground that the city is properly exercising its nuisance abatement powers under section 30005, subdivision (b), a court should conclude that the abatement is not within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b) if it determines that the city\u2019s action in declaring a nuisance, or in prescribing the alleged abatement actions, is a pretext for avoiding its obligations under the local coastal program.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We emphasize that because most development within the coastal zone requires a permit (\u00a7\u00a7 30103, subd. (a), 30600, subd. (a)), a trial court cannot conclude that a city is acting outside the scope of its nuisance abatement powers <em>merely </em>by finding that it is taking actions that are in conflict with the Coastal Act. To do so would be to conclude that a city must obtain a coastal development permit <em>any time </em>it abates a nuisance in a coastal zone, contrary to the holding in <em>Citizens. (Citizens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1585, fn. omitted [concluding that a coastal permit is not required \u201c \u2018[w]here a local government properly declares a nuisance, and requires abatement measures that are narrowly targeted at abating the declared nuisance [citation]\u201d].) However, where a local government <em>improperly </em>declares a nuisance as a pretext for avoiding its own local coastal program obligations, section 30005 does not provide a safe harbor from the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>c. <em>The trial court erred in ordering the Commission not to attempt to exercise jurisdiction over development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, without first determining whether the City\u2019s enactment of the ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The trial court concluded that \u201c[rjegardless of the merits of the Commission\u2019s arguments concerning the finding of a nuisance, ... the Coastal Commission lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter and . . . such issues are reserved for adjudication by the courts.\u201d The trial court also ruled that \u201cthe . . . Commission lacks jurisdiction under Coastal Act section 30005[, subdivision] (b) to place limitations on the enforcement of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.\u201d The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the Commission to \u201ccease and desist from any actions to enforce or otherwise attempt to submit the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance to the jurisdiction of the . . . Commission.\u201d Through these rulings, it appears that the trial court concluded that the City\u2019s mere declaration that it was exercising nuisance abatement powers pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b) deprived the Commission of any jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Alternatively, the trial court may have intended to conclude that the Commission could assume jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance only if the trial court were subsequently to invalidate the ordinance in the Surfrider Case. In either instance, the court erred in granting a petition for writ of mandate restraining the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining, <em>in the City\u2019s Case, </em>whether the City was acting properly within the scope of its nuisance abatement powers pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Consistent with our interpretation of section 30005, subdivision (b) in part III.A.3.b., <em>ante, </em>prior to granting the City relief and ordering the Commission to refrain from exercising jurisdiction over development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, the trial court was required to determine whether there was an actual nuisance, and if so, whether \u201cthe development \u2018activity exceeds the amount necessary\u2019 [citation] \u2018simply to abate the nuisance\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Citizens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1585.) The trial court was also required to determine whether the City\u2019s enactment of the ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program. In the companion Surfrider Case, the trial court reviewed a considerable amount of evidence bearing on the issue of pretext and the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the abatement measures that the City enacted in the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. For example, the trial court considered evidence pertaining to the conditions that allegedly support the nuisance declaration and the measures that the City claimed were necessary to abate the alleged nuisance. The trial court also heard evidence concerning whether the City\u2019s chosen abatement measures conflicted with the City\u2019s obligations under the local coastal program. The court was presented with evidence pertaining to provisions in the local coastal program concerning trail access, and evidence that the Commission had rejected a previous request from Headlands to be relieved of some of the requirements in the local coastal program pertaining to such access based on alleged geotechnical and engineering difficulties. The court also heard evidence that the City adopted the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance only after the Commission \u201cdemanded that the City revoke the hours and remove the gates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Based on the trial court\u2019s statements in its order granting the petition for writ of mandate in the Surfrider Case, it appears that the trial court is likely to find on remand in this case that the City\u2019s enactment of the ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that the development mandated by the City exceeded the amount necessary to abate any actual nuisance.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, because the trial court did not consider these precise issues in the context of the City\u2019s writ petition/complaint, we conclude that the trial court should be afforded that opportunity in the first instance on remand, in accordance with our directions in part III.A.4., <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">4. <em>Proceedings on remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In part III.A.2., <em>ante, </em>we concluded that the Commission lacked appellate jurisdiction pursuant to section 30625 to consider the validity of the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. The portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment and the peremptory writ of mandate declaring the Commission\u2019s May 13 actions invalid are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In part III.A.3., <em>ante, </em>we concluded that the trial court erred in determining that section 30005, subdivision (b) precludes the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance without first determining whether City\u2019s enactment of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program. That portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the Commission lacks jurisdiction over the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance pursuant to section 30005, subdivision (b), and that portion of the trial court\u2019s peremptory writ of mandate ordering the Commission to \u201ccease and desist from any actions to enforce or otherwise attempt to submit the City\u2019s Nuisance Abatement Ordinance to the jurisdiction of the . . .

If the court determines that the City adopted the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance solely as a pretext for avoiding obligations under the local coastal program and/or that the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance exceeds the amount necessary to abate the nuisance, the court is directed to enter a new judgment in favor of the Commission. The court\u2019s judgment shall deny the City\u2019s request for a peremptory writ of mandate insofar as it seeks to prohibit the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over development that the court determines to be outside the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">If the court determines that the City has established that it did <em>not </em>act to enact the ordinance as a pretext to engage in development that would otherwise be subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, or that it did not mandate development in excess of that necessary to abate the nuisance, the court is directed to grant judgment in favor of the City and to issue a peremptory writ of mandate prohibiting the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The trial court is free to determine the procedural manner by which it will address these issues, including whether to order supplemental briefing and/or to hold additional hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>B. <em>The City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In their appeals, the City and Headlands contend that the trial court erred in declaring the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance \u201cinvalid and void insofar as there was no properly declared nuisance and/or the manner of abatement was excessive.\u201d Surfrider contends that the trial court properly determined that the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance lacks any rational basis. In the alternative, Surfrider contends that the ordinance infringes on various constitutional rights. For the reasons stated below, we elect to hold the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals in abeyance, since the final resolution of the issues in the related consolidated case may moot the issues raised in the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In the Commission\u2019s appeal in the City\u2019s Case, we held that the trial court erred in concluding that section 30005, subdivision (b) precludes the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. We also determined that the case must be remanded for further proceedings that may, and likely will, permit the Commission to exercise jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. Further, to the extent that the Commission is permitted to exercise such jurisdiction, the Commission has made it clear that it intends to prohibit the development in question.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Under these circumstances, it is likely that a final resolution of the issues in the City\u2019s Case will moot the controversy in the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeal in the Surfrider Case. In fact, the City essentially made this argument in the trial court, stating, \u201c[I]f the Lead Action [(i.e., the City\u2019s Case)] is resolved in favor of the Commission, [Surfrider\u2019s] claims will be <em>moot, </em>since the Commission has already taken the action necessary to prevent the enforcement of the City\u2019s Ordinance.\u201d (See <em>Wilson v.

Such an approach also allows for the possibility that any future litigation over the validity of the Commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance will be unencumbered by what might well become essentially an advisory opinion from this court concerning the related, but distinct, issues raised in the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Accordingly, we will hold the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals in abeyance, pending a final resolution of the issues in the City\u2019s Case, including any future action taken by the Commission for the purpose of directing the City to cease and desist undertaking the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">With respect to case No. D060260, the trial court\u2019s June 2, 2011 judgment and accompanying writ of mandate are affirmed insofar as the court concluded that the Commission\u2019s actions taken at its May 13, 2010 hearing are invalid and void.

Holding the City\u2019s and Headlands\u2019s appeals in abeyance allows the issues of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the development to be resolved in the first instance in the context of litigation concerning the City\u2019s petition/complaint against the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b226-8\">BENKE, Acting P. J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AOO\">I disagree with three aspects of the majority\u2019s opinion. First, the majority mischaracterizes the relief the City of Dana Point (the City) sought in its petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief. The face of the City\u2019s petition and complaint is quite clear: it only seeks a determination that under Public Resources Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 30005, subdivision (b), the California Coastal Commission (the Commission) lacks the power to determine the validity of the City\u2019s nuisance ordinance. Nothing in the City\u2019s petition can be interpreted as requesting the trial court to determine the ultimate question of whether the ordinance is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Second, and more importantly, the majority improperly requires the City establish that its ordinance was valid. The City\u2019s ordinance is presumptively valid, and the City was not required to establish the validity of its ordinance before enforcing the separation of powers principles embodied in section 30005, subdivision (b). Rather, by its terms, section 30005, subdivision (b) plainly placed that burden on the Commission. I note the Commission could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>have brought a cross-complaint challenging the validity of the City\u2019s ordinance or joined the Surfrider Foundation\u2019s action (the Surfrider case), which directly challenged the validity of the nuisance ordinance. However, the Commission chose not to take either course.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As a practical matter, by depriving the municipalities of the presumption that their nuisance ordinances are valid, the majority\u2019s opinion will require that municipalities either obtain the approval of the Commission before exercising the power expressly and unconditionally provided to them by section 30005, subdivision (b) or be prepared to litigate their right to declare and abate nuisances. That circumstance improperly infringes on the City\u2019s well-established constitutional and statutory prerogatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Third, I am baffled by the majority\u2019s unwillingness to address and dispose of the issues raised in the City\u2019s appeal from the judgment entered by the trial court in the Surfrider case. The City\u2019s appeal in the Surfrider case, on a fully developed record, presents what will no doubt appear to the parties and the public to be precisely the issue the majority is requiring the trial court to revisit in the City\u2019s case against the Commission. Not only do considerations of judicial economy suggest that we consider and determine the validity of the City\u2019s ordinance at this point, but also the public\u2019s substantial interest in access to the beach at the Headlands will continue to be burdened with what the trial court has determined were unlawful limitations while the trial court and the parties are compelled to again address issues we could and should resolve in the Surfrider case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We should affirm the judgment in the City\u2019s case against the Commission and directly address the merits of the issues presented in the Surfrider case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n sum, the City asked the trial court to \u2022 rule that the City was legitimately exercising nuisance abatement powers under section 30005, subdivision (b) and that the Commission therefore lacked jurisdiction to restrict any action that the City might take pursuant to those powers\u201d is at direct odds with what the City asked for in its action against the Commission. In fact, the City only asked the trial court to determine that the Commission had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of its ordinance and therefore the trial court need not determine whether the nuisance ordinance was valid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>I note that in moving for judgment on the pleadings, the City argued the Commission had no authority to review the validity of the ordinance and that instead only the courts have that power. In opposing the City\u2019s complaint and petition, the Commission relied on the factual record developed in Commission proceedings to argue that the nuisance ordinance was arbitrary and capricious. In responding to the Commission\u2019s factual presentation on the merits of the ordinance, the City stated: \u201cThe issue in this case ... is <em>not </em>whether the Commission\u2019s decision was supported by any (let alone substantial) evidence. Rather, the issue in front of this Court is whether the Commission had the <em>legal </em>jurisdiction to act in the first place. The Commission\u2019s factual evidence is irrelevant.\u201d The City went so far as to assert not only that the Commission\u2019s factual presentation was irrelevant but that \u201c[t]he factual evidence supporting the City\u2019s decision is likewise unrelated to the issue of whether the Commission\u2019s actions were in excess of its jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The trial court agreed with the City and determined the Commission had no power to pass upon the validity of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Given this record, it is simply not fair to the City or the trial court to attribute to the City a claim it did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">However, more important than the majority\u2019s mischaracterization of the relief the City requested, is the majority\u2019s alteration of the clear separation of powers set forth in section 30005, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">By its terms, section 30005 states: \u201cNo provision of this division <em>is a limitation </em>. . . : [f] . . . [f ] (b) On the power of any city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.) In light of this provision, which expressly and unconditionally permits local regulation of nuisances, we cannot imply the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act; \u00a7 30000 et seq.) nonetheless somehow limits or preempts the City\u2019s power to declare, prohibit and abate nuisances: \u201cThere can be no preemption by implication if the Legislature has expressed an intent to permit local regulation or if the statutory scheme recognizes local regulation.\u201d <em>(Delta Wetlands Properties v. County of San Joaquin </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 128, 143 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 672], citing <em>People ex rel. Deukmejian </em>v. <em>County of Mendocino </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 476, 485 [204 Cal.Rptr. 897, 683 P.2d 1150].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Although Public Resources Code section 30005, subdivision (b) expressly and without limitation preserves the traditional police power of municipalities over nuisances (see Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7; Gov. Code, \u00a7 38771), the majority\u2019s opinion substantially impairs that power. The impairment arises out of the majority\u2019s holding that as a condition of obtaining the protection expressly provided by section 30005, subdivision (b), the City must show that its ordinance is valid and not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">There of course can be no serious question that the majority opinion in fact gives the Commission power to determine the validity of nuisance ordinances. Section III.A.4. of the majority opinion specifically states that on remand the trial court is directed to determine if the City was acting within the scope of section 30005, subdivision (b) in adopting its nuisance ordinance, and \u201c[z]ra <em>making this determination, the trial court shall decide whether the City\u2019s enactment of the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance was a pretext for avoiding the requirements of its local coastal program and, if the court determines that there is an actual nuisance, whether the development mandated by the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance exceeds the amount necessary to abate that nuisance.\u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 207, italics added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>majority opinion goes on to say: \u201cIf the court determines that the <em>City has established </em>that it did <em>not </em>act to enact the ordinance as a pretext. . . . \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 207, first italics added, second italics in original.) Nothing on the face of the Coastal Act places such a burden on a municipality, and important principles of municipal and constitutional law suggest that any burden with respect to the validity of a municipal nuisance ordinance rests with the Commission, not the municipality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Initially, I note the City\u2019s adoption of the nuisance ordinance was presumptively valid. \u201cIn determining whether a particular ordinance represents a valid exercise of the police power, the courts \u2018simply determine whether the statute or ordinance reasonably relates to a legitimate governmental purpose.\u2019 [Citation.] Every intendment is in favor of the validity of the exercise of the police power, and even though a court may differ from the determination of the legislative body, the ordinance will be upheld so long as it bears substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.\u201d <em>(Ensign Bickford Realty Corp. v. City Council </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 467, 474 [137 Cal.Rptr. 304].) Thus, \u201cwhere no right of free speech or any other fundamental right is involved or presented ... the burden is upon the one who attacks an ordinance valid on its face and enacted under lawful authority, to prove facts to establish its invalidity.\u201d <em>(City of Corona v. Corona Etc. Independent </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 382, 384 [252 P.2d 56]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 664 [presumption official duty has been regularly performed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Secondly, the specific power to declare and abate nuisances is provided to municipalities both by article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution, which recognizes that municipalities may make and enforce \u201call local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws,\u201d and Government Code section 38771, which gives city legislative bodies the power to declare \u201cwhat constitutes a nuisance.\u201d (See <em>City of Costa Mesa v. Soffer </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 378, 383 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 735].) Because a municipality\u2019s police power is inherent, rather than delegated from the state, our Supreme Court has been \u201c \u2018 \u201creluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation when there is significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{City of Riverside </em>v. <em>Inland Empire Patients Health &amp; Wellness Center, Inc. </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 729, 744 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 409, 300 P.3d 494] <em>{City of Riverside))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In its quite recent decision in <em>City of Riverside, </em>the Supreme Court found no conflict between a local ordinance which declared that any operation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>marijuana dispensary could be abated as a nuisance and the express or implied provisions of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (CUA; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.5 et seq.) and the Medical Marijuana Program (MMP; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.7 et seq.), which shield individuals from criminal prosecution for possessing medical marijuana or operating a collective that dispenses it. <em>(City of Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at pp. 744-745.) In interpreting the CUA and MMP in a careful and restrained manner, which focused on their operative provisions rather than their far broader purposes, the court noted: \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe common thread of the cases is that if there is a significant local interest to be served which may differ from one locality to another then the presumption favors the validity of the local ordinance against an attack of state preemption.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Riverside, </em>at p. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">I think the majority here errs in failing to interpret the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; \u00a7 21000 et seq.) in the careful and restrained manner employed by the Supreme Court in <em>City of Riverside </em>and, more importantly, in failing to give the City the benefit of the presumption that its ordinance was valid. In particular, the majority\u2019s use of the general overall goals of CEQA as grounds for limiting the City\u2019s historical police powers is incongruent with the deference <em>City of Riverside </em>requires that we give the City\u2019s exercise of those very same powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I do not by any means suggest that a municipality has unfettered power to declare a nuisance when it has no basis for doing so. Notwithstanding its constitutional, common law and statutory powers to abate nuisances, a municipality may not by a mere \u201c \u2018declaration that specified property is a nuisance, make it one when in fact it is not.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Leppo </em>v. <em>City of Petaluma </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 711, 718 [97 Cal.Rptr. 840].) However, while any affected party may certainly challenge the validity of an ordinance, assigning the burden of proof to the appropriate party has tremendous practical implications. If, as the majority holds, a municipality must bear the burden of establishing the validity of a nuisance ordinance, as a practical matter the City must either obtain the concurrence of the Commission before acting or be prepared to bear the considerable expense of establishing the validity of its action rather than simply defending it. In short, the rule announced by the majority creates a substantial disincentive to exercise the inherent police power recognized in our Constitution and expressly preserved by section 30005, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">As I noted at the outset, the Commission could have, but chose not to, bring a cross-complaint in the City\u2019s action against it, and it could have, but chose not to, join in Surfnder\u2019s action against the City. In litigating such claims, the Commission could have vigorously attacked the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>City\u2019s ordinance, but importantly consistent with the deference owed to the City\u2019s exercise of its police power, the Commission would have borne the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">I also observe the Commission has plenary power over the City\u2019s adoption of a local coastal program. <em>(Pacific Palisades, </em>supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 794.) Arguably, in light of the gates the City required under its nuisance powers, the Commission could have reconsidered its approval of the City\u2019s local coastal program and the power it gave the City to issue coastal development permits. However, in light of section 30005, the Commission may not directly interfere with the City\u2019s well-established and well-protected nuisance powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In sum, because the City was not required to show that its ordinance was valid, it was entitled to the relief the trial court provided to it under section 30005, subdivision (b). Thus, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in the City\u2019s action against the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">My third area of disagreement with my colleagues is their unwillingness to reach the City\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment in the Surfrider case. Rather than staying the City\u2019s appeal in the Surfrider case, I think it is imperative that we reach the merits of the City\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment in the Surfrider case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">As I noted at the outset, in the Surfrider case the trial court determined that the City\u2019s ordinance is invalid; that the gates required by the ordinance are unlawful because there was no evidence of a nuisance; and that City\u2019s use of gates to abate any nuisance was arbitrary and capricious. If the trial court was correct, the public\u2019s interest in unfettered access to the beach in the Headlands will continue to be impaired while (1) the trial court once again determines the precise issue it determined in the Surfrider case and (2) we are once again presented with an appeal on the merits of the City\u2019s nuisance ordinance. I fail to understand what public or jurisprudential interest is served by such a multiplicity of proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied July 10, 2013, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

Such a concession, if it was made, was erroneous, because, as I have explained, the City\u2019s complaint and petition contain no such request. However, after listening to a recording of the oral argument, I am not at all certain that such a concession was ever intended by counsel at argument in this court.

I think it\u2019s an important question, and you know our thought on that. We put that in our brief, that that court gets to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201cJustice Benke: If we conclude that they do get to decide, then where does that leave you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">\u201cCity Attorney: That the Commission gets to decide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cJustice Aaron: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\">\u201cCity Attorney: I\u2019d be sad. (laughter and some inaudible comments) In terms of this case, it would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and, I\u2019d have to think that one through. I\u2019m not sure what the impact would be. I guess it would reverse the writ that was issued against the Commission and would send it back to the trial court for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-16\">\u201cJustice Benke: I thought the trial court had made a conclusion. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019d have to go back and look at the language again. That the trial court had made an actual determination that the manner of enforcing policing power was overbroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-17\">\u201cJustice Aaron: But that was in the Surfrider case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">\u201cJustice Benke: That was in Surfrider. Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. I\u2019m addressing Surfrider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">\u201cCity Attorney: Surfrider\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-20\">\u201cJustice Benke: No, I think it just got straightened out. I think you were originally addressing the Commission case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-21\">\u201cCity Attorney: The Commission never sued saying we\u2019ve ceded nuisance. They sued saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-22\">\u201cJustice Aaron: Yeah, but the City did ask for a declaration that it was legitimately exercising its nuisance abatement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-23\">\u201cCity Attorney: And the court said\u2014Surfrider said it wasn\u2019t a nuisance. The court agreed that it wasn\u2019t a nuisance. The court said it\u2019s a rational basis standard as to whether it was a nuisance or not. The question of is it nuisance or development, which is kind of the issue that the . . . case throws out there you were inquiring about before, would really be a factual inquiry, and that factual inquiry never occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-24\">\u201cJustice Benke: That\u2019s why I asked about the record. Where do we go for a record on that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-25\">\u201cCity Attorney: That question was never addressed. We certainly never argued it before the trial court because it never came up in the context of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">As I read these remarks, counsel makes it fairly clear that in the City\u2019s action against the Commission, the validity of the ordinance was not litigated but that the issue was fully considered in the Surfrider action.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-27\">I also note that at oral argument, the Commission\u2019s counsel suggested if we affirm the trial court\u2019s order in Surfrider, the jurisdictional question we consider in the City\u2019s case would be moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> In light of <em>Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates, LLC </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 783, 794, 810-811 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 383, 288 P.3d 717] <em>{Pacific Palisades), </em>it is now clear a municipality\u2019s local coastal program is itself a provision of the Coastal Act.
