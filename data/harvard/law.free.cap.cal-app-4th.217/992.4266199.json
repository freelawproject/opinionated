(Philip Morris) seeking damages for lung cancer he developed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>smoking Philip Morris cigarettes and was awarded compensatory and punitive damages. He died while the verdict was on appeal. <em>(Boeken </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1640 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 638] (Richard\u2019s action).) In this case, Dylan Boeken (Dylan), Richard\u2019s son, brought a wrongful death action against Philip Morris for Richard\u2019s death and recovered $12.8 million for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">On appeal, in the published portion of this opinion, we discuss and reject Philip Morris\u2019s contentions that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the proper measure of Dylan\u2019s damages. Relying on <em>Blackwell v. American Film Co. </em>(1922) 189 Cal. 689 [209 P. 999] (Blackwell), Philip Morris contends that when a personal injury plaintiff who was fully compensated in a lawsuit for his injuries and resulting physical incapacity dies from those injuries, a surviving child\u2019s wrongful death loss of consortium damages are measured from the decedent\u2019s postinjury diminished condition at the time of death. Also in the published portion of this opinion, as to Dylan\u2019s cross-appeal, we hold he may not recover interest on his award because his Code of Civil Procedure section 998 (section 998) offer of settlement did not include the statutorily required \u201cprovision that allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we deal with Philip Morris\u2019s contentions concerning another jury instruction and the application of collateral estoppel. We affirm the judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">In Richard\u2019s action, the \u201cjury found that Philip Morris products consumed by [Richard] were defective either in design or by failure to warn prior to 1969, resulting in injuries to [Richard]. The jury also found liability to [Richard] based upon fraud by intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, false promise, and negligent misrepresentation, concluding that [Richard] had justifiably relied upon fraudulent utterances and concealment by Philip Morris.\u201d <em>(Boeken v. Philip Morris, Inc., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1649-1650.) The jury awarded Richard compensatory damages of over $5.5 million and punitive damages in an amount that ultimately was reduced on appeal to $50 million. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Richard died while that verdict was on appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1649, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Richard\u2019s widow, Judy Boeken, acting for herself and Dylan, filed an action against Philip Morris seeking wrongful death damages. Her wrongful death claim was dismissed on the ground it was barred by the res judicata effect of a voluntary dismissal with prejudice of her prior action. <em>(Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) </em>48 Cal.4th 788 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>In his second amended complaint for wrongful death, Dylan alleged that Richard died on January 16, 2002, from injuries caused by Philip Morris products. Dylan had claims for negligence, strict liability (failure \u201cto give warnings and/or instructions prior to July 1, 1969\u201d), and fraudulent concealment. Dylan asserted that \u201coffensive collateral estoppel applies to the issues of liability and causation of the injury which subsequently caused\u201d Richard\u2019s death and sought damages for loss of consortium and funeral and burial expenses. Dylan later limited his claims based on Philip Morris\u2019s fraudulent concealment to the period prior to July 1, 1969. Prior to trial, Dylan served on Philip Morris an offer to allow judgment under section 998 in the amount of $4.95 million, which offer Philip Morris did not accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Prior to trial, Philip Morris moved for an order that offensive collateral estoppel did not apply to preclude it from relitigating its liability. The trial court denied the motion. The trial court also denied Philip Morris\u2019s requests to instruct the jury that Dylan\u2019s damages for loss of consortium were to be based on Richard\u2019s condition as it existed at the time of Richard\u2019s death and to modify an instruction on wrongful death damages to state explicitly that Dylan could not recover for any emotional injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">At trial, Dylan called a number of witnesses who testified that Richard was a good father who had a close relationship with Dylan throughout Dylan\u2019s childhood and up to the time of Richard\u2019s death. Philip Morris did not call any witnesses who challenged the nature of Dylan\u2019s relationship with his father, and does not raise on appeal the admissibility or substance of the testimony of Dylan\u2019s witnesses on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">At the close of Dylan\u2019s case, Philip Morris moved for a directed verdict, arguing that Dylan had not shown compensable damages by measuring the damages from the condition of Richard at the time of his death. The trial court denied the motion. The jury returned a verdict for Dylan, awarding him $12.8 million in damages. Philip Morris moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that Dylan failed to show damages under the proper measure of damages. It also moved for a new trial, in part, on the grounds that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the measure of Dylan\u2019s damages and in applying offensive collateral estoppel to the issue \u00f3f its liability. The trial court denied Philip Morris\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Dylan moved for an award of prejudgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3291 (section 3291) on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict exceeded his section 998 offer. The trial court, in denying the motion, ruled that Dylan\u2019s section 998 offer was invalid because it did not contain the required acceptance provision that allowed Philip Morris to indicate that it accepted the offer by signing a statement in the offer that it was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>Philip Morris appeals from the judgment. Dylan cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s order denying prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">I. \u2022 <em>Dylan\u2019s Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Philip Morris contends that when, as here, a personal injury plaintiff (Richard) who brought an action in which he was fully compensated for his injuries and resulting physical incapacity dies from those injuries, his child\u2019s (Dylan\u2019s) damages in a subsequent wrongful death action\u2014here, loss of consortium damages\u2014are based on the decedent\u2019s postinjury diminished condition at the time of death. Philip Morris argues that the application of such a rule would, in effect, prohibit any recovery to Dylan\u2014presumably on the theory that Richard, due to his lung cancer, was unable to provide Dylan any comfort, society, or protection at the time of Richard\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">\u201cUnlike some jurisdictions wherein wrongful death actions are derivative, Code of Civil Procedure section 377.60 \u2018creates a <em>new cause of action </em>in favor of the heirs as beneficiaries, based upon their own independent pecuniary injury suffered by loss of a relative, and distinct from any the deceased might have maintained had he survived. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Horwich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 283 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927].)  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.61, damages for wrongful death \u201care measured by the financial benefits the heirs were receiving at the time of death, those reasonably to be expected in the future, and the monetary equivalent of loss of comfort, society, and protection. <em>(Corder v. Corder </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 644, 661 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 660, 161 P.3d 172] <em>(Corder).)\u201d (Mendoza </em>v. <em>City of West Covina </em>(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 702, 720 [141 Cal.Rptr.3d 553] <em>(Mendoza).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">In <em>Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at pages 795 through 796, our Supreme Court explained: \u201cOriginally, the recovery in wrongful death actions was limited to \u2018pecuniary injury\u2019 (Stats. 1862, ch. 330, \u00a7 3, p. 448), which some courts interpreted to mean that only economic losses were compensable (such as loss of financial support or household services). As early as 1911, however, we recognized the right of wrongful death plaintiffs to recover <em>noneconomic </em>damages, including damages for loss of society and comfort, so long as the damages were not based merely on grief or sorrow. (See <em>Bond v. United Railroads of San Francisco </em>(1911) 159 Cal. 270, 285-286 [113 P. 366].) In <em>Krouse v. Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 67-70 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022], we confirmed that loss of consortium damages are recoverable in wrongful death actions.\u201d California permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>recovery in a child\u2019s wrongful death action for loss of a parent\u2019s consortium. <em>(Borer v. American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 441, 451 [138 Cal.Rptr. 302, 563 P.2d 858].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Philip Morris contends that the Supreme Court in <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689 established what the proper measure of Dylan\u2019s damages should have been\u2014i.e., damages based on Richard\u2019s postinjury diminished condition at the time of Richard\u2019s death. In <em>Blackwell, </em>Edward Blackwell\u2019s leg was injured in an automobile accident. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 692.) He brought an action for his injuries and recovered $13,762. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 693.) While the judgment was on appeal, Mr. Blackwell died from shock following an operation on his leg. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 692-693.) The judgment, which was affirmed, was paid to Mr. Blackwell\u2019s wife, Rachel Blackwell, as administratrix of his estate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Mrs. Blackwell then brought a wrongful death action and recovered $10,000. <em>(Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. at pp. 692-693.) On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give two instructions to the effect that the jury, in estimating damages, \u201ccould consider the physical condition of [the] decedent immediately prior to his last operation, in determining the probable amount of <em>financial assistance </em>he would have rendered to his widow and children.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 702, italics added.) The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument because the jury had been instructed at the defendant\u2019s request with an instruction that was substantially similar to the two refused instructions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (189 Cal. at p. 702.) Mrs. Blackwell disputed the soundness of the instruction given, as well as the two rejected instructions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court said, \u201cThe question in this case was what pecuniary loss was suffered by respondent and her children by reason of the loss of decedent in his crippled condition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 697.) The court added, \u201c[A]s already pointed out, decedent was fully compensated for the injuries sustained by him and for his resulting physical incapacity and in estimating the pecuniary loss resulting to [Mrs. Blackwell] by virtue of his death it was necessary to take into consideration his crippled condition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 702.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Philip Morris concludes from <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689, that \u201cwhere the defendant has <em>already </em>been required to fully compensate the decedent for the harm of reducing him from his pre-injury healthy condition to his pre-death diminished condition, his heirs cannot collect a second time for that reduction in the decedent\u2019s condition in a wrongful death case.\u201d Thus, according to Philip Morris, loss of consortium damages are to be determined by considering only the decedent\u2019s postinjury physical condition at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>At trial, Philip Morris requested two instructions consistent with its view of the proper measure of damages based on its interpretation of the holding in <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689. Those instructions would have required the jury to determine Dylan\u2019s damages based on the \u201cconditions existing at the time of death\u201d and to consider \u201c[t]he health of the deceased . . . immediately before death.\u201d The trial court denied the requests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court also denied Philip Morris\u2019s motions for a directed verdict, for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial on the asserted ground that Dylan had failed to show damages under what Philip Morris argued was the proper measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Philip Morris overstates the relevant holding in <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689. Reasonably read, the holding by the court in <em>Blackwell </em>applies to lost economic support and not to lost consortium. The instructions at issue in <em>Blackwell </em>concerned damages for the <em>\u201cfinancial assistance </em>[Mr. Blackwell] would have rendered to his widow and children\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 702, italics added)\u2014i.e., the pecuniary loss of economic support\u2014and not the pecuniary value of the \u201closs of [his] comfort, society, protection, nurture and education\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 701).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">In describing Mr. Blackwell\u2019s recovery in his personal injury action, the court in <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689 stated, \u201cThe verdict and judgment in that action established the fact that he was damaged to the extent fixed by the verdict, and this represents his decreased earning capacity, injuries, pain and suffering.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 696-697.) Thus, the court reasoned, the question in Mrs. Blackwell\u2019s subsequent wrongful death \u201ccase was what pecuniary loss was suffered by [her] and her children by reason of the loss of decedent in his crippled condition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 697.) Because Mr. Blackwell had been compensated for his decreased earning capacity in his personal injury action, Mrs. Blackwell could not recover again for those damages in her wrongful death action. That is, in determining Mrs. Blackwell\u2019s economic support damages, the jury was to consider Blackwell\u2019s decreased earning capacity caused by his \u201ccrippled condition.\u201d As the court stated in <em>Fein </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical </em>Group (1985) 38 Cal.3d 137 [211 Cal.Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665], \u201cIn <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>American Film </em>Co. (1922) 189 Cal. 689, 700-702 [209 P. 999], we held that in a wrongful death case, a jury was properly instructed that in computing damages it should consider the amount the decedent had obtained from defendant in an earlier judgment as compensation for the impairment of his future earning capacity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 154-155; see 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 1168, 1187, pp. 530-531, 554-557.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Philip Morris contends that the court in <em>Blackwell </em>dealt with \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d that included both loss of consortium as well as \u201cthe probable amount of financial assistance.\u201d <em>(Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. at 702.) We read the court\u2019s discussion of the decedent\u2019s \u201ccondition . . . immediately prior to his last operation\u201d as concerning only \u201cthe probable amount of financial assistance he would have rendered to his widow and children.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">To read <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>189 Cal. 689, as does Philip Morris, makes little sense. <em>Blackwell </em>dealt with a concern about a double recovery <em>(id. </em>at p. 702), which is not an issue in a loss of consortium claim brought by a decedent\u2019s child. According to Philip Morris, had Richard lived without lung cancer, but been killed instantly by some other tortious means, Dylan would have been entitled to recover against the tortfeasor; but because Richard died a long, agonizing death caused by Philip Morris, Dylan is entitled to no recovery. Or, as argued by Dylan, under Philip Morris\u2019s contention, if two people, are hit in a crosswalk by an automobile and one is killed instantly and the other dies in a week from severe injuries, the child of the first accident victim would be entitled to loss of consortium damages but the child of the second accident victim would not. Our 1922 Supreme Court could not have intended such an absurd result. As Justice Cardozo wrote in 1920, \u201cwe are not to close our eyes as judges to what we must perceive as men.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Knapp </em>(1920) 230 N.Y. 48, 63 [129 N.E. 202].) Or as another jurist recently observed, \u201cThere is enough unavoidable absurdity in life. We should avoid absurdity in the law.\u201d <em>(Zack </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(11th Cir. 2013) 704 F.3d 917, 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Accordingly, the trial court in this case did not err in refusing Philip Morris\u2019s two proposed jury instructions, and in denying its request to modify CACI No. 3921, its motion for a directed verdict, its motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and its motion for a new trial, all of which were based on the erroneous ground that Dylan\u2019s loss of consortium damages were to be measured from Richard\u2019s physical condition at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">II.-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>IV. <em>Prejudgment Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">According to Dylan, the trial court erred when it denied his motion for prejudgment interest under section 3291<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the ground that his section 998<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> offer to allow judgment failed to include a provision allowing Philip Morris to accept the offer by signing a statement that the offer was accepted. Dylan asserts that we should interpret section 998\u2019s language that such an \u201cacceptance provision\u201d \u201cshall\u201d be included in a section 998 offer as \u201cdirective\u201d and not \u201cmandatory.\u201d The trial court did not err because the acceptance provision was mandatory and Dylan\u2019s section 998 offer therefore was invalid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We review de novo issues of statutory construction. <em>(Barner v. Leeds </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 676, 683 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 97, 13 P.3d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">B. <em>Application of Relevant Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Prior to trial, Dylan served a section 998 offer to allow judgment against Philip Morris in the amount of $4.95 million. Philip Morris did not accept the offer. Following a jury trial, Dylan was awarded $12.8 million. Thereafter, because the verdict exceeded his section 998 offer, Dylan moved for an award of prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3291. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that Dylan\u2019s section 998 offer was invalid because it did not contain a provision that if Philip Morris was to accept the offer, it would do so by signing a statement that the offer was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Under section 998, either party to an action may serve a written offer to allow judgment on the opposing party. (\u00a7 998, subd. (b).) If a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>makes an offer under section 998 that the defendant does not accept and the plaintiff receives a more favorable judgment, the judgment accrues interest at the annual rate of 10 percent from the date of the plaintiff\u2019s offer. (\u00a7 3291.) Effective January 1, 2006, the Legislature amended subdivision (b) of section 998 in part to add the requirement that offers under section 998 <em>\u201cshall </em>include a statement of the offer, containing the terms and conditions of the judgment or award, and a provision that allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is accepted.\u201d (Italics added, as amended by Stats. 2005, ch. 706, \u00a7 13, p. 5651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In <em>Puerta v. Torres </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1267 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 922], the defendant served a section 998 offer on the plaintiff. The offer did not include the required acceptance provision. The Court of Appeal held that under the plain language of the statute, a section 998 offer must include an acceptance provision, and the defendant\u2019s offer was invalid for lack of such a provision. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1270, 1273.) In reaching this conclusion, the court considered two \u201ccompeting dynamics.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1271.) The first \u201cdynamic\u201d was case law predating the acceptance provision amendment to section 998 that emphasized that the purpose of section 998 was to encourage settlement. <em>(Puerta v. Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1272.) Those cases held that offers under section 998 should be held valid if they are clear and understandable, \u201ceven if they do not precisely track the statute\u2019s language.\u201d <em>(Puerta </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1271.) The second \u201cdynamic\u201d was the \u201cmost fundamental principles of statutory construction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1272.) Under those principles, if the language of a statute \u201c \u2018is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning governs.\u2019 <em>(Silicon Valley Taxpayers\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Santa Clara County Open Space Authority </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 431, 444 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 312, 187 P.3d 37]; see <em>Young </em>v. <em>Gannon </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 209, 223 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 187] [the \u2018court looks first to the language of the statute; if clear and unambiguous, the court will give effect to its plain meaning\u2019].)\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court found this second \u201cdynamic\u201d to predominate. <em>(Ibid.) </em> It stated that section 998, subdivision (b) provides that offers to compromise \u201cshall\u201d include an acceptance provision and cited <em>Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, 777 P.2d 610] for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[i]t is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that the word . . . \u201cshall\u201d is ordinarily construed as mandatory ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Puerta v. Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The defendant in <em>Puerta </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at pages 1272 through 1273 argued, as does Dylan, that \u201cshall\u201d is not always construed as strictly mandatory, such as when that construction would defeat the purpose of the statute. The court held, however, that applying the acceptance provision amendment to section 998 as written did not defeat the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>(Puerta </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1273.) The amendment required that an acceptance of a section 998 offer be in writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>and that the manner of acceptance be indicated in the offer. <em>(Puerta v. Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1273.) The court reasoned, \u201cThe statute\u2019s new language seeks to eliminate uncertainty by removing the possibility that an oral acceptance might be valid, which is a legitimate concern. While there is room for interpretation as to how an appropriate statement regarding acceptance might be phrased in the offer, it is clear from the statute\u2019s language that at least <em>some </em>indication of how to accept is required by the amendment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 418 [141 Cal.Rptr.3d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">We agree with the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Puerta </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th 1267. Construing the acceptance provision amendment as directory and not mandatory would defeat the purpose of the amendment\u2014 eliminating uncertainty in the acceptance of section 998 offers by requiring the acceptance to be made by a signed statement. Requiring the offeror to include in the section 998 offer, in essence, the manner in which the offer must be accepted, arguably facilitates settlements by deterring invalid, oral acceptances.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Dylan argues that the validity of a section 998 offer that does not include an acceptance provision should be determined by evaluating the litigation sophistication of the party receiving the offer\u2014that is, whether the party receiving the offer was \u201cactually confused\u201d about how to accept a section 998 offer. Dylan reasons, \u201cIf an extremely sophisticated litigant represented by extremely qualified counsel knows full well how to accept a section 998 offer, but declines to do so in order to force a trial, the purpose of section 998 is subverted by invalidating the offer to settle on a technicality.\u201d The court in <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.4th 418 essentially rejected this argument by holding that an acceptance provision in a section 998 offer is mandatory whether or not the party receiving the offer represents himself or is represented by counsel. (206 Cal.App.4th at pp. 423-424.) Any attorney who reviews section 998 might well advise the client to ignore a section 998 offer that does not include the required acceptance language.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Dylan points to his counsel\u2019s declaration that Philip Morris never settles these types of personal injury actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But this is of no avail to Dylan, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>we interpret the mandatory requirements of the statute without regards to what occurred in this particular case or the tactics of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Because Dylan\u2019s section 998 offer did not include the required acceptance provision, the offer was invalid. <em>(Puerta v. Torres, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.4th at p. 1273; <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.4th at pp. 423-424.) Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Dylan\u2019s motion for interest pursuant to section 3291.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The judgment and order are affirmed.

Attorneys for Philip Morris informed me that there would never be a reason for a settlement conference since Philip Morris would never settle a case filed against it claiming personal injury or wrongful death. I have heard attorneys for Philip Morris state this to Los Angeles County Superior Court judges. I have been told by attorneys for Philip Morris that its national litigation strategy is to never offer a dime in settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
