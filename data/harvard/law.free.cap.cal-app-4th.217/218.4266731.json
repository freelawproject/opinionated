SCE\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">This is Laabs\u2019s fourth appeal, and the second involving SCE. In the first two appeals we affirmed summary judgments in favor of the County and the City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the third appeal, we reversed summary judgment in favor of SCE. <em>(Laabs v. Southern California Edison Co. </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1279 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 241] <em>(Laabs III).) </em>In <em>Laabs III, </em>we held that there existed triable issues of fact as to whether SCE owed a duty of care to motorists relative to the placement of streetlights immediately adjacent to the traveling lanes of a high-speed roadway. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1269.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Following remand, SCE moved for judgment on the pleadings based on the argument that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the present action. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subd. (c)(l)(B)(i).) Its motion was premised on an argument that Public Utilities Code section 1759<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> precluded the superior court from entertaining any lawsuit dealing with matters that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC or Commission). It argued that the placement or location of streetlights fell under the exclusive province of the PUC, and the trial court could not entertain an action for damages because it would interfere with the PUC\u2019s exercise of its plenary power. More particularly, SCE contended that upon SCE\u2019s filing of its tariff with the PUC and the PUC\u2019s approval of said tariff, the conditions contained therein had the force and effect of law. SCE submitted that the location of the subject pole was part of the approved tariff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>and that under the express conditions of the tariff, SCE is relieved of all liability for acting in accordance therewith. (See Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 489, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The trial court granted the motion and the present appeal ensued. Because the trial court does have subject matter jurisdiction over the present matter, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">B. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In Laabs\u2019s second amended complaint, she alleges the following facts. Laabs was a passenger in a car driven by James Dimeo. Dimeo was driving northbound on Ridgecrest Road in Victorville. Dimeo\u2019s car was struck by another car at an intersection with Pebble Beach Drive, spun out of control and across Ridgecrest Road, and hit a concrete light pole erected 18 inches away from the curb. Laabs was injured. The light pole was owned and maintained by SCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Laabs sued SCE on the theory that SCE acted negligently by installing and maintaining the light pole so close to the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">C. <em>Judicially Noticed Documents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">SCE\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings relies exclusively on documents of which it requested the trial court to take judicial notice. First is an \u201cAgreement for Service for Street Lighting\u201d entered into between the City and SCE on August 12, 1977. Attached as exhibits to this agreement are PUC \u201cSchedule No. LS-1,\u201d which deals with a \u201cUtility-Owned System\u201d and \u201cSchedule No. LS-2,\u201d dealing with a \u201cCustomer-Owned Installation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">The second document is a \u201cSchedule LS-1,\u201d dated June 5, 1992, dealing solely with company-owned systems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It includes a reference to \u201cDecision 92-06-020.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The tariff sets forth certain rates applicable to \u201cstreet and highway lighting service where [SCE] owns and maintains the street lighting equipment and associated facilities . . . .\u201d It includes two \u201cSPECIAL CONDITIONS\u201d relevant here. Special condition 6.a. provides: \u201cThe applicant for street light service shall specify the type of service, lamp size, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>location of street lights.\u201d Special condition 9 provides; \u201cLiability of Company: The Company shall not, by taking action pursuant to its tariffs, be liable for any loss, damage, or injury, established or alleged, which may result, or be claimed to result, therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The third document is a one-page document dated November 21, 1975, and revised April 11, 1979; it appears to be a schematic drawing which includes the descriptions \u201cCity of Victorville\u201d and \u201cCommercial Comer Utility Location.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It shows a utility pole placed 18 inches from the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The trial court granted the request for judicial notice as to each document.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Based on these documents, SCE contends that Laabs\u2019s action is barred by section 1759. Specifically, SCE argues that when the PUC approved SCE\u2019s tariff, it exercised its authority over subject matters addressed in the tariff; the tariff required SCE to place streetlights where the City wanted them and included a limitation of liability provision; because the location of streetlights and the limitation of liability are addressed in the tariff, any issues related to them are subject to the PUC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction and any action addressing them is barred by section 1759.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Initially, we note that Schedule No. LS-2 (Customer-Owned Installation) appears not applicable. Laabs\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that SCE owns the specific streetlight installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Further, the pleading does not allege the date the streetlight was installed; it is therefore left to some conjecture as to whether the 1977 Schedule No. LS-1 or the 1992 LS-1 applies. This date may be important because if one were to accept SCE\u2019s position as to the significance of the release of liability, the release is contained only in the 1992 LS-1, not the 1977 schedule. Additionally, there are no conditions in the earlier schedules referencing \u201clocation of street lights.\u201d As such, any approval by the PUC of those schedules would not have entailed the siting of streetlights. For purposes of our opinion, however, we assume the applicability of the 1992 LS-1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Lastly, there is nothing about the street comer schematic depicting the location of a utility pole that suggests it was submitted to the PUC or relates to any tariff or PUC decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>D. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 438, subdivision (c)(l)(B)(i) . . . provides that a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a defendant on the grounds that the court \u2018has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint\u2019 . . . . [f] \u2018The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as \u00bf matter of law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bezirdjian v. O\u2019Reilly </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 384], fn. omitted.) \u201c[J]udgment on the pleadings must be denied where there are material factual issues that require evidentiary resolution.\u201d <em>(Schabarum v.

(Cal. Const., art. XII, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6.) The Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities, including the power to fix rates, establish rules, hold various types of hearings, award reparation, and establish its own procedures. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, 6.) The commission\u2019s powers, however, are not restricted to those expressly mentioned in the Constitution; \u201cThe Legislature has <em>plenary power, unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution </em>but consistent with this article, to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 5.)\u2019 [Citation.] [][]  Pursuant to this constitutional provision the Legislature enacted, inter alia, the Public Utilities Act. (\u00a7 201 et seq.) That law vests the commission with broad authority to \u2018supervise and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>regulate every public utility in the State\u2019 (\u00a7701)[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] and grants the commission numerous specific powers for [that] purpose. . . . [T]he Legislature further authorized the commission to <em>\u2018do all things, </em>whether specifically designated in [the Public Utilities Act] <em>or in addition thereto, </em>which are necessary and convenient\u2019 in the exercise of its jurisdiction over public utilities. [Citation.] Accordingly, \u2018The commission\u2019s authority has been liberally construed\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 914-915 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 724, 920 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cIn particular, the commission has comprehensive jurisdiction over questions of public health and safety arising from utility operations. Thus the commission is generally authorized to require every public utility to \u2018construct, maintain, and operate\u2019 its \u2018plant, system, equipment, [or] apparatus\u2019 in such manner as to \u2018safeguard the health and safety of its employees, . . . customers, and the public . . . .\u2019 (\u00a7768.) To this end, the commission is further empowered to prescribe the installation and use of \u2018appropriate safety or other devices,\u2019 and to require every utility to do <em>\u2018any other act </em>which the health or safety of its employees, . . . customers, or the public may demand.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 924.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u201cThe PUC\u2019s most obvious regulatory authority includes the regulation of rates . . . .\u201d <em>(Hartwell Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 256, 270 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 38 P.3d 1098]; see Cal. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 6 [\u201cThe commission may fix rates . . . .\u201d].) \u201cSection 489, subdivision (a), requires every public utility to file with the PUC a tariff\u2014a schedule \u2018showing all rates, tolls, rentals, charges, and classifications . . . <em>together with all rules, contracts, privileges, and facilities which in any manner affect or relate to </em>rates, tolls, rentals, classifications, or service.\u2019 Such a tariff, when approved by the PUC, has the force of law.\u201d <em>(Pacific Bell </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 269, 273-274 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 910], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In approving a tariff, the PUC has the power to control that which in \u201c \u2018any manner affectfs] or relate[s] to rates ... or service.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pacific Bell v. Public Utilities Com., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 274.) As part of this power, the PUC may also limit the liability of the utility to the public. In a case involving a telephone company tariff, the court explained that the limitations on liability are \u201can equitable trade-off\u2014the power to regulate rates and to set them below the amount an unregulated provider might otherwise charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>requires a concomitant limitation on liability.\u201d <em>(Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1017-1018 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Further, and as directly relevant to the present motion, section 1759, subdivision (a) states: \u201cNo court of this state, <em>except the Supreme Court and the court of appeal, . . . </em>shall have jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, restrain, or interfere with the commission <em>in the performance of its official duties, as provided by law and the rules of court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Bearing in mind the basic plenary power of the PUC, the Legislature has provided for a limited scope of private action against a utility for damages. As set forth in section 2106: \u201cAny public utility which does, causes to be done, or permits any act, matter, or thing prohibited or declared unlawful, or which omits to do any act, matter, or thing required to be done, either by the Constitution, any law of this State, or any order or decision of the commission, shall be liable to the persons or corporations affected thereby for all loss, damages, or injury caused thereby or resulting therefrom. . . . An action to recover for such loss, damage, or injury may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">2. <em>The Relationship of Sections 1759, 2106, and Local Regulation to the Present Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The question before us is whether the present action for damages is precluded by the overall grant of plenary power to the PUC by the Constitution and sections 701 and 1759, or falls within the limited exception of section 2106. In addressing a similar issue, the court in <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>stated: \u201cAddressing the question of statutory construction, this court [in <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone Co. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 1 [114 Cal.Rptr. 753, 523 P.2d 1161]] declared the primacy of section 1759 and the correspondingly limited role of section 2106. The <em>[Waters] </em>court held that \u2018in order to resolve the potential conflict between sections 1759 and 2106, the latter section must be construed as <em>limited </em>to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commission\u2019s declared supervisory and regulatory policies.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . . [T]he two sections must be construed in a manner which harmonizes their language and avoids unnecessary conflict. Section 2106 reasonably may be interpreted as authorizing only those actions which would not interfere with or obstruct the commission in carrying out its own policies.\u2019 [][] Under the <em>Waters </em>rule, accordingly, an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section 2106 is barred by section 1759 not only when an award of damages would directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>contravene a specific order or decision of the commission, i.e., when it would \u2018reverse, correct, or annul\u2019 that order or decision, but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission, i.e., when it would \u2018hinder\u2019 or \u2018frustrate\u2019 or \u2018interfere with\u2019 or \u2018obstruct\u2019 that policy.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 917-918, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">As such, if the PUC (1) has the authority to regulate or otherwise establish policy in a given area and (2) has exercised that authority by regulation or policy, then the superior court may do nothing that hampers or interferes with that exercise of jurisdiction, including awarding damages in a private action. (See generally <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 914-934.) Stated another way, \u201c[t]he [PUC] has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation and control of utilities, and that jurisdiction, once assumed, cannot be hampered or second-guessed by a superior court action addressing the same issue.\u201d <em>(Anchor Lighting </em>v. <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 541, 548 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 780].)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">With the above said, a city exercising its police powers may impose conditions and regulations upon a public utility to the extent they are not in conflict with the exercise of jurisdiction by the PUC. As explained in <em>Orange County Air Pollution Control Dist. v. Public Util. Com. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 945 [95 Cal.Rptr. 17, 484 P.2d 1361]: \u201c \u2018[Concurrent jurisdiction . . . may well exist as to some matters but. . . .if . . . there is a direct confrontation with the jurisdiction exercised by this Commission ... the jurisdiction of this Commission in the matter is either exclusive or paramount. . . .\u2019 [f] . . . [T]he commission has been held to have paramount jurisdiction in cases where it has exercised its authority, and its authority is pitted against that of a local government involving a matter of statewide concern.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 950-951, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As stated in <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. City of Carlsbad </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 785 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 534]: \u201cThe general authorization for a local entity\u2019s police power is found in California Constitution, article XI, section 7: \u2018A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u2019 California Constitution, article XI, section 9, subdivision (b) permits municipalities to prescribe conditions and regulations for the operation of public utility works by private entities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Finally, section 2902 provides that the chapter of the Public Utilities Code governing the surrender of municipal control to the PUC \u201cshall not be construed to authorize any municipal corporation to surrender to the commission its powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationship between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health, convenience, and <em>safety of the general public, </em>including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility, <em>the location of the poles, </em>wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility, on, under, or above any public streets . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">F. <em>The PUC Does Not Have Exclusive Jurisdiction over the Location of Streetlights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">As previously indicated, SCE\u2019s basic position is (1) the PUC has the authority to regulate the siting of light poles and (2) the PUC has exercised that authority by approving the tariff. Included within the tariff is language dealing with \u201clocation of poles\u201d and a release of liability as to actions taken in compliance with the tariff. As such, SCE argues that (3) allowing a plaintiff to recover damages resulting from actions pursuant to the tariff would interfere with the PUC\u2019s jurisdiction and is thus precluded by section 1759. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">As evident from the above, the PUC has general plenary power over utilities. At the same time, local municipalities may, pursuant to their police power, regulate utilities to the extent the regulation is not inconsistent with law. More specifically, a city may control the location of utility poles within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Initially, SCE has not cited to any specific PUC policy, regulation, decision or study which indicates that it has exercised authority over the siting of streetlights. Indeed, the closest this court can come to determining whether the PUC has entered the field of controlling the location of utility poles is in <em>In re Competition for Local Exchange Service </em>(1998) 82 Cal.P.U.C.2d 510 <em>(Decision No. 98-10-058).</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At one portion of its order, the commission addresses its jurisdiction relative to section 2109. It states: \u201cThe obligations of a city, county or other political subdivision to provide access to [right-of-way] under its control is addressed under Part 3 of the [Public Utilities] Code. The Legislature has expressly recognized the duties and responsibilities of a \u2018municipal corporation\u2019 and the ability of a municipal corporation to retain or surrender control of some of its powers to the Commission. Municipal corporations are expressly authorized not to surrender the power to supervise and regulate the relationship between such public utilities and the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>public \u2018in matters affecting the health, convenience, and safety of the general public, including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility, the location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility, on, under, or above any public streets . . . .\u2019 (Section 2902.) [f] \u2022\u2022 \u2022[!]\u25a0\u25a0 \u2022 [L]ocal governments thus may regulate the time, location, and manner of installation of telephone facilities in public streets, [but] they may not arbitrarily deny requests for access by public utilities . . . .\u201d <em>(Dec. No. 98-10-058, supra, </em>82 Cal.P.U.C.2d at pp. 543-544; see <em>Southern Cal. Gas Co. </em>v. <em>City of Vernon </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 209, 217-218 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 661] [\u201cThe language of Public Utilities Code section 2902 simply reflects that the <em>location </em>of pipelines beneath city streets ... [is a matter] for the municipal corporation, not the PUC.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Commission goes on to explain that if the telecommunications company is unable to resolve its dispute with the local entity as to siting and right-of-way access, then it can apply to the PUC for a \u201ccertificate of public convenience and necessity.\u201d <em>(Dec. No. 98-10-058, supra, </em>82 Cal.P.U.C.2d at pp. 544-545.) In so indicating, however, the PUC states: \u201cWe recognize that the Commission lacks the jurisdiction to directly order a local governmental body to grant access. In the event that we grant the siting authority sought in the application, it will be the responsibility of the telecommunications carrier to notify the local governmental body of the Commission\u2019s order. In the event that we grant such an application, and the local governmental body still refuses to grant access in accordance with the Commission order, the telecommunications carrier\u2019s recourse shall be to file a lawsuit in the appropriate court of civil jurisdiction seeking resolution of the dispute over access.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Here, the City\u2019s schematic depicting a streetlight located 18 inches from the curb face indicates that the City has exercised control over the location of the streetlight. (See \u00a7 2902.) Although the PUC could perhaps exercise jurisdiction over the placement of poles, nothing in the 1992 LS-1 or the PUC\u2019s related decision indicates that it has. Indeed, it appears otherwise. As stated in special condition 6.a.: \u201cThe <em>applicant </em>[(City of Victorville)] for street light service shall specify the type of service, lamp size, and <em>location of street </em>lights.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, to the extent the PUC and the City had concurrent jurisdiction over the location of streetlights, the PUC, in accordance with <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>and its own construction of section 2902, allowed the City to exercise its jurisdiction as to the siting of the streetlights. As such, the City\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is not inimical to the Public Utilities Act. (\u00a7 201 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Although the PUC has the <em>authority </em>to regulate the siting of light poles as a condition affecting or relating to the rates, tolls, rentals, classification, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>service (see \u00a7 489, subd. (a)), the tariff in this case indicates that the City, <em>not the PUC, </em>has control over the siting of light poles. We therefore reject SCE\u2019s argument that the PUC\u2019s approval of the tariff constitutes an exercise of the PUC\u2019s jurisdiction over that subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The release of liability found in special condition 9 of the 1992 LS-1 is also inapplicable. As provided: \u201cThe Company shall not, by taking action pursuant to its tariffs, be liable for any loss, damage, or injury, established or alleged, which may result, or be claimed to result, therefrom.\u201d Because the placement of light poles was generally under the control of the City, SCE did not take any action with respect to the placement of the light poles \u201cpursuant to its tariffs.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, the limitation of liability provision is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">While SCE argues that a utility may limit its liability to the public by way of a tariff, we note that all of the cases setting forth this proposition, save one, deal with phone service and involve subscribers to the service. Additionally, and again with one exception, the cases postdate and refer to the PUC decision in <em>In re Telephone Corporations </em>(1970) 71 Cal.P.U.C. 229, wherein the Commission specifically investigated \u201call rules, conditions or tariff provisions limiting the liability of telephone corporations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We have not found and have not been cited to any PUC decision addressing limitations on liability for utilities other than those providing phone services. Further, as alluded to in <em>Thrify-Tel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bezenek </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1571 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 468], \u201c[although article XII, sections 4 and 6 of the California Constitution authorize the commission to establish <em>rates </em>utilities may charge for their services, it is a debatable question as to whether they empower the PUC to liquidate a utility\u2019s tort damages against third parties.\u201d (See <em>Colich &amp; Sons v. Pacific Bell </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238, fn. 15 [244 Cal.Rptr. 714] [inapplicability of limitation of liability provisions to cases involving personal injuries by third parties].)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In conclusion, we find that while the PUC may have concurrent jurisdiction with the local entity relative to the placement of light poles, it did not, in this case, exercise that authority. Moreover, there is nothing about an award of damages against SCE that would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the Commission, or would have the effect of undermining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>general supervisory or regulatory policy of the Commission. Therefore, under section 2106, the superior court has jurisdiction over the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">II. <em>CITY\u2019S DEMURRER TO SCE\u2019S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">SCE did not file a timely governmental claim against the City before filing its first amended cross-complaint naming the City as a cross-defendant. The trial court sustained the City\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend based on SCE\u2019s failure to comply with the government claims statute. Both at the trial level and on appeal, SCE contends it did not need to file a claim because its cross-complaint for equitable indemnity was solely defensive in nature. (See <em>Krainock </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 216 Cal.App.3d 1473 [265 Cal.Rptr. 715] <em>(Krainock).) </em>We agree with the trial court and affirm the judgment entered thereon. More particularly, we find that SCE\u2019s cross-complaint is based on facts outside of the pleadings to which the City was a party such that the cross-complaint is not solely defensive in nature. Because of this, compliance with the Government Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810 et seq.) was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">B. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In October 2003, Laabs filed her initial complaint against the driver, owners, and manufacturer of the vehicle in which she was a passenger. Additional named defendants were the driver of the other vehicle, as well as the City and the County. The theory against the City and the County was that they were \u201cnegligent in designing, constructing, maintaining, controlling and otherwise creating and failing to correct a dangerous road condition due to inadequate sight distance and lack of warning signs', devices and signals.\u201d Fifty \u201cDoe\u201d defendants were named. Ten Doe defendants were associated with the dangerous condition of public property. The remaining Doe defendants were alleged to be associated in some way with the vehicle in which Laabs was a passenger or the other vehicle involved in the accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Laabs\u2019s original complaint makes no allegations of any condition of property north of the intersection of Ridgecrest Road and Pebble Beach Drive. Additionally as to the Doe defendants associated with the property, the allegations deal solely with inadequate sight distance at the intersection and the absence of warning signs and signals. Laabs\u2019s complaint additionally omits any allegation that the Doe defendants were negligent in ways unknown to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On April 14 and April 16, 2004, the City filed two successive cross-complaints. The more recent cross-complaint named as cross-defendants each of the City\u2019s named codefendants. It further alleged that unknown \u201cMoe\u201d cross-defendants were jointly and severally liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries <em>\u201cas alleged in the Complaint in this </em>action.\u201d (Italics added.) In its charging allegations, the City went on to allege: \u201c9. If Plaintiff sustained damages as alleged in her complaint, these damages were caused, entirely or in part, by Cross-Defendants <em>as set forth herein: </em>[][] a. The County of San Bernardino owned and controlled the northbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road and Pebble Beach Drive, and if there was a dangerous condition thereon the County of San Bernardino is responsible therefor; [][] b. James Dimeo, Jr., operated his vehicle in a negligent, careless, reckless and wanton manner, driving at a speed in excess of 100 miles per hour while under the influence of alcohol and/or intoxicating drugs; [f] c. Cross-Defendants James Dimeo, Sr. and Tina Dimeo negligently supervised James Dimeo, Jr., their minor child, in that they knew of their child\u2019s dangerous tendency and propensity to take and operate the vehicle involved in the collision without authorization and in a reckless and careless manner. These Cross-Defendants failed to take the appropriate action and corrective measures to prevent James Dimeo, Jr. from intentionally or negligently inflicting harm on others. These Cross-Defendants further failed to secure the vehicle to prevent unauthorized use by James Dimeo, Jr. Cross-Defendants\u2019 actions and failure to act resulted in the injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff; [][] d. The vehicle driven by James Dimeo, Jr. a 1999 Porsche Carrera, California License number. 4GYX773, including its component parts, failed to perform in a manner reasonably to be expected in light of its nature and intended function, including but not limited to failing to stay under control and failing to provide adequate protection and restraint of its occupants; [j[] e. Cross-Defendant Dorothy Jean Specter operated her vehicle negligently at the time of the collision by failing to exercise due care to ensure that she could enter safely into the roadway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>As with the complaint, the City\u2019s cross-complaint is based upon limited facts. There is nothing in the cross-complaint that speaks to conditions of property that are adjacent to the southbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road north of its intersection with Pebble Beach Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In May 2005, the trial court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Laabs\u2019s complaint. An appeal followed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the appeal was pending, Laabs filed her second amended complaint. In this pleading, Laabs omitted the City and the County as named defendants. She added SCE to the action. The alleged basis for SCE\u2019s liability was its ownership of the luminaire and its dangerous proximity to the traveling lanes of Ridgecrest Road. SCE was served with the second amended complaint on October 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In November 2005, SCE filed a cross-complaint for indemnity and contribution against James Dimeo and his parents. SCE also included an affirmative cause of action for damages for the repair of the luminaire.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In July 2007, almost two years after being served with the second amended complaint, SCE was granted summary judgment as to Laabs. Two years later, in July 2009, this court reversed the judgment. (See <em>Laabs III, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.4th 1260.) Following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of SCE\u2019s petition for review, the matter was remanded to the superior court in November 2009. Approximately three months later, SCE filed a governmental claim against the City. In the claim, SCE sought indemnification and costs of defense from the City based on the allegation that \u201c[t]he City made the decision with regards to the location of installation, type of equipment to use, mounting height, type of light and wattage/light output for the area streetlights, including the electrolier.\u201d The claim was returned to SCE as being untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Thereafter, in January 2011, after filing another claim, which was also returned as untimely,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> SCE filed a first amended complaint seeking indemnification from the City. In the cross-complaint, SCE alleged it substantially complied with the claims requirement. In March 2011, the City filed a demurrer contending, among other arguments, that SCE\u2019s cross-complaint was barred because of its failure to comply with the Government Claims Act. The trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer. Following the entry of judgment for the City, SCE filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">C. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. We give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] Further, we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded .... When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d <em>(City of Dinuba v. County of Tulare </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 859, 865 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 614, 161 P.3d 1168].) Where a cross-complaint seeks indemnity from a governmental entity stemming from an underlying personal injury action, compliance with the claims statute is required. <em>(State of California v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 754, 757 [192 Cal.Rptr. 198].) \u201cFailure to allege compliance with the claims statute renders the complaint subject to general demurrer. [Citation.] [][]... [f] ... [A cause of] action for damages is barred unless an exception relieves them of this requirement.\u201d <em>(Bates v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 367, 382-383 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 285].)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">D. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Pursuant to Government Code section 901: \u201c[T]he date upon which a cause of action for equitable indemnity or partial equitable indemnity accrues shall be the date upon which a defendant is served with the complaint giving rise to the defendant\u2019s claim for equitable indemnity or partial equitable indemnity against the public entity.\u201d A claim for money damages relating to a cause of action for injury to a person must be filed not later than six months after the date of accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 905, 911.2, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThe claim filing requirements apply to \u2018all claims for money or damages against the [governmental entity] ... for an injury for which the [entity] is liable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(State of California v. Superior Court, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 757.) Notwithstanding SCE\u2019s prayer for declaratory relief, its cross-complaint \u201cin essence states a claim \u2018for money or damages,\u2019 against the [governmental entity], \u2018relating to a cause of action ... for injury to person,\u2019 and hence is subject to the requirement that a claim be presented \u2018not later than [six months] after the accrual of the cause of action.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Here, both parties to the appeal agree that SCE did not comply with the applicable claim filing requirement. Laabs\u2019s second amended complaint was served on SCE on October 13, 2005; SCE did not file a claim until January 2010, more than four years later.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On appeal, SCE contends it is excused from filing a claim against the City because its cross-complaint is solely a defensive pleading and as such the governmental claim requirements do not apply. To support its position, SCE relies on <em>Krainock, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1473, wherein the court held that a defendant may file a defensive cross-complaint for indemnity against a public entity which has already filed a cross-complaint against it without first filing a claim. We disagree with SCE that <em>Krainock </em>is applicable to the present facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In <em>Krainock, </em>plaintiff Fiorello filed a personal injury action against defendants Krainock and the Poway Unified School District. Fiorello claimed that Krainock struck him during a \u201cfracas\u201d at a school athletic event. The school district was sued on a premises liability theory. <em>(Krainock, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1475-1476.) At the time of filing its answer, the school district filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief against Krainock. Krainock thereupon answered the cross-complaint and, without filing a governmental claim against the school district, filed a cross-complaint against the school district for the same relief sought by the school district in its cross-complaint. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The Court of Appeal held that Krainock did not need to comply with the claims statute before filing his cross-complaint. <em>(Krainock, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1478-1479.) The court stated: \u201cThe primary purpose of the governmental claims act is to apprise the governmental body of an imminent legal action so that the entity may investigate and evaluate the claim and, where appropriate, avoid litigation by settling meritorious claims. Thus, the act should not be allowed to become a snare for the unwary litigant if its statutory purposes have been satisfied.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1477.) In applying this principle, the court stressed that \u201cKrainock thus seeks to defend both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>complaint and the cross-complaint on the <em>same set of facts. </em>... He thus contends his cross-complaint will require <em>no new investigation of the facts beyond that which [the school </em>district] <em>already performed in preparing its </em>pleadings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1476-1477, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Such is not the case here. We first note that the City never filed a cross-complaint in which SCE was a named cross-defendant. Thus from its inception, SCE\u2019s reliance on <em>Krainock </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">To the extent the City\u2019s cross-complaint naming \u201cMoes 1-30\u201d could be construed as a cross-complaint against SCE, SCE\u2019s argument that its cross-complaint is purely a defensive pleading is still unsupportable. SCE\u2019s cross-complaint goes beyond the set of facts upon which the City defended Laabs\u2019s complaint and upon which the City\u2019s cross-complaint was premised. As a result, in order to defend the cross-complaint filed by SCE it would have to engage in new investigation beyond that which it already performed in preparing its initial answer and cross-complaint. As such, compliance with the claims statute would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">All of Laabs\u2019s allegations against the City dealt with inadequate sight distance at the intersection and the absence of warning signs and signals. The complaint made no reference to a luminaire or any condition of property north of the intersection of Ridgecrest Road and Pebble Beach Drive. There were no allegations that any of the Doe defendants were negligent in ways unassociated with the intersection or the vehicles involved in the accident. Likewise, the City\u2019s second amended cross-complaint was extremely focused as to the basis upon which the City was seeking indemnity. It was limited to the allegations of the complaint and specifically alluded to the areas of the cross-defendants\u2019 conduct for which the City was seeking indemnity or contribution. There was nothing in the cross-complaint that remotely spoke to conditions of property adjacent to the southbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road north of its intersection with Pebble Beach Drive. There was nothing that broadened the scope of the persons from whom the City was seeking indemnity or the facts upon which it was seeking indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The City\u2019s involvement in the litigation was clearly limited to the design of the intersection, the design of Ridgecrest Road south of the intersection, and the signage for northbound traffic leading up to the intersection. This is made abundantly clear by the discussion in <em>Laabs II </em>wherein we stated: \u201cThe pleading does not mention any facts involving the southbound lanes or, more importantly, the fact that the Dimeo vehicle struck a luminaire, pole, or some similar object. In the amended complaint, there is no explicit or implicit involvement of the luminaire. The additional [undisputed] fact shifts the alleged dangerous condition to a portion of public property not remotely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>referenced in the amended complaint. It attempts to predicate liability on a totally different condition, not the least bit involved with the intersection or inadequate sight distance.\u201d <em>(Laabs II, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">SCE\u2019s cross-complaint, which brings into play the City\u2019s involvement in the siting of the luminaire north of the intersection of Ridgecrest Road and Pebble Beach Drive, is clearly based on a set of facts different from the original complaint and the City\u2019s second amended cross-complaint. To defend SCE\u2019s cross-complaint, the City would be required to perform investigation of facts beyond that which the City already performed in preparing its pleadings and participating in the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">SCE\u2019s cross-complaint is far more than merely a defensive pleading to the City\u2019s cross-complaint, which does not name SCE and does not state a cause of action for indemnity against SCE.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As such, SCE was required to file a timely claim before instituting its action against the City for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In its reply brief, SCE states: \u201cIf the City is correct, SCE is caught in a legal Catch-22: SCE was required to present a claim for damages to the City within six months after SCE was served with Laabs\u2019 amended complaint; however, even if SCE had done so, it would still be barred from obtaining any relief from the City because the City was already out of Laabs\u2019 case before SCE\u2019s claim was due. Not only can SCE not win, it was barred from obtaining relief before it even knew it was involved in the case. This result is contrary to both logic and law.\u201d This is simply not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">A \u201c \u2018defendant\u2019s equitable indemnity action is independent of the plaintiff\u2019s action and a defendant is entitled to pursue his own indemnity action so long as the statute of limitations on that action has not expired.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Columbus Line, Inc. v. Gray Line Sight-Seeing Companies Associated, Inc. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 622, 631 [174 Cal.Rptr. 527].) \u201c \u2018[U]nder the governing provisions of . . .

Finally, absent the application of collateral estoppel or res judicata, the dismissal of a defendant from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s action, even by way of summary judgment, does not preclude another defendant from pursuing indemnity, by way of cross-complaint, from the dismissed defendant. <em>(Frank v.

It was undisputed that the luminaire was owned and maintained by SCE. Pursuant to the franchise agreement entered into between SCE and the City of Victorville, it was further undisputed that \u2018[a]ll poles, wires, lights, and electrical apparatus <em>installed by Company in furnishing service under (the franchise </em>agreement], <em>shall be placed as to work the least possible public and private inconvenience </em>. . . .\u2019 (Italics added.)

Thus, even if a public utility can avoid liability for a negligently placed light pole by claiming a government agency required a precise placement, there is insufficient evidence presented here to establish such a requirement.

We found that SCE failed to demonstrate that it did not exercise some control over the placement of the streetlight. Although the 1992 LS-1 indicates that the City was to select the placement of light poles, this does not preclude, from a practical standpoint, SCE having input into or control over the placement of the streetlight. This issue is clearly a fact-specific inquiry that cannot be resolved by way of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> Laabs filed an amended complaint on March 15, 2004. Although it is not in the record on this appeal, it was a subject of our decision in <em>Laabs 11. </em>In that case, we noted the following allegations regarding the physical property involved in the accident: \u201c \u2018Plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle northbound on Ridgecrest Road driven by James Dimeo, Jr., in the vicinity of its intersection with Pebble Beach Road in Victorville, unincorporated County of San Bernardino. Another vehicle driven by Dorothy Jean Specter was westbound on Pebble Beach Road stopped at a stop sign before attempting a left turn to go south on Ridgecrest Road. There was inadequate sight distance so that Specter did not perceive the approaching Dimeo vehicle which struck the Specter vehicle. Based upon information and belief, the [City] is responsible for the design, construction, maintenance and conrol [sic] of the southbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road. Based upon information and belief, [County] is responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>northbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road. Defendants [City] and [County] were negligent in designing, constructing, maintaining, controlling and otherwise creating and failing to correct dangerous road conditions due to inadequate sight distance and lack of warning signs, devices and signals. The dangerous conditions created an unreasonable risk of injury to persons using the roads and such dangerous conditions were a foreseeable cause of Plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Laabs II, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1252.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> At the trial court level, in response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Laabs introduced for the first time the alleged dangerousness of the luminaire, which was located north of the intersection and immediately adjacent to the southbound lanes of Ridgecrest Road. On appeal, we held that the City could not, given the state of the pleadings, be found liable for the alleged dangerousness of the luminaire as it related to the traveling lanes of Ridgecrest Road. As we explained: \u201cThe pleading does not mention any facts involving the southbound lanes or, more importantly, the fact that the Dimeo vehicle struck a luminaire, pole, or some similar object. In the amended complaint, there is no explicit or implicit involvement of the luminaire. The additional [undisputed] fact shifts the alleged dangerous condition to a portion of public property not remotely referenced in the amended complaint. It attempts to predicate liability on a totally different condition, not the least bit involved with the intersection or inadequate sight distance.\u201d <em>(Laabs II, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1258.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> SCE\u2019s cross-complaint was filed in response to Laabs\u2019s second amended complaint wherein the City was not named as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> The 2011 claim was premised on the same facts as the 2010 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> Even if its claim for equitable indemnity was viewed as being a claim not related to a \u201ccause of action ... for injury to person,\u201d thus allowing it to be filed \u201cnot later than one year after the accrual of the cause of action\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2, subd. (a)), there is still no question that SCE\u2019s claim was not timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> The court in <em>Krainock </em>adopted a three-prong test for determining whether a cross-complaint is purely defensive, thus being exempt from the claims requirements. <em>(Krainock, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1478-1479.) The present cross-complaint clearly does not conform to the second prong of the test. As discussed, SCE\u2019s claims, while arising out of the same accident, are unrelated to the facts upon which the City participated in the underlying action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> Whether its cross-complaint would have been the subject of a motion for summary judgment by the City is a matter we do not address here. Based on the briefing in the present matter, it is clear that SCE believes that the City\u2019s summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s complaint would not act as a bar to SCE\u2019s cross-complaint under the theory of collateral estoppel. The City argues that it would. We do not address this issue because we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision based on the fact that SCE did not comply with the appropriate government claims statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
