Some are taken at a valuation fixed by the inspectors fot less than the contract price. Some are rejected,'and the additional cost of those purchased charged to the contractor. On the trial the claimant attacks the <em>Iona fides </em>of the inspection. The decision of the court rests entirely upon the construction of the contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-7\">The court below decides:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-8\">1. Where\" a contract provides that, in case of failure to deliver rvithin the prescribed time, the defendants may'buy in the market, the provision is in the nature of a forfeiture clause, and if waived can hot be reasserted.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-10\">2.

If no such necessity be shown, the contract gives them no arbitrary right to take the goods at a reduced price, and the contractor retains the right to tender other goods within five days, if notified.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-14\">4.
