The applicant is no stranger to this Court. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>223 Md. 105; <em>Jackson v. Warden, 227 </em>Md. 637. The only point that possibly could not reasonably have been raised in the first post conviction proceeding before Chief Judge Niles, is his present claim that his arrest was illegal, disposed of by Chief Judge Niles on the ground that it could not be raised in a post conviction proceeding. If we assume, without deciding, that such a contention may be raised under some circumstances (as where it is relied on in connection with a search and seizure, <em>Boston v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 623), it could not aid the petitioner here. We have repeatedly held that the mere fact of an illegal arrest is not a ground for relief. <em>Slater v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 609, 611, and cases cited; <em>Ledbetter v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 643, 200 A. 2d 81; <em>Simms v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 652, 200 A. 2d 149. Petitioner here restricts his contention to the narrow point that his arrest without a warrant was illegal as the \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d was not committed in the presence of the arresting officer. No attendant illegal search and seizure is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
