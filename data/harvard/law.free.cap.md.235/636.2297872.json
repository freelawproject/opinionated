Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643. At his Post Conviction hearing, the trial judge made no finding of fact as to whether the search of applicant was unreasonable, but held that his plea of guilty was made freely and with full knowledge of its meaning and consequences; hence, if he had a defense based on the correctness of this ruling, as to the effect of his plea, seems to depend upon whether the holding in <em>Mapp, supra, </em>is retroactive or prospective in effect. Cf. <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>313 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>F. 2d 483; <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85. We have not found any case wherein the Supreme Court has, as yet, determined whether <em>Mapp </em>is, or is not, retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">However, it is possible that a factual finding upon the question of the reasonableness, <em>vel non, </em>of the search of the applicant may solve both his contentions. We will, therefore, grant leave to appeal and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\n<em>Leave to appeal granted and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
