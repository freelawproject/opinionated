There is no merit in these contentions. See <em>Tippett v. Director, </em>233 Md. 647, 648, and <em>McDonough v. Director, </em>229 Md. 626, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>634. The applicant makes additional allegations as to incompetency of counsel, collusion, and other claims too indefinite to require discussion. <em>Porter v. </em>Director, 232 Md. 639. He claims that he sought and was denied a private hearing. There is no requirement in the Maryland statute for private hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The applicant claims that his one year sentence for assault expired before the determination, and that the proceeding abated. The record shows that although he was acquitted of perverted practice upon a minor and convicted on the assault charge, he was convicted of enticing and harboring the same minor and sentenced to two years, to run consecutively. Since there is no factual basis for the claim of abatement we need not discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
