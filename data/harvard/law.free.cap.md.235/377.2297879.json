The defendant, after inquiring whether the agent wanted to buy heroin, and being told that it would have to be produced first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>would disappear and return in a few minutes with the narcotics, after which he would he paid the agreed price in cash. The defendant admitted making each of the deliveries but denied they were \u201csales\u201d because he only ran \u201cerrands\u201d for the agent, whom he thought was also a \u201cuser.\u201d He also admitted taking money for the heroin but insisted that his only purpose was to purchase drugs for his own use and that this was known to the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Since the evidence shows that the illegal transactions originated with the defendant, not the narcotics agent, there was no evidence of entrapment. Although the defendant\u2019s claim that he had been \u201centiced\u201d to procure heroin for the agent on the promise of the agent that he would give the defendant \u201ca fix\u201d for himself, raised a conflict in the testimony which the trial court resolved adversely to the defendant, the asserted excuse of entrapment is indistinguishable from those unsuccessfully relied on in <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, <em>Stewart v. State, </em>232 Md. 318, and <em>Snead v. State, </em>234 Md. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We think the evidence was such as warranted conviction. See <em>Toyer v. State, </em>234 Md. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
