This was a second petition for post conviction relief, the first petition having been denied by Judge Grady on May 15, 1963. Leave to appeal was denied by this Court in 232 Md. 653 on October <em>17, </em>1963. On December 11, 1963, Judge Northrop, in the Federal District Court, dismissed a petition for <em>habeas corpus, </em>\u201cwithout prejudice to refile in this Court should petitioner\u2019s petition for post conviction relief be denied.\u201d This seems to have prompted the second application.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">It is well settled that all grounds for relief must be raised in an original or amended petition and any grounds not so raised are waived unless the court finds in a subsequent petition grounds asserted that \u201ccould not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\u201d Code (1963 Supp.), Art. <em>27, </em>sec. 645 H; <em>Sewell v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 631, 200 A. 2d 648, 649. The only claim not set up in the first petition, but raised in the second, was that he \u201cnever confessed freely and voluntarily ; the signing of any papers was by force and threats.\u201d The record shows that after consultation with his counsel he withdrew pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty. There is no allegation that he signed any confession or that any confession was put in evidence. No claim has ever been made that the guilty pleas were involuntary. Even if there was any merit in the claims (and we see none) we perceive no reason why they could not have been made in the first petition. Hence his State remedies came to an end when we denied his application for leave to appeal from the first denial of post conviction relief, as Chief Judge Manley held. <em>Sewell v.
