An employee on duty at the store on all three occasions positively identified the appellant as the robber. The arresting officer testified that he shot the appellant in the store on the last occasion. The accused stated that he was shot while he was running across the street and denied having committed any of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The lower court, as the trier of facts, chose to disbelieve the appellant and to believe the witnesses for the State. Under similar circumstances, we have repeatedly held that the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are matters primarily for the trial court to determine, and that convictions based on such evidence will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Hursey v.
