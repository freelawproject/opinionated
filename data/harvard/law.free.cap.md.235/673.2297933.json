Judge Carter, in his opinion, dealt fully and properly with all of them except 2, 3 and 5. We, therefore, supplement his opinion as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">2. \u201cThat his home was illegally searched.\u201d No \u201cfruits\u201d of any search were offered at his trial; hence if there were an illegal search of his home, it was an immaterial matter in his criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">3. \u201cThat he was denied the right to call counsel or his family and that he was not advised of his <em>rights to </em>have counsel.\u201d At his hearing below, applicant made no mention of having requested anyone to call a lawyer or his family, or to permit him to do so. With reference to the allegation that he was not advised of his right to have counsel, the allegation does not state the time to which it refers (he was represented by court-appointed attorneys at his trial and the hearing herein below). At the hearing below, applicant\u2019s counsel asked no questions concerning this allegation, and no other evidence was produced concerning it. He pleaded guilty at his trial and freely testified at his hearing herein that he was guilty of the offense charged. Under these circumstances, we hold that the applicant failed to sustain the allegation. Compare <em>Escobedo v. State of Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">5. \u201cThat he was not informed that the statement which he signed could be used against him.\u201d If we assume, without deciding, that this allegation, if true, might entitle applicant to relief, no evidence was adduced at the hearing below concerning it. We cannot assume a bald, unsupported allegation in the petition to be true; hence there is nothing before us (with reference to this allegation) for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>For these reasons and those contained in Judge Carter\u2019s opinion with reference to applicant\u2019s other contentions, the application will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
