Maryland, 373 </em>U. S. 59, 10 L. Ed. 2d 193, and <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 </em>U. S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d <em>799. </em>(Subsequent to the report of Patuxent to the effect that the applicant was a defective delinquent and prior to Blann\u2019s hearing, the trial judge, acting in compliance with Art. 31B, Sec. 8 (a) and (b), appointed counsel to represent the applicant at his hearing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">' Passing the point that nowhere in the record does it appear that Blann below made the contention which he now asks us to consider, the answer to his claim is that the <em>White </em>and <em>Gideon </em>cases apply specifically to criminal prosecutions, while we have held many times that proceedings under the Defective Delinquent Act are, in their substantive and procedural aspects, civil in nature. See <em>Blizzard v. State, </em>218 Md. 384, 386; <em>Simmons v. Director, </em>227 Md. 661, 663; <em>McCloskey v. Director, 230 </em>Md. 635, <em>637; Monroe v.
