On this appeal the chief contention is that he was not adequately arraigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">The record shows that the appellant was brought before Judge Menchine for arraignment on August 15, 1963. The record shows that he had been served with copies of the indictments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>that same day at the time of his arrest. The court explained the charges and inquired if he had counsel. He replied that he had no funds, but that he had \u201ctalked to Mr. Sphritz.\u201d The court indicated that he would appoint Mr. Sphritz as his attorney as requested, and deferred arraignment. Upon petition of the State\u2019s Attorney, Judge Menchine signed an order on August 16, 1963, transferring the accused to Spring Grove State Hospital for mental examination as to his mental competence to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The case came on for hearing on November 1, 1963, before Judge Turnbull. The court was erroneously informed by Mr. Sphritz that the defendant had been previously arraigned, and desired to change his pleas from not guilty to guilty. The court then interrogated the appellant, outlined the charges against him, and inquired if he had \u201cdiscussed this\u201d with his attorney. He replied in the affirmative. The appellant also stated that he understood the pleas, that he recognized the fact that he could be punished, and that no threats, promises or inducements had been made \u201cin order to make this plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">After argument of counsel on both sides in regard to sentence, the court asked the appellant if he had anything to say, and remarked: \u201cyou have been through this often enough, so don\u2019t * * * put on an act.\u201d The appellant replied that he was \u201cnot proud\u201d of his life. The court then commented that he had been \u201cin state institutions * * * in military institutions [and] in Federal institutions.\u201d The court then imposed sentence and referred him to Patuxent Institution for evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We think it is clear that the plea of guilty was voluntarily made, and that there was at least substantial compliance with Maryland Rule 719. <em>Ayala v. State, </em>226 Md. 488, 491; <em>Gouker v. State, </em>224 Md. 524, 527; <em>Schuette v. State, 228 </em>Md. 340, 341. The case of <em>Taylor v. State, </em>230 Md. 1, is distinguishable on its facts. There the court failed to inform an accused of his right to counsel prior to the entry of a guilty plea. Cf. <em>Hoskins v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 613. The appellant was thirty-eight years of age, of normal intelligence, and as the State\u2019s Attorney remarked \u201crather familiar with the law in these proceedings.\u201d In connection with sentence, a matter argued on both sides, an F.B.I. report was put in evidence as State\u2019s exhibit No. 1, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the psychiatric report, of Dr. Prado as State\u2019s exhibit No. 2. In the latter report the appellant admitted that in the intervals between his incarceration in various state, military and Federal institutions, he had frequently resorted to forgery. Dr. Prado\u2019s report stated his opinion that the accused was competent to stand trial and to assist his counsel in his own defense. After imposing sentence, the court referred the appellant to Patuxent Institution for evaluation as a possible defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The appellant urges, on his own behalf and in addition to his contention as to failure to properly arraign, that he was denied due process because of illegal arrest, search and seizure, illegal confinement, inadequate representation by counsel, prejudice and malice on the part of Judge Turnbull. We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
