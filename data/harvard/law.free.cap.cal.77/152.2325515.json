The points made relate to the validity of such discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">1. It is contended that the requisite notice of the adjudication of insolvency was not given. The statute provides that a copy of the order must be published, and in addition that it shall be served either personally or by mail. (See section 7 of the Insolvency Act.) The appellant objects to the publication, and also to the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The objection to the publication is as follows: The order which was published is in these words:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u201cIn the matter of Herman Kirchner, an insolvent debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201c Herman <em>Hirchner </em>having filed in this court his petition, schedule, and inventory in insolvency, by which it appears that he is an insolvent debtor, the said Herman Kirchner is hereby declared,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">It is perfectly apparent from the foregoing that the name \u201cHirchner\u201d was a mere clerical error. And this appears upon the face of the order. The objection to the publication, therefore, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">There are several grounds of objection to the service by mail:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">. <em>(a) </em>It is said thi the affidavit of deposit in the post7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>office was insufficient, because it was not signed by the person for whom it was drawn up. The affidavit begins as follows: \u201cHerman Kirchner, being duly sworn, says,\u201d etc. It was signed by \u201c V. W. Gaskill, Deputy County Clerk,\u201d and the certificate is: <em>\u201cSubscribed </em>and sworn to this twentieth day of April, 1881. John F. Willard, Deputy County Clerk.\u201d The affidavit, therefore, was sworn to by the person who subscribed to it, who was Gaskill. And this being the case, we think that the recital in the affidavit as to \u201cHerman Kirchner being duly sworn \u201d may be rejected as surplusage, and that the affidavit is to be considered as made by Gaskill.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>(b) </em>The language of the affidavit is, that the notice was addressed \u201cone to each of said creditors at his place of business <em>as stated in said schedule.\u201d </em>The address of the creditor in the schedule is given in a column headed <em>\u201cResidence </em>of creditors.\u201d And it is argued that since no place of <em>business </em>is given in the schedule, the statement in the affidavit cannot be true. But in the first place, if the address was correctly given, the mistake of styling it a place of \" business\u201d when in fact it was a place of \u201cresidence\u201d does not seem to be material. And in the second place, it may be that the party resided at his place of business. There is no evidence that he did not, and the certificate of discharge being <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the regularity of the proceedings, it is to be presumed that such was the case, in the absence of a showing to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The address given does not seem to be a very definite one, but for all we know to the contrary it may have been a very well-known place.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The slight mistake in the spelling of the creditor\u2019s name, \u201cMcGilligan and Clark\u201d instead of \u201c Megilligan and Clark,\u201d is of no importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">2. It is contended that the discharge was invalid because of the insufficiency of the petition and inventory. The position is, that the following statement of debts due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the insolvent, viz., \u201c Debts due petitioner, $274,\u201d is not an \u201c accurate de=cT,'ption\u201d of the estate, as required by section 4 of <em>\u201eue </em>Insolvency Act. But it seems to have satisfie d oiie insolvency court. If the assignee had not been able to ascertain what the debts were by reason of the vagueness of the description, in all probability the court would not have granted the discharge. While the certificate of discharge is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, yet we do not understand that upon a collateral attack the creditor can raise objections which amount to a special demurrer to the petition. If there is not a total absence of essential averments, but only an insufficiency in the statement thereof, a collateral attack upon the discharge cannot be made. <em>(Mogk </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>75 Cal. 496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">It is argued, however, that some debts were omitted altogether from the inventory. In this regard the insolvent testified at the trial that he had not put in the inventory debts amounting to $650; that these debts were \u201coutlawed,\u201d and that he could n\u2019t get anything on them, and that he had not collected anything on them since. There was no evidence in contradiction of this. Taking the fact to be that the debts mentioned were utterly worthless and barred by limitation, we do not think their omission is ground for a collateral attack on the discharge. It is true that the insolvent should not take upon himself to decide what debts are worthless. And the insolvency courts should require full statements of the debts due to the insolvent. But where it is proven that the omitted debts were in fact worthless and barred by limitation, we are not prepared to say that the discharge can be collaterally attacked on the ground of the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The omission of these debts is claimed to amount to fraud and false swearing; but we see no ground for this position. The other matters do not require special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Thornton, J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AaB\">The affidavit of the deposit in the post-office was sufficient. If it was Kirchner\u2019s affidavit, it was sufficient, though not signed by him. In <em>Ede </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 Cal. 53, this was expressly held, and we think correctly held. If it was not Kirchner\u2019s affidavit, Deputy County Clerk Gaskill\u2019s affidavit was signed by him. It is immaterial that the affidavit commences \u201cHerman Eirchner, being duly sworn,\u201d etc. It is evident that this was a- clerical error or mistake, from the fact that the words just above quoted are followed by the statement \u201c that he is a deputy clerk of the county of Alameda.\u201d It appears that Ryder was the clerk of the county, and Gaskill, the affiant, his deputy, in April, 1881, when the affidavit was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We, cannot perceive any tenable grounds authorizing the ruling that the insolvency court did not have juris\u2022diction. The facts appearing bring it within the ruling in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>His Creditors, 22 </em>Cal. 38, which is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On the foregoing grounds, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
