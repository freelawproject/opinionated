After the information had been read, to which the defendant had pleaded not guilty of both charges, and the district attorney had stated what he expected to prove, the defendant answered that portion of the information which charged prior conviction of burglary by entering a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Then the case stood for trial upon the charge of petit larceny alone, so far as the pleadings were concerned, and the province of the jury. When the evidence was introduced, it was confined to the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant of petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The instructions for the people referred solely to the matter of the guilt or innocence of the defendant of <em>petit larceny. </em>To make it absolutely certain that the charge of prior conviction for burglary should not be considered by the jury, the court, at the instance of the defendant, expressly informed,them that as to that matter they had nothing whatever to do. Taking the instructions altogether, it is perfectly plain that the only charge remaining in the information for trial was that of petit larceny; that the jury were positively instructed to confine their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>deliberations to the consideration of the truth or falsity of that charge upon the evidence before them. There is no reason whatever to suppose that they ever dwelt in the remotest degree upon the charge of prior conviction of burglary, which, in their presence, had been eliminated from the trial by the confession of the defendant by his plea of guilty after the information had been read, and by the emphatic instructions of the court. They must have understood the instruction objected to as relating solely to the charge of petit larceny, the only one about which there was any dispute as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. The authorities cited by the defendant are wholly inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">We advise that the judgment and order be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Belcher, C. C., and Hayne, C., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b450-5\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Atqk\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
