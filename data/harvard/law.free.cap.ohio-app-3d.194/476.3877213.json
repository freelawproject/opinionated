Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Alnardo Feliciano, was charged in Berea Municipal Court with domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A) and eventually entered a plea of guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct. After the trial court imposed sentence, Feliciano paid his fine but filed a notice of appeal and requested the trial court to stay execution of the remainder of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 2} Feliciano now seeks to appeal from his conviction; however, this court cannot consider this case and must dismiss this appeal because the trial court did not enter a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cA judgment of conviction is a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 when it sets forth (1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon which the conviction is based; (2) the sentence; (3) the signature of the judge; and (4) <em>[the time stamp showing </em>journalization] <em>by the clerk of court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus, explaining Crim. R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">{\u00b6 4} A trial judge\u2019s handwritten notations made on a case file are insufficient to serve as a judgment entry unless those notations have been timestamped by the court\u2019s clerk. <em>State v. Charlton, </em>Summit App. No. 24035, 2008-Ohio-3771, 2008 WL 2924654; <em>Cuyahoga Falls v. Foster, </em>Summit App. No. 21820, 2004-Ohio-2662, 2004 WL 1160159, \u00b6 5, citing <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 337, 686 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">{\u00b6 5} The record submitted in this case demonstrates that the Berea municipal court\u2019s clerk has time-stamped some of the court\u2019s docket entries. The \u201cjournal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>entry\u201d from which Feliciano has attempted to appeal, however, is simply a part of a preprinted file folder. The entire file folder contains many handwritten notes, apparently added at different times during the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 6} Handwritten marks on the case file folder indicate that Feliciano was found guilty of \u201cDis. Conduct (M4)\u201d and received a sentence for that conviction, but the \u201cjournal entry\u201d does not bear a time-stamp showing journalization by the clerk of court. Moreover, although Feliciano submitted with his notice of appeal a \u201ccopy\u201d of the judgment entry, it, too, bears neither the judge\u2019s signature nor the court clerk\u2019s time-stamp. Therefore, the judgment does not comply with <em>Baker </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-7\">Blackmon, P.J., and E. Gallagher, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
