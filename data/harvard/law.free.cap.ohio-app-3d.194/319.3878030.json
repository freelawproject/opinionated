The court dismissed its complaint seeking a declaration that State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cState Auto\u201d) has a duty to indemnify and defend JTO in a lawsuit relating to a hotel constructed by JTO. The damage to the hotel was brought about by water infiltration, which was caused by defects in the construction of the hotel building. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">{\u00b6 2} Substantive Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">{\u00b6 3} JTO, a general contractor, entered into a contract with a hotel company to construct a Marriott Residence Inn in Mentor, Ohio. JTO subcontracted portions of the construction to Farizel Construction Company. Farizel purchased a commercial general-liability policy from State Auto, naming JTO as an additional insured on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">{\u00b6 4} In 2000, construction of the hotel was completed. However, the hotel experienced a water-infiltration problem shortly after opening for business. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>hotel company notified JTO and requested that the problem be remedied. JTO failed to do so. In 2007, the hotel company had repairs made to correct the water-infiltration problem, at a cost of $609,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 5} In 2008, the hotel company filed a suit against JTO, claiming breach of contract, breach of warranty of workmanlike performance, and breach of express warranty. The hotel\u2019s complaint alleged that shortly after opening, the hotel \u201cbegan to experience water infiltration in numerous places throughout the structure, including in entrance ways and guest rooms, resulting in damages to walls and ceilings.\u201d It sought damages in the amount of $609,000, the cost of repairing the damage caused by the water infiltration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 6} JTO brought a third-party action against Farizel. It also requested State Auto to provide a defense. State Auto denied coverage and refused to defend JTO in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 7} JTO then filed the instant action, claiming breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. It sought a judgment declaring that State Auto is obligated to indemnify and defend JTO, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. In response, State Auto filed a counterclaim seeking declaratory relief on issues of coverage and defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 8} State Auto then moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C). The trial court granted the motion and dismissed JTO\u2019s complaint, declaring that State Auto does not have a duty to defend or indemnify JTO. JTO now appeals, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting State Auto\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 10} Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cBecause Civ.R. 12(C) motions test the legal basis for the claims asserted in a complaint, our standard of review is de novo. In ruling on the motion, a court is permitted to consider both the complaint and the answer as well as any material incorporated by reference or attached as exhibits to those pleadings. In so doing, the court must construe the material allegations in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, as true and in favor of the non-moving party. A court granting the motion must find that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would entitle him or her to relief.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Frazier v. Kent, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 2004-P-0077 and 2004-P-0096, 2005-Ohio-5413, 2005 WL 2542940, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 12} The appellate court reviews de novo the granting or denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>Westwinds Dev. Corp. v. Outcalt, </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-G-2863, 2009-Ohio-2948, 2009 WL 1741978, \u00b6 23, citing <em>Euvrard v. Christ Hosp. &amp; Health Alliance </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 572, 575, 752 N.E.2d 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 14} The parties do not dispute that State Auto has no obligation to provide JTO with defense or indemnification regarding the defective construction that allegedly caused the water infiltration. The only issue is whether the damage to the property caused by the water infiltration is covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 15} JTO argues that it is entitled to coverage for the damage caused by the water infiltration because the water infiltration was an \u201coccurrence.\u201d State Auto maintains that it has no duty to defend or indemnify JTO because the alleged damage to the hotel ultimately resulted from the defect in the hotel\u2019s construction, not from an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 16} Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTo determine when the duty to defend arises, one must look to the allegations in the complaint and the insurance policy to ascertain whether the insured\u2019s actions were within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Snowden v. Hastings Mut. Ins. Co., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 209, 2008-Ohio-1540, 894 N.E.2d 336, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Thompson </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 78, 80, 23 OBR 208, 491 N.E.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe scope of the allegations in the complaint against the insured determines whether an insurance company has a duty to defend the insured. The insurer must defend the insured in an action when the allegations state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability insurance coverage. However, an insurer need not defend any action or claims within the complaint when all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ohio Govt. Risk Mgt. Plan v. Harrison, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 241, 2007-Ohio-4948, 874 N.E.2d 1155, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 19} Section I, paragraph 1 of the subject policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201ca.

Gibbs, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-L-058, 2005-Ohio-4210, 2005 WL 1940305, \u00b6 16. In <em>Gibbs, </em>this court provided the following ordinary meaning of an \u201caccident\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c \u2018An \u201caccident\u201d is an event proceeding from an unexpected happening or unknown cause without design and not in the usual course of things; an event that takes place without one\u2019s expectation; an undesigned, sudden and unexpected event; an event which proceeds from an unknown cause or is an unusual effect of a known cause and, therefore, unexpected.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 17.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 30} JTO concedes that the construction defects, which caused the water-infiltration problem, are not covered under the policy. It maintains, however, that the damage to the hotel building caused by the water infiltration is covered, because the water infiltration qualifies as an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 31} Regarding the issue of whether consequential damages stemming from faulty workmanship are caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d the Second District, in <em>Indiana Ins. Co. v. Alloyd Insulation Co., </em>2d Dist. No. 18979, 2002-Ohio-3916, 2002 WL 1770491, set forth the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018Insurance coverage is bottomed on the concept of fortuity. Applying this rule in the construction context, truly accidental property damage generally is covered because such claims and risks fit within the statistical abstract. Conversely, faulty workmanship claims generally are not covered, except for their consequential damages, because they are not fortuitous. In short, contractors\u2019 \u201cbusiness risks\u201d are not covered by insurance, but derivative damages are. <em>The key issues are whether the contractor controlled the process leading to the damages and whether the damages were anticipated.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018Coverage analysis largely turns on the damages sought. If the damages are for the insured\u2019s own work, there is generally no coverage. If the damages are consequential and derive from the work the insured performed, coverage generally will lie. The underwriting intent is to exclude coverage for the contractor\u2019s business risks, but provide coverage for unanticipated consequential damages.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added and citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 27-28, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Franco, Insurance Coverage for Faulty Workmanship Claims Under Commercial General Liability Policies (1994), 30 Tort and Ins.L.J. 785, 785-787.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Alloyd, </em>the plaintiff/property owner alleged that the defective construction of a roof caused corrosion and other damage to the property. The Second District concluded that the corrosion and related damage, as consequential damages, constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the policy, because they were \u201can accident, including continuous exposure, or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Id., 2002-Ohio-3916, 2002 WL 1770491, at \u00b6 31. See also <em>Dublin Bldg. Sys. v. Selective Ins. Co. of Am., </em>172 Ohio App.3d 196, 2007-Ohio-494, 874 N.E.2d 788 (the court concluded that damage by mold caused by a failure to seal the exterior joints of the buildings was covered under the commercial general-liability insurance policy). Although we are aware of the contrary authorities on this issue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we find the reasoning of the Second District persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 35} In this case, the hotel company alleged in its complaint that shortly after opening, the hotel \u201cbegan to experience water infiltration in numerous places throughout the structure, including in entrance ways and guest rooms, resulting in damages to walls and ceilings.\u201d The applicable analysis for whether coverage exists is whether \u201c \u2018the contractor controlled the process leading to the damages and whether the damages were anticipated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alloyd, </em>2002-Ohio-3916, 2002 WL 1770491, at \u00b6 27, quoting Franco, Insurance Coverage for Faulty Workmanship Claims under Commercial General Liability Policies (1994), 30 Tort &amp; Ins.L.J. 785. Under an appropriate set of facts, the water infiltration <em>can </em>be an \u201coccurrence,\u201d i.e., \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Therefore, construing in its favor the material allegations in its complaint, with all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, we cannot say that JTO can prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, the trial court erred in granting State Auto\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing JTO\u2019s complaint. The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-10\">Grendell and Rice, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\">.
