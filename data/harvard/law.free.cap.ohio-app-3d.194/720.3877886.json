For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">{\u00b6 2} On November 8, 2007, appellant was indicted on one count of murder and one count of tampering with evidence. On September 5, 2008, appellant filed a motion to suppress evidence, asserting lack of probable cause for the search and seizure of his girlfriend\u2019s residence, his personal property, and his own person. A suppression hearing was conducted on September 15, 2008, and the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on March 2, 2010, and concluded on March 5, 2010, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of murder and one count of tampering with evidence. The same day, the trial court sentenced appellant to a term of 15 years to life for the murder conviction, a violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), and sentenced him to five years, to be served consecutively, for the conviction of tampering with evidence, a violation of R.C. 2921.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant now appeals the decision of the trial court, setting forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it overruled appellant Randy Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an unreasonable warrantless entry into and search of his premises in the absence of not only probable cause but also of authorized consent or permission, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cII. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it overruled appellant Randy Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of a subsequent inspection of his premises pursuant to a warrant issued in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cIII. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it overruled appellant Randy Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of a warrantless seizure of his personal property in violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIV. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it overruled appellant Randy Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of searches of his personal property and person pursuant to warrants issued in violation of the of the of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 9} The following facts are relevant to the four assignments of error raised on this appeal. Damon Hudson, an officer of the North Baltimore police department, and John Helm, an investigator for the Wood County prosecutor\u2019s office, both testified at the suppression hearing. A summary of their testimony is below.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 10} On October 15, 2007, Karen Coldwell phoned police to report that her car was stolen by appellant, her boyfriend. The following day, on October 16, 2007, Officer Damon Hudson received a call regarding a possible missing-person report and responded to 409 West State Street. Hudson testified that upon arrival he was met outside the residence by Misty Mason, the adult daughter of Coldwell. Mason told the officer that her mother had been missing for almost 24 hours and that this was unlike her mother. Mason also expressed concerns that on the night of October 15, 2007, she had overheard her mother fighting and arguing with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 11} During the initial visit, Hudson was aware that 409 West State Street was the residence of Coldwell because he had been called to the residence a number of times because of \u201cinstances\u201d between Coldwell and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 12} Hudson entered Coldwell\u2019s home following an invitation from Mason. Once inside Coldwell\u2019s home, Mason pointed out personal effects that included Coldwell\u2019s contact lenses, work identification, cell phone, and purse. Mason told Hudson that her mother would never leave her home without them. Mason also indicated that a beer can on the dining room table belonged to appellant, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>on her observation that the tab on the beer was turned to the right.' Also in plain view were the words \u201clove hurts,\u201d which were written on a living room table with what looked to be soap.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 13} At some point, Coldwell\u2019s other adult daughter, Jessica Reed, arrived. Both Mason and Reed told Hudson that they had spoken to appellant and believed that appellant was at Nathan Roe\u2019s house. Hudson then called the sheriffs office to see if they could find the reported stolen vehicle near Roe\u2019s address. After roughly one hour at Coldwell\u2019s home, Hudson returned to the police department to fill out a missing-person report.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 14} Later that day, Hudson returned a second time to 409 West State Street. Upon arrival, Hudson noticed Coldwell\u2019s car parked in the driveway. The daughters told Hudson that they had discovered their mother\u2019s car near Roe\u2019s home and drove it back. To further support their concern, the daughters pointed out Coldwell\u2019s glasses and keys, which were left in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 15} The daughters again invited Hudson into Coldwell\u2019s house. Once inside, Hudson listened to a conversation between Mason and appellant on a speakerphone. Appellant asserted that Coldwell was at Miss Cue, a sports bar, and refused to help with the efforts to locate Coldwell. Hudson testified that this conversation, along with previous findings, created a mounting suspicion that Coldwell may have been a victim of foul play.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 16} Hudson and the daughters walked through the house a second time looking for anything that would indicate the whereabouts of Coldwell. Among items retrieved were the glass top with \u201clove hurts\u201d written on it, a pack of cigarettes, a beer can, a lighter, and a towel with a red-brown substance on it that appeared to be blood. All items were in plain sight and identified during the first visit except for the towel, which was found in the bathroom during the second walkthrough by Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 17} Investigator John Helm testified that he first arrived at 409 West State Street on October 17, 2007, to assist the police department in a missing-person case. Based on conversations with Coldwell\u2019s daughters and friends and police, Helm obtained a search warrant for 409 West State Street. The purpose of the warrant was to search for \u201cany evidence tending to explain the whereabouts of Karen Coldwell or any harm that may have come to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 18} Helm testified that he believed he had a valid search warrant when these following items were retrieved from Coldwell\u2019s residence: a pillowcase, shaver, toothbrush, and hairbrush. The pillowcase tested positive for blood and the other items were taken to establish a DNA standard for the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 19} Helm learned through a conversation with Roe that on October 15, 2007, appellant stayed overnight at Roe\u2019s home. Roe also informed Helm that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>lant was no longer staying with him and that appellant had left a garbage bag containing recently washed clothes in the back of Roe\u2019s pickup truck. The bag was left open and Helm testified that he could see some clothing and deodorant through the top of the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 20} Coldwell\u2019s body was found on October 18, 2007. Subsequently, a second search warrant to search the contents of the bag was issued on October 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 21} A third search warrant was issued to attain two buccal swabs from appellant while he was at the Wood County jail for the purpose of DNA comparison to previously collected evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 22} An appellate court\u2019s review of a suppression hearing presents a mixture of questions of fact and law. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, \u00b6 100. When resolving matters involving factual questions, an appellate court must uphold the decision of the trial judge if the findings are supported by competent, credible evidence. Id. In contrast, when reviewing matters involving a legal conclusion, the appropriate standard of review is de novo, and the appellate court should give no deference to the decisions of the trial court and instead independently determine whether the applicable legal standards are met. <em>State v. Claytor </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 623, 627, 620 N.E.2d 906; <em>United States v. Watkins </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 179 F.3d 489, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 23} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the court should have suppressed evidence gathered by Hudson during the two warrantless walkthroughs of 409 West State Street. Appellant- alleges that Hudson failed to obtain consent to search the residence and that there was no emergency or exigency that justified the warrantless entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 24} The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure by the government. However, in order to have standing to challenge a violation, an individual must have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the subject matter of the search. <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85; <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>(1978), 439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387. A legitimate expectation of privacy is \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>at 143-144. The burden is on the party asserting the motion to provide sufficient evidence to prove grounds for standing. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Olson, </em>the Supreme Court held that that an individual\u2019s status as an overnight guest is alone enough to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. at 96-97, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85. However, the ruling in <em>Olson </em>is limited in that it does not apply to prior overnight guests, regardless of the level of frequency, who failed to present sufficient evidence to show that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>were an overnight guest at the time of the search. <em>State v. Davis </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 277, 285, 609 N.E.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 26} When at the time of the search an individual is not an overnight guest, courts look at the totality of the circumstances in making a determination. <em>State v. Messenger, </em>3d Dist. No. 9-09-19, 2010-Ohio-479, 2010 WL 530087, \u00b6 16. In <em>Messenger, </em>the court determined that appellant did not meet the status of an overnight guest despite evidence showing that he had been staying at the residence for over a year, had no restrictions as a guest, had free use of household items, and had left several personal items throughout the house because appellant was staying somewhere else at the time of the search. Id. at \u00b6 15-16. In <em>Hill v. United States </em>(App.D.C.1995), 664 A.2d 347, the court found that the defendant, despite sometimes being an overnight guest, did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, because there was no evidence that he was planning on spending that particular night at the apartment. Similarly the court in <em>Alston v. Maryland </em>(2004), 159 Md.App. 253, 858 A.2d 1100, 1107-1109, found that an appellant who was an on-and-off overnight guest had no expectation of privacy when he failed to provide additional evidence connecting him to the premises, such as whether he planned to stay as an overnight guest on the night of the search, whether he had the right to invite others into the premise, whether he had a key to the home, whether he had personal effects left at the premises, and whether he received mail at the premises. In <em>Rankin v. State </em>(1997), 57 Ark. App. 125, 942 S.W.2d 867, 870-871, the court held that even though the defendant frequently stayed at his girlfriend\u2019s home as an overnight guest and had left prescription bottles at the home, he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because he was not an overnight guest on the day of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 27} Returning to the case at hand, the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence from the two warrantless entries of 409 West State Street because there was no evidence that appellant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Coldwell\u2019s residence. In the suppression hearing, no evidence was provided that would lead a trial judge to rule that appellant ever held a status higher than that of an overnight guest. Although appellant occasionally stayed at Coldwell\u2019s home, like the defendants in <em>Hill, Messenger, Alston, </em>and <em>Rankin, </em>there was no evidence to support a finding that appellant intended to stay as an overnight guest on the day of search. To the contrary, appellant not only stayed at Roe\u2019s home on the night of October 15, but also failed to make any attempts to return to the State Street residence on October 16, the day of the two warrant-less searches, or at any point following the search. According to Detective Helm\u2019s testimony, \u201cin the time period from the 15th to the 18th, he [appellant] had changed residences two times. He had been living in the address in North Baltimore. By the 16th he had stayed at Roe\u2019s overnight, and the 18th he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>staying in a trailer in Fostoria.\u201d Also, there was no evidence showing that appellant helped pay the mortgage or utility bills or stored personal affects at Coldwell\u2019s home. Further support for the termination of appellant\u2019s overnight-guest status can be gathered from the fact that on October 15 Coldwell reported to the police department that her car may have been stolen by appellant. Therefore a review of the totality of the circumstances provides ample evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 28} Even if this court were to determine that the trial court erred in finding that appellant had no expectation of privacy in the State Street home, the warrantless search would still be valid due to third-party consent. In <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148, the court found that a third party who possesses common authority may consent to a search of the premises. A person with sufficient relationship over the premises may also give consent to a search. <em>State v. Sneed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 3, 7, 584 N.E.2d 1160; <em>United States v. Matlock </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242. It is not necessary that the consenting third party have actual authority over the premises. <em>United States v. Ayoub </em>(C.A.6, 2007), 498 F.3d 532, 537. Even if the belief is erroneous, using an objective standard, third-party consent is valid if the officer looking at the then available facts could reasonably conclude that the third party had apparent authority to consent. <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 177, 186-189, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148; <em>Ayoub </em>at 537. An officer\u2019s belief is not reasonable if the surrounding circumstances would lead a reasonable person to doubt the authority of the third party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>United States v. Hilliard </em>(C.A.8, 2007), 490 F.3d 635, the court found that the officer\u2019s belief that a third party had apparent authority to consent to a search was reasonable, because the third party answered the door and invited officers into the home and was familiar with the location of items within the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 30} Here the trial judge found as a matter of fact that Hudson reasonably believed that Mason and Reed had a sufficient relationship over the premises to consent to the search. Hudson knew that Mason and Reed were daughters who kept in close contact with their mother, appeared to have access to their mother\u2019s home, readily invited Hudson into their mother\u2019s home without any hesitation, and were familiar with the location of items throughout the house. Based on the record, there is sufficient credible evidence to support the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 31} Because appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy and Hudson\u2019s belief that the daughters had apparent authority was reasonable, we need not consider whether the requirements for exigent circumstances were met. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>{\u00b6 32} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the subsequent warrant issued for the search of 409 West State Street was unreasonable due to lack of probable cause. Appellant further asserts that the warrant fails to fall under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">{\u00b6 33} The totality of the circumstances is considered when determining whether a warrant affidavit supports the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that there was substantial basis to believe that probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 230-231, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527. The Ohio Supreme Court, in following the standard set forth in <em>Gates, </em>stated that when reviewing the sufficiency of an affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, an appellate court should give great deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 329, 544 N.E.2d 640; <em>Gates </em>at 213. Furthermore when the case is marginal, reviewing courts should uphold the validity of the warrant. <em>George </em>at 329-330.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 34} The evidence in the record provides sufficient support for the trial judge\u2019s finding that there was probable cause that the search of the premises would lead to information that would help locate or explain the disappearance of Coldwell. Coldwell was reported missing by her daughter who kept in close contact; Coldwell and appellant had a history of fighting that had even led Coldwell to contemplate suicide in the past; the words \u201clove hurts\u201d were written on the glass top table of Coldwell\u2019s home; Coldwell\u2019s car was reportedly stolen by appellant; and a towel with what looked to be blood stains was found on the premises. All these facts provide ample evidence sufficient to support a trial judge\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to issue a search warrant for the State Street residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 35} Even if this court were to determine that the search-warrant affidavit contained insufficient evidence to establish probable cause, the evidence obtained with the search warrant is still admissible pursuant to the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677; <em>State v. Wilmoth </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 251, 254, 22 OBR 427, 490 N.E.2d 1236. In <em>Leon </em>the court articulated that absent an \u201callegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Leon </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 36} The application of the <em>Leon </em>test to our facts supports the finding that the evidence collected under the first warrant is admissible under the good-faith exception. During the suppression hearing there was no evidence that Helm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>purposely or recklessly misled the judge. No evidence was presented to show that the issuing judge abandoned his role as a neutral, competent judge when reviewing the affidavit. Also, Helm reasonably believed he had a valid warrant when he conducted the search of Coldwell\u2019s home. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision to deny appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence gathered as a result of the first issued warrant was proper. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 37} In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that the evidence obtained from the warrantless seizure of items left in a bag in the back of Roe\u2019s pickup truck should be suppressed. Appellant contends that the seizure was unreasonable since there was no evidence to conclude that the property was abandoned by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 38} Abandoned property is not afforded protection under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Abel v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 217, 241, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668. In <em>United States v. Colbert </em>(C.A.5, 1973), 474 F.2d 174, 176, the court stated that \u201cabandonment is primarily a question of intent, and intent may be inferred from words spoken, acts done, and other objective facts.\u201d In <em>State v. Gould, </em>6th Dist. No. L-08-1383, 2010-Ohio-3437, 2010 WL 2891490, \u00b6 28, this court stated that \u201call relevant circumstances existing at the time of the alleged abandonment should be considered\u201d when determining whether a property was intended to be abandoned. Therefore it is important to determine whether the owner of the abandoned property voluntarily relinquished his interest in the property such that a reasonable expectation of privacy does not exist at the time of the search. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>People v. Schmeck </em>(Cal.2005), 37 Cal.4th 240, 281, 33 Cal.Rptr.3d 397, 118 P.3d 451, the court found that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy when he left a paper bag in the garage owned by an acquaintance because the acquaintance had free, unrestricted access to the bag. Further, the court found that when an individual leaves an unsecured bag with an acquaintance, that person assumes the risk that the acquaintance may search the contents of the bag or legally consent to the search of the bag. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 40} The facts of our case are similar to those found in <em>Schmeck. </em>As in <em>Schmeck, </em>appellant left his personal property with Roe, an acquaintance, and placed it in plain view in a location that was readily accessible to Roe. Also, as in <em>Schmeck, </em>there was no expectation of privacy because the bag containing the clothes was not secured with a lock nor was Roe instructed to not look inside the bag. Furthermore, Roe stated to Helm that appellant was no longer staying at his home and that the bag was left by appellant in the back of Roe\u2019s truck. Roe did not provide any statements indicating that appellant intended to retrieve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>bag in the future. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, the fact that the bag contained clothes that were freshly laundered and left open on the back of a friend\u2019s pickup truck gives little weight to support a conclusion that appellant intended to return for the bag. In this case, the trial judge reasonably determined that appellant abandoned his bag at Roe\u2019s home and had no expectation of privacy for the contents of the bag. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 41} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that the warrant issued to search the contents of the bag found in Roe\u2019s truck and the warrant to compel a DNA sample from appellant were unreasonable because of lack of probable cause to issue the warrants. For the same reasons articulated in support of the trial judge\u2019s decision in the second assignment of error, this court finds that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the second and third search warrants were supported by probable cause. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 42} On due consideration, the decision of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed. Pursuant to App.R. 24, appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b769-8\">Osowik, P.J., and Pietrykowski, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
