The basis of the charge was that she had stolen steel valued at $13,148 from Metro Deck Inc. A victim-impact statement indicated that Metro Deck had been reimbursed in full for the value of the stolen items by its insurer. Still, the trial court ordered Berlinger to pay restitution to Metro Deck for the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In a single assignment of error, Berlinger now argues that the trial court erred in ordering her to pay restitution when the victim had already been reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">{\u00b6 4} We find no error in the trial court\u2019s order. In 2004, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2929.18 to remove a trial court\u2019s authority to order that restitution be paid to a party other than the victim of an offense, the victim\u2019s survivor, or certain agencies designated by the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) now provides that the court may order \u201c[rjestitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. If the court imposes restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court, to the adult probation department that serves the county on behalf of the victim, to the clerk of courts, or to another agency designated by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 5} Berlinger cites a number of cases for the proposition that the order in this case was unlawful under the current version of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But in the cases cited by Berlinger, restitution was ordered to be paid directly to the victims\u2019 insurers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 6} Here, the trial court ordered that the restitution be paid to the victim, not to the victim\u2019s insurer. The court therefore did not act outside the authority granted to it under R.C. 2929.18(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 7} Nonetheless, Berlinger suggests that the trial court erred because Metro Deck did not suffer any \u201ceconomic loss\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We disagree. Metro Deck suffered economic loss in the amount of $13,148. Although insured, Metro Deck paid premiums to secure the coverage in an amount that would cover the theft. And in any event, the fact that Metro Deck was insured should not redound to the benefit of Berlinger, who caused the economic loss. The trial court acted in conformity with R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), and we overrule the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 8} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-10\">Sundermann and Cunningham, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\">.
