For the reasons outlined below, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">{\u00b6 2} On April 24, 2007, Jennifer Touhey was injured in an automobile accident when she collided with a truck and trailer owned by Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turf, a landscaping company owned and operated by Mark E. Ross. At the time of the accident, Funk was driving the vehicle, accompanied by Frank Crabtree, an employee of Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turf.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">{\u00b6 3} On March 11, 2009, appellants filed an action against Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf as well as its alleged employee, Funk, claiming, among other things, negligence, vicarious liability, and negligent hiring and supervision. Appellants also sought to recover punitive damages. After filing their answers, Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims, and Funk filed a motion for partial summary judgment solely on the issue of punitive damages. The trial court granted both parties\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants now appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision granting Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turfs motion for summary judgment as well as Funk\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, raising two assignments of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turfs motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 6} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Burgess v. Tackas </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 294, 296, 708 N.E.2d 285. Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come only to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, construing the evidence most strongly in that party\u2019s favor. See Civ.R. 56(C); see also <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. The movant bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once this burden is met, the nonmovant has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be construed in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>Walters v. Middletown Properties Co., </em>Butler App. No. CA2001-10-249, 2002-Ohio-3730, 2002 WL 1625682, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants initially argue that the trial court erred in its decision granting summary judgment to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf by finding that Funk was not an Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf employee, \u201cas there was conflicting and disputed evidence upon which reasonable minds could come to different conclusions as to the employment status of Funk at Ed\u2019s Tree.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cWhether someone is an employee or an independent contractor is ordinarily an issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 524 N.E.2d 881, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Billman v. Massillon Dev. Group, L.L.C., </em>Stark App. No. 2007-CA-00169, 2008-Ohio-287, 2008 WL 223668, \u00b6 10. However, \u201cwhere the evidence is not in conflict or the facts are admitted, the question of whether a person is an employee <em>or </em>an independent contractor is a matter of law to be determined by the court.\u201d <em>Parrett v. Trost </em>(Feb. 7, 2000), Clermont App. No. CA99-06-058, 2000 WL 155515, at 5; <em>Brown v. CDS Transport Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 10AP-46, 2010-Ohio-4606, 2010 WL 3783137, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 10} Whether one is an employee or an independent contractor depends on the facts of each case. <em>Mendoza v. Bishop, </em>Butler App. No. CA200404-080, 2005-Ohio-238, 2005 WL 123982, \u00b6 34; <em>Gillum v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 373, 25 O.O. 531, 48 N.E.2d 234, paragraph two of the syllabus. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>key factual determination in making such a finding \u201cis who had the right to control the manner or means of doing the work.\u201d <em>Bookwalter v. Prescott, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 262, 2006-Ohio-585, 859 N.E.2d 978, \u00b6 17. As noted by the Ohio Supreme Court, in making such a determination, \u201c[t]he factors to be considered include, but are certainly not limited to, such indicia as who controls the details and quality of the work; who controls the hours worked; who selects the materials, tools and personnel used; who selects the routes traveled; the length of employment; the type of business; the method of payment; and any pertinent agreements or contracts.\u201d <em>Bostic </em>at 146, 524 N.E.2d 881; <em>Baker v. Curtis C. Howard Equip. </em>(Dec. 14, 1998), Madison App. No. CA98-04-019, 1998 WL 857578, at *4; <em>Nye v. Kemp </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 130, 133, 646 N.E.2d 262. \u201cAll indicia of an employment relationship in a given case must be assessed together as a whole.\u201d <em>Vajda v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80917, 2003-Ohio-160, 2003 WL 125086, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Harmon v. Schnurmacher </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 616 N.E.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">{\u00b6 11} According to Funk\u2019s deposition testimony, Funk, who claimed he was paid \u201cunderneath the table,\u201d worked for Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf maintaining its \u201cmachines and stuff\u2019 for \u201c[a]bout a month, month and a half\u2019 before he was fired immediately after the accident in question. In addition, Funk, who testified that he worked \u201cclose to\u201d 40 hours a week, but less if Ross \u201cdidn\u2019t need\u201d him, claimed that he would report to the shop \u201cbetween 8 and 8:30\u201d Monday through Friday, and \u201csometimes Saturday,\u201d in order to \u201cstart [its] equipment up\u201d and \u201cget everything warmed up so it would be ready to go.\u201d Funk would then \u201cclean the shop up\u201d and \u201cchange the oil and stuff for them,\u201d or, if something were to break down, \u201ccheck the batteries out, make sure the battery is up enough where it runs the equipment.\u201d Funk also testified that \u201c[i]f something breaks down [at a job site],\u201d he would \u201ctake stuff out there to try to fix equipment when it\u2019s out in the area.\u201d When asked who told him what to do after he reported to the shop, and who he considered to be his boss, Funk testified that Ross was the boss who instructed him on what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 12} According to Ross, Funk was not an employee of Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf but would often \u201cjust hang around the shop, talk to his friend Frank Crabtree, or fish.\u201d Ross did testify, however, that after meeting Funk, he agreed that Funk could come to the shop and \u201cchange some oil, things like that,\u201d but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a mechanic, labeled. He just did some oddball things.\u201d In addition, when asked during his deposition, \u201c[o]ther than you, was there any other employee that would have been responsible for supervising [Funk],\u201d Ross testified affirmatively, and named his foreman, Tim Taylor, as well as his brother and employee, Bryan Ross. Ross, who also admitted to paying Funk \u201cwhen he completed a task we allowed him to perform\u201d and permitting him to use Ed\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turfs tools, further testified that Funk never filled out a job application, did not complete any withholding-tax documents, and did not receive any employee benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 13} After a thorough review of the record, and upon construing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, something that this court must do when reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, we find that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to Funk\u2019s status as an employee or independent contractor of Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf. As noted above, evidence was presented indicating that Funk went to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turfs shop on a daily basis in order to get the necessary equipment \u201cwarmed up.\u201d Evidence was also presented indicating that Funk worked \u201cclose to\u201d 40 hours a week cleaning up the shop and maintaining Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turfs equipment, but that Ross, his alleged boss, actually controlled the amount of hours Funk worked. In addition, evidence was presented indicating that Ross, as well as his foreman, Tim Taylor, and brother and employee, Bryan Ross, were responsible for supervising Funk. There was also evidence indicating that Funk was paid for his services, albeit \u201cunderneath the table,\u201d and that he was permitted to use Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turfs tools. Based on this evidence, we find that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to Funk\u2019s status as an employee or an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 14} Having found that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to Funk\u2019s status as an employee or an independent contractor, we find that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf. Therefore, because a genuine issue of material fact remains, we find it unnecessary to address the remaining issues presented by appellants under their first assignment of error. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is sustained and the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to Ed\u2019s Tree <em>&amp; </em>Turf is reversed. The cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee Rudy Funk\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">{\u00b6 16} In their second assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting Funk\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment regarding their claim for punitive damages. In support of their claim, appellants argue that the trial court erred by finding that Funk\u2019s actions in deciding to drive that day \u201cdid not establish a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In tort law, punitive damages are available in actions involving fraud, actual malice, oppression, or insult on the part of the defendant. <em>Creech v. Brock &amp; Assoc. Constr., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 711, 2009-Ohio-3930, 918 N.E.2d 541, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Preston v. All Vinyl Fence &amp; Decks, Inc., </em>Trumbull App. No. 2008-T-0015, 2008-Ohio-6997, 2008 WL 5428817, \u00b6 37; R.C. 2315.21. Actual malice, as required for an award of punitive damages in this case, means, among other things, \u201ca conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u201d <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 335, 512 N.E.2d 1174. When actual malice is predicated on conscious disregard, such as is the case here, the court \u201cmust review the evidence to determine if reasonable minds can differ as to whether the party was aware his or her act had a great probability of causing substantial harm\u201d and whether sufficient evidence was presented \u201cthat the party consciously disregarded the injured party\u2019s rights or safety.\u201d Id.; <em>Malone v. Courtyard by Marriott L.P. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 440, 446, 659 N.E.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 18} In this case, Funk, who claimed to have had some experience working on the trailer that was attached to the truck involved in the accident, testified that before driving the truck, which Ross identified as a Ford F600 that had a \u201cgross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds,\u201d he noticed that the \u201cwires\u201d for the trailer\u2019s brakes \u201cgot cut somehow through the job site.\u201d When asked whether he informed Crabtree that the \u201cwires on the trailer were cut,\u201d Funk testified that Crabtree told him \u201cthey would be alright.\u201d Funk then testified that while driving the truck, a vehicle for which he testified he was unqualified and was uncomfortable driving, he came across a stopped vehicle that required him to hit the brakes abruptly, thus prompting the trailer, which had a gross vehicle weight of 7,000 pounds, to slide across the centerline and strike appellants\u2019 vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 19} After a de novo review of the record, and again upon construing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellants, we find that a genuine issue of material fact remains whether Funk acted with conscious disregard for the safety of others by driving the truck, a vehicle weighing 26,000 pounds, for which he claimed he was unqualified and was uncomfortable driving, along with its attached trader, a trailer he claimed to have worked on previously, that had its brake \u201cwires * * * cut somehow through the job site.\u201d In turn, even though Funk claimed Crabtree told him \u201cthey would be alright,\u201d and even assuming, as the dissent asserts, that Funk believed it imprudent to allow Crabtree to drive in his condition, reasonable minds can still differ whether Funk was aware that driving a truck with a trailer that had its brakes cut exhibited a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others that created a great probability of causing substantial harm. Just as it is day-to-day knowledge that would have the dissent \u201cconclude centrifugal force caused the forward movement of the trailer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>swing out from behind the truck,\u201d it is also day-to-day knowledge that driving a vehicle with an attached trailer that arguably did not have any brakes, at a minimum, creates a question of fact whether Funk acted in conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 20} The dissent, although not explicit, essentially claims that appellants have waived any issues regarding the trailer\u2019s braking system since they did not rely upon these facts in their memorandum in opposition to Funk\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, those facts, which Ross, Crabtree, and Funk all testified to as part of their October 9, 2009 depositions, were clearly part of the record before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 21} On appeal from a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment, this court is required to review both the law and the facts de novo. In other words, \u201c[w]hen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u201d <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. In turn, although these facts were not specifically relied upon by appellants in their memorandum in opposition to Funk\u2019s motion for summary judgment, such facts are still part of the record precluding this court from affirming the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">{\u00b6 22} In light of the foregoing, because a genuine issue of material fact remains whether Funk acted with a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others, we find that the trial court erred by granting partial summary judgment to Funk on appellants\u2019 punitive-damages claim. It is the trier of fact, not this court, that will ultimately decide whether appellants\u2019 claim for punitive damages is meritorious. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is sustained, the trial court\u2019s decision granting partial summary judgment to Funk is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b845-9\">Hendrickson, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b845-10\">Piper, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b845-11\">Piper, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">{\u00b6 23} I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the decision of the trial court as it pertains to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding Funk\u2019s status as either an employee or an independent contractor. However, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion reversing the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment as to punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>pertaining to Funk. When examining the evidence in the light most favorable to Touhey, reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion as it relates to punitive damages, which requires us to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 24} The majority opinion correctly points out that punitive damages are recoverable in actions involving actual malice. The majority cites <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, paragraph one of the syllabus, for the proposition that actual malice means \u201ca conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u201d Since <em>Preston, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court has elaborated on the degree of proof necessary to demonstrate conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Calmes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 470, 473, 575 N.E.2d 416, quoting <em>Preston </em>at 335, the court reiterated its holding in <em>Preston </em>and explained that \u201cpunitive damages are intended to punish and deter conduct resulting from a mental state so callous in its disregard for the rights and safety of others that society deems it intolerable. This mental state is the component of the standard contained in the phrase \u2018conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons.\u2019 \u201d The <em>Calmes </em>court articulated that \u201cmisconduct greater than mere negligence is required. This component is expressed in the language \u2018great probability of causing substantial harm.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting <em>Preston </em>at 335-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 26} The supreme court later stated that \u201cactual malice requires consciousness of the near certainty (or otherwise stated \u2018great probability\u2019) that substantial harm will be caused by the tortious behavior. Any less callous mental state is insufficient to incur that level of societal outrage necessary to justify an award of punitive damages. Therefore, it is evident that a reckless actor, who only has knowledge of the mere possibility that his or her actions may result in substantial harm, is not behaving maliciously.\u201d <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Said </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 690, 698, 590 N.E.2d 1228, overruled on other grounds (1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 552, 644 N.E.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">{\u00b6 27} In support of punitive damages, the majority opinion focuses upon Funk\u2019s feeling uncomfortable and unqualified to drive the truck, the weight of the vehicles involved, and the possibility that the trailer brake lines were not operating. Apparently, neither the trial court nor the parties treated the brake lines as a genuine issue or a material fact because Touhey did not raise the brake issue in her memorandum in opposition to Funk\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the trial court did not address the brakes in its decision and entry. A de novo review should apply the evidence to the issues presented to the trial court. See <em>Wall v. Sprague, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2007-05-065, 2008-Ohio-3384, 2008 WL 2635528, \u00b6 20 (noting that \u201cappellate courts do not consider arguments raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>by parties for the first time on appeal. * * * \u2018Despite the fact that appellate courts review summary judgment decisions de novo, the parties are not given a second chance to raise arguments that they should have raised below\u2019 \u201d). These items, in the totality of all the other circumstances, clearly do not rise to the level of a conscious disregard of the near certainty or great probability of substantial harm as discussed in <em>Calmes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 28} According to Funk\u2019s deposition testimony, Funk did not desire to drive the truck that day but, to the contrary, was reluctant, only to be pressured into driving by Crabtree because his back hurt. Funk\u2019s testimony indicated that he was friends with Crabtree (the man who helped him secure employment) and would help him when Crabtree \u201cneeded help.\u201d Funk clearly testified that on the day of the accident, Crabtree asked him to drive because he was suffering from back pain. When Funk expressed his hesitancy to drive, Crabtree \u201cbasically forced\u201d him to drive. Opposite the majority\u2019s suggestion of a material fact regarding the probability of contemplated harm, it would appear Funk believed it imprudent to allow one concerned or distracted with pain to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 29} Funk\u2019s acquiescence to Crabtree\u2019s persistence may arguably establish Funk\u2019s negligence, but that, along with the other factors referenced by the majority, does not establish a callous act in disregard for the rights and safety of others. It would be a departure from previously pronounced definitions as applied to factual circumstances to say that the legal standards involved here would embrace punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">{\u00b6 30} Regarding the brake lines, the majority relies upon the idea that the accident was caused by an issue with the trailer\u2019s brakes. The record, however, does not establish the reason for the accident. Neither party submits any evidence that nonfunctioning trailer brakes were the cause of the collision. There was no evidence or argument before the trial court that the unloaded trailer was required by law or practicality to have an independent braking system. Furthermore, the majority discusses cut wires as though they were severed, when that was not established before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">{\u00b6 31} Funk testified that he had been driving without any trouble for approximately 20 minutes when he came around a corner, saw stopped traffic, and abruptly \u201cput on the brakes.\u201d At that point, the trailer \u201cpushed the truck, and the trailer went left of center and [Touhey] sideswiped the trailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">{\u00b6 32} A review of Funk\u2019s other testimony demonstrates that he is testifying to possibilities and probabilities through leading questions that are permeated with uncertainty and conjecture. In testifying to the details of the accident, the following exchange occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[Q] Do you know what\u2014is that trailer equipped with electric brake [sic], probably?</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201c[A] Probably, yeah, but the truck wasn\u2019t hooked up for electric brakes for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[Q] Pardon me?</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[A] We had it hooked up, but that truck, I don\u2019t think it was for electric brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[Q] So when you hooked up that trailer to the truck, the only\u2014you put, obviously, the receptacle, there was plug for the lights, right? Yes?</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c[A] Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c[Q] And you don\u2019t believe that that trailer was equipped with electric brakes?</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c[A] No, not unless\u2014the wires got cut somehow, either through the job site or something like that, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">{\u00b6 41} When asked what his response was to the possibility of cut wires, Funk responded that he mentioned it to Crabtree, and the more qualified and experienced Crabtree stated that they would be all right. Although Funk testified that the lines were possibly cut, he did not testify to what degree they were cut. Because the record does not indicate to what degree the lines were cut, or if they were cut, that can have little significance in forming a conscious disregard with a great probability or near certainty of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">{\u00b6 42} Were I to assume that the brake line to the trailer was in fact somehow severely cut, Funk\u2019s testimony establishes that he expressed his safety concerns, and that he was told by Crabtree that the lines would be all right. Funk testified that before the accident occurred, he knew that Crabtree had experience driving trucks and hauling heavy equipment, and that he understood that Crabtree held a commercial drivers\u2019 license \u201cCDL\u201d license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I am reluctant to join the majority in holding that when a person inquires about a safety issue and receives assurances from one believed to be more qualified and experienced, such action indicates consciousness of the near certainty (or otherwise stated \u201cgreat probability\u201d) that substantial harm will be caused by the tortious behavior of operating the equipment in question. The failure to perceive the danger of a situation is vastly different than a conscious, more deliberate, disregard of substantial harm. Focusing on facts that are relative to causation is not material to the \u201cconsciousness\u201d of any disregard for the great probability of substantial harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Even if I were to accept the majority\u2019s analysis that Funk should not have driven a truck of that size without the proper licensure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the trailer\u2019s brakes were not operating, I would characterize Funk\u2019s actions as far below the malicious standard required for punitive damages. At best, it appears that Funk considered that his actions could result in a mishap, evidenced by his reluctance to drive. It is clear that Funk did not consider the possibility of harm so probable that it prevented him from eventually agreeing to relieve Crabtree in driving. However, a person \u201cwho only has knowledge of the mere possibility that his or her actions may result in substantial harm, is not behaving maliciously.\u201d <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Said </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 690, 698, 590 N.E.2d 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">{\u00b6 44} Nowhere in Funk\u2019s testimony did he state that he was aware of the weight of the truck or trailer, and I would note that Funk\u2019s testimony merely establishes possibilities that either the trailer did not have independent brakes (because the truck itself was not designed to accommodate them), or that the brake lines or wires were cut to some unknown degree. Even reviewing these facts in a light most favorable to Touhey, I do not find either fact dispositive of Funk\u2019s alleged conscious disregard for the safety of others. While several factors might be combined to establish Funk\u2019s negligence, there is no conduct constituting misconduct greater than mere negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">{\u00b6 45} Funk testified that once he came around the corner, he saw traffic stopped in front of him. Funk stated that at the time he applied the brakes, he was only ten feet away from the stopped ears and therefore had to \u201cput the brakes on pretty abruptly.\u201d Given the force of the stop and Funk\u2019s position coming around the corner, it is day-to-day knowledge that would have us conclude that centrifugal force caused the forward movement of the trailer to swing out from behind the truck once Funk suddenly applied the brakes. There is no evidence in the record other than speculation as to what mechanically, if anything, caused the collision, and we must be cautious in extrapolating facts from vague, undeveloped testimony, particularly when considering damages designed to punish egregiously intolerable conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>{\u00b6 46} I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, and I agree with its conclusion that \u201cit is clear from the undisputed facts that Plaintiffs cannot prove by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant Rudy Funk possessed consciousness of the near certainty that substantial harm would be caused by his behavior.\u201d While Funk\u2019s actions may have constituted negligence, Ohio law is clear that misconduct greater than mere negligence is required in order to recover punitive damages. The issue of punitive damages as to Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf remains to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">{\u00b6 47} In forcing this issue to be decided by a jury when no genuine issue of material fact was previously presented to the trial court, the purpose of Civ.R. 56 is rendered meaningless. I would affirm the decision of the trial court granting partial summary judgment to Funk regarding the punitive-damages issue. I therefore am compelled to concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-12\">. According to Crabtree's deposition, he held a chauffeur's license, which he considered a commercial license. He also testified that he never applied for an additional CDL license because the department of motor vehicles told him he did not need a CDL to haul agricultural products such as the sod that Ed's Tree &amp; Turf installed for its customers. Regardless of whether Crabtree actually held a CDL, Funk\u2019s testimony is clear in that he believed Crabtree was experienced in driving large vehicles and held a CDL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\">. According to Ross\u2019s deposition, he believed that department of motor vehicles standards did not require his drivers to hold a CDL license because their trucks were used to haul agricultural products. He later testified that he believed that any employee he hired would be exempt from having a CDL, \"as long as he had a valid driver\u2019s license.\u201d Ross also testified that on several occasions when his employees were cited for not having a CDL license, he provided documentation to the court that his employees were exempt due to the agricultural nature of their business and as a result, the citations were nullified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">. Funk\u2019s vague, speculative, and inconsistent testimony appears to be nothing more than someone attempting to deflect responsibility with after-the-fact explanations not founded in established facts. This does little to unveil a \"conscious disregard\u201d prior to the collision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
