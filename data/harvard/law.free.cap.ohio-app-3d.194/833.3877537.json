Interstate raises six assignments of error, challenging its purported no-contest plea, the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt, and the trial court\u2019s imposition of a total fine of $11,948,000. Because we find that the record is devoid of Interstate\u2019s ever actually changing its not-guilty plea and entering a no-contest plea, we vacate the conviction and sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Interstate is a private, for-profit corporation based in Gilbert, South Carolina, that buys and sells real estate. Throughout 2008 and 2009, appellee, the city of Cleveland, cited Interstate for multiple building- and housing-code violations, including issuing condemnation notices, as a result of the deteriorating and hazardous conditions of the properties owned by Interstate. Despite being served with notice of the code violations, Interstate failed to correct the violations. The city subsequently filed 18 cases\u2014three minor-misdemeanor tickets and 15 multiple-count complaints for failure to correct the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">{\u00b6 3} According to the record, Interstate failed to appear in court after being properly cited and served with summons of the complaints. The trial court ultimately held a contempt hearing on Interstate\u2019s repeated failure to appear and entered a finding of contempt, resulting in per diem fines totaling $450,000. On November 16, 2009, Interstate subsequently appeared, through its counsel, and entered not-guilty pleas on all the cases. Following the not-guilty pleas, the court set the matter for a court-supervised pretrial with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">{\u00b6 4} Through pretrial negotiations, the city recommended that Interstate pay $500 for each of the three minor-misdemeanor eases, and in exchange for a plea of no contest to the other cases, the city would dismiss all duplicate cases and recommend a total of $150,000 in fines but agree to a 90 percent suspension of the fines after Interstate remedied the violations and fully reimbursed the city for the costs it incurred in demohshing the condemned properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">{\u00b6 5} The court held a change-of-plea hearing on March 18, 2010. At this hearing, the court allowed Interstate\u2019s manager, George Kastanes, to appear in court via video conferencing. Interstate also provided the court with an affidavit from Kastanes, authorizing its attorney, Edward Hayman, to withdraw any previous plea of not guilty and to enter a plea on Interstate\u2019s behalf. At the hearing, the court addressed Kastanes first, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cWe have a case here in Cleveland and the authorization is fine, but if there is a change from not guilty to no contest, we have to do what we call \u2018Wanzo\u2019 because it\u2019s named after Mary Wanzo, the defendant. And Mr. Hayman, of course, is familiar because he\u2019s a long time practitioner here in court, but the only thing missing is that you understand that the corporation, not you personally, but the corporation in the criminal cases that are before us would be entering a plea of no contest, which is not an admission of guilt, but an admission that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>violations did exist; and the corporation would be giving up its right to a jury trial; right against self-incrimination; right for compulsory process and right to have the City prove their ease beyond a reasonable doubt; and that Mr. Hayman then will work on the case as outlined in your authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cWe\u2019ll hear from the prosecutor; hear her recommendation, and it\u2019s my intention today not to issue a sentence, but to do a presentence report and work on this with Mr. Hayman and the prosecution in trying to come up with a holistic solution to the issues that are raised. So I just need to\u2014in that the corporation, both corporations Paramount Land Holdings and Interstate know their rights and knowingly and willingly give them up, and have authorized Mr. Hayman to act in their behalf today?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">{\u00b6 8} After Kastanes answered in the affirmative, the court then proceeded to hear from the prosecutor as to the city\u2019s stated recommendation. The city gave a recommendation consistent with what the parties had discussed in pretrial negotiations. The city also moved to nolle those cases that were duplicates, which the trial court granted and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">{\u00b6 9} On March 23, 2010, a judgment entry was journalized, reflecting that on March 18, 2010, Interstate appeared through its counsel and withdrew its plea of not guilty and entered a plea of no contest and that the court then entered a finding of guilt. This judgment entry was not signed by the trial judge. Consequently, on June 18, 2010, the trial court entered another judgment entry and order, journalizing its finding of guilt against Interstate. On this same day, the trial court also issued a detailed sentencing order, imposing the maximum penalty allowed under law for each of the offenses in the ten cases, for a total of $11,948,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">{\u00b6 10} Interstate now appeals, raising six assignments of error, which are set forth in the attached appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">No Contest Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">{\u00b6 11} In its first assignment of error, Interstate argues that the trial court failed to ever properly take a no-contest plea, and therefore its conviction and sentence cannot stand. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">{\u00b6 12} Initially, we note that a trial court\u2019s obligations under Crim.R. 11 in accepting a plea depend upon the level of offense to which the defendant is pleading. <em>State v. Watkins, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 12, 2003-Ohio-2419, 788 N.E.2d 635, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">{\u00b6 13} For a petty offense, such as the offenses at issue in this case and defined in Crim.R. 2(D) as \u201ca misdemeanor other than [a] serious offense,\u201d the court is instructed that it \u201cmay refuse to accept a plea of guilty or no contest, and shall not accept such pleas without first informing the defendant of the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>the plea of guilty, no contest, and not guilty.\u201d Crim.R. 11(E). To satisfy the requirement of informing a defendant of the effect of a plea, a trial court must inform the defendant of the appropriate language under Crim.R. 11(B). <em>State v. Jones, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 211, 2007-Ohio-6093, 877 N.E.2d 677. Thus, \u201cfor a no contest plea, a defendant must be informed that the plea of no contest is not an admission of guilt but is an \u00e1dmission of the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint, and that the plea or admission shall not be used against the defendant in any subsequent civil or criminal proceeding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, citing Traf.R. 10(B)(2) and Crim.R. 11(B)(2). Conversely, the trial court need not inform the defendant of the maximum sentence and the right to a jury trial to satisfy this requirement. Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">{\u00b6 14} Our review of the record reveals that Interstate never actually entered a plea of no contest at the change-of-plea hearing on March 18, 2010. Indeed, the city concedes that neither Kastanes nor Interstate\u2019s attorney ever actually entered a no-contest plea. We find that this omission is fatal to any subsequent finding of guilt, which is also conspicuously missing from the transcript of the proceedings held on March 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, we find that the applicable plea requirements set forth in Crim.R. 11(E) necessitate that the defendant first communicate a plea of no contest to the court. The failure first to obtain such a plea precludes a trial court from subsequently making a guilty finding and entering a conviction. See <em>Cleveland v. McCoy, </em>8th Dist. No. 90763, 2009-Ohio-2247, 2009 WL 1349736.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, based on the record before us, we sustain the first assignment of error, vacate the convictions and sentence, and remand for further proceedings. Our disposition of the first assignment of error renders the remaining five moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b875-7\">Cooney and Gallagher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in failing to have the defendant-appellant enter a valid plea, in violation of the United States and Ohio constitutions and Ohio Criminal Rule 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cDefendant-appellant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive its constitutional rights with full knowledge of the maximum penalty included as required by Ohio Criminal Rule 11(C)(2)(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe trial court failed to make a finding of guilt based on an explanation of the circumstances of the offense in violation of Ohio Revised Code Section 2937.07.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Assignment of Error IV</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court failed to advise the defendant-appellant that it had a right to confront witnesses against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Assignment of Error V</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe total f\u00edne of $10,948,000.00 is excessive, unrelated, and grossly disproportionate to the offenses to which defendant-appellant pled no contest, and constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the defendant-appellant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 9 Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Assignment of Error VI</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe defendant-appellant\u2019s numerous/multiple convictions for building and housing code violations involved allied offenses of similar import, thus precluding the trial court\u2019s imposition of multiple sentences.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-11\">. We note that prior to entering a guilty finding, the trial court never discussed any of the circumstances regarding the stated violations in the seven cases involving first-degree misdemeanors, as required under R.C. 2937.07.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
