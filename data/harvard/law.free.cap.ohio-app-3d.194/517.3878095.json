Such additions are referred to as \u201cover-fills\u201d and are also not absorbed into the rank\u2019s regular complement until the expiration of the eligibility list.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Eligibility List 04-19 for Police Lieutenant</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 4} This case concerns the vacancies that existed in the rank of lieutenant between November 2004 and August 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 5} In 2004, the city approved eligibility list 04-19, which became effective June 30, 2004, and which was ultimately set to expire on August 1, 2006. York was ranked 12th on list 04-19, and Richardson was 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 6} By November 2004, three vacancies had occurred in the rank of lieutenant and those vacancies had been filled by three white males from the top of the eligibility list. In March 2005, a fourth vacancy was filled by David Fink, a white male who was next on the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 7} The promotion of a fourth consecutive white male triggered the provisions of the consent decree requiring the promotion of a minority. Martin Mack, an African-American man who was fifth on the eligibility list, was promoted as a double-fill on March 20, 2005. The Mack promotion raised the number of lieutenants to 44: 43 in the regular complement and one double-fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 8} On July 21, 2005, Lieutenant Howard Rahtz was promoted to the rank of captain, creating a vacancy in the lieutenant rank. Two days later, Lieutenant Sandra Sizemore retired, creating a second vacancy in the lieutenant rank.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">{\u00b6 9} Then, on August 19, 2005, Michael Fern was promoted to lieutenant after he had settled his lawsuit with the city.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Fern ranked below York and Richardson on list 04-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 10} On November 23, 2005, three white female officers\u2014Deborah Bauer, Lisa Davis, and Christine Briede\u2014were promoted to lieutenant as a result of a settlement in another lawsuit. Bauer, Davis, and Briede were sixth through eighth, respectively, on list 04-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 11} Also on November 23, 2005, sergeants Emmett Gladden and Brett Isaac were promoted to lieutenant as court-ordered over-fills. Gladden and Isaac were 10th and 15th on the eligibility list, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 12} Two more retirements occurred in 2006. When Lieutenant Joe Hall retired on April 18, 2006, Timothy Brown was promoted from the ninth position on the eligibility fist. Lieutenant Robert Ruebusch then announced that he would retire effective July 29, 2006. Shortly after list 04-19 had expired, the city promoted John Rees, who was number ten on the eligibility list. After the Rees promotion, numbers one through 11 on the list had been promoted to lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The Claims of York and Richardson</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, upon the expiration of the list, York and Richardson were next in line to be promoted. The only question was whether any vacancies had remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 14} The answer to that question hinged on the proper characterization of the Mack and Fern promotions. At some point after Mack\u2019s promotion to lieutenant, the city determined that Fink had been eligible for promotion to lieutenant from an earlier list. As a result of that change, the city purported to retroactively characterize Mack\u2019s promotion to lieutenant as an \u201cin-line\u201d promotion instead of a double-fill, because Mack had been next in line on the eligibility list. And despite Fern\u2019s having been promoted following the settlement of his lawsuit, the city apparently maintained that he occupied a regular slot in the complement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 15} In any event, the city did not make any further promotions after those of Brown and Rees. York and Richardson filed a mandamus action, asserting that two vacancies remained in the rank of lieutenant when eligibility list 04-19 expired. They filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The Trial Court\u2019s Treatment of the Mack and Fern Promotions</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 16} In its first assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of York and Richardson. The city argues that there were no vacancies in existence at the time list 04-19 expired, and therefore, it had no duty to promote York and Richardson to the rank of lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Under Civ.R. 56(C), a motion for summary judgment may be granted only when no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to that party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court reviews a ruling on summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 18} To establish entitlement to a writ of mandamus, the relator must show that he has a clear legal right to the requested relief, that the respondent has a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and that the relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 124.44, governing promotions in a municipal police department, provides that \u201c[i]f there is [an eligibility] list, the commission shall, when there is a vacancy, immediately certify the name of the person on the list having the highest rating, and the appointing authority shall appoint that person within thirty days from the date of the certification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 20} The essence of the city\u2019s argument is that the two vacancies claimed by York and Richardson had already been filled by Mack and Fern.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 21} We first address the argument with respect to Mack. The city contends that because it had retroactively promoted Fink from an earlier eligibility list, the Mack promotion was properly characterized as an \u201cin-line\u201d promotion rather than a double-fill. Accordingly, the city argues, Mack had filled one of the vacancies in the regular complement.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 22} We find no merit in this argument. Although the city determined that Fink had been entitled to a promotion from an earlier date, the fact remained that he was the fourth consecutive white male to enter the rank of lieutenant and that Mack had been immediately promoted as a double-fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b623} The city has offered no authority for the proposition that it could retroactively alter the character of Mack\u2019s promotion to consider it an \u201cin-line\u201d promotion when at the time he was promoted in March 2005, there were no vacancies in the rank. As the trial court properly noted, the re-characterization of Mack\u2019s promotion would have required the city to retroactively demote him to the rank of sergeant and then to promote him to lieutenant when the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>vacancy arose in July 2005. Otherwise, there would have been an unauthorized expansion of the lieutenant complement. Because Mack\u2019s service records did not reflect such a demotion, he remained in a double-fill position and did not occupy either of the positions sought by York and Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 24} The city\u2019s argument with respect to Fern also lacks merit. The city apparently maintains, without explanation, that the Fern promotion filled one of the regular vacancies in the lieutenant complement. But this contention is untenable in light of the deposition testimony of Lieutenant Alan March of the police personnel section. March testified that Fern had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant from a previous eligibility list as the result of a settlement of his lawsuit. And it was undisputed that Fern was ranked below York and Richardson on list 04-19, the only list open at the time the promotion was made. Accordingly, Fern was in the position of an over-fill and did not fill either of the vacancies in the regular complement claimed by York and Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 25} In sum, the trial court correctly held that there remained two vacancies in the rank of lieutenant and that the right to those vacancies had vested in York and Richardson. Therefore, we overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 26} In its second assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in granting the writ of mandamus because the writ had issued after the expiration of the eligibility list. The city contends that the expiration of the list had rendered the requested relief moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 27} This argument is not well taken. Under R.C. 124.44, the right to a promotion vests in the highest ranked person from the eligibility list when a vacancy occurs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, York and Richardson established that vacancies had occurred while list 04-19 remained in effect and that they had been next in line for promotion when those vacancies had arisen. Thus, the subsequent expiration of the eligibility list did not render their claims moot, and we overrule the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 28} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-13\">Dinkelacker, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-15\">.
