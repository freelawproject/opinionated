Section XII(s)(l) of Kilgore\u2019s lease obligates her to \u201crefrain from engaging in * * * any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right of peaceful enjoyment of DMHA\u2019s public housing premises by other residents or employees of DMHA.\u201d The following notice is attached to that prohibition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>{\u00b63} \u201cNOTICE: CRIMINAL ACTIVITY and or crimes of violence are serious violations of the terms of this lease when a Tenant, member of his household, his <em>guest or any other person under Tenant\u2019s control </em>engages in any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of DMHA\u2019s premises by other tenants or employees of DMHA, or engages in <em>any drug-related criminal activity </em>or crime of violence <em>on or off DMHA\u2019s premises.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">{\u00b6 4} Section XVII of the lease governs its termination. Paragraph (a) of that section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThis lease may be terminated only for serious or repeated violations of material terms of the Lease, such as failure to make payments due under the Lease <em>or to fulfill Tenant obligations set forth in Section XII </em>above, failure to abide by any adopted policies, failure to comply with community service requirements, making false or fraudulent statements in regards to eligibility or income, and for other good cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">{\u00b6 6} Paragraph (c) of Section XVII of the lease governs procedures for termination of the tenancy. It provides for a notice of termination and a grievance hearing in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">{\u00b6 7} On March 11, 2010, DMHA commenced an action in forcible entry and detainer against Kilgore in Dayton Municipal Court. DMHA sought restitution of the premises and monetary award for damage to the premises for which Kilgore allegedly was responsible. Concerning its claim for restitution of the premises, DMHA\u2019s complaint alleged that on February 18, 2010, Dayton Police officers who were dispatched to Kilgore\u2019s unit on reports of drug activity \u201clocated 1.2 grams of marijuana in a soap box on top of the microwave oven and a digital scale with cocaine residue on it in a trash can.\u201d DMHA alleged that as a result, Kilgore violated Section XII(s)(2) of the lease, and that Kilgore had been served with a notice of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">{\u00b6 8} A copy of the notice of termination attached to DMHA\u2019s complaint states that Kilgore is not entitled to a grievance hearing because the \u201cviolations involve criminal and/or activity that threatens the health and safety of the premises,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he judicial eviction procedure used by DMHA shall be under the provisions of Ohio Revised Code 1923.04 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">{\u00b6 9} DMHA\u2019s claim for restitution of the premises was referred to a magistrate. A hearing was conducted in which Kilgore testified that she was unaware of the drug activities alleged in DMHA\u2019s complaint and that the conditions and circumstances alleged involved the conduct of two persons she had allowed into her apartment to clean while she went to a doctor\u2019s appointment. It was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>established that Kilgore had cooperated in allowing the search of her apartment performed by police. Kilgore was not charged with a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">{\u00b6 10} The magistrate filed a written decision. The magistrate credited Kilgore\u2019s testimony that she had no knowledge of the criminal activities alleged in DMHA\u2019s complaint and on that basis, found that she had not breached her lease agreement. The decision rendered judgment for Kilgore on DMHA\u2019s claim for restitution of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">{\u00b6 11} DMHA filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled the objections and adopted the decision as the court\u2019s order. The court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Court does not find Plaintiffs Objections well taken. While a public housing authority can evict a tenant for drug-related crimes committed by her guests, even if the tenant has no knowledge of them, eviction should be a last resort. Following <em>Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. v. Rucker </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued two letters advising public housing authority directors that they should consider several factors before evicting a tenant: the seriousness of the violation, the effect of eviction on household members unconnected with the violation, and the willingness of the head of household to remove those who committed the criminal activity from the lease. (Defendant\u2019s Appendix B and C). Following <em>Rucker, </em>trial courts still have the discretion to rule in favor of an innocent tenant on an eviction action. <em>CMHA v. Harris </em>(2006), 139 Ohio Misc.2d 96 [861 N.E.2d 179], paragraph 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cHere, the Magistrate was presented with evidence of an innocent tenant, who did not know about and was not present during the drug-related activity or connected with it; the parties responsible for the drug activity were temporary guests not on the tenant\u2019s lease and the tenant was willing to never have those guests in her apartment again; and Defendant would suffer if she lost her public housing. The Magistrate properly denied restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">{\u00b6 14} DMHA filed a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred when it held that the defendant did not breach her lease when she had no knowledge of the criminal activity caused by the defendant\u2019s guests even when it was proven that her guests committed criminal drug activity in the defendant\u2019s unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">{\u00b6 16} The condition in Section XII(s)(l) of Kilgore\u2019s lease prohibiting a tenant or any other person under the tenant\u2019s control from engaging \u201cin any drug-related criminal activity * * * on * * * DMHA\u2019s premises\u201d is a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>imposed by Section 1437d(Z )(6), Title 42, U.S.Code. It provides that each \u201cpublic housing agency shall utilize leases * * * providing] that * * * any drug related criminal activities on [federally assisted low income housing] premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant * * * or any guest or other person under the tenant\u2019s control, shall be cause of termination of the tenancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Rucker, </em>535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258, the Supreme Court held that an innocent-tenant defense cannot prevail against a claim for restitution of the premises following a public housing agency\u2019s termination of a tenant\u2019s lease for the causes a claim required by Section 1437d(Z)(6), Title 42, U.S.Code involves. The Supreme Court pointed out' that HUD regulations implementing the law provide that in deciding to terminate the tenancy, the public-housing agency has discretion to \u201cconsider all of the circumstances of the case,\u201d including those drug-related situations in which \u201c[t]he tenant did not know, could not foresee, or could not control behavior by other occupants of the unit.\u201d Id. at 129. Nevertheless, \u201cCongress\u2019 decision not to impose any qualification in the statute, combined with its use of the term \u2018any\u2019 to modify \u2018drug-related criminal activity,\u2019 precludes any knowledge requirement * * * Thus, <em>any </em>drug-related activity engaged in by the specified persons is grounds for termination, not just drug-related activity that the tenant knew, or should have known, about.\u201d Id. at 130-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>Rucker </em>also pointed out that \u201cby \u2018control,\u2019 the statute means control in the sense that the tenant has permitted access to the premises.\u201d Id. at 131. \u201cThus, the plain language of \u00a7 1437d(Z)(6) requires leases that grant public housing authorities the discretion to terminate tenancy without regard to the tenant\u2019s knowledge of the drug-related criminal activity.\u201d Id. By conferring discretion to terminate on the public housing authority, the statute \u201centrusts that decision to the local public housing authorities, who are in the best position to take account of, among other things, the degree to which the housing project suffers from \u2018rampant drug-related or violent crime,\u2019 \u2018the seriousness of the offending action,\u2019 and \u2018the extent to which the leaseholder has * * * taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the offending action.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 134, which reflect the purposes of the legislation. Because tenants who cannot control drug-related activity by those whom they invite into their premises \u201cthreaten [the] health or safety of other residents * * * it was reasonable for Congress to permit no-fault evictions in order to \u2018provide public other federally assisted low-income housing that is decent, safe, and free from illegal drugs.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, <em>Rucker </em>held that the public housing agency\u2019s decision to terminate a tenancy and seek eviction of the tenant is not subject to due-process requirements, because the agency is not acting as a sovereign, attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>criminally punish or civilly regulate tenants as members of the general populace. The agency \u201cis instead acting as a landlord of property that it owns, invoking a clause in a lease to which (tenants) have agreed and which Congress has expressly required.\u201d Id., 535 U.S. at 135, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258. Any deprivations of the tenant\u2019s rights in his tenancy will occur in state-court eviction proceedings, and \u201c[a]ny individual factual disputes about whether the lease provision was actually violated can, of course, be resolved in these proceedings.\u201d Id. at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 1923.02(A)(9) authorizes actions in forcible entry and detainer \u201c[a]gainst tenants who have breached an obligation imposed upon them by a written rental agreement.\u201d R.C. 1923.09(A) provides that if after a hearing, \u201cthe judge concludes that the complaint is not true, the judge shall enter judgment against the plaintiff for costs. If the judge finds the complaint to be true, the judge shall render a general judgment against the defendant, in favor of the plaintiff, for restitution of the premises and costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">{\u00b6 21} The written rental agreement between DMHA and Kilgore provides that Kilgore must refrain from engaging in \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d which occurs when the tenant or a \u201cperson under the tenant\u2019s control * * * engages in any drug-related criminal activity * * *.\u201d The lease further authorizes DMHA to terminate Kilgore\u2019s tenancy for \u201cserious violations,\u201d which include failure to fulfill the tenant\u2019s obligation to refrain from engaging in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">{\u00b6 22} The action DMHA brought was not to terminate Kilgore\u2019s tenancy. By exercising its right in the lease to terminate Kilgore\u2019s tenancy, DMHA extinguished that tenancy. DMHA\u2019s action was brought to recover possession of the premises. <em>Rucker </em>held that the innocent-tenant defense is unavailable to a tenant in an eviction action, as a matter of law. The trial court nevertheless considered Kilgore\u2019s innocence in granting her equitable relief from DMHA\u2019s right of possession, relying on <em>Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Harris, </em>139 Ohio Misc.2d 96, 2006-Ohio-6918, 861 N.E.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Harris, </em>a public-housing agency terminated the lease of a tenant following the arrest of a guest in her apartment on a federal warrant. A search incident to the arrest revealed a rock of crack cocaine in the guest\u2019s pocket. The tenant was unaware that her guest had drugs in his pocket. In an action for forcible entry and detainer brought by the agency, the municipal court held that while the agency has discretion to terminate the lease, per <em>Rucker, </em>courts nevertheless may weigh all equitable considerations in determining whether a forfeiture is to be declared. The court held that because the tenant was innocent and had cooperated with police, \u201c[t]o permit eviction of Harris * * * would be to hold that public-housing tenants can have no guests or, equally implausible, to hold that public-housing tenants must conduct a thorough search of each guest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>every time guests enter (the agency\u2019s) property. This court is not prepared to make such a holding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13. The court entered judgment for the tenant on a finding that \u201cequity prohibits her eviction from the premises.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">{\u00b6 24} Equity functions to supplement the law where it is insufficient. American Jurisprudence 2d, Equity, Section 1. We have held that it is the responsibility of the court to weigh the equitable considerations before imposing a forfeiture. <em>Gorsuch Homes, Inc. v. Wooten </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 426, 597 N.E.2d 554. \u201cEven where a cause of forfeiture is specifically mentioned in the lease, equitable considerations enter into the determination of such forfeiture and may relieve the lessee technically subject to forfeiture.\u201d 41 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Equity, Section 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe maxim, \u2018equity regards substance rather than form,\u2019 under which relief is granted against penalties and forfeitures and affirmative relief in aid of them is denied, does not apply to positive statutes, but only to conventional acts of parties. With respect to an act of the legislature, the maxim \u2018equity follows the law1 governs the attitude of the court.\u201d Id. at Section 36. Positive statutes govern courts in the exercise of their equity jurisdiction, just as in matters of law, and courts are not at liberty to apply an equitable interpretation of such statutes in order to avoid a seemingly undesirable result. Id. at Section 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">{\u00b6 26} Section 1437d(i )(6), Title 42, U.S.Code, imposes an obligation on federally funded public-housing agencies to include in their leases a right of termination if the tenant engages in any drug-related criminal activities. In neither the present case nor in <em>Harris </em>did the trial court impose an equitable bar to that statutory requirement. Rather, the court applied equitable considerations to prohibit the agency from exercising its right of termination when the tenant is actually innocent of the drug-related criminal activity concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">{\u00b6 27} An agency\u2019s exercise of its right of termination in a circumstance of this kind is not the mere conventional act of a landlord, such as termination for unpaid rent or damage to the property. See <em>Gorsuch Homes, Inc., </em>73 Ohio App.3d 426, 597 N.E.2d 554. Rather, the agency is acting on the authority Congress entrusted to it because, per <em>Rucker, </em>the agency is in \u201cthe best position to take account of, among other things, the degree to which the housing project suffers from \u2018rampant drug-related or violent crime,\u2019 \u2018the seriousness of the offending action,\u2019 and \u2018the extent to which the leaseholder has * * * taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the offending action.\u2019 \u201d 535 U.S. at 134, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258. By relying on the innocent-tenant defense, except as the agency has applied it, courts run the risk of preventing operation of the enforcement mechanism for which the statute provides, undermining the policy. That outcome would be inconsistent with the obligation of equity to follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In <em>Harris, </em>the tenant was not only actually innocent of the drug-related activity that occurred, there was also no way she reasonably could have known that her guest had cocaine in his pocket. Therefore, the tenant took all reasonable steps to mitigate the offending action, as the trial court found. Neither had the tenant done anything that furthered her guest\u2019s criminal purposes, which were not particular to the apartment unit where they occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 29} In the present case, Kilgore was likewise actually innocent of the drug-related criminal activity of her two guests, and they apparently concealed from her their plans to engage in it. However, by making her apartment open and available to them as she did, Kilgore furthered her guests\u2019 criminal purposes to use that location to engage in drug-related activity. The federal statute makes no exception for inadvertence in relation to its purpose of protecting residents of federally financed housing from drug-related criminal activity. The result may appear draconian, but <em>Rucker </em>observed that \u201c[sjtrict liability maximizes deterrence and eases enforcement difficulties.\u201d 535 U.S. at 134, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted judgment for Kilgore in the action for forcible entry and detainer that DMHA commenced. The assignment of error is sustained. The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on DMHA\u2019s claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b812-8\">Hall, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b812-9\">Fain, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b812-10\">Fain, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">{\u00b6 31} Although the issue is close, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">{\u00b6 32} To begin with, I conclude that Section 1437d, Title 42, U.S.Code, is not intended to displace state law governing the relations between landlords and tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">{\u00b6 33} The United States Supreme Court held as follows in <em>Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. v. Rucker </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 152 L.Ed.2d 258:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cSection 1437d(Z)(6) requires lease terms that give local public housing authorities the discretion to terminate the lease of a tenant when a member of the household or a guest engages in drug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew, or should have known, of the drug-related activity.\u201d Id. at 136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Significantly, in rejecting due-process concerns that had troubled the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe en banc Court of Appeals held that HUD\u2019s interpretation \u2018raise[s] serious questions under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 because it permits \u2018tenants to be deprived of their property interest without any relationship to individual wrongdoing.\u2019 [Citations omitted.] But both of these cases deal with the acts of government as sovereign. * * * The situation in the present cases is entirely different. The government is not attempting to criminally punish or civilly regulate respondents as members of the general populace. <em>It is instead acting as a landlord of property that it owns, invoking a clause in a lease to which respondents have agreed and which Congress has expressly required.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 535 U.S. at 135, 122 S.Ct. at 1236, 152 L.Ed.2d 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">{\u00b6 37} Consistently with this statement that in administering public housing, the federal government is acting as landlord, not as a sovereign, the very next paragraph in the opinion in <em>Rucker </em>continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Court of Appeals sought to bolster its discussion of constitutional doubt by pointing to the fact that respondents have a property interest in their leasehold interest, citing <em>Greene v. Lindsey, </em>456 U.S. 444, 102 S.Ct. 1874, 72 L.Ed.2d 249 (1982). This is undoubtedly true, and <em>Greene </em>held that an effort to deprive a tenant of such a right without proper notice violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, in the present cases, such deprivation will occur in the state court where [the public-housing authority] brought the unlawful detainer action against respondents. There is no indication that notice has not been given by [the public-housing authority] in the past, or that it will not be given in the future. Any individual factual disputes about whether the lease provision was actually violated can, of course, be resolved in these proceedings. [Footnote omitted].\u201d Id., 535 U.S. at 135-136, 122 S.Ct. at 1236, 152 L.Ed.2d 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">{\u00b6 39} From the two paragraphs in <em>Rucker </em>quoted above, I conclude that Section 1437d, Title 42, U.S.Code, the statute upon which DMHA relies, is intended to govern the administration of public-housing leases by public-housing authorities, as landlords, not to displace state law governing the legal relations between landlords and tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">{\u00b6 40} Next, I conclude that the trial court properly weighed the equities and found that they weighed against the equitable remedy of eviction in this case, which work a forfeiture of Kilgore\u2019s housing subsidy. Equity abhors a forfeiture. <em>Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Smith </em>(1886), 44 Ohio St. 156, 167, 5 N.E. 417; <em>Stephenson v. Haines </em>(1866), 16 Ohio St. 478, 487. When a tenant raises equitable defenses, a court must balance the equities to determine whether a forfeiture of the lease is warranted. <em>S. Hotel Co. v. Miscott, Inc. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>App.2d 217, 221, 73 O.O.2d 235, 337 N.E.2d 660. This is especially so where, as in the case before us, the breach of the lease has been cured. Id. See also <em>Gorsuch Homes, Inc. v. Wooten </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 426, 597 N.E.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">{\u00b6 41} DMHA argues that the trial court did not weigh the equities, but instead decided, inconsistently with <em>HUD v. Rucker, </em>that a tenant\u2019s lack of knowledge of her guests\u2019 drug-related activities is an absolute defense to eviction for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">{\u00b6 42} The magistrate\u2019s decision would provide support for DMHA\u2019s argument in this regard. But the trial court, in overruling DMHA\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, took a different tack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c[DMHA] claims that the Magistrate should have granted restitution because it was established that [Kilgore] was in violation of her DMHA lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cIn Response, [Kilgore] claims that restitution should not have been granted because she was not in her apartment at the time of the drug-related incident, she had no knowledge of any drug activity, and she did not act maliciously or willfully. [Kilgore] argues that the <em>Rucker </em>Court held that 42 USC \u00a7 1437d vests the public housing authority with the discretion not to terminate the tenancy of an innocent tenant and following <em>Rucker, </em>the Secretary of HUD urged public housing authorities to be guided by compassion and common sense in responding to illegal drugs and to only use eviction as a last option. (Defendant\u2019s Appendix B and C). [Kilgore] maintains that the Dayton Municipal Court has held that a DMHA tenant, with no previous knowledge of drug-related activity of guests, was not in breach of the tenant\u2019s DMHA lease. <em>DMHA v. Baldwin </em>(Dec. 15, 2005), D.M.C. No. 05CYG1338. (The Court held that Baldwin did not act maliciously or willfully, in that she had no knowledge of the criminal activity, and she had a substantial interest in her public housing subsidy and would suffer extreme hardship if evicted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe Court has reviewed the record, the Transcript and evidence, and the law and agrees with the Magistrate that [DMHA] should not be granted restitution. The testimony from the Transcript indicated that [Kilgore] had the guests in her apartment from the night before when they cleaned for her, she was going to take them home after her appointment because she was running late, she was at her appointment and was not in her apartment when the police discovered the guests and the drug-related activity, she did not know her guests were involved with drugs, and the guests would never be welcome back because of the drugs and items they carried into her apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe Court does not find [DMHA]\u2019s Objections well taken. While a public housing authority can evict a tenant for drug-related crimes committed by her guests, even if the tenant has no knowledge of them, eviction should be a last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>resort. Following <em>Rucker, </em>the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued two letters advising public housing authority directors that they should consider several factors before evicting a tenant: the seriousness of the violation, the effect of eviction on household members unconnected with the violation, and the willingness <em>of </em>the head of household to remove those who committed the criminal activity from the lease. (Defendant\u2019s Appendix B and C.) Following <em>Rucker, </em>trial courts still have the discretion to rule in favor of an innocent tenant on an eviction action. <em>CMHA v. Harris </em>(2006), 139 Ohio Misc.2d 96 [861 N.E.2d 179], paragraph 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cHere, the Magistrate was presented with evidence of an innocent tenant, who did not know about and was not present during the drug-related activity or connected with it; the parties responsible for the drug activity were temporary guests not on the tenant\u2019s lease and the tenant was willing to never have those guests in her apartment again; and [Kilgore] would suffer if she lost her public housing. The Magistrate properly denied restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">{\u00b6 48} Although the trial court never expressly declared in its decision that it was weighing the equities, reading its decision persuades me that this was exactly what it was doing. And I conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the equities weighed in Kilgore\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">{\u00b6 49} I would overrule DMHA\u2019s sole assignment of error, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
