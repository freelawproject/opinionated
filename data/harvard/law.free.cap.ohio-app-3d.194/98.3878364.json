Martindale, filed this appeal seeking reversal of a judgment by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Lind Stoneworks, Ltd. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 2} According to the complaint, appellee is an Ohio limited-liability company owned by James Lind. In 2007, Lind was approached by Martindale, owner of Top Surface, regarding fabrication of Zodiaq countertops. Top Surface had an agreement with Lowe\u2019s under which Lowe\u2019s took orders for the countertops, and Top Surface performed the installation. Lind and Top Surface ultimately entered into an oral agreement under which Lind fabricated the countertops for Top Surface. At trial, Lind testified that during the course of their discussions, \u201cI asked Randy, \u2018Am I billing Lowe\u2019s or am I billing you?\u2019 And he said, \u2018You\u2019re billing me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 3} At some point during this arrangement, Top Surface fell behind on payments made to Lind. Lind began to include on its invoices to Top Surface finance charges on any unpaid balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 4} Eventually, Lind filed suit on the unpaid balance. The complaint named both Top Surface and Martindale as defendants. The complaint did not identify whether Top Surface is a corporation or some other type of business entity, nor did the complaint identify the basis for any imposition of liability on Martindale in his individual capacity. The complaint alleged that the unpaid balance totaled $104,848.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">{\u00b6 5} On June 21, 2010, the trial court held a bench trial on appellee\u2019s claims. At trial, appellee agreed that the balance alleged in the complaint had been reduced to $98,593.02 as a result of payments received from appellants. Appellants admitted that approximately $85,000 was owed on the account, but argued that the balance alleged by appellee should be adjusted to reflect additional payments made and to remove the finance charges that had been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">{\u00b6 6} At trial, James Lind testified regarding the formation of the agreement. Exhibits were offered showing the amounts owed and payments received on the account. Those exhibits identify only Top Surface, and not Martindale individually, as the party on the account. Lind testified that he did not believe it was necessary to add Martindale\u2019s name on the account. Lind further testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>when he started to include finance charges on his invoices to Top Surface, Martindale objected but continued to perform under the agreement. On cross-examination, when asked whether Martindale had ever agreed to guarantee Top Surface\u2019s debt, Lind testified that Martindale had repeatedly stated, \u201cI will take care of it. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">{\u00b6 7} Martindale testified that in entering the agreement with Lind, he was acting on behalf of Top Surface, with all payments being made from Top Surface\u2019s checking account. Martindale further testified that he did not personally guarantee the corporation\u2019s debt and did not believe he was a party to the agreement with Lind. Upon questioning by the trial court, Martindale testified that Top Surface is a corporation, with proper documents having been filed with the Ohio Secretary of State. Martindale also testified that he was the president and sole owner of the corporation and that the corporation had no other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 8} A good portion of the trial involved the precise amount owed on the account. Martindale testified that he believed some payments had been made that were not properly credited to the account. The trial court asked the parties to submit memoranda setting forth their positions regarding the amount owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants submitted a memorandum arguing that the $98,593.02 amount offered at trial should be reduced by $10,362.32 reflecting finance charges added by appellee, and should additionally be reduced to reflect two checks appellants claimed had been sent to appellee, but not properly applied to the account, in the amounts of $3,948 and $1,550. Appellants also argued that they were entitled to a credit of $1,668.10, which reflected a service charge that had been charged to appellee by its supplier and passed on by appellee to appellants. Thus, appellants argued that the total owed was $81,064.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 10} Appellee filed a memorandum in response. Appellee agreed that appellants were entitled to an additional credit of $1,550. However, appellee argued that it was entitled to recover the $10,362.32 in finance charges and the $1,668.10 service charge. Appellee also argued that while it had received the check for $3,948, that check had not been cashed, at the request of Martindale\u2019s son. Thus, appellee argued that the total owed on the account was $97,043.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 11} The trial court issued a decision and entry finding in favor of appellee in the amount of $97,043.02. The court found that because the parties were merchants, the contract was governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. The court cited R.C. 1302.04(C)(2) and (3) to support the conclusion that the contract did not have to be in writing. The court further found that the $10,362.32 finance charge and the $1,668.10 service charge could be recovered pursuant to R.C. 1302.84 as incidental damages incurred by appellee as the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The court then turned to the issue of whether Martindale could be held individually liable on the contract and concluded that individual liability could be imposed. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">First, it must be pointed out that Defendant offered <em>no evidence </em>regarding the status of Top Surface, Inc. Apparently, Top Surface, Inc. operates out of Mr. Martindale\u2019s home at 9825 Meadowbrook Lane, Galena, OH 43021.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">It was only upon the Court\u2019s questioning that Mr. Martindale admitted that he is the only owner of Top Surface, Inc. and that there are no other shareholders or owners. He further conceded that there are no officers, no board of directors, no shareholders, etc. Just himself! No evidence was produced regarding the status of the corporation with the Secretary of State or the I.R.S., etc. The checks used by Defendant to pay Plaintiff are signed by Randy Martindale without any indication that he is signing under any other capacity than personally. Mr. James E. Lind, Plaintiff, testified that this contract was personally made by and guaranteed by Randy L. Martindale, individually.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court therefore entered judgment in the amount of $97,043.02 against both Top Surface and Martindale. Appellants then filed this appeal, asserting four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">The Trial Court erred by finding that the corporate veil of Top Surface, Inc. should be pierced as to its contract with Lind Stoneworks, Inc. [sic] and that its shareholder, Randy L. Martindale, was liable for the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">The Trial Court erred by finding that Lind Stoneworks, Ltd. and Randy L. Martindale entered into an enforceable contract for the sale of goods against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">The Trial Court erred by finding that Randy L. Martindale entered into an enforceable contract to personally guarantee the debt of Top Surface, Inc. to Lind Stoneworks, Ltd. against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">The Trial Court erred by finding that Lind Stoneworks, Ltd. was entitled to interest on the unpaid balance of the contract at a rate in excess of that allowable under O.R.C. \u00a7 5703.47 against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Appellants\u2019 first three assignments of error are interrelated and will therefore be addressed together. By those assignments, appellants argue that the trial court erred in imposing individual liability upon Martindale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 15} At the outset, it is unclear from the trial court\u2019s decision what the basis for imposition of individual liability was. In its decision, the trial court cited the lack of evidence regarding Top Surface\u2019s corporate status, e.g., documents filed with the Secretary of State or the Internal Revenue Service, and that Martindale signed checks for payment to appellee without indicating that he was signing them in his status as a corporate officer. These findings suggest that the trial court was concluding that Top Surface is not a valid corporation, which would lead to the conclusion that \u201cTop Surface, Inc.\u201d was simply a \u201cd.b.a.\u201d designation for Martindale personally, and he was therefore entering into the contract for himself individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 16} However, there is no basis in the record to support the conclusion that \u201cTop Surface, Inc.\u201d was not a valid corporation, but was instead simply a name under which Martindale was conducting business for himself individually. In its complaint, appellee named Top Surface as a separate defendant, and nothing in the complaint appears to assert Top Surface\u2019s status as anything other than a corporation. Appellee did not argue at any point during the trial that Top Surface was not a corporation and that Martindale therefore had to have entered into the contract on his own behalf; the issue of Top Surface\u2019s corporate status was raised only during the presentation of appellants\u2019 case and only upon questioning by the trial court. The only testimony on this point was that offered by Martindale, who testified that Top Surface was a corporation, having properly filed documents with the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 17} Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Martindale had signed checks for Top Surface without indicating that he was doing so in his corporate capacity. No checks were offered into evidence at trial showing that Martindale signed them in either his individual or corporate capacity. The only evidence offered at trial regarding checks was Martindale\u2019s testimony that all checks were drawn on Top Surface\u2019s checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 18} The only other possible basis for a conclusion that Martindale was entering the contract on an individual basis rather than on behalf of the corporation was his response to the question about whether Lind would be sending invoices directly to Lowe\u2019s. Martindale responded, \u201cYou are billing me.\u201d This response by itself does not support a conclusion that Martindale was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>acting on behalf of the corporation in directing Lind regarding where invoices should be sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">{\u00b6 19} Consequently, to the extent that the trial court\u2019s finding imposing individual liability on Martindale was based on a conclusion that Top Surface was not a valid corporation, there was no evidence in the record to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 20} Also in its decision, the trial court pointed to its conclusion that Martindale was operating Top Surface out of his home and that Top Surface had no other shareholders or owners and no corporate officers. This language suggests that the trial court\u2019s imposition of individual liability on Martindale may have been based on a conclusion that it was appropriate to pierce Top Surface\u2019s corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 21} In general, the shareholders, officers, and directors are not liable for a corporation\u2019s debts. <em>Capital-Plus, Inc. v. Potter </em>(June 5, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-1353, 2001 WL 604226. However, in some cases, the corporate veil can be pierced, and individual liability can be imposed. The elements that must be shown in order to pierce the corporate veil are (1) that the person against whom individual liability is sought to be imposed must have controlled the corporation so completely that the corporation had no separate mind, will, or existence of its own; (2) control over the corporation was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to impose individual liability; and (3) injury or unjust loss to the person seeking to impose individual liability resulted. <em>Belvedere Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. R.E. Roark Cos., Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 274, 617 N.E.2d 1075. The party seeking to impose individual liability has the burden of establishing the elements necessary to pierce the corporate veil. <em>Zimmerman v. Eagle Mtge. Corp. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 762, 675 N.E.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 22} The trial court did not address any of the individual elements necessary to pierce the corporate veil. The only evidence cited by the trial court that would support piercing the corporate veil went only to the first element: that Martin-dale\u2019s exercise of control over Top Surface was so complete that Top Surface had no mind, will, or existence of its own. The fact that Top Surface had no officers, shareholders or owners other than Martindale arguably establishes a level of control complete enough to satisfy the first element required for piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 23} We note that the other piece of evidence cited by the trial court, that Martindale was operating the corporation out of his home, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the corporation had no separate existence of its own. More importantly, there was no evidence in the record to support this conclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The only basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion appears to be that the complaint listed the same address for both Martindale and Top Surface. No evidence was offered to this effect at trial, and the only evidence admitted at trial regarding Top Surface\u2019s address, appellee\u2019s Exhibit A-l, shows Top Surface\u2019s address as 5064 Red Bank Road in Galena, an address different from that listed in the complaint for Top Surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 24} However, even assuming that the evidence at trial was sufficient to satisfy the first element for piercing the corporate veil, none of the evidence at trial provides any basis to conclude that Martindale exercised control over the corporation in a way that constituted fraud or an illegal act against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 25} Consequently, there was no basis for the trial court to impose individual liability on Martindale by piercing Top Surface\u2019s corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, in its decision, the trial court cited testimony by James Lind that the oral contract between Top Surface and appellee had been personally guaranteed by Martindale. The full extent of Lind\u2019s testimony on this point was that upon being approached about the account\u2019s being delinquent, Martindale purportedly responded by saying, \u201cI will take care of it. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 27} In order to create a guarantee on a debt, \u201cthe language must be clear that one is assuming responsibility.\u201d <em>Scherers Communications, Inc. v. Natl. Media Marketing, Inc. </em>(Apr. 14, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 93APE09-1254, 1994 WL 129912, *2. Martindale\u2019s statement that he would \u201ctake care\u201d of the delinquent account was too ambiguous by itself to constitute a clear manifestation of his intention to establish a personal guarantee of payment sufficient to impose personal liability on Martindale.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 28} Furthermore, R.C. 1335.05, Ohio\u2019s Statute of Frauds, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">No action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant, upon a special promise, to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person; * * * unless the agreement upon which such action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person thereunto by him or her lawfully authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, in general, any promise to guarantee the debt of another party must be in writing signed by the guarantor. Ohio courts have recognized some instances in which a personal guarantee is not required to be in writing. \u201c \u2018When the leading object of the promisor is not to answer for another\u2019s debt but to subserve some pecuniary or business purpose of his own involving a benefit to himself, his promise is not within the statute of frauds, although the original debtor may remain liable.\u2019 \u201d <em>America\u2019s Floor Source, L.L.C. v. Joshua Homes, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 493, 2010-Ohio-6296, 946 N.E.2d 799, \u00b620, quoting <em>Wilson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Floors Co. v. Sciota Park, Ltd. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 451, 8 O.O.3d 444, 377 N.E.2d 514, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">{\u00b6 30} Even if we were to assume that Martindale\u2019s oral statement to Lind that he would \u201ctake care\u201d of the delinquency did constitute a sufficiently certain promise to guarantee Top Surface\u2019s debt, the lack of a writing reflecting the agreement would render the promise unenforceable. No evidence was offered at trial to the effect that Martindale\u2019s agreement to guarantee Top Surface\u2019s debt would have subserved some pecuniary or business purpose of Martindale\u2019s own or would have benefited him individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 31} Consequently, there was no basis for the trial court to impose liability on Martindale personally. Therefore, appellants\u2019 first three assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 32} In their fourth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in awarding appellee interest in an amount greater than the statutory amount set forth in R.C. 5703.47 on the balance of the account. By this assignment, appellants take issue with the trial court\u2019s inclusion of the approximately $10,000 in finance charges that were added to the account balance during the course of the agreement. The trial court found that the finance charges were commercially reasonable and therefore included them in the damage award. {\u00b6 33} R.C. 1343.03(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">In eases other than those provided for in sections 1343.01 and 1343.02 of the Revised Code, when money becomes due and payable upon any bond, bill, note, or other instrument of writing, upon any book account, upon any settlement between parties, upon all verbal contracts entered into, and upon all judgments, decrees, and orders of any judicial tribunal for the payment of money arising out of tortious conduct or a contract or other transaction, the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate per annum determined pursuant to section 5703.47 of the Revised Code, unless a written contract provides a different rate of interest in relation to the money that becomes due and payable, in which case the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate provided in that contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 34} In this case, the agreement between Top Surface and appellee was an oral contract. Thus, in the absence of a written agreement including a different interest rate, appellee was entitled only to interest at the rate set forth in R.C. 5703.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 35} Appellee argues that appellants acquiesced to the finance charges added to the invoices by continuing to do business under the contract. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has concluded that inclusion of an interest rate higher than the statutory amount on an invoice does not satisfy the \u201cwritten contract\u201d requirement set forth in R.C. 1343.03(A), regardless of whether the recipient of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the invoice acceded to the interest rate set forth in the invoice. <em>Minster Farmers Coop. Exchange Co., Inc. v. Meyer, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 459, 2008-Ohio-1259, 884 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 36} Appellee was entitled to an award of prejudgment interest at the statutory rate set forth in R.C. 5703.47 because \u201c[p]rejudgment interest is seemingly automatic in cases of breach of contract.\u201d <em>O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 609, 2005-Ohio-5056, 839 N.E.2d 943, \u00b6 110. However, at trial, no evidence was offered regarding how appellee determined the interest rate it applied when it added the finance charges to the invoices submitted to appellants. In briefing, appellee states that the interest rate was 18 percent. Because the trial court did not apply the statutory interest rate set forth in R.C. 5703.47, we must remand this case to the trial court for application of the proper rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 37} As a final matter, $1,668.10 of the finance charges included in the trial court\u2019s award of damages were attributed by the court to finance charges imposed on appellee by one of its suppliers as a result of Top Surface\u2019s failure to pay all amounts owed on the account. Incidental damages incurred as a result of a breach of contract can include interest charges incurred on money borrowed by the seller to finance the subject matter of the contract. See <em>Baker v. Dupler </em>(Dec. 16, 1991), 4th Dist. No. 1481, 1991 WL 271349.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 38} No evidence was offered at trial that the $1,668.10 charge was incurred by appellee on money used by appellee to finance the subject matter of the contract between appellee and Top Surface. In the brief regarding the amount of damages submitted after the trial, appellee stated that the charge was imposed by one of appellee\u2019s suppliers, but did not connect the supplier to materials used in the contract between appellee and Top Surface. Furthermore, even if the connection had been made, appellee offered only the bare assertion made in its posttrial brief and did not supply any evidentiary materials to support the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 39} Consequently, there was no evidence in the record to support an award of the $1,668.10 charge as incidental damages, and the trial court erred in including that amount in its damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 41} Having sustained appellants\u2019 assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-12\">Brown and Dorrian, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">.
