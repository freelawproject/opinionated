Rummel, petitioner-appellant, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Branch, in which the court overruled his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Jae L. Rummel (n.k.a. Pickard), petitioner-appellee, has not filed an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">{\u00b6 2} The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved on January 15, 1998, by a dissolution decree. The parties had two children together: Angelica, born May 26, 1984; and Candice, born July 29, 1986. The dissolution decree provided that the father was to pay child support to the mother in the amount of $45 per week, per child, which was a downward deviation from the statutory guideline amount of $53.35 per week, per child.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">{\u00b6 3} On November 14, 1994, the trial court modified the father\u2019s child-support obligation to zero, based upon the father\u2019s disability and the children\u2019s receipt of social security benefits due to his disability. The order was effective August 26, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2003, the Franklin County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d) conducted a review of child support in this case. Because Angelica had been emancipated as of this date, CSEA calculated the father\u2019s child-support obligation for Candice only at the statutory guideline amount of $332.18 per month, effective March 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">{\u00b6 5} Upon the emancipation of Candice, on June 29, 2008, CSEA issued findings that recommended that child-support terminate effective July 29, 2004; calculated child-support arrearage to be $31,658.29, plus a processing charge arrearage of $801.48, effective May 27, 2008; and recommended that the arrearage be liquidated at a rate of $332.18 per month. Neither the father nor the mother objected, and the trial court adopted the recommendation of CSEA on August 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">{\u00b6 6} During this time, the father apparently also had in effect a child-support order issued in Muskingum County for $383.14 per month for the support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>another child, who was 16 years old as of April 23, 2010. The father had an arrearage in the Muskingum County case of approximately $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">{\u00b6 7} On September 11, 2009, the father filed a motion to modify child support and determine the correct arrearage and appropriate liquidation rate. The parties agreed to reduce the arrearage by $5,562, which represented the social security payments paid to the children due to the father\u2019s disability, thereby reducing the arrearage to $22,686.60, effective April 23, 2010. The issue of the appropriate liquidation rate was heard by a magistrate, who recommended that the current liquidation amount remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">{\u00b6 8} On May 12, 2010, the father filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision. After a hearing on the objections, the trial court overruled the father\u2019s objection on September 22, 2010. The father appeals the judgment of the trial court, asserting the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">[I.] The trial [court] committed prejudicial error by ordering appellant to pay monthly child support arrearage in an amount greater than permitted by federal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">[II.] Ohio Revised Code Section 3123.14 is unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">{\u00b6 9} The father argues in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred when it ordered him to pay child-support arrearage in an amount greater than that permitted by the Consumer Credit Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. 1673(b). The father contends that pursuant to R.C. 3113.21(D)(1)(a), a wage withholding order cannot require an employer to withhold more of the garnishee\u2019s earnings than permitted under the CCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 3113.21, which is cited by the father, was repealed in 2001. The analogous provisions to R.C. 3113.21(D)(1)(a) are now found in R.C. 3121.03(A)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">To the extent possible, the amount specified to be withheld shall satisfy the amount ordered for support in the support order plus any arrearages owed by the obligor under any prior support order that pertained to the same child or spouse, notwithstanding any applicable limitations of sections 2329.66, 2329.70, 2716.02, 2716.041, and 2716.05 of the Revised Code. <em>However, in no case shall the sum of the amount to be withheld and any fee withheld by the payor as a charge for its services exceed the maximum amount permitted under section 303(b) of the \u201cConsumer Credit Protection Act,\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1673(b).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">{\u00b6 11} The CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673, entitled \u201cRestriction on garnishment,\u201d sets forth the maximum allowable garnishment. Section 1673(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>(2) The maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subject to garnishment to enforce any order for the support of any person shall not exceed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">(A) where such individual is supporting his spouse or dependent child (other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support such order is used), 50 per centum of such individual\u2019s disposable earnings for that week; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">(B) where such individual is not supporting such a spouse or dependent child described in clause (A), 60 per centum of such individual\u2019s disposable earnings for that week;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">except that, with respect to the disposable earnings of any individual for any workweek, the 50 per centum specified in clause (A) shall be deemed to be 55 per centum and the 60 per centum specified in clause (B) shall be deemed to be 65 per centum, if and to the extent that such earnings are subject to garnishment to enforce a support order with respect to a period which is prior to the twelve-week period which ends with the beginning of such workweek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao\">{\u00b6 12} 15 U.S.C. 1672, provides the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">(a) The term \u201cearnings\u201d means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">(b) The term \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d means that part of the earnings of any individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">{\u00b6 13} The father argues that his arrearage liquidation and child-support withholdings exceed 65 percent of his monthly net income of $1,200. Thus, the father contends, his obligation is in violation of both the Ohio Revised Code and Section 303 of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">{\u00b6 14} The father fails to address the trial court\u2019s main basis for denying his motion to modify. The trial court found that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the father\u2019s request to revisit the amount of the order. The doctrine of res judicata bars further litigation of issues that were raised previously or could have been raised previously. <em>Natl. Amusements, Inc. v. Springdale </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 60, 62, 558 N.E.2d 1178. Here, the trial court found that the father had the opportunity to litigate the liquidation amount in prior proceedings but failed to request an administrative hearing or object to the recommendation of CSEA. The court noted that a final, appealable order was entered by the court that journalized the findings and recommendations of CSEA on August 8, 2008. The father does not contest the court\u2019s findings in this respect, and our own review of the record supports the court\u2019s findings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>record reveals that on June 26, 2008, CSEA filed recommendations establishing the support and processing charge arrearage and recommending that the arrearage be liquidated at $832.18 per month. The first section of CSEA\u2019s recommendations indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">IMPORTANT: THIRTY (30) DAY OBJECTION TIME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYP\">THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS INVESTIGATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A COURT ORDER UNLESS YOU OBJECT. IF YOU OBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS, THE OHIO REVISED CODE (ORC) REQUIRES YOU TO RESPOND WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE. AN \u201cOBJECTION TO CSEA INVESTIGATION\u201d FORM IS ENCLOSED FOR YOU TO USE WHEN OBJECTING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\">(Boldface and Capitalization sic.) The father failed to file objections to CSEA\u2019s recommendations. On August 8, 2008, the trial court issued an entry approving and adopting CSEA\u2019s June 26, 2008 recommendations and making them an order of the court. The father failed to file an appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, because father failed to object to CSEA\u2019s recommendations and failed to appeal from the trial court\u2019s adoption of those recommendations, we concur with the trial court that res judicata prevents the father from contesting the liquidation amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">{\u00b6 15} Notwithstanding res judicata, even if we were to address the merits of the father\u2019s argument, we would find it unavailing. With regard to Section 303 of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673, the trial court rejected this argument, concluding that R.C. 3121.03(A) and Section 303 of the CCPA prevent a court only from withholding wages in excess of the federal garnishment restrictions but do not restrict the amount a court may order to liquidate a support arrearage, which is the only relief father requested in his September 11, 2009 motion. The court further found that the father\u2019s weekly disposable income was $552.84 per week (based upon a wage of $17 per hour for 160 hours per month, with 18.7 percent in state and federal taxes deducted). Thus, the court found that the maximum garnishment was 60 percent of $552.84, or $331.70 per week. The court further found that the father\u2019s withholding in the current case was $76.66 per week, and that his withholding in the Muskingum County case was $88.42 per week, which together were below the maximum allowable garnishment of $331.70 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">{\u00b6 16} The father argues that his aggregate withholdings exceed 65 percent of his monthly net income, which he contends the magistrate and the parties agreed was $1,200. Even if we could address the merits of the father\u2019s argument, we would be confronted with myriad problems fatal to his claim. First, the father does not calculate any numbers in his appellate brief to demonstrate that the orders at issue exceeded the limits imposed by Section 303(b) of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673(b), and the transcript from the magistrate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>hearing provides incomplete data. Second, this court has no documentary-evidence before it, such as a pay stub or W-2, to perform its own calculations as to what the father\u2019s \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d are under Section 303(b) of the CCPA. Third, the record does not reveal that the magistrate and parties agreed that his monthly \u201cnet income\u201d was $1,200. At no time during the magistrate\u2019s proceedings did the mother agree to this amount. Furthermore, although the magistrate did mention this $1,200 figure as the father\u2019s \u201cnormal bring home\u201d at one point during the hearing, the magistrate did not indicate that this figure is father\u2019s \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d under Section 303(b) of the CCPA, and, as discussed in the next point below, it clearly is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">{\u00b6 17} Fourth, the $1,200 monthly \u201cnet income\u201d figure urged by the father upon appeal and before the magistrate already has subtracted from it the liquidation amount ordered in the current case, as well as the $383.14 per month in child support ordered in Muskingum County. The father presents no authority for the proposition that \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d as used in Section 303(b) of the CCPA, should exclude these amounts. To arrive at the father\u2019s \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d the trial court in the present case subtracted the father\u2019s state and federal taxes from his gross income, and then multiplied that amount by the maximum statutory garnishment percentage allowed to arrive at the maximum withholding amount permitted. We agree with the trial court that to arrive at \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d as used in Section 303(b), a court should not first subtract from gross income prior support orders in other cases or the liquidation or support order at issue in the current case. See, e.g., <em>Lough v. Robinson </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 149, 152, 675 N.E.2d 1272, fn. 2 (the term \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d for purposes of Section 303(b) of the CCPA, does not include deductions for support orders); <em>Seegert v. Zietlow </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 451, 466, 642 N.E.2d 697 (finding \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d for purposes of Section 303(b) of the CCPA, was gross earnings minus relevant taxes and union dues); <em>Nurse v. Portis </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 60, 520 N.E.2d 1372, paragraph two of the syllabus (to determine net disposable income for purposes of Section 303(b) of the CCPA, court did not consider prior support orders); <em>Mizell v. Mizell </em>(Dec. 24, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 00 JE 30, 2001 WL 1667865 (court compared the monthly arrearage liquidation amount to the father\u2019s total monthly Social Security check to determine whether the limits in Section 303(b) of the CCPA were exceeded); <em>Slivka v. Slivka </em>(Mar. 7, 1996), 8th Dist. No. 69146, 1996 WL 100854 (to determine net disposable earnings for purposes of Section 303(b) of the CCPA, the court subtracted federal, state, and local taxes from the garnishee\u2019s annual gross income); <em>Gillespie v. Gillespie </em>(June 30, 1994), 8th Dist. No. 65518, 1994 WL 317785 (to arrive at \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d under Section 303(b) of the CCPA, court used net income from father\u2019s W-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The trial court used the 60 percent figure from Section 303 of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673, while the father uses the 65 percent figure. We agree that the father\u2019s 65 percent figure is the correct percentage to use, because the liquidation order at issue here is for arrearages incurred before the 12-week period discussed in the exception found in Section 303(b), 15 U.S.C. 1673(b)(2)(B). However, the disagreement about the appropriate percentage to use makes no difference in this case because the orders at issue are not near either 60 or 65 percent of the father\u2019s disposable earnings. We already outlined the trial court\u2019s calculations using the lower 60 percent figure, and the trial court\u2019s calculations demonstrate the orders here did not come close to that limit imposed by Section 1673(b). Therefore, we find that even if res judicata did not preclude the father from contesting the liquidation order at issue here, his arguments would still be without merit. For all of these reasons, the father\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">{\u00b6 19} The father argues in his second assignment of error that R.C. 3123.14 is unconstitutional and inconsistent with Section 303 of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673. However, the father\u2019s constitutionality argument must fail because there is no conflict between R.C. 3123.14 and Section 1673. R.C. 3123.14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">If a withholding or deduction notice is issued pursuant to section 3121.03 of the Revised Code to collect an arrearage, the amount withheld or deducted from the obligor\u2019s personal earnings, income, or accounts <em>shall be at least equal </em>to the amount that was withheld or deducted under the terminated child support order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">{\u00b6 20} The father\u2019s contention is that R.C. 3123.14 conflicts with 15 U.S.C. 1673 because R.C. 3123.14 mandates that the amount withheld for any arrearage must be at least equal to the amount that was withheld under the terminated support order, while Section 1673 limits the amount <em>of </em>a garnishment order to a percentage of the garnishee\u2019s disposable earnings. We do not agree that there is a conflict. R.C. 3123.14 explicitly pertains to withholding notices issued pursuant to R.C. 3121.03, and 3121.03(A)(1), as discussed above, specifically limits any withholding order issued pursuant to that section to the limits imposed by Section 303 of the CCPA. Thus, the mandate in R.C. 3123.14 that the withholding notice to collect an arrearage must be at least equal to the amount that was withheld under the terminated support order is still limited by the terms of R.C. 3121.03 and Section 303 of the CCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1673. Therefore, because there is no conflict between R.C. 3123.14 and Section 303 of the CCPA, the father\u2019s argument that R.C. 3123.14 is unconstitutional is without merit. For this reason, the father\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, the father\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Branch, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-6\">French and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
