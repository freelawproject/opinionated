Leopard II appeals from his conviction and sentence following a guilty plea to two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, felonies of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">{\u00b6 2} The charges against Leopard stemmed from allegations that on multiple occasions, he had inserted his finger into J.R.\u2019s and B.M.\u2019s vaginas, engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>vaginal intercourse with them, and performed cunnilingus on the girls, who were both 15 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 3} The record reflects that 42-year-old Leopard met the two minors by permitting children in the neighborhood to come into his home to \u201chang out,\u201d drink alcohol, and use marijuana. His home was a well-known gathering spot for neighborhood teens. Leopard created an environment that condoned illegal activity and provided alcohol for the teens, knowing that young girls would be at his home drinking and partying. Once the girls were in his home, he made it clear that he was interested in them sexually. He used his access to them to eventually engage in sexual activity with both victims. This activity occurred on multiple occasions over several months. Both victims had recordings on their cellular devices where Leopard confessed to engaging in numerous, separate, sexual encounters with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 4} Based on the foregoing activity, Leopard was indicted on six counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.04(A), with specifications that he was ten or more years older than his victims. At arraignment, Leopard entered a plea of not guilty. Following a plea bargain, however, he entered a guilty plea to two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, each with the ten-or-more-years-older specification. The guilty plea involved one count for each of his two victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court ordered a presentence investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d) report and revoked Leopard\u2019s bail. At sentencing, the trial court imposed consecutive four-year prison sentences for a total of eight years. It also imposed five years of mandatory postrelease control and classified Leopard as a Tier II sexual offender. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 6} Leopard advances three assignments of error on appeal. First, he contends that his sentence is contrary to law because the trial court failed to make certain necessary findings before imposing consecutive sentences. Second, he claims that his sentence is contrary to law because the trial court failed to properly consider the statutory principles and purposes of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors. Third, he asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing more than minimum and consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 7} When reviewing felony sentences, an appellate court must first determine whether the sentencing court complied with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence, including R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, in order to find whether the sentence is contrary to law. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. If the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law, the trial court\u2019s decision when imposing the term of imprisonment must be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Leopard asserts that <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517, effectively overruled <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, thus reviving the requirement in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) that a court make certain findings before imposing consecutive sentences. Because the trial court did not make those findings, Leopard contends his sentence is contrary to law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 9} The requirement in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) that the trial court make certain findings before imposing consecutive sentences was found unconstitutional and severed from that statute in <em>Foster. </em>Leopard\u2019s argument that <em>Foster\u2019s </em>holding was effectively overruled by <em>Ice </em>is unpersuasive. In <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that <em>Ice </em>does not revive R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). See also <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23857, 2011-Ohio-752, 2011 WL 579204, \u00b6 12. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Foster, </em>a trial court is not required to make findings or give reasons for the sentences that it imposes; the court is vested with the full discretion to impose whatever prison term it chooses within the statutory range. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 37. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 10} In his second assignment of error, Leopard claims that the trial court failed to properly consider the statutory principles and purposes of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 11} When exercising its sentencing discretion, a trial court must consider the statutory policies that apply to every felony offense, including those set out in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. <em>Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 38. In that regard, R.C. 2929.11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) A court that sentences an offender for a felony shall be guided by the overriding purposes of felony sentencing. The overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(B) A sentence imposed for a felony shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing set forth in division (A) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">{\u00b6 14} In turn, R.C. 2929.12 states:</p>\n<blockquote

position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(4) The offender\u2019s occupation, elected office, or profession obliged the offender to prevent the offense or bring others committing it to justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(5) The offender\u2019s professional reputation or occupation, elected office, or profession was used to facilitate

The offender shows genuine remorse for the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 42} On appeal, Leopard contends the trial court did not consider \u201cthe principles and purposes of sentencing\u201d under R.C. 2929.11 and balance the seriousness and recidivism factors under R.C. 2929.12, although the sentencing entry says that the court did consider those statutes in rendering its decision. Instead, Leopard asserts that the court imposed two, four-year consecutive sentences because he \u201cgot a tremendous break or was shown tremendous leniency from the State of Ohio when the State dismissed four of the counts because * * * it was [not] an issue of being able to prove that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 48} Contrary to Leopard\u2019s claim, the record illustrates that the trial court did fully consider both the principles and purposes of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors provided by R.C. 2929.12. The trial court explained some of its reasoning for its decision on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 44} Although the trial court did not specifically cite either statute during the sentencing hearing, its judgment entry stated that it had \u201cconsidered the record, oral statements of counsel, the defendant\u2019s statement, the presentence investigation report, the principles, and purposes of sentencing under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.11, and [had] balanced the seriousness and recidivism factors under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.12.\u201d A trial court speaks through its journal entries, and Leopard\u2019s sentence is not contrary to law merely because the trial court failed to cite either statute during the sentencing hearing. <em>State v. Cave, </em>Clark App. No. 09-CA-6, 2010-Ohio-1237, 2010 WL 1138931, \u00b6 10. \u201cFurthermore, even if there is no specific mention of those statutes in the record, \u2018it is presumed that the trial court gave proper consideration to those statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>Clark App. No. 09CA28, 2010-Ohio-2138, 2010 WL 1932041, \u00b6 43, quoting <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 45} During the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor stated that although the victims were at the older end of the spectrum as far as juvenile victims, there were many aggravating factors. According to the prosecutor, the most significant was the fact that Leopard had sexually assaulted two victims. The prosecutor argued: \u201cThat points to a couple of issues. First of all, the need to punish him for each victim; and second of all, whether or not he\u2019s subject to rehabilitation or looking at recidivism issues. Obviously, those are always concerns when you have more than one victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 46} The prosecutor added, \u201cI\u2019ll ask that whatever sentence you pass today must punish him for engaging in sex with two teenage girls and must protect the community to make sure he\u2019s not in a position to commit anymore acts like this. * * * A sentence that is not consecutive basically allows him a free pass for one of the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 47} When imposing its sentence, the trial court \u201cagree[d] with the prosecutor that the sentence imposed should run consecutively.\u201d The court complied with the applicable rules and statutes in making this determination. Furthermore, we note that the two four-year sentences that the trial court imposed are not statutory maximum sentences and are within the authorized range of available punishments for felonies of the third degree. R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). We have no basis for concluding that Leopard\u2019s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. His second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 48} In his third assignment of error, Leopard contends because he is a first-time offender, the trial court abused its discretion in imposing near maximum and consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 49} Leopard argues that his aggregate eight-year sentence is unduly harsh and not supported by the record. Therefore, he claims that it constitutes an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. In support, he points to a number of facts and circumstances. They include his lack of a prior criminal record, the consensual nature of the sexual acts, the absence of force, violence, or physical harm, the lack of exploitation of any mental or physical impairment, and the fact that he was a law-abiding citizen prior to this incident. In light of these facts, Leopard contends that his sentence is unduly harsh and thus constitutes an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Even though the sentence may admittedly appear harsh and would not be the sentence imposed if sentencing were our duty, we cannot say that it is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 50} The phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable, or a \u201cview or action that no conscientious judge could honestly have taken.\u201d <em>State v. Brady, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 375, 2008-Ohio-4493, 894 N.E.2d 671, at \u00b6 23; <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248. It is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary. \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision. It is not enough that the reviewing court, were it deciding the issue <em>de novo, </em>would not have found that reasoning process to be persuasive, perhaps in view of countervailing reasoning processes that would support a contrary result.\u201d <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 51} Here Leopard\u2019s conduct reasonably supports imposition of a sentence within the ranges of R.C. 2929.14(A)(3), which authorizes sentences of one, two, three, four, or five years for third-degree felonies. The trial court stated on the record its reasons for giving Leopard the sentence it did: there were multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>victims, a pattern of behavior over a period of time, multiple instances of offense conduct, planning of the offenses ahead of time, and luring of the victims with alcohol and possibly marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 52} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive four-year sentences. In the absence of any statute to the contrary, \u201cit is a matter solely within the discretion of the sentencing court whether sentences shall run consecutively or concurrently.\u201d <em>State v. Nunez, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22208, 2008-Ohio-3376, 2008 WL 2627676, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Stewart v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 180, 181, 22 O.O.2d 116, 187 N.E.2d 888; see also <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 53} Having overruled Leopard\u2019s three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-8\">Donofrio, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b547-9\">Grady, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b547-10\">Donofrio, J., of the Seventh District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b547-11\">Grady, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">{\u00b6 54} The presentence investigation report prepared for the trial court in this case reveals that the two victims were 15 years of age. Had they been 16, defendant\u2019s conduct would not have been criminal. Defendant used alcohol to entice the victims, but there is no evidence that he used force. His conduct was planned, not merely opportunistic. The report fails to reflect that the victims suffered physical or psychological injuries as a result of defendant\u2019s conduct. Defendant expressed remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">{\u00b6 55} Leopard was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, R.C. 2907.04. As charged, the offenses are third-degree felonies because Leopard was ten years older than the victim. R.C. 2907.04(B)(3). Third-degree felonies are punishable by prison terms of one, two, three, four, or five years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">{\u00b6 56} The state dismissed counts one, two, four, and five in exchange for defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty to counts three and six. His plea exposed Leopard to a maximum punishment of ten years, should maximum five-year sentences be imposed consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">{\u00b6 57} R.C. 2929.14(B) states that the sentencing court \u201cshall impose the shortest prison term authorized for the offense\u201d unless (1) the offender was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>previously convicted of a felony offense or (2) the shortest term \u201cwill demean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct or will not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 58} Leopard was a first offender. Instead of the shortest one-year prison term for each of his two offenses, the trial court imposed a four-year sentence for each, one year less than the maximum, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate term of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 59} The court stated that it considered the purposes and principles of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12. There is little if any basis to find a higher risk of recidivism, and the court mentioned none. The court was instead concerned with the seriousness of the two offenses, citing defendant\u2019s use of alcohol and that he had engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct involving the victims \u201cover a couple of months, maybe even three months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 60} The matters to which the court referred are sufficiently serious to elevate defendant\u2019s sentences above the one-year minimum term that R.C. 2929.14(B) prescribes. However, they are not sufficiently serious to quadruple that minimum in each case, and then to double the quadruple by running the sentences consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 61} R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) sets out the criteria for imposing consecutive sentences. Consecutive service must be necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and not disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime or the danger that the offender poses to the public. Also, when the offenses were committed as part of the same course of conduct, \u201cthe harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses (must have been) so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 62} The state recommended consecutive sentences, saying that if consecutive sentences are not imposed, Leopard would get a \u201cfree pass\u201d for one of his two offenses. That consideration appears nowhere in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 63} For the court, the most compelling reason to impose consecutive four-year sentences is in its statement: \u201cI think the defendant got a tremendous break or was shown tremendous leniency from the State of Ohio when the State dismissed four of the counts because I don\u2019t think it was an issue of not being able to prove that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 64} R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 are in accord with the basic philosophy of considering not only the offender\u2019s particular conduct but also his character when imposing a sentence. Other matters relevant to one or both may also be considered, and that approach has withstood due-process and-double jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>challenges. However, the cases offer no support for imposing a greater sentence merely because the offender escaped punishment for other crimes on account of a plea bargain. The court may consider the conduct those other crimes involved, but not the fact that the offender was not punished for them as a basis to impose a greater sentence. Notably, that particular consideration appears nowhere in R.C. 2929.11 or 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">{\u00b6 65} The Supreme Court did unintended injury to the sentencing policies the General Assembly adopted in S.B. 2 when, in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.8d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, the court said that judges are \u201cfree\u201d to impose any sentence within the available range and, in <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, that the power to impose consecutive sentences is \u201cinherent\u201d in the court. Judges have read those holdings as authorization to put aside the statutory policies on sentencing and instead to enforce their own subjective views.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 66} Even when a sentence is within the available range, courts may not abuse their discretion in choosing the sentence to impose. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. I find an abuse of discretion in this case. I would modify the sentences to four years concurrent and affirm as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
