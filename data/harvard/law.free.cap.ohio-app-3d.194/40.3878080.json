SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">The Ross County Juvenile Court abused its discretion when it classified [A.R.R.] as a Tier III juvenile sexual offender registrant without considering the proper factors and applying current law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">The trial court erred when it applied Senate Bill 10 to [A.R.R.], as the law violates his right to equal protection under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">The retroactive application of Senate Bill 10 to [A.R.R.] violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">{\u00b6 3} A.R.R. was previously adjudicated a delinquent child for having committed a sexually oriented offense. At the March 16, 2009 hearing, the magistrate recommended that he be classified a Tier III sex offender under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (\u201cAWA\u201d) enacted in 2007. See Am.Sub.S.B. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>10. Two days later, the juvenile court agreed with the magistrate and found that \u201cthe child is <em>required </em>to be classified as a Tier III Juvenile Sex Offender Registrant pursuant to O.R.C. 2152.83(A).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, we reversed the judgment because it appeared that the trial court felt compelled to make that classification based on appellant\u2019s age, when, in fact, it had discretion to decide the issue. See <em>In re A.R.R., </em>Ross App. No. 09CA3105, 2009-Ohio-7067, 2009 WL 5247453 <em>(\u201cA.R.R. </em>I\u201d). On remand, the trial court again considered the matter and classified appellant a Tier III sex offender. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error raises the issue of whether the trial court possessed jurisdiction to classify him a Tier III sexual offender. By way of background, appellant\u2019s date of birth is September 12, 1988. Thus, he turned 21 years of age on September 12, 2009. Appellant cites a recent decision from the Third District that held that a juvenile court loses jurisdiction to classify an offender a Tier III sex offender once the offender reaches the age of 21 years. See <em>In re G.M., </em>188 Ohio App.3d 318, 2010-Ohio-2295, 935 N.E.2d 459, at \u00b6 18. Appellant argues that he was 21 at the time of the March 22, 2010 hearing, and, thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction. He urges us to follow <em>G.M. </em>and vacate his Tier III classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 6} In the case sub judice, we first point out that the March 22, 2010 hearing was held on remand of <em>A.R.R. I. </em>Appellant\u2019s original classification hearing was held March 16, 2009, and the judgment that classified him a Tier III offender was issued on March 19, 2009. Those proceedings all occurred in advance of appellant\u2019s 21st birthday. In <em>G.M., </em>the Third District noted that it did not decide the issue \u201cas to what authority the juvenile court may or may not have after a child\u2019s 21st birthday to issue orders to enforce or otherwise modify a classification order that was entered before the child\u2019s 21st birthday.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17, fn. 1. That, however, is the precise issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">{\u00b6 7} In the case sub judice, appellant reached the age of 21 years while <em>A.R.R. I </em>was on appeal. Our reversal and remand ensured that the trial court\u2019s classification was not made on the basis of its belief that it was required to classify appellant a Tier III offender. We noted that the juvenile court \u201cmay reimpose such classification on remand\u201d if it believed that the evidence warranted such classification. 2009-0hio-7067, 2009 WL 5247453, at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">{\u00b6 8} We further note that under R.C. 2152.82(C), the classification as a juvenile-offender registrant is not affected by a juvenile\u2019s 21st birthday. Although in the case at bar we reversed and remanded the trial court\u2019s March 18, 2009 classification order, the fact remains that the court issued the original order before appellant\u2019s 21st birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Accordingly, under the particular facts and circumstances present in this case, we conclude that the juvenile court possessed jurisdiction on remand to reenter the Tier III classification after appellant\u2019s 21st birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 11} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that his classification as a Tier III offender constitutes an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. We disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 12} This court has held that a juvenile court has discretion to classify a delinquent as a Tier III sex offender. <em>A.R.R. I, </em>supra, at \u00b6 7; <em>In re AM., </em>Athens App. No. 09CA07, 2009-Ohio-7066, 2009 WL 5247478, at \u00b6 7. When a trial court has the discretion to perform an act, its decision is typically reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard. Generally, an abuse of discretion constitutes more than an error of law or judgment; rather, it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. See, e.g., <em>Landis v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 339, 342, 695 N.E.2d 1140; <em>Malone v. Courtyard by Marriott L.P. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 440, 448, 659 N.E.2d 1242. An appellate court may not find an abuse of discretion simply by substituting its judgment for that of the trial court. See <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Chippewa Twp. Trustees </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 728, 732, 654 N.E.2d 1254; <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 137-138, 566 N.E.2d 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 13} Our review of the March 22, 2010 classification-hearing transcript reveals that the magistrate heard arguments from both the prosecutor and appellant\u2019s counsel. In reclassifying appellant as a Tier III offender, the magistrate considered all of the \u201cfactors and circumstances\u201d surrounding the case, including the rape victim\u2019s age (four years). The magistrate also explicitly stated that \u201call the factors set forth in * * * [R.C.] 2152.83\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 14} We also emphasize that the trial court has been involved with this matter since 2007 and is in the best position to weigh the facts and circumstances and to assess the weight and credibility of the evidence. Although defense counsel made an impassioned plea on appellant\u2019s behalf, and his appellate counsel argues that more emphasis should have been placed on those arguments, we find nothing to persuade us that the trial court\u2019s decision to classify him a Tier III sex offender is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 16} We jointly consider appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error in which he argues that the AWA (1) violates his equal-protection rights and (2) should not apply to him retrospectively as it violates the United States Constitution\u2019s ban on ex post facto laws, as well as the Ohio Constitution\u2019s ban on retroactive laws. We find no merit in these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 17} Ohio courts have held that the AWA does not violate a juvenile offender\u2019s equal protection rights. See, e.g., <em>In re C.P., </em>Athens App. No. 09CA41, 2010-Ohio-1484, 2010 WL 1256057, at \u00b6 18-28; <em>In re R.D., </em>Licking App. No. 09CA97, 2010-Ohio-2986, 2010 WL 2595157, at \u00b6 36. We have also rejected the argument that the AWA violates either the federal Constitution\u2019s ban on ex post facto laws or the Ohio Constitution\u2019s ban on the retroactive application of laws. See <em>State v. Anderson, </em>Athens App. No. 09CA18, 2009-Ohio-7014, 2009 WL 5178481, at \u00b6 7; <em>State v. Coburn, </em>Ross App. No. 08CA3062, 2009-Ohio-632, 2009 WL 348835, at \u00b6 8-13. Nothing in appellant\u2019s brief prompts us to reconsider these decisions. Thus, unless and until the Ohio Supreme Court holds otherwise, we continue to adhere to those decisions. Accordingly, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 18} After having considered all of the errors appellant assigned and argued, we hereby affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-11\">Harsha, P.J., and Kline, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">. Although appellant phrases his assignment of error in terms of \"abuse of discretion,\u201d he . urges us to review the trial court\u2019s determination de novo and cites <em>In re J.S., </em>Wayne App. No. 07CA0035, 2007-Ohio-6402, 2007 WL 4225419, at \u00b6 12. The <em>In re J.S. </em>court, however, made the remark while analyzing the trial court\u2019s interpretation of law. We agree that such rulings are reviewed on appeal de novo, but here we are reviewing the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts to determine whether a Tier III classification is warranted. We concede that little case law exists to establish an appropriate standard of review, but for those reasons discussed in this opinion, we review this matter under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\">. R.C. 2152.83(D) specifies that a juvenile court should consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the sexually oriented offense as well as the public interest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>safety. Id. at (1) and (3). We parenthetically note that nothing in the statute requires the court to explicitly set forth in its judgment entry how it weighed each individual factor.
