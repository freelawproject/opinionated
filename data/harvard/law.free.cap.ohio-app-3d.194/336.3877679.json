Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In October 2009, Annable was indicted on one count of theft and 30 counts of practicing medicine without a license. The case proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defense made a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, which was denied. The defense presented evidence, and at the conclusion of its case, renewed its Crim.R. 29 motion; the motion was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 3} The jury found Annable guilty of theft and 12 counts of practicing medicine without a license. The trial court sentenced him to four and a half years in prison and ordered him to pay $15,580 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 4} The voluminous testimony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this case revealed the following facts. Annable, a cosmetologist, was the owner of Bella Derm Medi Spa<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Westlake, Ohio. The spa\u2019s slogan was \u201cthe feel of a spa, the care of a physician.\u201d One of the services offered at the spa was mesotherapy. Clients receiving mesotherapy signed a \u201cmesotherapy patient consent form\u201d and a form explaining \u201cmesotherapy post-treatment instructions.\u201d The clients also completed and signed a \u201cmedical questionnaire\u201d that included a \u201cpre-operative medical history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 5} The state\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Diane Maiwald, a board-certified dermatologist and founding member of the American Board of Mesotherapy, explained mesotherapy. Dr. Maiwald testified that mesotherapy is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, back pain, fat reduction, and cellulite. She stated that the therapy requires the injection of medication, either with a hypodermic needle or medical roller, under the upper layer of skin. Dr. Maiwald testified that injection, or puncturing of the skin, is necessary so that the required high concentrations of medication can be released into the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Dr. Maiwald further testified that mesotherapy is a medical procedure that requires medical supervision and described various precautions that a doctor performing the procedure should take. For example, she testified that the injected medication needed to be tailored to each person and that the medical rollers should never be reused. Dr. Maiwald also testified that most of her patients undergoing the procedure required prescription medication for pain management. She testified that she had never heard of a cosmetologist performing the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 7} The spa became the subject of investigation by law-enforcement officials, the Ohio State Medical Board, and the Ohio State Board of Cosmetology after an employee complained that the therapy \u201cjust looked wrong.\u201d According to the employee, Annable would numb the clients\u2019 skin with ice packs, and while she (the employee) held the clients\u2019 skin \u201ctight,\u201d Annable would apply a roller with needles to the area. The employee testified that the clients would usually bleed from the rollers, and that she saw the same roller being used on more than one patient. According to the employee, \u201cthese people were in a lot of pain.\u201d The employee also testified that in the nearly a year that she worked at the spa, she never saw a doctor on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 8} Another employee of the spa, a licensed practical nurse (\u201cLPN\u201d), testified that she began performing the procedure at the spa on her own after Annable \u201ctrained\u201d her. The LPN testified that some rollers would be used on more than one client. The LPN also described the numbing with ice packs and testified that some of the clients would bleed. The LPN further testified that she saw only one doctor on the spa premises, but that doctor did not have anything to do with the mesotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 9} Several of the spa\u2019s mesotherapy clients testified for the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Collectively, they testified that they believed Annable was a doctor, and based on that belief, they undressed for him for examinations. Annable told the clients that he would inject the area to be treated with amino acids that would \u201cbreak down the fat.\u201d They described the procedure as \u201cpainful.\u201d Some of the clients testified that they had had special medical conditions to which they alerted Annable and which Annable told them he would manage. The clients stopped the treatments because they were too painful. The clients prepaid for the services. Several of the clients requested a refund, but never received one.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 10} Three doctors testified about their relationship with Annable. First, Dr. Harry Simmons testified that he and Annable had agreed that Dr. Simmons would work as an independent contractor at the spa one or two days a week. Simmons testified that he was to receive training on some of the services the spa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>offered, and then he would choose which of the services he would perform or oversee. Simmons testified that he observed one or two mesotherapy procedures, but never performed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Simmons later learned that his name was listed on some of the spa\u2019s therapy information sheets as being the doctor who performed procedures, including mesotherapy, that he never performed. After discovering this, Simmons confronted Annable and terminated his relationship with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 12} The second doctor, Dr. Dominick Catalano, operated a medical spa in Streetsboro, Ohio, and he and Annable had discussed the possibility of merging their businesses. During their discussions, Annable told Catalano about mesotherapy; Catalano had never heard of it and had never performed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 13} Catalano and Annable eventually agreed to work together. Catalano testified that under their agreement, only he (Dr. Catalano) would perform medical procedures in either spa, and Annable was to perform cosmetic services relating to hair, nails, and superficial skin resurfacing. Catalano testified that Annable never told him that he had been performing mesotherapy and that if he had known that, he never would have agreed to work with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Catalano came to learn that mesotherapy is a \u201chighly specialized form of practice. [It] involves advance knowledge of certain compounds that will be infused into the skin, as well as the potential for side effects and what to do from the side effects from the medications.\u201d Dr. Catalano severed his relationship with Annable after he saw him perform mesotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 15} The third doctor who testified about his relationship with Annable was Dr. Nicholas Diamantis. Dr. Diamantis testified that he and his partner at the Western Reserve Center for Oral and Facial Cosmetic Surgery, Dr. Matthew Goldschmidt, occasionally worked at Annable\u2019s spa as independent contractors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Dr. Diamantis, he and Dr. Goldschmidt would provide their own equipment and staff whenever they worked at the spa. Dr. Diamantis testified that Annable displayed his picture and referred to Diamantis as \u201cmedical director\u201d on literature advertising the spa without his permission. Dr. Diamantis testified that he never discussed with Annable being the medical director of the spa and, furthermore, never served in that capacity. Drs. Diamantis and Goldschmidt severed their relationship with Annable out of concern that they \u201cmay inadvertently violate certain ethical restrictions placed on [them] regarding the unauthorized practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Annable testified at trial. He admitted performing mesotherapy. It was Annable\u2019s belief that it is proper for a cosmetologist to provide services that claim to have a medical or healing benefit. He admitted that he had never received permission to perform the procedure from the Medical Board or the Cosmetology Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 17} After their investigations, both the Ohio State Medical Board and the Ohio State Cosmetology Board found that Annable was practicing medicine without a license. Annable\u2019s cosmetology license was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 18} Annable has assigned the following errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201cI. Defendant-appellant\u2019s constitutional and due process rights were violated and he has been subjected to double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cII. The trial court committed reversible error when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201cHI. The trial court\u2019s error in the admission of evidence effectively denied the defendant due process and a fair opportunity to present his defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201cTV. Defendant\u2019s conviction is manifestly against the weight of the evidence and must be overturned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">\u201cV. The trial court erred in convicting and sentencing the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Acc\">Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">{\u00b6 19} For his first assigned error, Annable contends that he was subjected to double jeopardy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">{\u00b6 20} Prior to this case, Annable had twice been under indictment for the crimes charged here: first, in case No. CR-517594, and second, in case No. CR-521710. In the first case, Annable was indicted by information in February 2009. In the second case, Annable was indicted by a grand jury in March 2009. In November 2009, the court issued judgments in both cases stating, \u201c[0]n recommendation of the prosecutor case is dismissed with prejudice. Defendant re-indicted on new case CR-530634 10/30/2009.\u201d The new case, case No. CR-530634, is the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">{\u00b6 21} In July 2010, upon the state\u2019s motion, the court issued judgments in the two prior cases, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">For good cause shown and to correct a clerical error to the case under Case Number[s] CR 517594[and] CR 521710, be now dismissed without prejudice and the court\u2019s entry should now reflect that correction. Case[s] [are] dismissed without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>{\u00b622} This record evidences that the trial court\u2019s original judgments dismissing the two prior cases contained a clerical error, that is, dismissal with prejudice. A new case could not have been filed, as the judgments stated one was, if the dismissals were with prejudice. Moreover, in order to dismiss a case with prejudice, a trial court must find a deprivation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights. <em>State v. Worwell, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86032, 2005-Ohio-6343, 2005 WL 3219726, \u00b6 16. There was no such finding in either of the two prior cases, further evidencing that the original dismissals with prejudice were clerical errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">{\u00b6 23} A clerical mistake is a mistake or omission, mechanical in nature and apparent on the record, that does not involve a legal decision or judgment. <em>State v. Patrick, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89214, 2007-Ohio-6847, 2007 WL 4443398, \u00b6 20. A court may, at any time, correct clerical mistakes arising from oversight or omission. <em>State v. Walton, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87347, 2006-Ohio-4771, 2006 WL 2627542, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 24} On this record, Annable\u2019s double-jeopardy rights were not violated; the prior cases were dismissed without prejudice, and the nunc pro tunc entries stating so were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 25} Within this assignment of error, Annable also takes issue with the fact that he was indicted under R.C. 4731.34 in case Nos. CR-517594 and CR-521710, but the indictment in this case was under R.C. 4731.41. We find no error with these inconsistencies. The crime of practicing medicine without a license is set forth under R.C. 4731.41; R.C. 4731.34 is the definitional section. Apparently realizing that it had previously indicted Annable under the definitional section, rather than the section that makes it a crime to practice medicine without a license, the state corrected itself and properly indicted Annable under R.C. 4731.41 in this case. That occurrence did not create any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 26} In light of the above, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 27} Annable challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 28} Under Crim.R. 29(A), a court \u201cshall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction requires a court to determine whether the state has met its burden of production at trial. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541. On review for sufficiency, courts are to assess not whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>evidence against a defendant would support a conviction. Id. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 29} Annable contends that the trial court erred by denying his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal because the state failed to (1) submit any evidence on the mens rea for practicing medicine without a license, which he contends is recklessness, (2) establish that any \u201calleged drug\u201d he used was in fact a drug, (3) establish that his acts did not fall under authorized acts permitted by a cosmetologist, and (4) establish theft by deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">1. Culpable Mental State</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 30} Annable raised the issue of the mens rea for practicing medicine without a license in support of his Crim.R. 29 motion and argued that the state failed to present evidence that he acted recklessly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, however, held that the statute imposes strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 4731.41, governing the crime of practicing medicine or surgery without a certificate, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">No person shall practice medicine and surgery, or any of its branches, without the appropriate certificate from the state medical board to engage in the practice. No person shall advertise or claim to the public to be a practitioner of medicine and surgery, or any of its branches, without a certificate from the board. No person shall open or conduct an office or other place for such practice without a certificate from the board. No person shall conduct an office in the name of some person who has a certificate to practice medicine and surgery, or any of its branches. No person shall practice medicine and surgery, or any of its branches, after the person\u2019s certificate has been revoked, or, if suspended, during the time of such suspension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 32} Under R.C. 2901.21(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The state argues that the \u201cno person shall\u201d language, in the absence of any reference to a required mental state, indicates a legislative intent to impose strict liability. But the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the usage of the phrase \u201cno person shall\u201d does not by itself evince a plain legislative intent to impose strict liability. <em>State v. Moody, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 244, 2004-Ohio-6395, 819 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 16. Rather than relying on this phrase alone, courts must consider other indicia to determine whether the General Assembly intended to impose strict liability. Id.; see also <em>State v. Clay, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 528, 2008-Ohio-6325, 900 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 25, quoting <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 30; <em>State v. Bowersmith, </em>Union App. No. 14-02-02, 2002-Ohio-3386, 2002 WL 1434057, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 34} The state urges us to consider the definitional section as evidence that the General Assembly intended R.C. 4731.41 to be a strict-liability offense. We have reviewed R.C. 4731.34 and do not find an indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to impose strict liability. In fact, that section outlines an exception for practitioners of the Christian Science church. See R.C. 4731.34(B). There are also various other exceptions to the general prohibition against practicing medicine without a license set forth in R.C. 4731.36. For example, R.C. 4731.36(A) provides, \u201cSections 4731.01 to 4731.47 of the Revised Code shall not prohibit service in case of emergency, domestic administration of family remedies, or provision of assistance to another individual who is self-administering drugs.\u201d (See R.C. 4731.36 for various other exceptions.) We recognize that there can be exceptions to a strict-liability offense. But we note the numerous exceptions to practicing medicine without a license in considering the state\u2019s contention that \u201cfrom a public policy and logical perspective the legislature could not impose otherwise [i.e., strict liability].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 35} In light of the above, we find that R.C. 4731.41 is not a strict-liability statute. Thus, we now consider the implications of the trial court\u2019s treating the crime as a strict-liability offense as it relates to the indictment and its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 36} Recently, the Ohio Supreme Court, overruling its decision in <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169, held that an indictment that charges an offense by tracking the language of the criminal statute is not defective for failure to identify a culpable mental state when the statute itself fails to identify a mental state. <em>State v. Horner, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, at paragraph one of the syllabus. In light of this ruling, the denial of Annable\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion based on the form of the indictment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 37} As it relates to the jury instructions, the trial court, believing that the offense of practicing medicine without a license is a strict liability offense, did not instruct the jury on recklessness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">As a general rule, a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on all elements that must be proved to establish the crime with which he is charged, and, where specific intent or culpability is an essential element of the offense, a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on that mental element constitutes error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0q\">(Footnote omitted.) <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 153, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 38} In its instructions to the jury, the court more or less read the charge of practicing medicine without a license as set forth in the statute; it did not give any instruction on strict liability. The defense raised the issue of the mental state as part of its Crim.R. 29 motion; it objected to the jury instructions because of a lack of a unanimity instruction, but not on the ground that the trial court faded to instruct on the mens rea for practicing medicine without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 39} Crim.R. 30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 40} Under Crim.R. 52(B), \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d \u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 41} There are three conditions that must be met to satisfy the plain-error rule. First, there must be a deviation from a legal rule. Second, the error must be plain, meaning that the error is an obvious defect in the trial proceedings. Third, the error must have affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. This has been interpreted to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. The appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 42} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the failure to instruct on each element of an offense is not necessarily reversible as plain error. <em>Adams, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144, at paragraph two of the syllabus. An appellate court must review the instructions as a whole to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>a manifest miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the error in the instructions. Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 43} Under the facts of this case, the error was not so prejudicial that the result of the case would have been different had the error not occurred. We note in particular that although the court incorrectly treated practicing medicine as a strict-liability offense, it did not so instruct the jury. Rather, the court more or less read the statute to the jury. Moreover, there was substantial evidence presented that Annable had acted recklessly. On this record, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">2. Proof of use of a Drug</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 44} Annable contends that the state failed to present evidence that the alleged drug he used during mesotherapy was actually a drug. Practicing medicine without a license is not limited to administering drugs, however. \u201cThe statute may be violated by the dispensing of a remedy as well as a drug.\u201d <em>State v. Henning </em>(1948), 83 Ohio App. 445, 450, 38 O.O. 484, 78 N.E.2d 588. The state presented sufficient evidence that Annable had dispensed a remedy. The trial court, therefore, properly overruled the Crim.R. 29 motion on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">3. Authorized Acts by a Cosmetologist</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 45} Annable contends that the state failed to prove that his acts were not permissible under his cosmetologist license. We disagree. The investigator from the Ohio State Board of Cosmetology testified that cosmetologists are not permitted to puncture the first layer of skin, introduce a foreign substance into the body, or treat medical conditions. There was sufficient testimony that Annable did all these prohibited acts. His Crim.R. 29 motion on this ground was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">4. Theft by Deception</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 46} Annable was charged with theft under R.C. 2913.02(A)(3), which provides, \u201cNo person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services * * * [b]y deception[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">{\u00b6 47} Deception means \u201cknowingly deceiving another or causing another to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, by preventing another from acquiring information, or by any other conduct, act, or omission that creates, confirms, or perpetuates a false impression in another, including a false impression as to law, value, state of mind, or other objective or subjective fact.\u201d R.C. 2913.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>{\u00b6 48} Six of Annable\u2019s clients were listed as the victims of theft. Those victims testified that they prepaid for their services with Annable, but they did not finish their treatment plans. All but one victim requested refunds; none of them were reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 49} The state presented sufficient evidence that Annable used deceptive practices to entice his victims to prepay for the therapy. After taking the victims\u2019 money, he did not provide the services as agreed, and Annable did not refund the money. On this record, the trial court properly denied his Crim.R. 29 motion as it related to the theft count.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 50} In light of the above, the trial court properly denied Annable\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion, and the second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Admission of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">1. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 51} In his third assignment of error, Annable contends that the trial court improperly limited the testimony of his expert witness, but not the state\u2019s, thereby resulting in a \u201cwell-known and respected, qualified expert being unable to express an opinion, while a dermatologist who had only the minimal degree was permitted to express an expert opinion on the facts.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 52} The admission of expert testimony is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 576, 660 N.E.2d 724. An abuse of discretion requires more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Reiner </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 342, 356, 731 N.E.2d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 53} Evid.R. 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">A witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">{\u00b6 54} After a hearing on the issue of both parties\u2019 experts, the trial court ruled that the state\u2019s expert, Dr. Maiwald, qualified as an expert in dermatology who performs mesotherapy, but not as an expert in mesotherapy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The court also ruled that the defense\u2019s expert, Dr. Ernest Chidio, qualified as an expert in the areas of medicine in which he practiced, but not as an expert in mesotherapy. The court\u2019s ruling in regard to Dr. Chidio was based on the fact that he had never even performed a mesotherapy treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2. Radio Advertisement</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 55} A tape of a radio advertisement that referred to appellant as \u201cDr. Annable,\u201d which never aired, and was created by Clear Channel, was admitted into evidence over the defense\u2019s objection. The evidence demonstrated that Clear Channel, on its own, created the advertisement with the intent of inducing Annable to purchase air time for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 56} The tape was used by the state in the defense\u2019s case, when Annable took the stand, to demonstrate that he was regarded in the community as a doctor. It was proper impeachment evidence. Evid.R. 607 provides that the \u201ccredibility of a witness may be attacked by any party.\u201d Annable\u2019s position at trial was that he had never held himself out to his clients or the public as a doctor. The tape was admitted into evidence to attack Annable\u2019s credibility by showing that he was believed to be a doctor. This was proper under Evid.R. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 57} In light of the above, the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 58} Annable contends in his fourth assignment of error that his convictions are against the weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 59} A challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence attacks the verdict in light of the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541. When inquiring into the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court sits as the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and makes an independent review of the record. Id. at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541; <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 60} The appellate court reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of all witnesses, and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and a new proceeding ordered. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Where a judgment is supported by competent, credible evidence going to all essential elements to be proven, the judgment will not be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Mattison </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 23 OBR 43, 490 N.E.2d 926. Accordingly, reversal on manifest-weight grounds is reserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201cthe exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 61} Upon review, we find that the weight of the evidence supports the convictions. The state presented ample evidence that Annable practiced medicine without a license and committed theft by deception. That evidence included his performing a medical procedure, holding himself out, either explicitly or impliedly, as being a doctor, and taking money for the treatments, which were not completed and for which the clients were not refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 62} On this record, this is not an exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Conviction and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 63} In his final assignment of error, Annable challenges his conviction based on the lack-of-unanimity instruction. He also challenges his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 64} In regard to the trial court\u2019s denial of Annable\u2019s request for an instruction on jury unanimity, the prevailing rule in Ohio is that \u201ca general unanimity instruction will ensure that the jury is unanimous on the factual basis for a conviction, even where the indictment alleges numerous factual bases for criminal liability.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 104, 545 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 65} The record reflects that the trial court provided a general unanimity instruction to the jury as follows: \u201cBecause this is a criminal case, the law requires that all 12 of you be in agreement before you can consider that you have reached a verdict.\u201d We find that the trial court\u2019s general unanimity jury instruction was proper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 66} Moreover, the practicing-medicine-without-a-license counts were not allied offenses, subject to merger at sentencing, as Annable contends. The counts involved separate victims, separate acts, and separate times. No one count was necessary for any other count to be charged. Each count of practicing medicine without a license was a single conceptual grouping.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>Johnson, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 96, 545 N.E.2d 636, the Ohio Supreme Court held that even if a single count of an indictment is capable of being committed by alternative means, it can be construed as a single conceptual grouping. Id. at 104. The Ohio Supreme Court further ruled that despite the existence of alternative means of commission of murder, the count in the indictment was able to be construed as a single conceptual grouping. The crime at issue here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>practicing medicine without a license, allows for varying means of committing the single conceptual act.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 68} If a count of an indictment is conceptually single, the court is not required to instruct the jury that it must be unanimous as to the means it was committed. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-2787, 889 N.E.2d 995. In <em>Gardner, </em>the defendant contended that his aggravated-burglary conviction was less than unanimous because it could differ as to the crime to be committed within the dwelling. The Ohio Supreme Court held that although there were alternative means to commit a burglary, the crime of burglary was conceptually single, and the trial court was not required to instruct for factual unanimity. Id. at \u00b6 49, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 69} Likewise here, the conceptually single crime of practicing medicine without a license provides several means by which it can be committed. Therefore, a factual-unanimity instruction was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 70} Annable next challenges his sentence and, in particular, that the trial court sentenced him to consecutive terms without making findings. Pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, the trial court was not required to make any findings on the record in order to support the imposition of the sentence. Post-<em>Foster, </em>trial courts have full discretion to impose any sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing more than the minimum sentences. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 71} In <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, the Ohio Supreme Court established a two-step procedure for reviewing felony sentences. <em>Kalish </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">In applying <em>Foster </em>to the. existing statutes, appellate courts must apply a two-step approach. First, [appellate courts] must examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. If this first prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision in imposing the term of imprisonment is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 72} A sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law where the trial court \u201cconsider[s] the purposes and principles of R.C. 2929.11, as well as the factors listed in R.C. 2929.12, * * * properly applie[s] postrelease control, and * * * sentence^] * * * within the permissible range.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18. In addition, so long as the trial court gives \u201ccareful and substantial deliberation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>relevant statutory considerations,\u201d the court\u2019s sentencing decision is not an abuse of discretion. Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">{\u00b6 73} Here, the sentences were in the statutory ranges and therefore were not contrary to law. Further, the court considered \u201call required factors of the law\u201d and found that \u201cprison is consistent with the purpose of R.C. 2929.11.\u201d Our review of the record also indicates that the court carefully deliberated upon the relevant statutory considerations and, thus, did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 74} In light of the above, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-7\">Blackmon, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b392-8\">Stewart, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\">.

However, I would vacate the theft conviction. The issue of refunds from Annable is a contract matter, not a criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 76} In <em>Orange Village v. Woolfolk </em>(Oct. 5, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 77451, 2000 WL 1474506, this court considered an analogous case in which a city brought charges against a, private snow-plow operator who took money in advance of the winter season but failed to render those services. The city charged Woolfolk with theft by deception and obtained a conviction, but this court vacated the conviction stating: \u201cSimply put, this is a contract, not a criminal case. The civil law provides adequate remedies for breached contracts * * Id. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 77} It is uncontested that Annable performed procedures on the named theft victims. They thus received in part what they paid for, even if those services were not rendered by a licensed medical doctor. This is not a case where Annable took the money and ran without performing any services whatsoever. The victims may not have received entirely what they bargained for, but any shortcomings in what was agreed to versus what was delivered is purely a matter of contract. I believe, therefore, that the theft count should be vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
