MPSS owned the premises that OPRS leased to the Getters and insured the premises through Cincinnati Insurance. In 2008, a fire broke out at the premises leased by the Getters, causing $169,719.75 in damages. Cincinnati Insurance reimbursed MPSS for the damages to the leased premises minus the $10,000 deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">{\u00b6 3} Cincinnati Insurance then brought an action in the Butler County Common Pleas Court against Robert Getter as the administrator of Joyce Getter\u2019s estate and the Getters\u2019 insurer, Auto Owners, alleging that the fire was caused by Joyce Getter\u2019s negligence and therefore Cincinnati Insurance was entitled to subrogation against her estate for the amount it had been obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>pay MPSS. Cincinnati Insurance also requested that Auto Owners be declared liable for the damages caused by Joyce Getter\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 4} Robert Getter and Auto Owners moved for summary judgment on Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s complaint, arguing that under <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Phil-Mar Corp. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 85, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330, and cases following it, such as <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Consolidated Stores Corp. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 19, 587 N.E.2d 391, the terms of the Getters\u2019 lease with OPRS relieved Joyce Getter from common-law liability for her alleged negligence. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment to Robert Getter and Auto Owners on Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s subrogation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 5} Cincinnati Insurance now appeals, raising the following as its sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff-appellant in granting defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 7} Cincinnati Insurance argues that the trial court erred in finding that the lease agreement between OPRS and the Getters relieved Joyce Getter from liability for her negligence in causing the fire that damaged the leased premises owned by MPSS, because the lease agreement contained neither a \u201csurrender clause\u201d stating that a lessee will not be held responsible at the lease\u2019s termination for certain kinds of damage, nor a provision making it clear that the lessor\u2019s insurance on the leased premises is intended to protect both the lessor and the lessee. Therefore, Cincinnati Insurance contends, the rule in <em>Phil-Mar </em>and its progeny does not apply to the Getters\u2019 lease agreement and thus the lease agreement is subject to this state\u2019s \u201cgeneral rules for contracts relieving a party from the consequences of their negligence,\u201d which include the principle that such contracts are enforceable only if they are \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d Cincinnati Insurance asserts that there is no provision in the lease agreement that \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d released Joyce Getter from the consequences of her negligence. We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">{\u00b6 8} A trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Summary judgment may be granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in its favor. <em>Ohio Valley Associated Builders &amp; Contrs. v. Rapier Elec., Inc., </em>192 Ohio App.3d 29, 2011-Ohio-160, 947 N.E.2d 1261, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">{\u00b6 9} Because Cincinnati Insurance brings this action as the subrogee of its insured, MPSS, Cincinnati Insurance can claim no rights greater than those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>MPSS has against the Getters. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Control Serv. Technology, Inc. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 801, 803, 677 N.E.2d 388. Therefore, if there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the trial court\u2019s finding that the lease agreement between the Getters and OPRS relieved Joyce Getter from her common-law liability to MPSS for her alleged negligence in causing the fire that damaged MPSS\u2019s property, then Cincinnati Insurance has no claim against the Getters or their insurer, Auto Owners.

T &amp; J Transp. &amp; Warehouse </em>(Jan. 25, 1991), Lucas App. No. L-90-097, 1991 WL 7274, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 10} The \u201cresidency agreement\u201d or lease agreement between OPRS and the Getters states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cD.

See, e.g., <em>Kay v. Pennsylvania RR. Co. </em>(1952), 156 Ohio St. 503, 46 O.O. 417, 103 N.E.2d 751, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, and <em>George H. Dingledy Lumber Co. v. Erie RR. Co. </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 236, 131 N.E. 723, paragraph one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>syllabus. However, in <em>Phil-Mar, </em>166 Ohio St. 85, 87-89, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330, the court found that certain provisions in the parties\u2019 lease agreement relieved the lessee of its common-law liability for negligence in causing a fire that damaged the lessor\u2019s property, even though there was no specific exculpatory clause in the lease that so relieved the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Philr-Mar, </em>the court looked at the words expressed in the totality of the agreement to ascertain the intent of the parties. The court found that where a lease agreement contained (1) a surrender clause requiring the lessee to return possession of the leased premises to the lessor upon the expiration or termination of the lease, with said premises being \u201c \u2018in as good condition and repair as the same shall be at the commencement of said term (loss by fire * * * excepted),\u2019 \u201d and (2) a provision requiring the lessee to pay the lessor any additional premium charged for the fire insurance on the premises that resulted from the lessee\u2019s occupancy, the lessor had relieved the lessee of liability for fire caused by the lessee\u2019s negligence, and thus the lessor had no right of recovery against the lessee. Id. at syllabus. Continuing, the court found that the lessor\u2019s insurers, being subrogated only to the lessor\u2019s rights, also had no right of recovery against the lessee, even though the insurers had compensated the lessor for the losses it sustained as a result of the lessees\u2019 negligence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 24} In support of its decision, the <em>Phil-Mar </em>court focused on the language in the lease agreement\u2019s surrender clause, which, more fully stated, required the lessee to surrender possession of the leased premises \u201c \u2018in as good condition and repair as the same shall be at the commencement of [the lease\u2019s] term <em>(loss by fire and ordinary wear and decay only </em>excepted).\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., 166 Ohio St. at 86-87, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330. The court noted that while the parties had qualified the phrase \u201cwear and decay\u201d in the surrender clause with the word \u201cordinary,\u201d they did not qualify in any way the phrase \u201closs by fire,\u201d and thus the phrase \u201closs by fire\u201d was to be given its usual and ordinary meaning, i.e., \u201cdamage resulting from fire caused by act of God, accident or negligence.\u201d Id. at 88. As a result, the court concluded that the parties \u201capparently intended to relieve the lessee from liability for any fire loss,\u201d including loss from fire caused by the lessee\u2019s negligence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">{\u00b6 25} The court also cited another provision in the lease that \u201cclearly indicated\u201d the purpose of the surrender clause was to relieve the lessee from liability for loss by fire, namely, the provision requiring the lessee to pay the lessor for any additional premium charged for the fire insurance on the premises that resulted from the lessee\u2019s occupancy of the premises. Id. at 88-89. The court, after \u201cconsidering the lease as a whole,\u201d found that it was apparent under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the circumstances of the cas\u00e9 that \u201cthe parties intended to relieve the lessee from its common-law liability to the lessor for loss by fire.\u201d Id. at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">(\u00b6 26} <em>Phil-Mar </em>was subsequently followed by the Tenth District Court of Appeals in <em>Consolidated, </em>68 Ohio App.3d 19, 587 N.E.2d 391. In that case, a lessor\u2019s premises were damaged when its lessee\u2019s employee negligently operated a forklift, causing the roof of the leased premises to collapse. Id. at 21. The lessor\u2019s insurer paid the lessor nearly $49,000 in damages for the collapsed roof and then brought a subrogation and negligence action against the lessee in common pleas court. Id. The lessee moved for summary judgment against the lessor, and the trial court granted it. Id. at 22. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the lessee, finding that the \u201cother casually\u201d exception in the \u201crepairs/surrender\u201d clause in the parties\u2019 lease agreement relieved the lessee from its common-law liability for negligence. Id. at 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 27} The \u201crepairs/surrender\u201d clause provided that the lessee \u201c \u2018shall, at its own sole cost and expense, make all repairs it deems necessary to the interior of the demised premises, including all windows, and at the end of [the lease\u2019s] term or any extension thereof, shall surrender the demised premises to [lessor] in substantially the same condition as when received, <em>ordinary wear and tear and loss or damage by fire, Acts of God, or other casualty excepted.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 23. The lease agreement also contained an \u201cinsurance\u201d clause requiring (1) the \u201c <em>\u2018[lessor] at its sole expense [to] keep the demised premises insured against loss by fire or other casualty customarily covered by a fire and extended coverage policy to the full replacement cost thereof\u2019 \u201d </em>and (2) the lessee \u201c \u2018to carry comprehensive public liability insurance naming [lessor] as an additional named insured\u2019 \u201d \u201cto insure for liability to persons or nonstructure-related property.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 28} The <em>Consolidated </em>court, citing <em>PhiV-Mar </em>for support, found that the commonly accepted definition of the term \u201cother casualty\u201d is \u201can accident or event that results from an unusual or unexpected cause,\u201d and that within the context of the lease agreement, culled from \u201creading the surrender and insurance clauses together,\u201d the term' meant <em>\u201cany </em>damage caused in <em>any </em>manner, including negligence, other than by [the lessee\u2019s] own intentional or criminal acts.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., 68 Ohio App.3d at 25, 587 N.E.2d 391. The court then found that since the lease agreement \u201cdid not specifically assess to either party the loss occasioned from an \u2018other casualty,\u2019 * * * [the loss] was to be borne by the party, under the insurance clause, which was required to obtain insurance coverage against such damage, to wit: the lessor, * * * (and therefore its subrogee * * *).\u201d Id. The court further noted that the \u201creal issue\u201d in the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u201cwhether the <em>[Phil-Mar] </em>doctrine should be extended to other nonfire-related incidents as an exception to the general principle of requiring some express exclusion of negligence,\u201d and it found that it was appropriate to do so, even though the damages in that case were caused by a collision while the damages in <em>Philr-Mar </em>were caused by a fire. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>Control Serv. Technology, Inc., </em>111 Ohio App.3d 801, 677 N.E.2d 388, the Second District Court of Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment against the lessor\u2019s insurer and in favor of the lessee, Control Service Technology (\u201cCST\u201d), on the insurer\u2019s subrogation and negligence action. The trial court had granted summary judgment to CST on the basis of a provision in the parties\u2019 lease in which the lessor agreed to restore the leased premises under certain conditions in the event of a fire or other casualty. The trial court found that this lease provision constituted \u201ca waiver of any negligence on the part of CST.\u201d Id. at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals disagreed, finding that the provision in question was ambiguous and \u201c[did] not appear to be a waiver of negligence on the part of the lessee, or at least it is not the type of waiver ordinarily relied upon to excuse a party from the results of the party\u2019s own negligence.\u201d Id. at 805, citing <em>Kay, </em>156 Ohio St. 503, 46 O.O. 417, 103 N.E.2d 751, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. The court of appeals also found that the parties\u2019 lease did not contain a surrender clause similar to the \u201crather explicit\u201d surrender clauses in <em>Phil-Mar </em>and <em>Consolidated. Control Serv. Technology </em>at 804. The court of appeals further noted that \u201cunlike the leases in <em>Phil-Mar </em>and <em>Consolidated, </em>the present lease <em>did not require that the lessor carry fire insurance, </em>nor did it specify that the lessor would be reimbursed for additional fire insurance premiums attributable to the lessee\u2019s occupancy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 31} While <em>Phil-Mar </em>and <em>Consolidated </em>are distinguishable from this case in that the lease agreement between OPRS and the Getters does not contain a surrender clause similar to the clauses in those eases or a provision requiring the Getters to share part of the costs of the fire insurance with the lessor, this case is similar to those cases in that, unlike the lease agreement in <em>Control Serv. Technology, Inc., </em>the lease agreement between the Getters and OPRS required OPRS to provide insurance on the Getters\u2019 \u201cliving unit * * *, building, grounds and equipment provided by [OPRS.]\u201d Under section E.2 of the parties\u2019 lease agreement, OPRS was obligated to \u201cprovide insurance on [the Getters\u2019] living unit (not [the Getter\u2019s] personal possessions), building, grounds and equipment provided by [OPRS,]\u201d and in the next sentence, the Getters are made \u201csolely responsible for insuring [their] personal possessions and furnishings.\u201d Any reasonable lessee in the Getters\u2019 position would have interpreted this provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>their lease agreement as meaning that OPRS was assuming responsibility for providing insurance on the building of the leased premises for risks such as accidental fires, while the lessee would be responsible for obtaining insurance coverage for his or her personal possessions and furnishings.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 32} Furthermore, we disagree with Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s assertion that the language in the surrender clause contained in Section F.2 of the lease agreement stating \u201cYou will be charged the costs of returning the unit to its original condition when you permanently vacate the unit\u201d demonstrates that the parties did not intend to relieve the Getters from common-law liability for their negligent acts. The sentence that immediately precedes the surrender clause states, \u201cAny modifications or permanent additions requested by You to Your unit (interior or exterior) must be agreed to by both You and OPRS, and will be at Your expense.\u201d When this sentence and the surrender clause are read together, the average lessee would have interpreted the surrender clause to mean that upon leaving the premises, the lessee would be responsible for undoing any modifications or \u201cpermanent additions\u201d that he or she installed, and returning the property to its original condition. Moreover, for the reasons stated earlier, a reasonable lessee in the Getters\u2019 position would have believed that under the lease agreement, it was OPRS\u2019s responsibility as the lessor to provide fire insurance for the building, and nothing in the surrender clause or the sentence immediately preceding it would have altered that belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 33} Cincinnati Insurance also argues the language in Section D.3 of the lease agreement stating \u201c[OPRS\u2019s] liability shall be only for [OPRS\u2019s] Own negligent acts or omissions, or those of [OPRS\u2019s] employees within the scope of their jobs\u201d proves that the parties did not intend for the Getters to be released from liability for their negligent acts. However, this language, also must be read in context with the sentence that immediately precedes it, which states, \u201cYou shall have the sole responsibility of providing insurance coverage for loss, damage, or theft of your personal property that You maintain in the Community.\u201d When these sentences are read together as they must be, see, e.g., <em>Saunders v. Mortensen, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 86, 2004-Ohio-24, 801 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 16 (a contract must be read as a whole, with the intent of each part gathered from a consideration of the whole), it is apparent that OPRS was merely acknowledging in this section of the lease agreement that while lessees are responsible under the lease agreement for insuring their own personal property and furnishings, instances may arise in which OPRS or one of its employees during the scope of their employment may negligently damage a lessee\u2019s personal property and furnishings, and in such instances, OPRS would be responsible for such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court stated in its decision that it was not \u201cpersuaded by [Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s] contention that the [lease agreement] does not <em>dearly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>and unequivocally </em>release [Joyce Getter] from liability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then cited the provisions of the lease agreement discussed above to refute Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s contention. The trial court\u2019s response to Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s argument makes it appear that the trial court may have believed that it was required to employ the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d standard in determining whether the lease agreement in this case relieved Joyce Getter from her common-law liability for her alleged negligence. However, the majority in <em>Phil-Mar </em>did not use the term \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d in their decision. The term is mentioned briefly in <em>Control Serv. Technology, Inc., </em>111 Ohio App.3d at 805, 677 N.E.2d 388, in a parenthetical explanation accompanying that court\u2019s citation to <em>Kay, </em>156 Ohio St. 503, 46 O.O. 417, 103 N.E.2d 751. However, as the <em>Consolidated </em>court stated, the decision in <em>Phil-Mar </em>constitutes \u201can exception to the general principle of requiring some express exclusion of negligence.\u201d <em>Consolidated, </em>68 Ohio App.3d at 25, 587 N.E.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 35} Cincinnati Insurance has also recognized this fact in its appellate brief, and thus has framed its argument on appeal by first contending that the rule in <em>Phil-Mar </em>and its progeny does not apply in this case and then asserting that the Getters\u2019 lease agreement is therefore subject to the \u201cgeneral rules for contracts relieving a party from the consequences of their negligence,\u201d including the principle that such contracts are enforceable only if they are \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d However, we have found that the lease agreement in this case does fall under the rule set forth in <em>Phil-Mar </em>and its progeny, even though the lease agreement between the Getters and OPRS differs from the one in those cases. Additionally, while the <em>Phil-Mar </em>court may not have used the term \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d the court\u2019s decision stands for the proposition that it must be clear and apparent from the terms of the lease agreement, looked at as a whole, that the parties intended to relieve the lessee from its common-law liability to the lessor for negligence. Id., 166 Ohio St. at 88-89, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 36} When the Getters\u2019 lease agreement is considered as a whole, taking into account all of the agreement\u2019s terms and the circumstances of this case, we conclude that it is clear and apparent that the parties intended to relieve Joyce Getter from her common-law liability to the lessor for negligently causing a fire that damages MPSS\u2019s property. See <em>Phil-Mar </em>at 89 and <em>Consolidated, </em>68 Ohio App.3d at 23-25, 587 N.E.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">{\u00b6 37} The dissent appears critical of the \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to which we have gone to construe the agreement as a whole in order to determine the clear intent of the parties. However, such task is often our responsibility in determining if a material question of fact truly exists. Here, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 38} Courts in this country have developed three approaches to dealing with the question whether a lessor\u2019s insurer can bring a subrogation claim against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>lessee who negligently causes a fire that damages the lessor\u2019s property, for which the insurer is obligated to reimburse the lessor. <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>757 N.W.2d 584, 589, 2008-SD-106, \u00b6 12-84. The first approach is the rule established in <em>Sutton v. Jondahl, </em>532 P.2d 478, 1975 OK.Civ.App. 2, commonly referred to as the <em>\u201cSutton </em>rule,\u201d which holds that a lessor\u2019s insurer is <em>not </em>entitled to seek subrogation against a lessee even when the lessee\u2019s negligence has caused a fire that damages the lessor\u2019s property, because the lessor and lessee are deemed to be \u201cimplied co-insureds\u201d under the landlord\u2019s fire-insurance policy. <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. </em>at \u00b6 15. The second approach, commonly referred to as the <em>\u201cAnti-Sutton </em>approach,\u201d holds that a lessor\u2019s insurer <em>is </em>permitted to bring a subrogation claim against a lessee for the lessee\u2019s negligence, absent an express or implied agreement precluding such a claim. Id. at \u00b6 21. The third approach, commonly referred to as the \u201ccase-by-case approach,\u201d requires the court to examine the lease as a whole in order to determine the parties\u2019 intent regarding the question of whom should bear the risk of loss for damage to the leased premises caused by the lessee\u2019s negligence. Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">{\u00b6 39} By virtue of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Phil-Mar, </em>166 Ohio St. 85, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330, Ohio has been viewed as a state that uses the case-by-case approach. See, e.g., <em>Dattel Family Ltd. Partnership v. Wintz </em>(Tenn.Ct.App.2007), 250 S.W.3d 883, 888. Courts that employ the case-by-case approach have found that \u201cif the landlord has communicated to the tenant an express or implied agreement to maintain fire insurance on the leased premises, absent some compelling provision to the contrary, the court can conclude that it was reasonably expected that the landlord would look only to the policy, and not to the tenant, for compensation for fire loss.\u201d <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. </em>at \u00b6 29. Conversely, courts that employ the case-by-case approach have found that \u201csubrogation may be appropriate where the lease does not require the landlord to purchase fire insurance or the lease requires the tenants to purchase their own insurance to cover liabilities resulting from their negligence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">{\u00b6 40} In this case, the parties\u2019 lease agreement expressly states that OPRS \u201cwill provide insurance on [the Getters\u2019] living unit (not [the Getters\u2019] personal possessions), building, grounds and equipment provided by [OPRS,]\u201d and in the next sentence, makes the Getters \u201csolely responsible for insuring [their] personal possessions and furnishings.\u201d As we have previously stated, any reasonable lessee in the Getters\u2019 position would have interpreted the parties\u2019 lease agreement to mean that OPRS was assuming responsibility for providing insurance on the building for risks such as accidental fires, while the lessee would be responsible for obtaining insurance coverage for his or her personal possessions and furnishings.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>{\u00b6 41} In light of the foregoing, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the Getters and Auto Owners on Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s complaint, because the terms of the parties\u2019 lease agreement relieved Joyce Getter from common-law liability for her alleged negligence in causing the fire that resulted in damage to the leased premises. See <em>Phil-Mar, </em>166 Ohio St. at 89, 1 O.O.2d 212, 139 N.E.2d 330, and <em>Consolidated, </em>68 Ohio App.3d at 23-25, 587 N.E.2d 391. Cf. <em>Control Serv. Technology, Inc., </em>111 Ohio App.3d at 807, 677 N.E.2d 388. As a result, MPSS could not have brought a negligence action against Joyce Getter\u2019s estate, and therefore Cincinnati Insurance, as MPSS\u2019s subrogee, could not bring a subrogation action against Joyce Getter\u2019s estate, either. Id. at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b837-7\">Hutzel, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b837-8\">Ringland, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-15\">.

However, regardless of whether the parties\u2019 intent must be \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d or simply \u201cclear\u201d and \u201capparent,\u201d terms which I find virtually synonymous, nothing in the majority\u2019s decision, nor anything in the lease agreement itself, indicates that the parties intended to relieve the Getters from liability as a matter of law. Therefore, because the parties\u2019 intent cannot be established as a matter of law, a question of fact remains as to whether the parties intended to relieve the Getters from their common-law liability in the case at bar. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision and would find that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Getter and Auto Owners.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
