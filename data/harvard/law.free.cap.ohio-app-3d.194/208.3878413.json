Celebrezze Jr., Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 1} Yazeed Essa, appellant, appeals his conviction for the aggravated murder of his wife, Rosemarie Essa. After a review of the record and pertinent law, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 2} On February 7, 2006, appellant was indicted by the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), accusing him of purposely, and with prior calculation and design, causing the death of Rosemarie on February 24, 2005. On October 6, 2006, authorities in Lanarca, Cyprus, arrested appellant while he was traveling under a false Lebanese passport. Appellant fought extradition in Cyprus until December 12, 2008, when the Cypriot Minister of Justice issued an official surrender warrant. Appellant was transported to Cuyahoga County on January 9, 2009, and the trial court arraigned him on January 14, 2009, setting bond at $75,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 3} A jury trial commenced on January 19, 2010, and lasted until March 8, 2010, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty of aggravated murder, as charged in the indictment. On March 10, 2010, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing, during which appellant was sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility after 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">{\u00b6 4} On February 24, 2005, Rosemarie called her long-time friend, Eva McGregor, at 1:53 p.m. while McGregor was at work and Rosemarie was driving to meet her sister at a movie. McGregor testified that Rosemarie told her that she was running late and was feeling nauseous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cShe said that she had taken a calcium pill right before she left her house. And I said, calcium. I said, When did you start taking calcium?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAnd she said, well, she was at [appellant\u2019s family, and they had a discussion that because of her age she should start to take calcium, and she said she really didn\u2019t want to take it, and she said that she was rushing out the door. He said, here, take it. Take your calcium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAnd then she said I just\u2014that I took it, and she said now, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s making me sick. * * * She said to me that she was going to call [appellant] and ask him if the calcium pill he gave her could be making her sick. Could be making her feel so nauseous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">{\u00b6 8} Shortly after Rosemarie\u2019s conversation with McGregor, Rosemarie was involved in an automobile accident. At trial, Tera Tanski testified that she witnessed Rosemarie\u2019s black Volvo veer off the road and hit another car, slow down, and veer back. Rosemarie\u2019s car was going so slowly that Tanski got out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>her own car, chased the Volvo on foot, opened Rosemarie\u2019s door, and brought the car to a stop. Rosemarie\u2019s eyes were open but glassy, and she did not speak. Tanski testified that she held Rosemarie\u2019s jaw while Rosemarie vomited on her leg and on the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 9} Thereafter, Rosemarie was rushed to Hillcrest Hospital and was pronounced dead within a half hour of her arrival at the hospital. Eric White, D.O., testified that on February 24, 2005, he treated Rosemarie at the emergency room of Hillcrest Hospital. Dr. WTiite testified that Rosemarie had arrived by ambulance and had reportedly been in a minor motor-vehicle accident. WTien Rosemarie arrived at the hospital, she had shallow breathing and erratic heartbeat, and was unresponsive; however, she had no major signs of trauma. After 30 to 40 minutes of attempting to revive Rosemarie, Dr. White saw no signs of improvement. After a discussion, appellant told Dr. White to \u201cjust call it,\u201d and Dr. White agreed to stop trying to revive Rosemarie. Dr. White stated that at the time of Rosemarie\u2019s death, there was nothing about her symptoms that indicated cyanide poisoning; however, the cause of her death was a mystery to Dr. Wdiite based on the low impact of the motor-vehicle accident and the lack of major signs of trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 10} Rosemarie\u2019s brother, Dominic DiPuccio, learned of Rosemarie\u2019s car accident when appellant called to find out if he could drop his children off at Dominic\u2019s home on the way to the hospital. Julie DiPuccio, appellant\u2019s sister-in-law, stated that appellant was in such a hurry that his daughter was not fully dressed. Wdien the DiPuccios arrived at the hospital, they learned that Rosemarie was not going to make it. As more people arrived at the hospital, the family decided to have everyone gather at Rosemarie\u2019s house. At that time, Dominic received a call from McGregor. Upon learning that Rosemarie had died, McGregor told Dominic about the conversation she had had with Rosemarie just moments before her death and Rosemarie\u2019s belief that the calcium pills caused her nausea. This information caused Dominic to demand that a full autopsy and toxicology testing be done by the county coroner the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 11} Forensic pathologist, Elizabeth Balraj, M.D., was the elected county coroner at the time David Dolinak, M.D., performed Rosemarie\u2019s autopsy on February 25, 2005. At the time of the autopsy, there was no indication of any injuries, and an internal examination showed no evidence of trauma. As a result, Dr. Balraj was unable to determine Rosemarie\u2019s cause of death at the time of her autopsy and referred the matter for toxicology screening. The normal toxicology screens did not reveal any unusual substances in Rosemarie\u2019s system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 12} On March 17, 2005, appellant voluntarily met with Detective Gary McKee of the Highland Heights Police Department and gave him a statement concerning his wife\u2019s death. McKee testified that at the time he interviewed appellant, he did not suspect that appellant had anything to do with Rosemarie\u2019s death. In the course of the interview, appellant informed McKee that Rosemarie had been taking prenatal vitamins and calcium supplements. Later that evening, McKee followed appellant to his home and retrieved Rosemarie\u2019s prenatal vitamins and calcium supplements. McKee testified that prior to appellant\u2019s handing the pills over to him, appellant asked why he was collecting the pills, and McKee responded, \u201cWell, you know my boss told me I should collect these so we can do a complete\u2014we cover all the bases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 13} Firas Essa, appellant\u2019s brother, testified that after appellant\u2019s March 17, 2005 interview with the Highland Heights Police Department, he helped appellant flee the United States. Firas testified that appellant wanted to get out of town because he was concerned that people would find out about his extramarital affairs with Marguerite Montanez and Michelle Stephens. Firas enlisted the help of his cousin, Sam Qasem, who had experience smuggling fugitives out of the country. They concocted a ruse to go to Detroit with appellant to gamble, where appellant would cross the border into Canada. To explain his absence, appellant supplied a phony story that a friend had been injured in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s cousin, Abraham Awad, accompanied the group to Detroit for what he thought would be a gambling trip. Awad rode in a car with Sam Qasem, Firas, and appellant. During the car ride, appellant explained that he was running from the authorities and why he was running:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. And did [appellant] at that time, in the car ride, indicate to you why the police asking him about [Rosemarie]\u2019s death would cause him or trigger him to want to leave the country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. He stated he was scared, that he was nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. Afraid of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. Afraid of being implicated in the death, blamed for [Rosemarie]\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. And how would he be blamed for [Rosemarie]\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2A\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. I guess they found some pills in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Z\">{\u00b621} \u201cQ. What about those pills in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. They were laced with calcium or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Calcium laced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. I\u2019m sorry, not calcium laced. Cyanide\u2014calcium pills that were cyanide laced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 25} Once in Canada, Awad arranged for appellant to fly to Lebanon, where he would be taken care of. When appellant arrived in Lebanon, he assumed the name George Khalife.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 26} On March 21, 2005, Dominic filed a missing-persons report for appellant. On April 7, 2005, Dominic received a phone call from appellant. During that conversation, appellant told Dominic, \u201cI\u2019m in a really bad place, close to Iran. I talked to my lawyer, and he told me that they got enough to put me in jail, it could be years before it\u2019s a trial, and I don\u2019t want to put my family through that, I don\u2019t want to put you guys through that.\u201d Dominic told appellant, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Your children need you.\u201d In response, appellant stated, \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 27} Douglas Rohde testified that he was employed by the Lake County Crime Lab and that on March 22, 2005, he inspected the calcium capsules that were retrieved by McKee. In the course of his inspection, Rohde determined that nine of the 56 capsules tested contained cyanide.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 28} Raymond Jorg testified that he is employed as a fingerprint examiner for the Lake County Forensic Lab and that on April 8, 2005, he examined eight capsules that contained cyanide for fingerprints. He was able to detect that three of the eight pills had some fingerprint ridges, but was unable to make a comparison to a known print.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 29} As a result of the police investigation that revealed cyanide in Rosemarie\u2019s pills, forensic pathologist, Dr. Dolinak, became concerned that cyanide was a factor in Rosemarie\u2019s death. On April 21, 2005, a more elaborate screening for signs of poison was conducted, and the test revealed 9.1 milligrams of cyanide per liter of Rosemarie\u2019s blood. Additionally, coroner investigators discovered cyanide in bits of vomit taken from Rosemarie\u2019s car. On April 22, 2005, the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office made a determination that Rosemarie had died as a result of acute cyanide intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 30} Michelle, a nurse at Akron General Medical Center, testified that she had carried on an intimate relationship with appellant beginning in October 2004. Michelle testified that appellant had been unhappy in his marriage and had planned to leave his wife. On a regular basis, appellant told Michelle that he loved her. Just days before Rosemarie\u2019s death, appellant sent Michelle a handwritten Valentine\u2019s Day card that read, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day. I can\u2019t wait to see you in this. I have my own selfish reasons for giving you this gift. Next Valentine\u2019s Day will be all ours. I love you with all my being.\u201d When Rosemarie died, appellant made a hysterical call to Michelle and asked her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>come to his house to be with him on February 24, 2005. Appellant told Michelle, \u201cYou will be the only mommy that [his children] will remember, and I bet you never expected this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 31} Marguerite testified that she was employed by appellant\u2019s company, Dish One Up, and had an on-and-off relationship with appellant. Marguerite stated that on March 17, 2005, appellant called her while she was babysitting his children at his house and told her that the police were coming to get Rosemarie\u2019s medications. Thereafter, appellant arrived at the home with Detective McKee and provided him with various pill bottles, including the calcium pills. Marguerite testified that after McKee left the house, appellant \u201cflipped out\u201d and was cussing and angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 32} Jamal Khalife testified that he has lived in Beirut, Lebanon for the past 15 years. In June 2005, Khalife was asked by his brother to pick up appellant from the airport in Beirut and take care of him. Khalife provided appellant with \u201cfive or six\u201d fake IDs and a place to stay in Beirut. While appellant was in Beirut, Khalife learned that appellant was wanted by the authorities in the United States. Khalife testified that appellant told him that he was responsible for the death of Rosemarie. Khalife stated, \u201cHe told me the whole story, from the beginning. * * * that his wife was in the home, going, I think, to a movie, and he provided two vitamin pills, and down the street she had a car accident, and she died. * * * and he ground the cyanide, refilled the pills.\u201d When asked whether appellant gave him an indication as to why he killed his wife, Khalife stated, \u201cAt the beginning I think he said something about she\u2019s cheating on him, or something like that.\u201d Khalife stated that appellant openly bragged with numerous people in Lebanon about killing his wife, and he warned appellant to keep his mouth shut, but appellant would not listen.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 33} On cross-examination, Khalife acknowledged that he had been indicted on a 29-count federal indictment in October 1994, and he received a plea to lesser charges and hoped for the possibility of a reduced sentence in exchange for his truthful testimony in appellant\u2019s case. Additionally, Khalife received immunity in connection with any of his testimony in this case and his role in harboring appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 34} Firas testified that on February 24, 2005, he was in Mexico when he received a call from his frantic brother concerning the death of Rosemarie. Firas acknowledged that he had pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence in connection with his assistance in helping appellant flee the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 35} Firas stated that appellant had had many girlfriends, including Marguerite and Michelle, and that he did not believe Rosemarie had any knowledge of appellant\u2019s affairs. Firas acknowledged that he knew appellant had purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the calcium pills for Rosemarie. However, he testified that appellant denied having any involvement in Rosemarie\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 36} On cross-examination, Firas testified that appellant was a compulsive womanizer, both before and after his relationship with Rosemarie. Firas testified that prior to their marriage, Rosemarie and appellant separated after Rosemarie learned that appellant was seeing another woman, but appellant won her back by vowing to stay faithful. Firas testified that after the couple married, appellant continued to cheat, but kept his affairs secret from Rosemarie. According to Firas, appellant was happy in his marriage and was a great father to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 37} On redirect, Firas was asked to explain a January 13, 2009 telephone recording between himself and appellant, who was in jail, in which appellant asked Firas about paying an individual \u201c$35,000 to shut up,\u201d and finding a couple of new witnesses for the prosecutors \u201cto make their heads spin.\u201d Firas explained that he made up witnesses as a ruse to throw prosecutors \u201cfor a loop\u201d and that the $35,000 had to do with a ten-year-old dispute with a girlfriend. Firas maintained that the $35,000 was not used to shut up anyone. When asked by the prosecutor if he had engaged in yet another obstruction-of-justice scheme, the trial court advised Firas of his Fifth Amendment rights. Thereafter, Firas invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and asked to consult with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 38} Thirteen days later, Firas returned to complete his testimony. Prior to taking the stand, trial counsel discussed the matter in chambers, where the state disclosed that it did not intend to bring further charges against Firas, Omar, or Abe Awad, if Firas testified truthfully concerning the conversations with his brother. Firas then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. [D]id you ever have an opportunity to talk with your brother about Rosie\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. What did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. The second trip is what you\u2019re asking me about, and that\u2019s when he admitted that he was responsible for [Rosemarie]\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. What do you mean by admitted that he was responsible for [RosemarieJ\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. I asked him if he was responsible for her death, and he said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. What did he tell you that he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. He said he put cyanide in the capsules. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-16\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. Why are you here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-17\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. To testify truthfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. And why is it important that you come here and testify truthfully today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. Because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be in violation of my plea agreement, and I could face substantial prison time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant now appeals his conviction for aggravated murder, raising 11 assignments of error for our review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 52} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that he was denied his rights to equal protection and due process when -the trial court failed to give a cautionary jury instruction regarding the testimony of Khalife and Firas. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it refused to grant his request that the court amend the standard witness-credibility instruction to include language requiring the jury to take into consideration the substantial plea agreements offered to Khalife and Firas in exchange for their testimony against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s jury instructions, the proper standard of review for an appellate court is whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction or giving an instruction constituted an abuse of discretion under the facts and circumstances of the case. See <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 68, 541 N.E.2d 443. In addition, jury instructions are reviewed in their entirety to determine if they contain prejudicial error. <em>State v. Porter </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 10, 235 N.E.2d 520.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90845, 2009-Ohio-2026, 2009 WL 1156678, \u00b6 50. To constitute an abuse of discretion, the ruling must be unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 54} In support of his position, appellant argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury similarly, if not identically, to the accomplice jury instruction in R.C. 2923.03(D). Wfiien an accomplice testifies on behalf of the state in exchange for a plea agreement, there is a possibility that the accomplice\u2019s testimony may be self-serving and biased. <em>State v. Small, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84768, 2005-Ohio-1316, 2005 WL 678116, \u00b6 16, citing <em>State v. Muntaser, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81915, 2003-Ohio-5809, 2003 WL 22455703. Therefore, R.C. 2923.03(D) requires that the court give the jury a special instruction on the credibility of accomplices, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 55} \u201cIf an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c \u2018The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude, or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c \u2018It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 58} Alternatively, appellant argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury similarly, if not identically, to Federal Sixth Circuit Jury Instruction 7.07, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c7.07 Testimony of a witness under grant of immunity or reduced criminal liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">\u2022[\u00b6 60} \u201c(1) You have heard the testimony of__You have also heard that the government has promised him _ in exchange for his cooperation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c(2) It is permissible for the government to make such a promise. But you should consider_\u2019s testimony with more caution than the testimony of other witnesses. Consider whether his testimony may have been influenced by the government\u2019s promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c(3) Do not convict the defendant based on the unsupported testimony of such witness, standing alone, unless you believe his testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">{\u00b6 63} Despite appellant\u2019s contentions, R.C. 2923.03(D) and Federal Circuit Jury Instruction 7.07 are inapplicable to the case at hand. In <em>State v. Sawyer </em>(Mar. 14, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 79197, 2002 WL 407935, this court held that where evidence presented at trial does not demonstrate that the witness acted as an accomplice, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim that the court should have given an instruction in line with R.C. 2923.03(D) is unfounded.\u201d See also <em>State v. Summers </em>(Oct. 23, 1995), Stark App. No. 94-CA-0243, 1995 WL 768590 (the instruction required by R.C. 2923.03(D) was not appropriate where the witness was not an accomplice or coconspirator); <em>State v. Carroll, </em>Clermont App. Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, 2007 WL 4555782, \u00b6 138-149 (the trial court was not required to give 2923.03(D) instruction in murder prosecution where witness was given immunity from prosecution and where witness was neither indicted nor a codefendant and did not admit taking part in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>any crime for which appellant has been indicted); <em>State v. Wellman, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-386, 2006-Ohio-3808, 2006 WL 2057895, \u00b6 58 (\u201cThe trial court properly determined that the accomplice instruction was inappropriate given that there was no evidence in the record that [the witness] and appellant were accomplices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 64} As in the foregoing cases, neither Firas nor Khalife qualified as an accomplice to the aggravated murder of Rosemarie. Appellant has provided no case law to support his position that a jury instruction similar to R.C. 2923.03(D) should be given when the witness is not an accomplice but has received a plea agreement in consideration for his testimony against the defendant. Similarly, this court is not bound to apply federal jury-instruction provisions, and appellant has failed to provide any case law in support of his position. Therefore, the trial court had no basis to apply R.C. 2923.03(D) or Federal Circuit Jury Instruction 7.07. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving the jury the standard instruction regarding witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 66} In his second and third assignments of error, appellant raises claims of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 67} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that he was denied a fair trial when the state prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing argument. Specifically, appellant contends that the prosecutor inappropriately referred to the testimony of attorney Larry Zukerman, which was previously excluded by the trial court pursuant to appellant\u2019s pretrial motion in limine. Appellant submits that the prosecutor\u2019s unsupported and misleading closing argument violated his constitutional right to a fair trial under both the Ohio and United States Constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 68} During closing arguments, over objection, the prosecutor stated the following to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cNow, he wants to tell you, or they want to tell you, well, his brother counseled him to run, or that his lawyer, he got bad legal advice. Larry Zukerman told him, you got to get out of town because you\u2019re going to get charged with capital murder. Well, the only way that Larry Zukerman would tell him about that is that the Defendant admitted to him that these pills were laced with cyanide. There\u2019s no lawyer who is going to put their ticket on the line to tell him to run unless he had significant information about the Defendant admitting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 70} \u201cDefense Counsel: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cProsecutor: \u2014that he was responsible\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cCourt: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cProsecutor: \u2014for his wife\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 74} Courts afford prosecutors wide latitude in making closing arguments. <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 141, 661 N.E.2d 1019. The touchstone of this analysis is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 91. The test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper, and if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. Further, \u201c \u2018[i]t is well settled that a party cannot complain of [an] opponent\u2019s argument to the jury, where it amounts only to a reply in kind to matters argued\u2019 by the complaining party.\u201d <em>State v. Hopkins, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-338, 2006-Ohio-232, 2006 WL 163995, \u00b6 31, quoting <em>State v. Roland </em>(Mar. 15, 1979), Cuyahoga App. No. 38393, 1979 WL 209968.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 75} Here, the prosecutor made the above statements in response to the defense attorney\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, the defense attorney attempted to minimize appellant\u2019s flight from the country by arguing that he fled only because \u201c[h]e [was] vulnerable to bad advice that he got from his brother, Firas, and his lawyer, Larry Zukerman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant misreads the context of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, which were designed to dismantle the argument that Zukerman influenced appellant to flee the country. The prosecutor did not vouch for the credibility of Firas or Khalife, violate attorney-client privilege, or intentionally misstate facts. Rather, the prosecutor merely replied to appellant\u2019s defense counsel\u2019s argument concerning Zukerman\u2019s alleged \u201cbad advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 77} Dominic DiPuccio testified that when appellant contacted him on March 17, 2005, appellant told him that he had fled the country, in part, because his attorney believed that there was enough evidence against him to support an indictment. However, there was no testimony that Zukerman advised appellant to leave the country. The comments made by the prosecutor were meant to rebut any argument that appellant relied on Zukerman\u2019s advice to flee the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 78} Assuming arguendo that the sarcasm in a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s comments was improper, appellant has failed to establish any prejudice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>statements did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 79} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct when it elicited testimony from Firas\u2019s attorney, Robert Glickman, concerning the truthfulness of Firas. On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Glickman concerning his representation of Firas. Appellant submits that the prosecutor, in his cross-examination of Glickman, caused Glickman to vouch for the veracity of Firas. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 80} The following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cProsecutor: Okay. And you\u2019re Firas Essa\u2019s attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cGlickman: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cProsecutor: Mr. Essa came in here and testified to the ladies and gentleman of the jury and told the ladies and gentleman of the jury that his brother admitted to poisoning his wife. Were you here for that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cGlickman: I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cProsecutor: Okay. And as far as when [Firas] came in here to testify, did you advise him that he needs to give complete and truthful testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cGlickman: I don\u2019t have a waiver from my client to tell you what I advised him. I will tell you I\u2019ve never advised my client not to give anything but complete and truthful testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cProsecution: At any time would you give advice to your client to come in and give false testimony to a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cGlickman: Of course not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">{\u00b6 90} Generally, the opinion of a witness as to whether another witness is being truthful is inadmissible. <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 128, 545 N.E.2d 1220. In our system of justice, it is the fact-finder, not the expert or lay witness, who bears the burden of assessing the credibility or veracity of a witness. <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 530 N.E.2d 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">{\u00b6 91} Our review of the record indicates that Glickman never testified as to whether he believed that Firas testified truthfully. Rather, he indicated only that he would never direct any client to tell anything other than the truth. Accordingly, we find that Glickman did not give any opinion regarding Firas\u2019s veracity. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Evidentiary Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 92} In assignments of error four, five, six, and seven, appellant raises numerous evidentiary challenges. These assignments of error will be considered out of order for the purposes of clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Jacks </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 200, 207, 578 N.E.2d 512. Therefore, \u201c[a]n appellate court which reviews the trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence must limit its review to whether the lower court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 107, 543 N.E.2d 1233. A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner. A reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. See generally <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 94} In his fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing evidence of his venereal disease. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 95} Prior to trial, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence relating to his venereal disease, with the explicit proviso that \u201c[i]n the event that defendant\u2019s character, as it relates to this issue, is presented by defendant, the court reserves the right to revise this ruling at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 96} On cross-examination of Firas, defense counsel elicited testimony that appellant had had many sexual relationships with women before and after his marriage and that he had been discreet about these affairs to keep them from his wife. Subsequently, the trial court ruled, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, that the fact that appellant had a venereal disease and the fact that he recklessly gave the disease to other women, including his wife, was relevant to rebut the argument that appellant was discreet about his affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 97} When a defendant opens the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence, the state may use relevant information to rebut the inference arising from that evidence. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 565 N.E.2d 549. The Ohio Supreme Court has described rebuttal evidence as follows: Rebuttal evidence, the scope of which lies within the discretion of the trial court, is that which is \u201cgiven to explain, refute, or disprove new facts introduced into evidence by the adverse party.\u201d <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 446, 700 N.E.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">{\u00b6 98} Throughout the trial, defense counsel presented testimony to the jury that Rosemarie had no knowledge of appellant\u2019s affairs, that appellant was happy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>in his marriage, and that he was a loving father. Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s assertion that the testimony relating to appellant\u2019s reckless sexual behavior was relevant to rebut defense counsel\u2019s position that appellant had been a discreet philanderer, keeping his affairs secret from his wife. As observed by the trial court, appellant\u2019s sexual behavior did not appear to be discreet, and Firas\u2019s testimony that appellant had spread his venereal disease was relevant to rebut defense counsel\u2019s position that Rosemarie was unaware of appellant\u2019s affairs. Faced with appellant\u2019s introduction of his own character through the testimony of his brother Firas, the trial court acted within its discretion by allowing evidence of appellant\u2019s reckless sexual behavior to be presented to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 99} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 100} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court should have granted a mistrial due to what he contends was improper character and opinion evidence. Specifically, appellant challenges portions of testimony offered by four of the state\u2019s witnesses. Appellant submits that his due process rights to a fair trial were denied when McGregor, Michelle, Marguerite, and Gina Hasrouni offered irrelevant and prejudicial testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 101} The trial court is in the best position to determine whether a mistrial should be declared. <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 92. Thus, the decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb that decision on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Eva McGregor</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 102} Initially, appellant complains of several statements made by McGregor during her direct examination. On direct examination, McGregor testified that Rosemarie told her that appellant gave her a venereal disease prior to their marriage. Appellant contends that this testimony is irrelevant and highly prejudicial. We disagree. The record reflects that Rosemarie broke up with appellant prior to their marriage based, in part, on appellant\u2019s having given her a venereal disease and her discovery that appellant was having an affair. This evidence was relevant and assisted the jury in understanding the relationship of appellant and Rosemarie.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 103} McGregor further testified that she and Rosemarie had lunch in January 2005 and that Rosemarie had told her a \u201cdisturbing story.\u201d Appellant contends that McGregor\u2019s discussion of the disturbing story clearly alluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>evidence concerning some anti-freeze left in Rosemarie\u2019s car that was the subject of a motion in limine and barred by the trial court from being testified about at trial. Counsel for appellant immediately objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and prevented McGregor from finishing her testimony concerning the \u201cdisturbing story.\u201d The remark was isolated, and the jury did not hear any reference to the anti-freeze story. Therefore, we find that appellant suffered no prejudice from McGregor\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 104} Next, appellant challenges McGregor\u2019s inference that she felt scared during her first encounter with appellant after Rosemarie\u2019s death and McGregor\u2019s opinion that there must have been something in the calcium pills taken by Rosemarie to cause appellant to flee the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 105} Pursuant to Evid.R. 701, a lay witness\u2019s opinion testimony is limited to those opinions or inferences that are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. <em>State v. Skidmore, </em>Mahoning App. No. 08 MA 165, 2010-Ohio-2846, 2010 WL 2501219; Evid.R. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 106} These statements were made to explain McGregor\u2019s state of mind in the days following Rosemarie\u2019s death and allowed the jury to understand why she expressed her concerns that Rosemarie\u2019s death may have been related to her taking the calcium pills given to her by appellant. The statements were relevant and were not overly prejudicial. Further, McGregor\u2019s comment regarding appellant\u2019s flight did not amount to prejudice based on the trial court\u2019s subsequent instruction on flight to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Michelle Stephens and Marguerite Montanez</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 107} Defendant next complains of the testimony of both Michelle and Marguerite that they felt hatred and disgust toward him. Appellant did not object to this testimony and has waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Tichon </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 758, 767, 658 N.E.2d 16. To constitute plain error, the error must be obvious on the record, palpable, and fundamental, so that it should have been apparent to the trial court without objection. Id. Moreover, plain error does not exist unless the appellant establishes that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the trial court\u2019s allegedly improper actions. <em>State v. Waddell </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 163, 166, 661 N.E.2d 1043. Notice of plain error is to be taken with utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 83, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 108} Based on the other evidence adduced at trial, we hold that the brief, general statements by Michelle and Marguerite that they despised and hated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>appellant were not outcome-determinative, and therefore the admission of the statements was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Gina Hasrouni</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 109} Finally, appellant complains that a mistrial was proper after Gina Hasrouni testified that due to his behavior at her funeral, she believed that appellant had killed his wife. This response was immediately struck by the trial court, and the court gave the jury instructions to disregard the comment. A jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637. Here, the trial court was in the best position to evaluate whether the testimony of Hasrouni deprived appellant of a fair trial, and its decision to deny appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 110} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 111} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court improperly allowed the introduction of bad-acts testimony in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 112} Under Evid.R. 404(B), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 113} Further, R.C. 2945.59 provides, \u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 114} Evidence of other acts by a defendant is admissible only when it tends to show one of the matters enumerated in the statute and rule and only when the evidence is relevant to prove that the defendant is guilty of the offense in question. <em>State v. Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 67 O.O.2d 174, 311 N.E.2d 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 115} Appellant points to four instances of testimony where \u201cother acts\u201d were improperly admitted by the trial court. He specifically challenges Khalife\u2019s testimony that appellant indulged in recreational drugs and prostitutes in Beirut; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Cindy Page\u2019s testimony that appellant spoke derogatorily to his wife at a Christmas party; Firas\u2019s testimony that appellant gave his wife and other women a venereal disease; and McGregor\u2019s mention of a \u201cdisturbing story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 116} As stated above, McGregor\u2019s mention of a \u201cdisturbing story\u201d was properly objected to and stricken from the record. The objection was sustained, and McGregor was prevented from discussing any facts surrounding the disturbing story for the jury. Because McGregor never disclosed the actual acts surrounding the disturbing story, we cannot find a violation of Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 117} Additionally, we find that the admissibility of the evidence concerning appellant\u2019s giving other women a venereal disease is not barred by Evid.R. 404(B). The testimony was not admitted to show that appellant acted in conformity with prior bad acts. Rather, it was properly admitted as a rebuttal to appellant\u2019s elicitation of testimony that he had acted discreetly in carrying on affairs and was generally a good husband. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 118} Similarly, appellant\u2019s argument regarding the testimony of Cindy Page lacks merit because her testimony was used to rebut evidence presented by defense counsel that appellant and Rosemarie had a good marriage. Rebuttal evidence, the scope of which lies in the discretion of the trial court, is that which is given to \u201cexplain, refute, or disprove new facts introduced into evidence by the adverse party.\u201d <em>McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 446, 700 N.E.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 119} During his case, appellant called Rosemarie\u2019s close friend, Katie Touhey, to testify that Rosemarie seemed happy in her marriage. Appellant used Touhey\u2019s testimony to present to the jury an impression of marital harmony. To rebut this evidence, the trial court allowed Cindy Page to testify to having been at an Akron General Hospital Christmas party with appellant, Rosemarie, and Page\u2019s Saudi Arabian husband. Page testified that Rosemarie witnessed the two men speaking Arabic together and asked Page\u2019s husband where he was from. In response, appellant told Rosemarie that \u201cno one was talking to her.\u201d Page testified, \u201c[appellant] told her to shut up and go sit down.\u201d Rosemarie, humiliated, put up no resistance, and just went and sat down.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 120} We find that Page\u2019s testimony did not fall within the Evid.R. 404(B) category of evidence. Rather, the testimony was proper rebuttal evidence used to refute and disprove the new facts introduced by defense counsel through the testimony of Touhey. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony of Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 121} Finally, appellant submits that Khalife\u2019s testimony that appellant indulged in recreational drug use and prostitutes during his time in Beirut was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>irrelevant and in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). In the absence of an objection, we limit our review of the prosecutor\u2019s comments to that standard established for plain error. In light of the other evidence adduced at trial, we hold that the brief, general statements by Khalife that appellant had engaged in irrelevant bad acts was not outcome-determinative, and therefore, the admission of the statements was not plain error. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 118, 666 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 122} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 123} In his seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it allowed McGregor to testify about the conversation she had with Rosemarie just moments before Rosemarie\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 124} A trial court possesses broad discretion with respect to the admission of evidence, including the discretion to determine whether evidence constitutes hearsay and whether it is admissible hearsay. <em>State v. Graves, </em>Lorain App. No. 08CA009397, 2009-Ohio-1133, 2009 WL 653091, \u00b6 4. Whether or not the declarant is available as a witness, Evid.R. 803(1) permits the admission of statements \u201cdescribing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter unless circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">{\u00b6 125} Therefore, of \u201ccentral concern to the admission of statements of present sense impression is the temporal proximity of statements to the event at issue. This is so because \u2018[t]he principle underlying this hearsay exception is the assumption that statements or perceptions describing the event and uttered [closely in time] to the event, bear a high degree of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graves, </em>2009-Ohio-1133, 2009 WL 653091, at \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Cox v. Oliver Mach. Co. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 28, 37, 534 N.E.2d 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">{\u00b6 126} The key to the statement\u2019s trustworthiness is the spontaneity of the statement; it must be either contemporaneous with the event or be made immediately thereafter. A minimal lapse of time between the event and statement indicates an insufficient period to reflect on the event perceived; - the declarant\u2019s reflection would detract from the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. <em>State v. Ellington, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84014, 2004-Ohio-5036, 2004 WL 2340287, \u00b6 10. \u201cWhen the statement is the \u2018product of reflective thinking rather than spontaneous perception,\u2019 Evid.R. 803(1) does not apply.\u201d <em>Graves </em>at \u00b6 4, citing <em>State v. Simmons, </em>Summit App. No. 21150, 2003-Ohio-721, 2003 WL 356281, \u00b6 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>{\u00b6 127} The record reflects that Rosemarie indicated to McGregor that she was feeling nauseous and believed it was being caused by a calcium pill that appellant had told her to take earlier in the day. Rosemarie personally observed appellant give her the calcium pill, then personally experienced her own nausea setting in, all of which she recounted to McGregor as it was happening.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 128} Based upon the circumstances presented, this court cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this testimony. McGregor\u2019s testimony related to the feeling of sickness that Rosemarie was suffering at the time she made the statement. Further, the proximity in time between appellant\u2019s giving Rosemarie the calcium pill and Rosemarie\u2019s statement indicates its trustworthiness. <em>State v. Travis, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 626, 2006-Ohio-787, 847 N.E.2d 1237. Therefore, McGregor\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to the present-sense-impression exception to the hearsay rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 129} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Expert Testimony VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">{\u00b6 130} In his eighth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it allowed Gregg McCrary, retired Special Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), to testify as an expert when his testimony invaded the sole province of the jury deciding this case. Appellant submits that although McCrary was never directly asked to give his opinion about his special knowledge as a crime-scene analyst, he indirectly gave his opinion that appellant had a narcissistic personality and had staged his wife\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 131} McCrary worked as a special agent for the FBI for approximately 25 years. During that time, he took several graduate courses in criminal justice, and he received a master\u2019s degree in psychological services. He served his last ten years with the FBI in the behavioral-science unit, investigating cases and conducting research on violent criminal behavior to improve the operational effectiveness of the law-enforcement community. According to McCrary, the behavioral-science unit was developed in order to understand how people commit crimes, what motivates them to commit crimes, and how they get away with committing crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">{\u00b6 132} The Ohio Supreme Court has clearly held that police officers may qualify as expert witnesses where they possess specialized knowledge that will assist the fact-finder. <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038. In <em>Drummond, </em>the court held that a police officer with specialized knowledge of gangs and gang symbols could properly testify as an expert. As in <em>Drummond, </em>McCrary\u2019s specialized knowledge regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>staging of crime scenes was helpful to the fact-finder and relevant to the issues litigated throughout appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 133} At trial, McCrary was permitted to testify about his experience and specialization in the fields of crime-scene analysis, crime classification, and victimology. Specifically, McCrary discussed his knowledge and expertise with crime-scene \u201cstaging.\u201d McCrary defined staging as the \u201cpurposeful alteration of the crime or the crime scene to suggest some other motive, false motive.\u201d According to McCrary, offenders will stage a scene of a crime so that they will not immediately become the primary suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 134} Appellant relies on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Garcia, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79917, 2002-Ohio-4179, 2002 WL 1874535. In <em>Garcia, </em>the prosecution attempted to use McCrary as an expert witness; however, this court held that it was improper for McCrary to testify that in his expert opinion, the fire that had killed the defendant\u2019s children had had all the elements of being an arson for profit. In reaching that conclusion, this court held that such expert opinion testimony improperly invaded the jury\u2019s province. Id. However, the case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Garcia. </em>Here, McCrary did not offer any conclusions or opinions concerning appellant\u2019s possible motives in this case, and McCrary did not offer any opinions as to whether he believed appellant had staged Rosemarie\u2019s death. Rather, McCrary merely explained the concept of \u201cstaging\u201d and identified situations where staging may occur and why a defendant would attempt to stage a crime scene. We find that this information did not invade the jury\u2019s province. See <em>State v. Stevens </em>(Tenn.2002) 78 S.W.3d 817 (the Tennessee Supreme Court held that McCrary could testify about the staging of the crime scene, but was prohibited from testifying about the defendant\u2019s probable motives).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 135} Appellant also argues that it was improper for McCrary to define narcissistic personality disorder under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM-IV\u201d). The DSM-IV is a book of all the major mental disorders or mental illnesses that psychologists and psychiatrists have defined over the years. Evid.R. 803(18) provides that the following is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule\u201d: \u201cTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert witness in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.\u201d McCrary testified that he relied on the DSM-IV in his training and experience, and the definition of Narcissistic Personality Disorder was relevant to McCrary\u2019s testimony concerning the theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of \u201cstaging\u201d and crime classifications. Pursuant to Evid.R. 803(18), we find that the trial court acted within its discretion when it allowed McCrary to define Narcissistic Personality Disorder under the DSM-IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 136} Appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Manifest Weight</p>\n<p id=\"AJt\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 137} In his ninth assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction for aggravated murder was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 138} The court in <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, has set forth the proper test to be used when addressing the issue of manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Martin </em>stated: \u201cThe court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d Id. at 175. Moreover, it is important to note that the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The power to reverse a judgment of conviction as against the manifest weight must be exercised with caution and in only the rare case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. <em>Martin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 139} In determining whether a judgment of conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, in <em>State v. Wilson </em>(June 9,1994), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 64442 and 64443, 1994 WL 258662, we adopted the guidelines set forth in <em>State v. Mattison </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 23 OBR 43, 490 N.E.2d 926, syllabus. These factors, which this court noted are in no way exhaustive, include (1) [knowledge that even a] reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible [as true]; (2) whether evidence is uncontradicted; (3) whether a witness was impeached; (4) [attention to] what was not proved; (5) the certainty of the evidence; (6)the reliability of the evidence; (7) [the extent to which] a witness\u2019 [may have a personal interest to advance or defend his or her]testimony; and (8) [the extent to which] the evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting or fragmentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">{\u00b6 140} A reviewing court will not reverse a verdict where the trier of fact could reasonably conclude from substantial evidence that the state has proved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">{\u00b6 141} R.C. 2903.01(A) states: \u201cNo person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 2901.22(A), \u201c[a] person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result.\u201d Intent may be determined from the surrounding facts and circumstances. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 35, 38, 10 O.O.3d 78, 381 N.E.2d 637. An intent to kill may be presumed when the natural and probable consequence of an act is to produce death, and the jury may conclude from the surrounding circumstances that there was an intention to kill. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 213, 53 O.O. 96, 118 N.E.2d 517. It is presumed that a person intends the natural, reasonable, and probable consequences of his voluntary acts. <em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 8 O.O.3d 181, 375 N.E.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 142} Based on the forthcoming, we find that appellant\u2019s conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 143} The record indicates that appellant was a prominent doctor who demonstrated his knowledge of cyanide poisoning by giving Grand Rounds courses at the Akron General Hospital addressing the subject. He also had access to cyanide through his well-documented connections to the jewelry industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 144} The testimony of Firas established that just months before Rosemarie\u2019s death, appellant embarked on an affair with his mistress, Michelle. While dating Michelle, appellant sent her a Pajamagram proclaiming that \u201c[n]ext Valentine\u2019s Day will be all ours.\u201d The evidence presented at trial indicates that in the days leading to Rosemarie\u2019s death, there were signs that she had confronted appellant about his affair. Analysis conducted on the Essa family computer found that two days before Rosemarie\u2019s death, someone in the home typed an Internet search for \u201cMichelle Madeline.\u201d Testimony at trial proved that appellant was at work when this search was conducted. The night before her death, Rosemarie made a burst of telephone calls between 11:23 and 11:30 p.m. to appellant\u2019s cell phone, pager, and messaging service, followed by two longer telephone conversations around 2:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 145} Further, the record indicates that prior to leaving her home to meet her sister at the movie theater, Rosemarie was handed a calcium pill by the appellant, who insisted that she take it. While driving to the movie theater, Rosemarie called her long-time friend McGregor and confided to her that she thought the calcium pills were the cause of her current nausea.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 146} On March 17, 2005, four weeks after Rosemarie\u2019s death, appellant agreed to meet with Detective McKee. At trial, McKee stated that the interview was benign, routine, and nonaccusatory. In the course of that interview, McKee confiscated the calcium pills taken by Rosemarie on the day of her death. Within hours, appellant fled the country and began a new life in Beirut, where he used forgery and disguises to maneuver throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 147} Just days after appellant\u2019s flight from the United States, the Lake County Crime Lab inspected the calcium capsules that were retrieved from appellant\u2019s home and determined that nine of the 56 capsules tested contained cyanide. Appellant indicated that these were the pills that Rosemarie took on the day of her death, and the testimony of McGregor indicated that it was appellant who gave Rosemarie the calcium pill that morning. Thereafter, an additional toxicology screen performed by the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office revealed 9.1 milligrams of cyanide per liter of Rosemarie\u2019s blood. As a result, the coroner\u2019s officer concluded that Rosemarie died of cyanide poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 148} Finally, Firas, Khalife, and Awad testified that appellant had personally admitted to each of them, on separate occasions, that he killed Rosemarie by putting cyanide in her calcium supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 149} We are unable to conclude that this is the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. The state presented competent, credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination that appellant purposely, and with prior calculation and design, caused the death of Rosemarie. The jury was in the best position to weigh the credibility of the witnesses brought before it, and we find that the jury did not clearly lose its way when it found appellant guilty of aggravated murder. Therefore, appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 150} Appellant\u2019s ninth assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">R.C. 2967.191</p>\n<p id=\"AdN\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 151} In his tenth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it failed to grant him credit for time served between the date of his arrest in Cyprus on October 7, 2006, and his arrival in the Cuyahoga County Jail on October 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 152} In <em>State v. Jordan </em>(Aug. 10, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76488, 2000 WL 1144778, this court held, \u201cR.C. 2967.191 provides that a prison term shall be reduced by the number of days confined which arose out of the offense for which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced. Appellant is not entitled to credit for time served in another jurisdiction for another offense.\u201d Id. at *1, citing <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>rel. Gillen v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 381, 650 N.E.2d 454; <em>State v. McWilliams </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 398, 710 N.E.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 153} In the case at bar, appellant was not arrested or held in Cyprus solely on the underlying aggravated-murder charge. Initially, the Cypriot National Police arrested appellant for violating Cypriot laws against using a false passport and impersonation. Appellant was then held pursuant to a federal \u201cUnlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution\u201d warrant (\u201cUFAP warrant\u201d). The federal UFAP warrant remained pending during the entire period that appellant was imprisoned in Cyprus. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that he was held in Cyprus solely on the underlying charge. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying his request for credit for time served for the time he spent fighting extradition charges in Cyprus.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 154} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s tenth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Cumulative Errors XI</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 155} In his 11th assignment of error, appellant argues that the cumulative errors that occurred in his case deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 156} \u201c \u2018It is true that separately harmless errors may violate a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial when the errors are considered together. In order to find \u201ccumulative error\u201d present, we first must find that multiple errors were committed at trial. We then must find a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the combination of the separately harmless errors.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89371, 2008-Ohio-1404, 2008 WL 803034, \u00b6 62, quoting <em>State v. Djuric, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87745, 2007-Ohio-413, 2007 WL 274373.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 157} Specifically, appellant contends that the multiple errors raised in his previously discussed assignments of error form the basis of his cumulative-errors argument. Based on our discussion in the previous assigned errors, we find that appellant was not denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. Consequently, having found no errors regarding appellant\u2019s pivotal complaints in this case, we find that the doctrine of cumulative errors is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 158} Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s 11th assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-13\">Jones and Gallagher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Appellant\u2019s Assignments of Error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>I. \u201cThe appellant was denied his rights to equal protection and due process under both the Ohio and United States Constitutions when the trial court failed to give a cautionary jury instruction regarding the testimony of Jamal Khalife and Firas Essa.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">II. \u201cThe appellant was denied a fair trial in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution when the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">III. \u201cThe appellant was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution when the prosecution elicited testimony from Firas Essa\u2019s attorney that Firas Essa testified truthfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">IV. \u201cThe appellant\u2019s due process rights were violated when the trial court failed to declare a mistrial after the prosecution elicited inadmissible character and opinion testimony regarding the appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">V. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State of Ohio [to] elicit testimony that the appellant had a venereal disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">VI. \u201cThe appellant was denied due process of law and a fair trial when the trial court permitted evidence of other alleged bad acts pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">VII. \u201cThe appellant\u2019s confrontation rights under the state and federal constitution were violated by the admission of hearsay statements of Rosemarie Essa through Eva McGregor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">VIII. \u201cThe trial court erred when it allowed a crime scene analyst to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">IX. \u201cThe conviction for aggravated murder was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">X. \u201cThe trial court miscalculated the appellant\u2019s jail time credit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">XI. \u201cThe cumulative errors that occurred in the appellant\u2019s case deprived him of a fair trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">.
