The defendant hired his own daughter to teach the summer school, and refused to let the teachers board with Sargent, but boarded them himself, and took therefor, from the school money in his hands, one dollar and fifty cents per week. At the annual meeting of the district in March, 1863, the defendant made a report of his expenditures, which report the district refused to accept. This action was brought to recover the money retained by him for the board of the teachers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\"><em>Pike </em>&amp; Barnard, for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApVC\">cited <em>School Dist. </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>25 N.

Stats., provides that it shall be the duty of the prudential committee to select and hire teachers for the district, provide for them board, furnish necessary fuel, &amp;c. To provide board for the teachers was an official duty expressly imposed upon the defendant by statute, and the vote of the district relating to that subject was an act of usurpation and void as an attempt to repeal an act of the legislature. The concurrence of the defendant in such an attempt would be immaterial, and his refusal to comply with the vote of the district is not sufficient to sustain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
