The sheriff was commanded to attach the goods or estate of Stillman Griffin of Hartford, in the county of Windsor, and State of Vermont, &amp;c., and summon him, &amp;c., to answer to the inhabitants of the town of Lebanon, in the county of Grafton, in a plea of the case, for that whereas Mary Griffin of Lebanon, &amp;e., on <em>the day </em>of the date of this .writ, and for a long time previous, to wit, for the space of five years last past, at said Lebanon, had fallen into distress within said town of Lebanon, and then and there stood in need of immediate relief, and the defendant, being the son and near relative of the said Mary Griffin, and being of sufficient ability, having neglected and refused to furnish suitable provision and maintenance for the said Mary Griffin; the said plaintiffs then and there furnished, provided, laid out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and expended a large sum of money, to wit, three hundred dollars, for food, (brink, washing, lodging, clothing, nursing, and other necessaries, found and provided by the said plaintiffs, for the said Mary Griffin, at the defendant\u2019s request, and for the immediate relief and comfort of the said Mary Griffin, of which said several premises the said defendant had notice, whereby the said defendant became liable, and, in consideration thereof, then and there promised the plaintiffs to pay them the same sum on demand, yet though requested, has not paid the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">There were other counts not materially variant from this, so far as the questions raised in the case are concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">The defendant appeared and demurred to this declaration, for the following among other causes:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">1. Said action, being brought by the inhabitants of the town of Lebanon, and not\u00bbby the town as a corporation, is not brought by, nor in the name of, any party or parties, legally competent in law to bring or maintain the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">2. The declaration does not allege that a notice in writing, signed by the overseers of the poor of said town, stating the sums expended for the support of the pauper in question, nor notice of any kind, was ever given to the defendant, nor serv\u00e9d upon him in the manner required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-9\">3.

The statute was evidently intended for the benefit of other towns in this State, and for persons liable to contribute who are citizens. As to the citizens of other States, made liable under the humane provisions of the statute, another and different rule applies. All that the law can require is to give the party such notice as is necesGary in other cases in ordinary actions of assumpsit, to wit, by demand, by process, and by specification, and to be shown as matter of evidence under the general issue, as in other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The objection that the defendant resides out of the State involves the whole'issue before the court. If it is settled by precedent upon mature investigation, that a citizen of another State is exempt from liability in a case like the present, then the remedy in this jurisdiction fails, and the cause is at an end. Then, it becomes a question of the utmost importance, and should be carefully considered, and if it should be determined that a party is liable in such case, then the statute provision for notice is inapplicable, and the objection is groundless.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b561-4\">Bell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4B\">It must be regarded as settled, that there is, at common law, no legal obligation to support a parent. <em>Reeves, </em>(Dom. Rel. 284,) says \"the statute of this State (Connecticut) makes it the duty of parents to support their children, and grand-parents, their grand-children, children, their parents, and grand-children, their grand-parents.\u201d This statute imposes on such relatives obligations unknown to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">This question arose in the case of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>16 Johns. 281, where it was held, that \"there is no common law obligation, by which a child is liable to support an infirm and indigent parent; but the liability of the child is created solely by the statute, and therefore the law does not imply a promise from the child to pay for necessaries, furnished without his request to an indigent parent, and the natural obligation can only be enforced in the mode pointed out by the actand Spencer, J. said: \u201cThe liability of a child to support its parents, who are infirm and destitute, or aged, is wholly created by statute, and it has been truly said that the statute imposes on such relatives duties unknown to the common law.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>Dom. Rel. 284; 1 Black. Com. 448. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Munden, </em>1 Stra. 190, Pratt, C. J., said with the concurrence of the court: \u201cBy the law of nature a man was bound to take care of his own father and mother, but there being no temporal obligation to enforce that law of nature, it was found necessary to establish it by act of parliament;\"\u2019 and he adds what equally applies in the present case: \u201cNow the duty of a child of sufficient ability to maintain its poor and destitute parents, being an imperfect one, not enforced by the common law, and the statute having prescribed the manner in which it is to be enforced, and the extent of the liability, the statute remedy is the only one to be resorted to. Then, the consequence necessarily follows, that no one, who has afforded relief to indigent persons, from motives of humanity, or from any other consideration, can maintain a suit upon an implied contract, against the children of such parents, arising merely from the duty which such a person owes to its parents to support them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">It was urged on the argument, that \u201cthe court would intend a request from the moral duty operating on the child.\u201d But the court held otherwise, and that the facts negatived the idea of a request. Kent, (2 Com. 208,) after stating the New York statute, says, this is the only legal provision made, (for the common law makes none,) to enforce a plain obligation of the law of nature. 16 John. 281; 1 Stra. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The promise of a son to pay for past expenditures in relief of an indigent parent, is not binding in law. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Wyman, 3 </em>Pick. 207; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>7 Conn., 57; S. P. 1 Bouv. Inst. sec. 328; 1 Walk. Am. Law, 260, sec. 109. It is otherwise by the civil code of Louisiana, Art. 245,and by the code Napoleon, secs. 205-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The declaration in this case clearly does not show a cause of action within the statute, the notice required by the statute not being alleged. Blit the declaration, in each of its counts, alleges that the relief and supplies were furnished by the plaintiffs at the request of the defendant. If an express request can be shown, there does not seem to us to be any doubt that the defendant would be liable; and such proof would be competent and admissible under either of these counts. If the plaintiffs should be unable to prove an express request before the supplies were furnished, they must fail in their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In <em>Ehle </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>24 Wend. 96, it was held that a mere moral or conscientious obligation, unconnected .with a prior legal or equitable claim, is not a sufficient consideration to support a promise; and Bronson, J., said: \"Services voluntarily rendered, though they may be beneficial, impose no legal obligation upon the party benefited. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. Jackson, 20 Johns. 28. The service must be rendered on request, <em>Dunbar </em>v. Williams, 10 Johns. 259; and, in counting upon a past consideration, a request must in general be alleged. <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 Johns. 87; Parker <em>v. </em>Crane, 6 Wend. 647. It is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of a request. This, like most other facts, may be established by presumptive evidence, and the beneficial character of the services, though not enough, when standing alone, may be very important in a chain of circumstances tending to establish the presumption. 1 Saund. 264, n. 1; 14 Johns. 378, 188. It has been said that a moral obligation is a sufficient consid\u00e9ration to support an express promise. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Eden, </em>2 Cain. 150; 14 Johns. 378; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Muggeridge, </em>5 Taun. 37 . But this must'be taken with some qualification. The moral obligation to pay a debt, barred by the statute of limitations .or an insolvent\u2019s discharge, or to pay a debt contracted during infancy or coverture, will be a good consideration for an express promise, but a merely moral or conscientious obligation, unconnected with any prior legal or equitable claim, is not enough. 3 B. &amp; P. 249, n; <em>Smith v. Ware, </em>13 Johns. 257; Lawes\u2019 Pl. Asst. 54; 16 Johns. 283. But here the defendant was under no legal obligation whatever. Nothing had been done at his request, or for his benefit. The plaintiff has often failed upon an express promise in much stronger cases than this. <em>Hunt v. Bate, </em>Dyer, 272; Frear <em>v. Hardenbergh, </em>5 Johns. 272; Smith <em>v. Ware, </em>13 Johns. 257.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In <em>Mills v. Wyman, </em>3 Pick. 207, it was held that the general position, that a moral obligation is a sufficient consid\u00e9ration for an express promise, is to be limited, in its application, to cases where a good or valuable consideration has once existed. Thus, where a son, who was of full age, had ceased to be a member of his father\u2019s family, was suddenly taken sick among strangers, and, being poor and in distress, was relieved by the plaintiff, and afterwards the father wrote to the plaintiff pro m~ ising to pay him the expenses incurred, it was held that such promise would not sustain an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>So, in <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>15 Pick. 159, it was held that the liability of a father, under the statute, to support his son, who is unable to support himself, does not accrue until proceedings have been had pursuant to the statute. Consequently, furnishing supplies to the son, before such proceedings have been had, is not a benefit to the father, so as to constitute a legal consideration for his promise, made after the supplies were furnished, to pay for them. If supplies were furnished to defendant\u2019s son gratuitously, a verbal promise would be valid, so far as the statute of frauds is concerned, for it would not be the debt of another. The judge says, there is no evidence in the case, from which a jury would be warranted in finding that the plaintiff made the supplies to the son at the father\u2019s request, and, unless such request were proved, and the credit were given to the father originally, he would not be legally liable to pay for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We regard the decision in <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>43 N. H. 396, as settling the question, that where a party relies upon the provisions of a statute, on which alone his claim or right depends, he must show a compliance with the terms and conditions of the statute. It is not enough that he shows he did all that was in his power to comply with them. See authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">According to the practice, which has for a long time existed in this State, both in the language of charters, and in- the general laws, as well as in legal proceedings, a town corporation is described as \"the town of L.\u201d and not, as in some other jurisdictions, \"the inhabitants of the town of L.\u201d The description of the plaintiffs is manifestly defective. In the case of public corporations created by public laws, the court is officially to take notice of the corporate character, and, by our law, \"no writ, declaration, * or other proceeding in the courts, or course of justice, shall be abated, quashed, or reversed, for any error or mistake, where the person or ease may be rightly understood by the court, and courts may on motion order amendment in any such case.\u201d We cannot fail to see that the town of Lebanon is the party intended to be described as the plaintiff, and, on motion, the error may be corrected by an amendment. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>28 N. H. 284; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>42 N. H. 553; <em>Winnipisseogee, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Young, </em>40 N. H. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We are unable to see that it is at all material to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, that the defendant is not an inhabitant of the State, nor that the pauper has no legal settlement in Lebanon. The duty of the overseers of the poor is to relieve all persons in their town, who stand in need, whether they have a settlement there or not. Rev. Stat. ch. 66, sec. 1. And the duty of relations to support their relatives within the prescribed degrees, is unqualified, except by the course of proceeding prescribed by the law. <em>lb. </em>sec. 8, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\"><em>The demurrer is overruled. Plaintiff has leave to </em>amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
