Prior to execution of the stipulation, the parties deleted a provision which would have required the father to pay 96% of their children\u2019s school transportation expense. The Hearing Officer erred in giving effect to this provision and finding that the father was responsible for payment of such expenses <em>(see, Wilson v Neppell, </em>253 AD2d 493; <em>Joseph v Creek &amp; Pines, </em>217 AD2d 534; <em>Wuestenhoefer v </em>Friedlander/<em>Wuestenhoefer, Inc,, </em>213 AD2d 632; <em>Aguirre v City of New York, </em>214 AD2d 692; <em>Matter of Zaremba v Interface Flooring Sys., </em>195 AD2d 471; <em>Torsiello v Torsiello, </em>188 AD2d 523).
