However, the amount awarded by the Supreme Court was excessive. Weekly alimony in the sum of $750 will enable the former wife to meet all of her demonstrated needs, pay off her tax arrears, and address her transportation problems. Similarly, while an award of counsel fees was warranted <em>(see, </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 [b]; <em>see, DeCabrera v Cabrera-Rosete, </em>70 NY2d 879), the Supreme Court\u2019s award was excessive to the extent indicated. Ritter, J. P., Joy, S. Miller and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
