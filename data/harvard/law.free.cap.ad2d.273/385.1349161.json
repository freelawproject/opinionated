The factors to be considered when computing such an award include \u201cthe parties\u2019 ability to pay, the nature and extent of the services rendered, the complexity of the issues involved, and counsel\u2019s experience, ability, and reputation\u201d <em>(Matter of Olesh v Auerbach, </em>227 AD2d 406, 407). Another factor to be considered is the \u201cresources of the party seeking an award\u201d <em>(Matter of Getman v Getman, </em>156 AD2d 686, 687). Based upon this record, the counsel fee award was appropriate (see, Family Ct Act \u00a7 438 [b]; see <em>also, </em>e.g., <em>Matter of Mitchell v Mitchell, </em>209 AD2d 620; <em>Matter of Jurs v Jurs, </em>191 AD2d 564).
