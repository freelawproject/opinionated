As a result, the Supreme Court properly denied his motion to compel the petitioners to make further repairs pursuant to the stipulation until after resolution of all of the causation issues in a related tort action commenced by Barry against the petitioners <em>(see, Villatoro v Talt, </em>269 AD2d 390; <em>288/98 W. End Tenants Corp. v Mosesson, </em>144 AD2d 305; <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v Industrial Scrap Processing Corp., </em>97 AD2d 532; <em>see also, Ehrenpreis v Klein, </em>260 AD2d 532; <em>Terranova v Secured Capital Corp., </em>250 AD2d 835). Bracken, J. P., Ritter, Altman and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n<opinion><p id=\"AB0\">In a proceeding pursuant to General City Law \u00a7 20 (22), <em>inter alia, </em>to direct Augustine Barry to permit the petitioners to enter his house to perform structural repairs so that work on a nearby construction project could resume, Augustine Barry appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Giaccio, J.), dated March 10, 1999, which denied his motion pursuant to CPLR 2104 to compel the petitioners to make further repairs to his house in accordance with a stipulation of settlement between the parties.</p><p id=\"b424-3\">Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
