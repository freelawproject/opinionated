The plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a summons with notice in April 1997 alleging that Desai was negligent in failing to diagnose cancer of the bladder. On September 15, 1993, Martinez had filed a petition for liquidation under chapter 7 of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code (11 USC) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. By order of that court (Berk, J.), dated December 28, 1993, Martinez was released from all dischargeable debts. By notice of motion dated August 11, 1998, Desai moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue because Martinez failed to properly list on his liquidation petition the present medical malpractice action, which, according to Desai, accrued as early as January of 1992.</p><p id=\"b491-8\">The Bankruptcy Code broadly defines the property of a debtor to include causes of action existing at the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy action <em>(see, </em>11 USC \u00a7 541 [a] [1]; <em>Weitz v Lewin, </em>251 AD2d 402). Causes of action which accrue prior to the close of the bankruptcy proceedings, and which were neither abandoned nor administered in the case, nor the subject of a court order, remain property of the bankruptcy estate and the plaintiff loses the capacity to sue on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>behalf with respect thereto <em>(Schepmoes v Hilles, </em>122 AD2d 35, 36; <em>see, </em>11 USC \u00a7 554 [d]; <em>Ervolino v Scappatura, </em>162 AD2d 654; <em>Quiros v Polow, </em>135 AD2d 697). There are issues of fact as to whether this action accrued prior to the close of the bankruptcy proceedings. O\u2019Brien, J. P., Altman, McGinity and Smith, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
