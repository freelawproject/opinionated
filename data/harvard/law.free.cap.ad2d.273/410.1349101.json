Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [5]).</p><p id=\"b454-10\">The defendants\u2019 remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Joy, J. P., Friedmann, Krausman and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
