A <em>Ventimiglia </em>hearing <em>(People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350) is an ancillary hearing at which a defendant has the right to be present when he may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201csomething valuable to contribute\u201d <em>(People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 456). In <em>People v Spotford </em>(85 NY2d 593), for example, the <em>Ventimiglia </em>hearing involved four uncharged crimes dating back to 1981 and the defendant was in the best position to deny or controvert the allegations. In contrast, the sidebar colloquy in this case involved a legal discussion of whether a witness\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the same type of gun used in the subject incident was more prejudicial than probative, and this testimony had already been heard in the defendant\u2019s presence. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the defendant\u2019s presence at the sidebar conference \u201c \u2018[would have] helpfed] to ensure that the court\u2019s determination [was] not <em>* * * </em>predicated on the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cunrebutted view of the facts\u201d <em>(People v Ortega, </em>78 NY2d 1101, 1103)\u2019\u201d <em>(People v Spotford, supra, </em>at 597; <em>see, People v Dokes, </em>79 NY2d 656, 661).</p><p id=\"b460-3\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction of robbery in the first degree is unpreserved for appellate review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [5]).</p><p id=\"b460-4\">The sentence imposed was not excessive <em>(see, People v Suitte, </em>90 AD2d 80). O\u2019Brien, J. P., Joy, Luciano and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
