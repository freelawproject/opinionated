With respect to the former claim, plaintiff failed to make the requisite showing that there was a factual issue as to whether defendants intentionally and without justification procured a breach of the subject contract <em>(see, Lama Holding Co. v Smith Barney, </em>88 NY2d 413, 424), and with respect to the latter claim, plaintiff failed to make the requisite showing that there was a factual issue as to whether the activity alleged to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tute interference with its prospective business relations was unlawful or that defendants\u2019 sole motive in engaging in such activity was to injure plaintiff (see, <em>Matter of Pamilla v Hospital for Special Surgery, </em>223 AD2d 508).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The IAS Court, in adjudicating defendant landlord\u2019s counterclaims for rent, late charges and attorneys\u2019 fees, determined that it was the October 31, 1998 expiration date contained in defendant\u2019s cancellation notice and not the date of plaintiff\u2019s surrender of the demised premises that was controlling with respect to plaintiff\u2019s obligations under the subject lease, and that defendants did not release plaintiff from those obligations. However, we find an issue of fact concerning whether the parties intended that plaintiff would remain obligated for rent after it was no longer in possession. The lease states: \u201cThe Landlord shall have the right to cancel this Lease at any time upon giving the Tenant nine months prior written notice of such cancellation. At the expiration of such nine month period, the Tenant shall deliver possession of the demised premises and this lease shall be canceled and terminated as if such expiration date had been the date initially set forth in this Lease as the expiration date of this Lease.\u201d However, in defendant\u2019s January 15, 1998 letter that gave plaintiff the requisite nine months\u2019 notice of defendant\u2019s intent to cancel the lease, defendant directed plaintiff to vacate the premises <em>\u201con or before </em>October 31, 1998\u201d and further stated that \u201c[i]n the event that the tenant timely surrenders vacant possession of the subject premises <em>on or before </em>October 31, 1998 the landlord shall, in accordance with Article 68 issue to the tenant a fee of $15,000.\u201d This letter arguably gave plaintiff the choice of an early surrender and acceptance, a situation which the above-quoted lease provision does not explicitly address.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Plaintiff accordingly vacated the premises on June 10, 1998. Defendant responded with a July 2, 1998 letter \u201cconfirming] that * * * pursuant to written lease agreement dated May 1, 1996, you have removed all persons and property from the premises and have surrendered same\u201d. Notably, defendant did not state that it reserved any right to seek rent for future months, nor did it assert such a claim until after plaintiff sued it <em>(see, Riverside Research Inst. v KMGA, Inc., </em>108 AD2d 365, 368, <em>affd </em>68 NY2d 689). Since it is, at the very least, counterintuitive that a tenant who surrendered possession at the landlord\u2019s suggestion and with the landlord\u2019s consent would expect to remain liable for the rent, we cannot find as a matter of law that this was the parties\u2019 intent. It is for the trier of fact to determine whether defendant\u2019s ambiguous July 2, 1998 let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ter operated as an acceptance of the early surrender, terminating the rent obligations under the lease before October 31, 1998 <em>(see, Riverside Research Inst. v KMGA, Inc., supra, </em>at 368 [surrender and acceptance ends duty to pay rent]).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In any event, under the same paragraph of the lease, plaintiff is entitled to a set-off of $15,000 because the landlord exercised its cancellation option. It is worth noting that even if defendant is entitled to back rent from June to October, the set-off exceeds the base amount due ($1,800 per month for five months), not counting any related charges or interest that may be owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Moreover, the late charge provision of the lease, which awarded a 365% per annum penalty, should not be enforced. The charge, while not technically interest, is unreasonable and confiscatory in nature and therefore unenforceable when examined in the light of the public policy expressed in Penal Law \u00a7 190.40, which makes an interest charge of more than 25% per annum a criminal offense <em>(see, e.g., 943 Lexington Ave. v Niarchos, </em>83 Misc 2d 803).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We have considered plaintiffs remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
