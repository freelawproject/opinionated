The defense counsel\u2019s affirmation established the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay in making the motion (see, <em>Aurora v Ford Motor Credit Corp., </em>266 AD2d 418; <em>Rossi v Arnot Ogden Med. Ctr., </em>252 AD2d 778). We also note that the defendant\u2019s delay in making the motion caused no prejudice to the plaintiffs, who did not oppose that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion (see, <em>Rabadi v Atlantic &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>268 AD2d 418). Joy, J. P., Sullivan, Friedmann and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
