The allegations in the amended complaint sufficiently state a cause of action against Rosa to recover damages for tortious interference with prospective contractual relations <em>(see, Guard-Life Corp. v Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp., </em>50 NY2d 183, 191-192; <em>Jurlique, Inc. v Austral Biolab Pty., </em>187 AD2d 637, 638-639).</p><p id=\"b334-3\">The Supreme Court erred, however, in failing to dismiss the fourth cause of action alleging that the defendant Leigh Russo made a defamatory statement regarding the plaintiff, an independent contractor hired by her employer. The statement, which was made to a co-worker, was subject to a qualified privilege because it concerned a matter in which both Russo and her co-worker had an interest <em>(see, Liberman v Gelstein, </em>80 NY2d 429, 437; <em>Hyer v Southside Hosp., </em>227 AD2d 592). The plaintiff failed to allege any facts from which malice could be inferred and its conclusory allegations of malice were insufficient to overcome the privilege <em>(see, Trachtman v Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>251 AD2d 322; <em>Doherty v New York Tel. Co., </em>202 AD2d 627).</p><p id=\"b334-4\">The Supreme Court also erred in granting the plaintiff leave to replead its sixth cause of action alleging that Rosa and Russo had conspired to tortiously interfere with its contractual relations. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, the appellants are aggrieved by that portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s order <em>(see, Planned Consumer Mktg. v Coats &amp; Clark, </em>71 NY2d 442, 447, n 5). New York does not recognize an independent tort to recover damages for conspiracy <em>(see, New Dimensions Spa v Fitness Place Rockville Centre, N. Y., </em>187 AD2d 493, 494) and the plaintiff did not demonstrate that it could properly plead any other cognizable cause of action <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3211 [e]). Ritter, J. P., Sullivan, Altman and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
