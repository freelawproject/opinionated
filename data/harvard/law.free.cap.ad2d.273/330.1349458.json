Co. v ELRAC, Inc., </em>262 AD2d 276; <em>Cuthbert v Pederson, </em>266 AD2d 255; <em>ELRAC, Inc. v Beckford, </em>250 AD2d 725; <em>ELRAC, Inc. v Rudel, </em>233 AD2d 417). Additionally, this Court has held that, under identical facts as presented in this case, the defendant, ELRAC, Inc., d/b/a Enterprise Rent A Car Company (hereinafter ELRAC), has no obligation to defend or provide primary insurance for the lessee of one of its vehicles <em>(see, Federal Ins. Co. v ELRAC, Inc., supra).</em></p><p id=\"b375-4\">The plaintiff contends that the indemnification provisions of the ELRAC rental agreement are unenforceable because the print is smaller than required by CPLR 4544. However, the plaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence in support of its cross motion for summary judgment to establish that CPLR 4544 is applicable to this case. CPLR 4544 applies to consumer transactions which are \u201cprimarily for personal, family or household purposes\u201d. There is no evidence in the record that the defendant Carlos Medina rented the ELRAC vehicle for such purposes.</p><p id=\"b375-5\">The plaintiffs remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Bracken, J. P., Ritter, Altman and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
