The defendant was driving her Plymouth car northerly on Oakland Avenue, also approaching the intersection. The plaintiff\u2019s husband knew this was a \u201cblind corner\u201d by reason of a house, trees and other obstructions located on the southwest corner lot. He first saw the defendant\u2019s car in the intersection on Welch\u2019s Point Road, whereupon he applied his brakes, making tire marks on the road for a distance of twenty-four feet terminating at the rear of his car. The defendant arrived at the intersection first, and as she drove into it she cut to her left of its center to proceed west on Welch\u2019s Point Road. The middle of the left side of her car and the left front corner of the plaintiff\u2019s car were in collision at a point south of the center line of Welch\u2019s Point Road and six feet west of the westerly edge of the intersection. Damage to the plaintiff\u2019s car resulted. These facts are not in dispute. The court concluded that the defendant was negligent, that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was contributorily negligent, and that their concurrent negligence caused the collision and the plaintiff\u2019s damage, and gave judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s principal claim upon this appeal is that the court erred in concluding that her husband was guilty of contributory negligence barring her right to recover. In addition to the above facts the court found that in approaching the intersection the plaintiff\u2019s husband operated her car at a speed of at least about thirty-five miles per hour, and that when he first saw the defendant\u2019s car the plaintiff\u2019s car was at least sixty-four feet west of the westerly boundary of the intersection. The plaintiff contends that there is no evidence to support either of these findings and that without them the conclusion of contributory negligence cannot be sustained. We are satisfied, however, from our study of the evidence that the court was warranted in finding both of these facts. Since neither of these claimed corrections can be made, the court\u2019s further finding that the plaintiff\u2019s car was approaching the intersection at an unreasonable and excessive speed under the circumstances, and that her husband failed to keep a proper lookout and to have the car under such reasonable control as to enable him to stop it in time to avoid striking the defendant\u2019s car, which the plaintiff has also assigned as error, must stand. Therefore the court\u2019s conclusion of contributory negligence is supported by the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The further claim of the plaintiff is that, even though the finding cannot be corrected, this conclusion of the court is erroneous because the memorandum of decision shows that in reaching it a wrong principle of law was applied. The memorandum, after referring to the knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s husband of the dangerous conditions at this corner, goes on to state that he \u201cnevertheless did not commence to prepare to give the right of way to vehicular traffic proceeding north on Oakland Avenue into said intersection if circumstances warranted the according of said right of way.\u201d While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the memorandum may be consulted to ascertain the standard of care applied (Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7 90, p. 120; <em>Burk </em>v. <em>Corrado, </em>116 Conn. 511, 513, 165 Atl. 682), considering the statement quoted in connection with the finding <em>(Reiley </em>v. Healey, 122 Conn. 64, 72, 187 Atl. 661), we construe it as suggesting merely that, among the circumstances bearing on this driver\u2019s due care, one of the things which he should have had in mind was the possibility that at the corner a situation might present itself which would require him to yield the right of way to a vehicle emerging from his right. We therefore conclude that the statement fails to show that the court held the plaintiff\u2019s husband to the duty of extraordinary instead of reasonable care under the circumstances, as contended by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
