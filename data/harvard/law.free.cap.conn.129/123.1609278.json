O\u2019Connor. The plaintiff brought this action against William L. Clifford, Inc., claiming that O\u2019Connor at the time of the collision was operating the automobile as its agent and that her injuries were caused by his negligence. The case was tried to the jury and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff from which the defendant has appealed. Its claims on this appeal are three: that the evidence was insufficient to show that O\u2019Connor at the time of the collision was acting as its agent and the court, therefore, erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict; that the charge of the trial court on the subject of agency was incorrect; and that a ruling of the court upon evidence was erroneous and harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The defendant was a Connecticut corporation, with an office at Hartford, and there was evidence offered at the trial from which the' jury could have reasonably found these facts: The business of the defendant was selling supplies to beauty parlors. Its general manager, William L. Clifford, met O\u2019Connor at a beauty show in New York in 1935 and made arrangements with him as a result of which O\u2019Connor came to the defendant\u2019s office at Hartford on April 7th. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>10th, he began to work as a salesman for the defendant in Springfield, Massachusetts, having a drawing account, or salary, of $35 per week with an allowance for gasoline and oil of $8. He was to cover the territory of Springfield, Holyoke, Easthampton, Northampton, Greenfield and South Hadley. When employed by the defendant, it was known that O\u2019Connor had an automobile which he would use in getting around his territory, and the defendant\u2019s manager understood that such use would be with the defendant\u2019s permission. It was more advantageous to the defendant and O\u2019Con-nor would be able to do a better job if he used an automobile rather than buses or trains for transportation in that territory. The defendant knew that O\u2019Connor was using his car continuously in the defendant\u2019s business in Massachusetts, and he was required to identify himself as the defendant\u2019s salesman. He had samples to carry, and carried three or four bushels of them in his car at the time of the collision. O\u2019Con-nor testified that \u201cvery little instructions were given outside of following the regular route.\u201d Clifford, the defendant\u2019s sales manager and O\u2019Connor himself all testified that the defendant had no right to control the way in which O\u2019Connor covered the territory allotted to him, what time he should spend, what routes he should take, or whom he should visit. At the time of the collision, O\u2019Connor was on the regular route from Greenfield, where he had called on some of the defendant\u2019s customers, to South Hadley to sell some of the defendant\u2019s products to a customer there.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Before the collision, the defendant had taken out a policy of insurance covering its liability because of the operation by O\u2019Connor of his automobile in the defendant\u2019s business. The premium for this insurance was paid by the defendant and was not charged to O\u2019Connor. The portion of the insurance policy referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to is headed \u201cEmployers\u2019 Non-Ownership Automobile Liability\u201d and has a subheading \u201c(Named Employees and Direct Agents and Representatives).\u201d The clause in the policy was very restricted, covering the liability of Clifford, Inc., for damages \u201cresulting from the operation in the business of -the Named Assured\u201d of an automobile or motorcycle \u201cprovided such operation of commercial motor vehicles is occasional and not frequent.\u201d O\u2019Connor was undoubtedly an agent and representative of Clifford, Inc., but it does not necessarily follow that in putting his name on the list the defendant classified him as an employee. The purpose of the policy was obviously to cover a situation where ordinarily the person named in using his own car was not the employee of the defendant; the policy was meant to cover situations where, on a particular occasion, an employee or representative was sent out on its business with instructions to use his own car, as, for instance, where it became necessary to make an emergency delivery. The terms of the policy imply that ordinarily the person in using his own car would not be acting as an employee and the real implication is rather that O\u2019Connor ordinarily would not be an employee, but that he might become one on a particular occasion. There was also a letter subsequently written by Clifford\u2019s secretary which stated that O\u2019Connor was no longer in the \u201cemploy\u201d of the defendant; but the word \u201cemploy\u201d has too general a significance to afford any substantial basis for attributing to it, .as used in the letter, an admission that O\u2019Connor was strictly an employee of the corporation rather than one representing it as an independent contractor. See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u201cWhen a person authorizes another to act for him in any state and the other does so act, whether he is liable for the tort of the other is determined by the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the place of wrong.\u201d Restatement, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 387. The accident happened in Massachusetts and the substantive elements necessary to a recovery are governed by the law of that state. <em>Slobodnjak </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>116 Conn. 545, 546, 165 Atl. 681; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>117 Conn. 428, 430, 168 Atl. 17; <em>James </em>v. <em>Von Schuckman, </em>115 Conn. 490, 493, 162 Atl. 3. Whether or not the driver of a motor vehicle is an employee of another is a question involving a substantive element necessary to a recovery against that other for the driver\u2019s claimed negligence. We look to the law of Massachusetts, therefore, for determination of O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s status at the time of the collision as that of employee or independent contractor. The law of Massachusetts is stated in <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Coleman Bros., Inc., </em>277 Mass. 319, 321, 178 N. E. 638: \u201cThe test to determine whether the owner while driving his own automobile is acting as proprietor or as servant of another is whether he is in control so that he can at any time stop or continue and determine the way in which it shall be used or driven, not merely with reference to the result to be reached but with reference to the method of reaching that result even as to its small particulars. The vital inquiry concerns the right to control. If that right rests in the owner, he is acting as proprietor. If that right rests with another person, then he is the servant of that other person, who becomes responsible as master for the conduct of the owner.\u201d <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>204 Mass. 110, 112, 90 N. E. 392, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 442, 134 Am. St. Rep. 648; <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co., </em>265 Mass. 236, 238, 164 N. E. 77, 60 A. L. R. 1159; <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 399, 401, 169 N. E. 156; <em>Strong\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 243, 245, 178 N. E. 637. Under the law of Massachusetts which governs this phase of the case the evidence was not sufficient, viewing it in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>light most favorable to- the plaintiff, to permit the jury reasonably to have found that at the time the plaintiff was injured O\u2019Connor was acting as an employee of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The letter previously referred to was admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection. Assuming that the writer had authority to speak for the defendant, it was admissible for such evidential value as it had. The same is true of the admission in evidence of the insurance policy, also objected to, for the purpose of showing that O\u2019Connor was regarded by the defendant as an employee. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Beraldi, </em>260 Mass. 225, 232, 157 N. E. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In this opinion Maltbie, C. J., Brown and Jennings, Js., concurred; Ells, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
