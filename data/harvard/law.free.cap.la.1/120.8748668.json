The same amount in relation to the claims of Hicks &amp; Sons, seems to remain in the hands of the de-positees, for the benefit, and subject to the order of the former, according to certain conditions to be by them performed in relation to the depositors. Thiscircumstanceof difference, does not, in our opinion, materially change the essential merits of the two cases.</summary>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b144-10\">If on a comparison of the day of acceptance, the day designated for payment, and the tenor of the bill, it appears the days of grace were included with those of sight, between the day of acceptance arid that designated for payment, that day is the peremptory one 0f payment, and protest on it is legal.</p><p id=\"b144-11\">If the acceptance he not dated, parol evidence is admissible to show on what day it was made.</p><p id=\"AkN_\">If, on comparison of the day of acceptance. the day designated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>payment, and the tenor of the bill, it appears the days of grace were included with those between the day of acceptance and that designated for payment, that day is the peremptory one of payment, and protest on it is legal.

The principles on which its decision depend were then settled, after much discussion, and we believe them to be estab-<em>7 </em>lished on a just and sound interpretation of' the laws applicable to these cases.</p><p id=\"b145-16\">It is therefore ordered, &amp;c. that the judgment of the parish court be avoided, reversed and annulled.
