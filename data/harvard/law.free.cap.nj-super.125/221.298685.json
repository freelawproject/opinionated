J. S. A. </em>2A :170-26) and contempt of court, which were consolidated. The separate charges were tried concurrently before a County Court judge, as a County Court proceeding with respect to the contempt charge and as a municipal court matter with respect to the disorderly persons offense. Upon the determination that defendant was in contempt, an appeal was taken directly to the Appellate Division. Eolio wing the determination of guilt of the assault and battery charge, defendant appealed this conviction to the County Court, which affirmed that conviction after a hearing <em>de novo </em>on the record below. This assault and battery conviction was then appealed to the Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>pellate Division wherein it was consolidated with defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The charges stem from defendant\u2019s actions directed against Andrew Nicol, a constable of the Borough of Eiver Edge who had been retained by a private law firm to serve a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>upon defendant in connection with a pending civil action. The evidence appertained to Nicol\u2019s attempt to effectuate service upon defendant, initially at his home and later at his place of business, and defendant\u2019s conduct in resisting this service of process, including his physical contact with Nicol.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that Nicol under the circumstances was a trespasser and that this justified the use of \u201creasonable force\u201d to eject him. Nicol, as an officer acting for the court, was entitled to effectuate service of civil process and to enter defendant\u2019s premises peaceably for that purpose; 62 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Process, </em>\u00a7 58 at 840; 72 <em>C. J. S. Process </em>\u00a7 34(d) at 1043. Also without merit is defendant\u2019s argument that the convictions were the result of an improper use of hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Our independent examination of the record of the proceedings satisfies us that the convictions upon the respective charges were based upon sufficient credible evidence present in the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
