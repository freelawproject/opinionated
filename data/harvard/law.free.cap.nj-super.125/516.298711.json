Kugler, </em>Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney; <em>Mrs. Virginia Long </em>An<em>nich, </em>Assistant Attorney General, of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b541-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahm\">Plaintiff appeals from the final determination made by the Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), at its meeting of June 6, 1972, which denied the application of plaintiff for death benefits to which he claimed to lx; entitled as designated beneficiary of his deceased mother, Mary Racioppi, who had formerly been employed as a custodial maid by the Newark Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The last day on which Mrs. Racioppi had actually worked was in May, 1970. On November 19, 1970, TPAF approved Mrs. Racioppi\u2019s application for service retirement, the retirement to become effective on December 1, 1970. Mrs. Racioppi died on December 29, 1970 at the age of 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to death benefits by virtue of the provision in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:66-38 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">If a member dies within 30 days after the date of retirement or the date of board approval, whichever is later, a death benefit shall be payable only if he is deemed to be an active member in accordance with this section * *,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">contending that his mother was on leave of absence without pay when she retired and therefore was to be \u201cdeemed an active member\u201d because the cited section also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">For iho purpose of this section, * s'' * a member of the retirement system shall be deemed to be an active member * * * (2) for a period of no more than 2 years while on official leave of absence without pay if satisfactory evidence is presented to the retirement system that such leave of absence without pay is due to the member\u2019s personal illness * *' *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">When plaintiff\u2019s application was first submitted to TPAF it was denied without a formal hearing. Plaintiff appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and, in accordance with the applicable regulation, a hearing was held before the Hearing Officer of the Division of Pensions. Following the conclusion of the hearing \u2014 at which various stipulations were made by counsel and testimony was given by plaintiff, by the Secretary of the Newark Board of Education and by the Chief of Contributions in the Accounting Bureau of the Division of Pensions \u2014 the Hearing Officer filed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In it, he reviewed the evidence offered, made findings of fact and concluded that Mrs. Racioppi was not to be deemed an \u201cactive member\u201d since she was not on \u201cofficial leave of absence without pay,\u201d and hence that no death benefits were pa3^able.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The Board of Trustees concurred in the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendation and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">that Mary Racioppi was not on an official leave of absence without pay at the time of her death and that therefore, no group life insurance benefits are payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that, contrary to TPAF\u2019s findings, his mother was in fact \u201con official leave of absence\u201d and should not be penalized for what he refers to as a \u201cbureaucratic\u201d mess. However, we conclude from our study of the record that the findings made by the administrative agency could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, considering the proofs as a whole, and that therefore there is no warrant for our disturbing them. See <em>Jackson v. Concord Company, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>113, 117-118 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The determination of the Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund is affirmed. Ho costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
