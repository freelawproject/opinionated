J. </em>S. A. 24 :18-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On appeal he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. The only witness for the State on that motion was Patrolman Moretti of the Fewark Police Department. He testified that on October 4, 1970, about 10 p.m., he and his partner Patrolman Eomanella were on routine patrol duty in an unmarked radio car, but in uniform, in the vicinity of South Orange Avenue and 19th Street, proceeding northerly on 19th Street. As they entered the intersection he observed two colored males standing on. the northwest corner of the intersection. They were juveniles, and \u201call of a sudden\u201d one colored male, having a youthful appearance, exited from the bar situate on the corner. He approached the other two males standing on the corner. The officer further testified that he and his fellow officer assumed that there might have been some connection with the tavern since it was in an area'\u201chigh on narcotics\u201d they proceeded towards them \u2019 to see \u201cif anything was being transacted.\u201d The tavern in question was one of three bars in the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>known to sell narcotics. The three males were talking for a few seconds \u201cand as we approached them they split up.\u201d The police vehicle came to a stop. The officers called all three over to them and asked \u201cwhat they were doing in the area, and what the man was doing inside that particular bar,\u201d and \u201cthey said nothing.\u201d Moretti then testified that they asked for some identification since they intended to run a record check on them. The three males were then asked to step to the back of radio car where the officers proceeded \u201cto pat them down,\u201d so as to protect themselves from physical harm from weapons they might have. As a result of this pat down Moretti felt a \u201cbulge\u201d in one of the juvenile\u2019s rear pocket. He was asked to remove it so that it might be inspected to determine if it contained a weapon. Defendant complied and pulled out a small brown piece of paper, inside of which the officer found wrapped three glassine envelopes and a package of cigarette paper, all of which was secured by a rubber band. After the package was found defendant was placed under arrest. The other two males were released. Upon analysis the substance in the glassine envelopes was found to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The investigatory stop of defendant was clearly justifiable. <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>143, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 612 (1972); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 889 (1968); <em>State v. York, </em>116 <em>N. J. Super. </em>440 (App. Div. 1971). We recognize that the factual circumstances here presented may not be as compelling as those presented in the cited cases. However, none of those cases concerned the investigatory detention of a juvenile in the company of one and possibly two other juveniles at the relatively late hour of 10 p.m. in a high crime narcotics area standing near a tavern known to dispense narcotics and the trio \u201csplitting up\u201d as the officers approached them. These singular facts sufficiently justified the investigatory detention of defendant. When a police officer stops a person on the street for summary inquiry, the incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>temporary detention is not to be viewed as a formal arrest requiring probable cause, <em>State v. Dilley, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>460, 467 (1967) .</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Moreover, such facts coupled with the refusal of the youngsters to respond to the police officer\u2019s inquiry, justified the pat down search of defendant for a concealed weapon. <em>State v. Dilley, supra. </em>As was so aptly observed in <em>State v. Dennis, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>292, 297 (App. Div. 1971), certif. den. 58 <em>N. J. </em>337 (1971), \u201cThe Constitution does not require an officer to wager his physical safety against the odds that a suspected assailant is actually unarmed.\u201d We believe that under all the stated circumstances, the police officers had a reasonable basis to believe that defendant and his companions may have been armed. Weapons in high crime areas are readily available, and considering the pertinent facts the police officer had the right to make a self-protective frisk. In this respect, the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>40, 88 S. Ct. 1889, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 917 (1968) , where the frisk was conducted not for a weapon but obviously in search of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Defendant argues that the small size of the package seized from defendant renders the search violative of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of its unreasonable scope. The entire package containing the three decks of heroin and the cigarette paper was about two inches long, one and one-half inches wide, and one-third of an inch thick. However, as observed in <em>State v. Campbell, </em>53 <em>N. J. </em>230, 238 (1969), the seized object might well have contained a weapon such as a thin knife or blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Finally, we are mindful that the use or sale of illegal drugs has reached alarming proportions, and is carried on furtively and in as many conceivable ways as human ingenuity can devise in order to escape detection and criminal consequences. In this frame work the total circumstances are to be assessed, and the entire transaction viewed in a common sense, realistic fashion. <em>State v. Williams, </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372 (App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>1971), affirmed <em>o.b. </em>59 N. <em>J. </em>535 (1971). Considering the totality of the circumstances, the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b307-6\">Botter, J. S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AEa\">(dissenting). Defendant, age 16, and another blade youngster were standing on a street corner outside a tavern in a well lighted area. A third individual of \u201cyouthful appearance\u201d came out of the tavern and joined them. Two officers in an unmarked police car decided to \u201ccheek [them] out and to see if anything had happened or if anything was being transacted.\u201d The officers had heard nothing and had seen nothing pass among the three. As one officer testified, they were \u201cjust standing there talking for a few seconds and as we approached them they split up.\u201d There was no testimony that the individuals began to run or were even aware of the officers\u2019 presence. They <em>came </em>over <em>to </em>the police ear at the officers\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The police officers asked what they were doing in the area, \u201cand they said nothing.\u201d Identification was requested, but the officer who testified could not recall if all throe had produced identification. When patted down, a packet containing cigarette paper and three thin glassine envelopes of heroin was found in defendant\u2019s rear pocket. Defendant was arrested and the others were released.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In my opinion the conduct of defendant and his companions gave no suggestion whatever that they were engaging in crime or were about to do so. The facts here do not warrant an \u201cinvestigatory stop\u201d and frisk. Furthermore, there was absolutely no indication that the three were \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d All you have are two black teenagers talking on a street corner at 10 p.sr. in early October, joined by a third male who has exited from a tavern. Notwithstanding that the three taverns located in the area were known for narcotics traffic, there is less reason here to suspect defendant of criminal conduct than in <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 <em>U. S. 40, </em>88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>S. Ct. </em>1889, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 917 (1968), and yet in <em>Sibron </em>the United States Supreme Court suppressed evidence as unconstitutionally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In <em>Sibron, </em>over an eight-hour period, defendant had conversed with nine or more persons who were known nareartics addicts. Nothing was overheard and nothing was seen to pass between Sibron and the others. The court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">The inference that persons who talk to narcotics addicts are engaged in the criminal traffic in narcotics is simply not the sort of reasonable inference required to support an intrusion by the police upon an individual\u2019s personal security. 392 <em>U. S. </em>at 62, 88 S. Ct. at 1902.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">The police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees on the street or of whom he makes inquiries. Before he places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. In the case of the self-protective search for weapons, he must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous. <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra. </em>Patrolman Martin\u2019s testimony reveals no such facts. The suspect\u2019s mere act of talking with a number of known narcotics addicts over an eight-hour period no more gives rise to reasonable fear of life or limb on the part of the police officer than it justifies an arrest for committing a'crime. 392 <em>U. S. </em>at 64, 88 S. Ct. at 1903.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">As pointed out by Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in <em>Sibron, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>at 72, 88 S. Ct. at 1907, a stop, short of an arrest, was authorized in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 889 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u2018[AVjhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Read in the light of the above standards, neither the stop nor the search were authorized in the case at hand. None of the cases cited by the majority of this court go so far as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>authorize a stop and search on as little evidence as exists here. For example, in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>143, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 612 (1972), the investigatory stop was based upon information from a reliable informant, partly verified, that an individual seated in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and possessed a gun. In <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>an officer observed two men who appeared to be \u201ccasing\u201d a store for a possible robbery. In <em>State v. York, </em>116 <em>N. J. Super. </em>440 (App. Div. 1971), the defendant had been under surveillance because of his association with known narcotics violators; and, when approached by the police, he turned and handed a handkerchief containing heroin to someone behind him. The investigatory stop in <em>State v. </em>Dilley, 49 <em>N. J. </em>460 (1967), followed the officer\u2019s observation of two individuals at 3 :00 a.m. who were lingering between automobiles in a parking lot, and who had been observed earlier walking down the street turning their heads every few steps, looking to the rear. Finally, <em>State v. </em>Williams, 117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372 (App. Div. 1971), affirmed <em>o. b., </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>535 (1971), involved a defendant who had been observed conversing with known narcotics violators, and who, when the police approached, made a furtive downward motion, throwing a pink package to the floor of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The facts at hand present none of the circumstances which supported the \u201cstops\u201d in the above cases. Defendant and his companions were not known to the arresting officers as narcotics violators, nor were their actions furtive. Mere presence in the vicinity of a tavern where <em>others </em>have been known to deal in narcotics is not enough to create reasonable suspicions about this defendant and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The majority opinion gives weight to the \u201crefusal of the youngsters to respond\u201d to the police officer\u2019s inquiry. No officer testified that defendant and his companions \u201crefused to respond\u201d to their inquiries, and the trial judge made no such finding. The three came over when called and apparently cooperated when asked for identification. One officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>testified that when he asked what they were doing there, \u201cthey said nothing.\u201d The meaning of this testimony is not entirely clear. It may well be that the youths answered, \u201cnothing,\u201d a perfectly normal response for youngsters in that situation. In any case, the silence of one who is asked to explain his conduct cannot be considered affirmative evidence of an attempt to do an unlawful act <em>(State v. Zito, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>206, 215 (1969)), although it may reinforce suspicion aroused by his prior conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Mere presence in a high crime or narcotics area does not give the police reasonable grounds for an investigatory stop and frisk where the conduct of the suspect itself adds nothing to justify police intrusion. See <em>Cunha v. Superior Court of Alameda County, </em>2 Cal. 3d 352, 85 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>160, 466 P. 2d 704 (1970); <em>People v. Moore, </em>69 Cal. 2d 674, 72 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>800, 446 P. 2d 800 (1969). Those who deal in narcotics may act furtively, and with ingenuity, but there is no evidence that defendant on the night in question engaged in any conduct that could be so described.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Moreover, the police were not justified in unwrapping the 2 inch by 1-1/2 inch by 1/3 inch brown paper package, secured by a rubber band, which was found in defendant\u2019s pocket. To say that it may have contained a thin knife or razor blade in an obvious evasion of the rule of law enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio , supra, </em>which allows police to make a <em>protective </em>search in limited instances. In <em>Terry, </em>the court allowed a search for weapons when the officer is justified in believing that the suspect is \u201carmed and presently dangerous,\u201d specifying that such a search cannot be a \u201cfull\u201d search but must be \u201cstrictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.\u201d 392 <em>U. S. </em>at 24, 26, 88 S. Ct. at 1882. It can hardly be imagined that the police were looking for a weapon, rather than narcotics, when the paper package was unwrapped. The police had no grounds for an arrest, as in <em>State v. Campbell, </em>53 <em>N. J. </em>230 (1969), reversing 97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>1967), and no reason to fear defendant who was so \"armed.\u201d Presumably, the police had guns. Surely they were well enough protected against a person who would have no reason, if released, to reach into his hip pocket and start unwrapping a paper package in order to take out such an imagined weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Accordingly, I would suppress the evidence and set aside the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
