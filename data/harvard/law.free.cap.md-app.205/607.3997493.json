The court imposed a sentence of three years, all but nine months suspended, with five years unsupervised probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>On appeal, appellant raises two questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">1. Where the police illegally enter a home and secure the premises while they obtain a search warrant, is evidence subsequently seized pursuant to a lawful search warrant admissible under the independent source doctrine or the inevitable discovery doctrine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">On March 17, 2011, the court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Counsel for the State introduced into evidence, as State Exhibits 1 and 2, a search warrant and the search inventory identifying the evidence the police seized from appellant\u2019s home pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Detective George Witherington prepared the application and affidavit for the search warrant on November 19, 2010. The application detailed Detective Witherington\u2019s experience with controlled dangerous substances and then set forth the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">3. On November 19th, 2010, your affiant was in the vicinity of Flower Avenue and Piney Branch Road, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland, conducting undercover narcotics operations, due to complaints of drug activity in the area. Your affiant met with an individual, later identified as Ryan Lackonsingh,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and engaged him in conversation. Your affiant asked to purchase marijuana and Lackonsingh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>advised that he knew where to obtain marijuana and that he would obtain marijuana for your affiant. Lackonsingh then entered the writer\u2019s undercover vehicle and directed him to the area of Chickasaw Drive and Osage Street, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland and instructed your affiant to park on the side of the street. Lackonsingh advised that he would go purchase the marijuana at a nearby house and would be right back. Your affiant then provided Lackonsingh with $120.00 in pre recorded drug enforcement funds to purchase marijuana and Lackonsingh exited the vehicle. Detective Oaks, of the Montgomery County Police, Special Investigations Division, Tactical Narcotics Unit, then observed Lackonsingh walk to 1015 Osage Street, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. This address will hereafter be referred to as \u201cthe residence.\u201d Oaks observed Lackonsingh knock on the front door, observed the front door open and observed Lackonsingh enter. After approximately 2 minutes, Oaks observed the front door of the residence open and observed Lackonsingh walking away from the residence, back in the direction of your affiant. Lackonsingh then arrived at and reentered the writer\u2019s vehicle. Lackonsingh the[n] handed your affiant a baggie containing green, leafy, vegetable matter, which your affiant recognized through training and experience to be marijuana, a controlled dangerous substance of schedule I. At this time other members of the Tactical Narcotics Unit converged on the area and placed Lackonsingh under arrest. Detective Chmiel, of the Montgomery County Police, Special Investigations Division, Tactical Narcotics Unit, searched Lackonsingh incident to his arrest and located two baggies containing green, leafy vegetable matter in Lackonsingh\u2019s right, front coin pocket. Chmiel recognized through training and experience that this green, leafy matter was marijuana, a controlled dangerous substance of schedule I. Additionally, Chmiel located $20.00 U.S. currency in Lackonsingh\u2019s left, front pants pocket. Detective Sergeant Carafano of the Montgomery County Police, Special Investigations Division, Tactical Narcotics Unit, confirmed that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>$20.00 was a portion of the same $120.00 that your affiant had provided Lackonsingh to purchase marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">4. Upon arrest of Lackonsingh, Oaks responded to the residence to conduct a \u201cknock and talk\u201d investigation with the occupants. Upon approaching the residence, Oaks encountered t[w]o unidentified males who exited the residence and met Oaks in front of the residence. Oaks explained that he was at the residence to conduct an investigation and both individuals immediately became argumentative and began asking Oaks for a warrant. Carafano responded to the scene at this time and explained to the two males and an additional female inside the residence that the residence was being seized, pending further investigation. Carafano explained that your affiant would be applying for a search and seizure warrant. Oaks conducted a protective sweep of the residence in order to verify that no additional individuals were located within the residence and during this sweep, Oaks detected a strong odor of marijuana within the residence. Oaks observed approximately 1/4 pound of suspected marijuana laying in plain view on a bed within the residence, and a jar containing suspected marijuana and a digital scale, also in plain view, on a dresser within the residence. Once Oaks was confident that no additional individuals were in the residence, the house was secured pending a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The search warrant inventory, which was introduced as State\u2019s Exhibit 2, lists the following evidence seized during the execution of the warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">1. Marijuana and baggies found on bed in upstairs bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">2. Mail with name Abraham Kamara found on top of dresser in upstairs bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">3. Marijuana scale found on top of dresser in upstairs bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">4. Small bag of marijuana in blue jeans found in blue bin in downstairs bedroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Detectives Donnie Oaks and Michael Paul, members of the Montgomery County Police Department, testified regarding the events that occurred on November 19, 2010. Detective Oaks testified that Detective Witherington was working undercover, wired for audio, and he had arranged to purchase marijuana from Mr. Lackonsingh in Silver Spring. Mr. Lackonsingh entered Detective Witherington\u2019s unmarked vehicle and directed Detective Witherington to drive toward Osage Street. Detective Witherington gave Mr. Lackonsingh \u201cpre-marked drug enforcement money,\u201d requiring Mr. Lackonsingh to leave his jacket in the car for collateral.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Lackonsingh left.the vehicle and walked up Osage Street. He knocked on the door at 1015 Osage Street, and an unidentified person opened the door. Mr. Lackonsingh then entered the residence. Approximately five minutes later, Mr. Lackonsingh left the house and walked back to Detective Witherington\u2019s car. After Mr. Lackonsingh entered the car and gave the detective marijuana, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Detective Oaks testified that, several minutes after Mr. Lackonsingh exited appellant\u2019s house, he observed another man approach the residence, whereupon a male, whom Detective Oaks identified as appellant, exited. Detective Oaks observed appellant participate in a \u201chand to hand drug transaction\u201d at the bottom of the front steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">After approximately 15 minutes, Detective Oaks decided to approach the house in order to conduct a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d He explained: \u201cI believed I could talk to him, and, and ask him, you know, what, what\u2019s going on in the residence. And I believed I could talk him in, you know, talk him into turning over any more marijuana he had or, and ask him who was living in the residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Detective Oaks and two other detectives, who were all wearing police bulletproof vests, armbands, and badges, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>proached the front door. Appellant opened the door while the detectives were walking up the front steps. He stood in the threshold of the door, with both the storm door and the \u201cmain wooden door\u201d open, and Detective Oaks observed a \u201clarge fold of money in [an] open pocket in [appellant\u2019s] sweater.\u201d A few seconds later, appellant\u2019s brother, Kenneth Kamara, and a female came to the door. Detective Oaks took identification from each of the three individuals. He described appellant as \u201ccooperative,\u201d but his brother was \u201cagitated,\u201d \u201cconfrontational,\u201d and \u201cloud.\u201d The female had a young child with her who was loud and crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Detective Oaks gave the identification to Detective Spellman to run a \u201cwanted check,\u201d which indicated that that both appellant and Kenneth Kamara \u201chad cautions for being drug dealers, users and ... there was a caution for Kenneth being possibly armed.\u201d He refused Kenneth Kamara\u2019s request to return his identification, stating that he was waiting for Sergeant Carafano.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">When Sergeant Carafano arrived, he advised that he was going to get a search warrant for the residence. He stated that the police were going to detain appellant and his brother while they sought a search warrant. He handcuffed the two men, and the police then conducted a pat down of appellant and his brother for weapons and had them sit on a couch \u201capproximately four feet away from the front door.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Detective Oaks and another officer performed a protective sweep of the residence to make sure no one else was present. He explained that a sweep of a home involved \u201cwalking through all the rooms, making sure no one is hiding in the closets, under beds. You know, you have your guns out, make sure, just for your safety, and you just check the house for individuals.\u201d He did not open drawers or move anything during the sweep because he was \u201clooking for persons.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>During the sweep, he saw marijuana in a bedroom on the first floor in plain view. On the bed, there was a shopping bag containing marijuana, and on the dresser in front of the bed, there was a scale and a jar containing marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the sweep, Detective Oaks called Detective Witherington, who was drafting the application for the search warrant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The officers did not question appellant, but appellant told his brother, who was very confrontational, to calm down. At some point, appellant said: \u201c[W]hatever, this, it\u2019s all me, let him go.\u201d Appellant did not want his brother to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">While the officers were waiting for the warrant, appellant\u2019s mother came home. She was crying and very upset, asking \u201cwhy, why, why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Detective Oaks testified that the officers initially entered the home at approximately 5:32 p.m., and the search warrant was signed at 9:40 p.m. He explained the four hour delay as follows: \u201cI know there [were] problems with getting hold of ... our Lieutenant, Marcus Jones, to approve the search warrant,\u201d as well as \u201cproblems with getting hold of the ... judge who signed the search warrant.\u201d The search warrant was approved by Sergeant Carafano at 7:03 p.m. and by Lieutenant Jones at 7:40 p.m., and it was signed by a judge at 9:40 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Detective Paul testified consistently with Detective Oaks. He stated that he did not hear the officers question appellant, nor did the officers yell at, threaten, place their hands on, or make promises to appellant or his brother. Detective Paul saw a wad of money fall out of appellant\u2019s sweater pocket \u201cat least two or three times.\u201d He instructed Detective Williams to count the money and put it on the table in front of appellant. Detective Paul testified that appellant stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201c[W]hy you holding my brother? You can release him. Anything that\u2019s in this house is mine. The marijuana is mine. That, that room is mine. Anything that you would find in here is going to be mine.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brother told appellant to \u201cshut up. They\u2019re going to use this stuff against you. Shut up.\u201d The police told appellant to remain calm. Appellant continued to say, without any questioning, that the marijuana was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">When the warrant search was conducted, Detective Paul photographed the seized items, including marijuana and a digital scale found in the bedroom. One of the photographs showed that a door in the basement had been forced open. Detective Paul testified that it was standard operating procedure to force open a locked door during a protective sweep. The parties stipulated that appellant\u2019s father, Kenneth Kamara, Sr., would have testified that the door was not damaged when he left the home that morning. Detective Paul found a small amount of marijuana in a pocket of a pair of jeans in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The parties also stipulated that Sergeant Carafano would have testified that the money that was counted and placed on the table came from appellant\u2019s sweater. The money, which totaled $1,360 and included $80 of pre-marked drug enforcement money, was not taken off the table until after execution of the search warrant. Sergeant Carafano also would have testified that marijuana and baggies were found on the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the State \u201cconceded that the entry into the defendant\u2019s home and his arrest at that time ... violated his Fourth Amendment rights,\u201d stating that the police \u201ccreated the exigency\u201d by performing a knock and talk. The State asserted, however, that police officers may impound a house pending application for a search warrant for a reasonable amount of time. It argued that most of the evidence seized was admissible pursuant to the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Defense counsel argued that the money was not seized pursuant to the search warrant, but rather, it was seized at the time of the unlawful arrest. He argued that the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ments were involuntary because he had been \u201cin the custody of the police for some four or five hours. His house has been broken into, doors inferentially have been kicked into. His sister has been asked to leave her own house.\u201d He argued that, if paragraph four of the search warrant application, addressing contraband found inside the residence, was eliminated, then the application lacked probable cause. Counsel asserted that Mr. Lackonsingh \u201cprovided no information about whether there [were] any additional drugs still in the house,\u201d and the purchase was not a controlled buy because the police did not search Mr. Lackonsingh before he entered the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The circuit court was troubled by the officers\u2019 decision to \u201cgo in the house and make their own protective sweep,\u201d noting that there was probable cause for a search warrant before the officers entered the house. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">[T]hey meet [Mr. Lackonsingh] on the sidewalk.... He then gets into the car and he\u2019s transported to the house. He tells them how to get there. Then he takes the money, the marked money, and he goes inside. He\u2019s not seen for a period of time. He comes back out and lo and behold, he\u2019s got marijuana just like he said he was going to have. Okay? And when they search him after he\u2019s lawfully arrested, in my opinion, they find marked monies. The rest of the money is gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">There\u2019s certainly probable cause to believe he used part of the marked money to buy the marijuana that he had. There\u2019s more than sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The court stated that there was \u201cplenty of probable cause for his arrest. And the information for the probable cause for the search warrant is there if you excise it, based on what the police had.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The court found that the entry into the home and the protective sweep were unlawful, and it suppressed appellant\u2019s statements<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and his cell phone as fruits of an unlawful arrest. It further suppressed the money:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The money that could have been seized from his person had the arrest been lawful, it was clearly the product of that unlawful arrest. It kept falling out of his pockets until the police finally indicated that, what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Now, the police are not precluded from testifying that there was a large wad of cash in his pocket when he came to the door. But in connection with their testimony that once they seized it, it turned out to be money that was possessed by the undercover informant, it seems to me that, that would be Lthe] product as well of the unlawful seizure of the cash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">With respect to the drugs that ultimately were seized pursuant to the warrant, however, the court viewed <em>Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 813 A.2d 231 (2002), discussed <em>infra, </em>as dispositive of the issue. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">I think that in light of the <em>Williams </em>case, I have to deny your extremely well based, well articulated, well argued, and well thought out motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">So to take stock on where we are, the Court is denying the motion to suppress as to the items that were seized pursuant to the warrant, because I find that there was sufficient probable cause once I excised the, what was unlawfully seen and placed in the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">And I find that based on the <em>Williams v. State </em>case at 372 Md. 386 [813 A.2d 231], specifically looking at page 414 and the rest of the opinion as well, that it would seem as though, on facts strikingly similar to this, the Court of Appeals would have ruled based on their reasoning, that there was an independent source because the police did have probable cause to get a search warrant; and that when [the State\u2019s Attorney] did what they did not do in <em>Williams v. </em>State\u2014 what the State did not do in <em>Williams v. State, </em>she did put in the return. It\u2019s clear that the actual evidence was seized. That is, taken into the custody of the police. It was seen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>everything but the marijuana and the jeans was seen by the police earlier, but not seized by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">Therefore, the Court is going to deny the motion to suppress the actual evidence that was seized pursuant to the warrant, and which is identified as Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On April 6, 2011, the case proceeded on an agreed statement of facts as to Count 3, possession with intent to distribute marijuana. The agreed statement of facts provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">[O]n November 19th of 2010, the Montgomery County Police Department applied for and received a search warrant to search the residence of 1015 Osage Street, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. That is a one story, single family home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">When they executed that warrant on that sam\u00e9 day, they discovered in a front bedroom that, some bag, one bag on a bed that had multiple baggies of marijuana inside it. That particular item tested positive for 67.44 grams of marijuana. Also discovered within that bedroom, was a jar on a desk that also contained additional marijuana, baggies with marijuana in it. I think the total weight of the other marijuana was approximately 12.23 grams of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">Also discovered on the bed right next to the bag that contained the numerous bags of marijuana, was an empty, or a box of baggies that the testimony would have been by an expert, that those were baggies used as well to distribute marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">There was a digital scale, which is consistent with those that are commonly used to measure out marijuana for sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">Additionally, the testimony would have been that, that bedroom contained male clothing and also a number of items of mail were seized from that bedroom in the defendant\u2019s name. There was no other indication that, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>bedroom was occupied by anybody other than the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">An expert would have been called that would have testified that given the volume of the marijuana, the packaging of the marijuana, the additional baggies as well as the weight, that this, the amount seized1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1 and other indicia, indicated a possession with intent to distribute [marijuana].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Defense counsel then made a motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was \u201cno proof of any possessory interest in the room by my client.\u201d The court denied the motion and found appellant guilty. As indicated, appellant was sentenced to three years, all but nin\u00e9 months suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Motion to Suppress Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Appellant first contends that \u201cthe items seized pursuant to the search warrant must be suppressed as fruits of the illegal entry into and seizure of the Appellant\u2019s home by the police.\u201d In particular, he asserts that the court should have suppressed the following: (1) the evidence \u201cdiscovered without the benefit of the search warrant (money and cell phone found on the Appellant and statements of the Appellant)\u201d; (2) the evidence \u201cdiscovered solely as a result of the search warrant (marijuana found in jeans pocket and mail with Appellant\u2019s name on it)\u201d; and (3) \u201citems found during the illegal protective sweep and by means of the search warrant (marijuana, baggies and scale found in bedroom).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">As the State notes, with respect to the first category of evidence, the State conceded during the hearing on the motion to suppress that the police entry into appellant\u2019s house and appellant\u2019s arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, and the circuit court granted appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the money and the cell phone found on appellant\u2019s person, as well as the statements appellant made to the police while they waited for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the return of the search warrant. This evidence was not included in the agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">With respect to the remainder of the evidence seized, which was seized during the execution of a search warrant, the State contends that the court properly denied the motion to suppress. It makes three arguments in support of this contention. First, the State asserts that \u201cthe police were authorized to seize and impound the house while they obtained a search warrant to search the house.\u201d Second, it argues that \u201cthe redacted search warrant was supported by probable cause and thus provided an independent source for searching [appellant\u2019s] house.\u201d Third, the State contends that \u201cthe trial court properly denied the motion to suppress because the items on the search warrant inventory \u2018inevitably would have been discovered.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">This Court recently explained the standard of review of a denial of a motion to suppress evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">In reviewing a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence, \u201cwe view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion.\u201d We accept \u201c[t]he factual findings of the suppression court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of testimony ... unless clearly erroneous.\u201d With respect to the ultimate issue of constitutionality, however, we \u201cmake our own independent constitutional appraisal \u2018by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the present case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\"><em>Murphy v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 504, 511, 995 A.2d 783 (2010) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. IV. Here, the State agreed below, and on appeal, that the initial warrantless entry into the house, without consent or exigent circumstances, was unreasonable. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>425 Md. 1, 28-29, 38 A.3d 333 (2012) (\u201c[E]xcept when pursuant to valid consent or exigent circumstances ... \u2018the entry into a home to conduct a search or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>make an arrest is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless done pursuant to a warrant.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 211, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Generally, when the police \u201cobtain evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the \u2018[[Illegally obtained evidence is excluded under the exclusionary rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 653, 5 A.3d 730 (2010) (quoting <em>Myers v. State, </em>395 Md. 261, 282, 909 A.2d 1048 (2006)), <em>aff'd,, </em>421 Md. 630, 28 A.3d 687 (2011). This \u201c \u2018judicially imposed sanction\u2019 ... serves to \u2018deter lawless and unwarranted searches and seizures by law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">There are three circumstances, however, in which evidence obtained after initial unlawful conduct can be purged of taint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cFirst, evidence obtained after initial unlawful governmental activity will be purged of its taint if it was inevitable that the police would have discovered the evidence. <em>See Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377, 387 (1984). Second, the taint will be purged upon a showing that the evidence was derived from an independent source. <em>See United States v.

The third exception ... will allow the use of evidence where it can be shown that the so-called poison of the unlawful governmental conduct is so attenuated from the evidence as to purge any taint resulting from said conduct. <em>See Wong Sun [v.

United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 537, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988); <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 814, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984). <em>Accord Williams, </em>372 Md. at 412-14, 813 A.2d 231. In <em>Segura, </em>the police arrested the defendant in the lobby of his apartment building for selling drugs. 468 U.S. at 800, 104 S.Ct. 3380. The police then went to the defendant\u2019s apartment, entered without permission, conducted \u201ca limited security check of the apartment,\u201d and impounded the apartment for 19 hours while the officers waited to obtain a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 800-01, 104 S.Ct. 3380. The issue presented to the Supreme Court was \u201cwhether drugs and the other items not observed during the initial entry and first discovered by the agents the day after the entry, under an admittedly valid search warrant, should have been suppressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804, 104 S.Ct. 3380.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Court held that, even if the initial entry and occupation of the property were illegal, the challenged evidence need not be suppressed because it was discovered the day following the entry, during the search conducted pursuant to a valid warrant, and \u201c[t]he valid warrant search was a \u2018means sufficiently distinguishable\u2019 to purge the evidence of any \u2018taint\u2019 arising from the entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813-14, 104 S.Ct. 3380 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407). The Court noted that \u201cnone of the information on which the warrant was secured was derived from, or related in any way to, the initial entry\u201d into the apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 814, 104 S.Ct. 3380. Thus, the information possessed by the police before they entered the apartment constituted an independent source for the discovery and seizure of the evidence challenged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Segura </em>in two respects. First, in this case, unlike in <em>Segura, </em>we need to address whether drugs discovered during the initial protective sweep, prior to the execution of the warrant, were admissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Second, in this case, unlike in <em>Segura, </em>information obtained during the sweep was included in the warrant application. Neither of these distinguishing facts, however, precludes a finding that the evidence is admissible pursuant to the independent source doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">With respect to the first fact, the Supreme Court made clear, subsequent to <em>Segura, </em>that the independent source doctrine applies to evidence initially discovered illegally, but later obtained by an independent source untainted by the initial illegality. <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. In that case, the police forced entry into an unoccupied warehouse they believed to contain marijuana and \u201cobserved in plain view numerous burlap-wrapped bales that were later found to contain marijuana.\u201d 487 U.S. at 535, 108 S.Ct. 2529. They left without disturbing the bales, but they kept the warehouse under surveillance. <em>Id. </em>They did not reenter the warehouse until they obtained a search warrant approximately eight hours later.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The police then reentered the warehouse and seized 270 bales of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 108 S.Ct. 2529.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Supreme Court rejected Murray\u2019s claim that the independent source doctrine applies only to evidence obtained for the first time during an independent lawful search. <em>Id. </em>at 537., 108 S.Ct. 2529 The Court adopted the Government\u2019s argument that the independent source doctrine applies \u201cto evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an unlawful search, but later obtained independently from activities untainted by the initial illegality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained that, if police discover items X and Y during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>an illegal search, but later, during an independent legal search, discover item Z and rediscover items X and Y, items X and Y, as well as item Z, are admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 108 S.Ct. 2529. <em>Accord United States v. May, </em>214 F.3d 900, 906 (7th Cir.) (money improperly seized pursuant to state search warrant, but properly \u201crediscovered\u201d in legal federal search warrant, need not be suppressed pursuant to the independent source doctrine), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 891, 121 S.Ct. 217, 148 L.Ed.2d 153 (2000); <em>United States v. Herrold, </em>962 F.2d 1131, 1143 (3d Cir.) (gun seized during unlawful entry, treated as being seized pursuant to the subsequent warranted search, was admissible pursuant to independent source doctrine), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 958, 113 S.Ct. 421, 121 L.Ed.2d 344 (1992). Thus, pursuant to <em>Murray, </em>it is clear that the police observation of the marijuana and the paraphernalia during the protective sweep does not prevent application of the independent source doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The Court in <em>Murray </em>explained that the independent source doctrine rests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">upon the policy that, while the government should not profit from its illegal activity, neither should it be placed in a worse position than it would otherwise have occupied. So long as a later, lawful seizure is genuinely independent of an earlier, tainted one (which may well be difficult to establish where the seized goods are kept in the police\u2019s possession) there is no reason why the independent source doctrine should not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\"><em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. The Court stated that the \u201cultimate question, therefore, is whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Thus, the issue here is whether the later search pursuant to the warrant was genuinely independent of the earlier observation of the marijuana in the house. The Court in <em>Murray </em>gave guidance on how to assess this issue. It noted two situations in which the evidence would not be deemed to be obtained by independent lawful means: (1) where the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cdecision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry\u201d; and (2) where \u201cinformation obtained during that entry was presented to the [judge] and affected his decision to issue the warrant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In the present case, neither of these situations are present. The evidence here established that the police planned to get a warrant prior to the protective sweep or the discovery of any contraband. Detective Oaks testified that, when Sergeant Carafano arrived at the house, he announced that the police were going to detain appellant while they sought a search warrant. Appellant was then handcuffed and detained, and two officers conducted the protective sweep. The uncontradicted evidence shows that the decision to seek the search warrant was not prompted by what the officers saw during the initial protective sweep.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We do note that, in this case, unlike in <em>Segura </em>and <em>Murray, </em>the warrant did contain a paragraph referencing the drugs found during the initial entry and search of appellant. That, however, is not determinative. The Court in <em>Murray </em>noted that the inquiry was whether the information obtained during the initial sweep was presented to the judge and <em>\u201caffected [the </em>] <em>decision to issue the warrant.\u201d Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. In making this assessment, the Court of Appeals has explained that a court need not consider the <em>actual </em>effect of the evidence on the individual judge. Rather, the following objective test is employed: \u201c[Wjhether, after the constitutionally tainted information is excised from the warrant, the remaining information is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>372 Md. at 419, 813 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">If the remaining information in the warrant, apart from the tainted information, establishes probable cause, the warrant is lawful. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 813 A.2d 231. In this eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>stance, the independent source doctrine applies, and evidence seized pursuant to the warrant need not be suppressed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Etchin, </em>614 F.3d 726, 737-38 (7th Cir. 2010) (marijuana observed during illegal entry admissible because warrant affidavit contained sufficient probable cause without the illegally obtained evidence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 953, 178 L.Ed.2d 786 (2011); <em>United States v.

Jenkins, </em>396 F.3d 751, 756, 760 (6th Cir.) (evidence found in hotel room admissible, despite initial warrantless search, where information gained from the illegal search was redacted from the warrant affidavit and the remaining information constituted probable cause), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 336, 163 L.Ed.2d 48 (2005); <em>State v. Gulbrandson, </em>184 Ariz. 46, 906 P.2d 579, 590-91 (1995) (although initial warrantless entry into apartment was unlawful, where evidence subsequently was seized pursuant to a lawful warrant, it need not be suppressed), cer<em>t. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1022, 116 S.Ct. 2558, 135 L.Ed.2d 1076 (1996); <em>People v. Weiss, </em>20 Cal.4th 1073, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 337, 978 P.2d 1257, 1262-63 (1999) (although initial search of home unlawful, evidence subsequently seized pursuant to a warrant was admissible where, after redacting information based on the illegal search, there was sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the warrant), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1158, 120 S.Ct. 1166, 145 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2000); <em>People v.

Watts, </em>801 N.W.2d 845, 856 (Iowa 2011) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Applying the above analysis to determine if the search pursuant to the warrant was an independent source of the contraband found in the bedroom, we must redact the reference to the evidence found pursuant to the protective sweep and then determine whether the remaining information in the affidavit contained adequate facts from which the warrant-issuing judge could have concluded that probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>cause existed for the issuance of the warrant. Probable cause is defined as \u201c \u2018a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Agurs v. State, </em>415 Md. 62, 76, 998 A.2d 868 (2010) (quoting <em>Patterson v. State, </em>401 Md. 76, 91, 930 A.2d 348 (2007)). \u201c \u2018The rule of probable cause is a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction but more evidence than that which would arouse a mere suspicion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 584, 774 A.2d 420 (2001) (quoting <em>Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 403, 545 A.2d 1281 (1988)). <em>Accord Malcolm v. State, </em>314 Md. 221, 233, 550 A.2d 670 (1988) (\u201cprobable cause does not demand the certainty associated with formal trials; it is sufficient that a \u2018fair probability\u2019 existed\u201d). Moreover, probable cause is based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable people act. <em>Wilkes, </em>364 Md. at 584, 774 A.2d 420. <em>Accord Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 370, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Here, once the paragraph referring to the evidence observed during the protective sweep is excluded, the remaining information in the affidavit contains adequate facts from which a judge could have concluded that probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant. As indicated, <em>supra, </em>an undercover officer approached Mr. Lackonsingh and asked if he could get the officer marijuana. Mr. Lackonsingh replied that he could, entered the undercover vehicle, and directed the officer to 1015 Osage Street. The officer gave Mr. Lackonsingh $120 of marked law enforcement money for the purchase. Mr. Lackonsingh then entered the residence and returned shortly with marijuana. A search of Mr. Lackonsingh incident to his arrest revealed additional marijuana, with only $20 of marked law enforcement money remaining. Given this evidence, there was sufficient probable cause to support the warrant, even after the paragraph detailing the evidence found during the protective sweep is deleted. <em>See, e.g., Carrillo v. State, </em>98 S.W.3d 789, 792-93 (Tex.App.2003) (probable cause existed that cocaine was present in residence where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>undercover officer arranged to purchase cocaine from a subject who drove to defendant\u2019s residence, went inside, and after further activity, left the residence and delivered cocaine to the police officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In sum, although the initial entry into appellant\u2019s home was improper, the drugs and paraphernalia ultimately seized were seized pursuant to a valid warrant. The warrant was independent of any observations made in the subsequent protective sweep because: (1) the police made the decision to seek a search warrant prior to that time; and (2) the application for a warrant, deleting reference to the observations obtained during the protective sweep, contained sufficient probable cause to issue the warrant. Accordingly, the evidence seized was admissible pursuant to the independent source doctrine, and the trial court correctly declined to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Appellant next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he was in possession of the marijuana. He argues that there was no evidence: (1) that he was in the bedroom where the marijuana was discovered on the date of the search; (2) that access to the bedroom was limited to him; or (3) that he was aware of the marijuana found in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The State contends that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. It argues that, pursuant to the agreed statement of facts, appellant agreed that \u201cthere was no indication that ... the bedroom [where the contraband was found] was occupied by anyone other than\u201d appellant. It asserts that those agreed facts establish that appellant, \u201cand [appellant] alone, in fact occupied that bedroom,\u201d and therefore, he was in possession of the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The test of appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman, </em>423 Md. 666, 672, 33 A.3d 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Facon v. State, </em>375 Md. 435, 454, 825 A.2d 1096 (2003)). The Court\u2019s concern is not whether the verdict is in accord with what appears to be the weight of the evidence, \u201cbut rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence\u2014that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). Further, \u201cthe finder of fact has the \u2018ability to choose among differing inferences that might possibly be made from a factual situation____\u2019 That is the fact-finder\u2019s role, not that of an appellate court.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 183, 999 A.2d 986 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 534, 823 A.2d 664 (2003)). Moreover, when evaluating the judgment of the trial court in a non-jury trial, the judgment of the trial court will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 418, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In the present case, applying this standard of review, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. The term possession is defined as \u201cto exercise actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d Md.Code (2010 Supp.) \u00a7 5-101(u) of the Criminal Law Article. To prove dominion and control, \u201cthe \u2018evidence must show directly or support a rational inference\u2019 \u201d that the accused \u201c \u2018exercised some restraining or directing influence\u2019 \u201d over the drugs. <em>Jefferson v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 190, 214, 4 A.3d 17 (2010) (quoting <em>Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 142, 321 A.2d 767 (1974)). Knowledge of the presence of drugs is required to exercise dominion and control. <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 432, 842 A.2d 716 (2004). Such knowledge may be proven by circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>evidence and by inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 537, 823 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Pursuant to the terms of the statute, \u201cpossession may be constructive or actual, exclusive, or joint.\u201d <em>Belote v. State, </em>199 Md.App. 46, 55, 20 A.3d 143 (2011). Factors to be considered in determining whether there was constructive possession include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">[ (1) ] the defendant\u2019s proximity to the drugs, [ (2) ] whether the drugs were in plain view of and/or accessible to the defendant, [ (3) ] whether there was indicia of mutual use and enjoyment of the drugs, and [ (4) ] whether the defendant has an ownership or possessory interest in the location where the police discovered the drugs. None of these factors are, in and of themselves, conclusive evidence of possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. at 198, 999 A.2d 986 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Here, the agreed facts support a reasonable inference that appellant had a possessory interest in the bedroom where the marijuana was found. The bedroom contained male clothing, and there were several items of mail in appellant\u2019s name. Moreover, as the State points out, the agreed statement of facts also provided: \u201cThere was no other indication that, that bedroom was occupied by anybody other than the defendant.\u201d Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the court to find that the room was appellant\u2019s bedroom. <em>See Farnsworth, </em>920 N.E.2d at 55 (sufficient evidence that area was the defendant\u2019s bedroom where \u201c[p]resent in the room were the defendant\u2019s time card, writings to him, men\u2019s clothing, men\u2019s boots, and items consistent with the defendant\u2019s age, such as video game controllers\u201d). <em>Accord Chan v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 287, 317-18, 552 A.2d 1351 (1989) (letter addressed to \u201cSonny Chan\u201d at premises, along with appellant\u2019s presence at time of search, supported inference that appellant had possessory interest in the premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Courts in other states have held that, when contraband is found in a defendant\u2019s bedroom, that evidence is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>support a conviction of constructive possession. In <em>Commonwealth v. Farnsworth, </em>76 Mass.App.Ct. 87, 920 N.E.2d 45, 55, <em>review denied, </em>456 Mass. 1102, 922 N.E.2d 153 (2010), the Massachusetts Appeals Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cWhen contraband is found in a dwelling shared by a defendant and one or more other persons, a finder of fact may properly infer that the defendant is in possession of the contraband (not necessarily exclusive possession) from evidence that the contraband was found in proximity to personal effects of the defendant in areas of the dwelling, such as a bedroom or closet, to which other evidence indicates the defendant has a particular relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">(Quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Ct.App.1981), the Court of Appeals of Indiana explained: \u201cBecause bedrooms are usually private areas of a house ... evidence indicating sole occupancy of a bedroom supports a logical inference of control and knowledge of the room\u2019s contents by the usual occupier.\u201d <em>Accord State v. Crawford, </em>130 Idaho 592, 944 P.2d 727, 730 (Idaho Ct.App.1997) (where evidence showed exclusive control of bedroom, there was evidence to support \u201can inference that Crawford knew of and exercised control over the cocaine found in the dresser in what was proven to be her bedroom\u201d); <em>State v. Hudson, </em>277 S.C. 200, 284 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1981) (\u201cWhere contraband materials are found on premises under the control of the accused, this fact in and of itself gives rise to an inference of knowledge and possession which may be sufficient to carry the case to the jtqy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Here, pursuant to the Agreed Statement of Facts, the trier of fact was permitted to infer that appellant was the sole occupant of his bedroom, and as such, that he had knowledge and control of the drugs found in that room. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The warrant application, however, contained information gained during the protective sweep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. The court ruled that appellant's statements were \u201csuppressed insofar as the State cannot use them in their case in chief,\u201d because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\"the direct product of his unlawful arrest and detention,\u201d but it ruled that the statements were voluntary and therefore could be used for impeachment purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">. Altogether, approximately 80 grams of marijuana were seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\">.
