The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Thomas C. Lindsay, Sr. and The Thomas C. Lindsay, Sr. Revocable Trust (the \u201cLindsay Trust\u201d), appellees, and against the Annapolis Roads Property Owners Association (\u201cAR-POA\u201d), Stanley and Barbara Samorajczyk, and Margaret Tal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>bot, appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court issued two declaratory judgments, both of which are at issue in this appeal. In the first Declaratory Judgment, the circuit court declared that ARPOA holds no right, title, or interest in the Strip \u201cbinding\u201d upon Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the Annapolis Roads subdivision. In the second Declaratory Judgment, the circuit court declared that the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title and interest in the Strip \u201cbinding\u201d upon Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the Annapolis Roads subdivision, <em>\u201csubject, however, to </em>an easement appurtenant to Lot No. 18, [owned by the Samorajczyks] ... to use the 152' Right of Way for ingress and egress to Carrollton Road.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Appellants noted an appeal raising three issues, which we have rephrased and consolidated into one:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">I.

Whether the circuit court erred in finding that the Strip is subject to an easement appurtenant to Lot 18 to use the Strip for ingress and egress to Carrollton Road?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANe\">We answer this question in the negative. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In 1925, the Annapolis Roads subdivision, then known as \u201cBelmont,\u201d was conveyed to The Armstrong Company by Relia Abell Armstrong. In 1927, The Armstrong Company entered into an agreement with The Munsey Trust Company regarding the Annapolis Roads subdivision. The agreement, dated November 22, 1927, required The Munsey Trust Company to develop the community and make payments on a proposed mortgage in favor of The Equitable Company (\u201cEquitable\u201d). This agreement required that the following lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>guage be included in all subsequent deeds for sale of property in the Annapolis Roads subdivision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">The ARMSTRONG CORPORATION especially reserves all riparian rights appurtenant to the land as well as the beds of all roads, lakes and ponds, and agrees to construct roadways of approved type as indicated on the plat and survey made by Olmstead Brothers and recorded in the land records of Anne Arundel County, Maryland; and to set aside certain beaches and public parks as indicated on said plat for the perpetual use of the residents of Annapolis Roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In 1927, Equitable, as mortgagee, lent the Annapolis Roads Company (\u201cARC\u201d) $250,000. ARC conveyed fee simple title to Equitable with a grant of possession to ARC, until default of the loan, upon which event Equitable would possess the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The December 2, 1927, Mortgage contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">This mortgage, made this second day of December in the year nineteen hundred and twenty seven, by and between [ARC], a corporation of the State of Maryland, party of the first part, and the Equitable Company of Washington, a corporation of the State of Delaware, party of the second part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">Whereas [ARC] is justly indebted unto [Equitable] in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,-000.00) with interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum, payable semi-annually, in witness whereof [ARC] has given unto [Equitable] one certain promissory note of even date for Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,-000.00), bearing interest at six per cent (6%) per annum, payable semi-annually, principal due and payable five (5) years from date, and wishes to better secure the punctual payment of said note by the execution of this mortgage, which was a condition precedent to the making of said note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Now this mortgage witnesseth that in consideration of the premises and of the sum of Ten Dollars [ARC] does grant unto [Equitable], in fee simple, all that piece or parcel of ground situate, lying and being in Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland, and described as follows, to wit: All that tract of land, containing three hundred and forty one acres, more or less, known as \u201cBelmont,\u201d situated near Annapolis and at or near the mouth of the Severn River, in the Second Election District of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which was conveyed unto [ARC] by The Armstrong Company, a corporation of the State of Maryland, by deed made and delivered on the Second day of December, 1927, in which deed further reference to the chain of title and to the said property set forth, being also the identical property which was granted and transferred to the said The Armstrong Company by Relia Abell Armstrong, trustee by deed dated December 22, 1925, and recorded among the Land Records of said County in Liber W.M.B. No. 23 folio 32; and being also the identical property which is described by metes and bounds, ... and distances, in the deed thereof from David R. Randall, et al., to Paul Armstrong, dated November 13, 1907, and recorded among the Land Records aforesaid in Liber G.W. No. 57 folio 338, to which deed reference is here made for the purpose of making the said description of these presents as fully as though incorporated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">Together with the building and improvements thereon and the rights, roads, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages, thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">To Have and to Hold the aforesaid parcel of ground and premises unto and to the proper use and benefit of [Equitable], its successors and assigns forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">Provided, that if [ARC] or its successors or assigns, shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid the aforesaid sum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00), and all the interest thereon accrued, when and as the same may be due and payable, and shall perform all the covenants herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>on their part to be performed, then this mortgage shall be void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">And it is agreed that, until default be made in the premises, [ARC] shall possess the aforesaid property when paying in the meantime, all interest, taxes and assessments, public dues and charges of every kind, levied or assessed, or to be levied or assessed on said hereby mortgaged property, which taxes, assessments, interest, public dues, charges, mortgage debt and interest, [ARC] for itself, its successors, and assigns, does hereby covenant to pay when legally demandable. But if default be made in payment of said charges or the interest on said mortgage debt at the time limited for the payment of the same, or in any agreement covenant or condition of this mortgage, then the entire mortgage debt shall be deemed due and demandable, and it shall be lawful for [Equitable], its successors or assigns, or its or their Attorney or Agent, at any time after such default, to sell the property hereby mortgaged or so much thereof as may be necessary, to satisfy and pay said debt, interest and all costs incurred in making such sale, and to grant and convey the said property to the purchaser or purchasers thereof, his her or their heirs or assigns, and which sale shall be made in the manner following, viz: upon giving twenty days notice of the time, place, manner and terms of sale, in some newspaper printed in Anne Arundel County, and such other notice as by the said mortgage, its successors or assigns may be deemed expedient and in the event of a sale of said property under the powers hereby granted, the proceeds, arising from such sale to apply: ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">On September 18, 1928, the 1928 Plat was recorded, creating Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21, which are the subject of this appeal. The Strip was first depicted on the 1928 Plat. As shown on the 1928 Plat, Lot 21 had no access to Carrollton Road except over the Strip. Lot 18 had access to Carrollton Road over the Strip and over a similar strip binding the opposite side of Lot 19 running between Lots 16 and 19. As shown on the 1928 Plat, Lots 19 and 20 fronted Carrollton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Road, having direct access to it. The conveyance history of Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21 is set out more specifically below.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>Lot 18</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On December 10, 1928, ARC conveyed Lot 18 to F.K. Mohler.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The deed provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">[ARC] does grant and convey unto [Mohler], his heirs and assigns, in fee simple, all that piece or parcel of ground situate, lying and being in the Second Election District of Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland, being part of the same land which [ARC] obtained from The Armstrong Company by deed dated [December 2,1927], ... to wit: Lot numbered Eighteen (18) of Section \u201cD\u201d in the development known as \u201cAnnapolis Roads\u201d, as designated on the plat of said Annapolis Roads made by Olmsted Brothers, which said plat is recorded among the Land Records ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">Together with the buildings and improvements thereupon erected, made, or being; and all and every, the rights, alleys, ways, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">[ARC], its successors or assigns, reserves and retains all riparian rights appurtenant to the land as well as the beds of all roadways, lakes and ponds, and agrees to set aside certain beaches and public parks as indicated on the plat and survey made by Olmsted Brothers for the perpetual use of the residents of Annapolis Roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Mohler conveyed Lot 18 back to ARC in early 1929. On February 20, 1931, ARC conveyed Lot 18 back to Mohler.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In 1957, the Powells,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the subsequent owners of Lot 18, conveyed a portion of Lot 18 to the owners of Lot 19. In 1961, the Powells conveyed Lot 18 to Thomas F. And Dorothy S. Horton. In 1962, the Hortons conveyed a portion of Lot 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to the owners of Lot 19. In 1992, the Estate of R.N. Brown sold Lot 18, as well as Lot 17, to appellants, Stanley and Barbara Samorajczyk. Lot 18 is now in combination with Lot 17 and is designated as 2525 Carrollton Road, and is owned by appellants, the Samorajczyks.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\n<em>Lot 19</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On October 8, 1928, ARC conveyed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company by deed. Lot 19 was sold by lot reference, and not by metes and bounds description. The deed contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Together with the buildings and improvements thereupon erected, made, or being; and all and every, the rights, alleys, ways, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">[ARC], its successors or assigns, reserves and retains all riparian rights, appurtenant to the land as well as the beds of all roadways, lakes and ponds, and agrees to set aside certain beaches and public parks as indicated in the plat and survey made by Olmsted Brothers for the perpetual use of the residents of Annapolis Roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In 1928, The Homes Improvement Company conveyed Lot 19 to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton Bradley. In 1941, Mrs. Bradley, then a widow, sold Lots 19, 20, and 21 to the Trouchauds. In 1957, Jean Pierre and Margery Dort Trouchaud conveyed Lot 19 to Harry T. and Grace E. Solomon. In 1957, the Solomons conveyed Lot 19 to Mary Baquol and, on the same day, Baquol conveyed Lot 19 back to the Solomons. In 1977, the Solomons conveyed Lot 19 to John H. Gill, who conveyed it to the Kinneys in 1983. In 2006, the Kinneys conveyed Lot 19 to appellee, the Lindsay Trust. Lot 19 is designated as 2515 Carrollton Road and is owned by appellee, the Lindsay Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\n<em>Lots 20 &amp; 21</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">By deed dated June 23,1932, ARC conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Helen Sagrario. The deed provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>[ARC] does hereby grant and convey unto [Sagrario], her heirs and assigns, in fee simple, all those pieces, parcels or tracts of land situate, lying and being in Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland, described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Lots Numbered ... twenty (20) and twenty-one (21) in the subdivision known as \u201cSection D, Annapolis Roads\u201d, as shown on plat recorded in Liber F. S.R. 2 folio 8, one of the Land Records of said County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Together with the buildings and improvements thereupon erected, made or being; and all and every the rights, alleys, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the some belonging or in anywise appertaining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Lots 20 and 21 were conveyed by lot reference and not by metes and bounds descriptions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This deed included no reservation by ARC of the beds of roadways or any other reservation, restriction, or retention of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On July 6, 1932, Sagrario conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Mrs. Bradley using the standard form of contract of sale and deed that previously had been used by ARC, prior to the conveyance to Sagrario. The deed stated: \u201c[ARC], its successors and assigns, reserves and retains all riparian rights appurtenant to the land as well as the beds of all roadways, lakes, and ponds, and[]agrees to set aside certain beaches and public parks ... for the perpetual use of th[e] residents of Annapolis Roads.\u201d In 1941, Mrs. Bradley sold Lots 19, 20, and 21 to the Trouchauds. In 1953, the Trouchauds conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Paul and Virginia Anderson by deed, including one-half of the 10-foot wide strip that bordered on Lot 20. The deed to the Andersons provided for a use in common of the Strip. In 1959, the Andersons conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Edward and Agnes Erdelatz, who sold them to John Talbot and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>appellant Margaret Talbot in 1976. By deed dated May 25, 1976, the Talbots conveyed the portion of the Strip binding Lots 20 and 21 to the Solomons. Specifically, \u201cALL of that 10 foot path or road, lying between Lots 19 and 20 ... including that part of said 10 foot path or road lying contiguous to lots 21 and 18 ... to the end that said path or road may be closed, vesting title thereto in the [owners of Lot 19.]\u201d Lots 20 and 21 are designated as 2509 Carrollton Road, and are owned by appellant, Margaret Talbot.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\n<em>Current Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On June 6, 2007, appellants filed a three-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking declaratory judgment that title to the Strip vests in ARPOA and not the Lindsay Trust. The three counts were labeled: (1) declaratory judgment/quiet title; (2) intentional misrepresentation-fraud/unjust enrichment; and (3) negligent misrepresentation. On July 31, 2007, appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing as to count one for declaratory judgment that appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because a deed dated August 27, 1956, between Club Estates, Inc. and ARPOA,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> did not convey the Strip. As to counts two and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>three, appellees argued that the counts be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On August 2, 2007, appellants filed a response, and on August 14, 2007, appellees filed a reply to the response.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On September 20, 2007, appellees filed an Answer to the June 6, 2007, complaint. On October 1, 2007, appellees filed a counterclaim seeking declaratory judgment. On October 31, 2007, appellants filed an answer to the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">On October 30, 2008, appellees filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment asking the circuit court to find that the Lindsay Trust is the fee simple owner of the Strip, or in the alternative, to find that ARPOA is not the owner of the Strip. On November 18, 2008, appellants filed an opposition to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On December 18, 2008, appellees filed a Reply to appellants\u2019 Opposition to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">On January 9, 2009, a hearing was held on appellees\u2019 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 10, 2009, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and order of declaratory judgment, declaring that ARPOA holds no right, title or interest in or to the Strip (the \u201cFirst Declaratory Judgment\u201d). In the opinion, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">The September 18, 1928 [P]lat described above designated several rights-of-way in the community as \u201croad(s)\u201d (e.g., Carrollton). By contrast, the 10-Foot Strip has no designation of any kind. That demonstrates that if the original developer (and ARPOA\u2019s predecessor in interest) had considered the 10-Foot Strip to be a road as ARPOA now argues, the developer could easily have designated it as such. It did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>By deed dated October 8, 1928, ARC conveyed LOT 19 to Homes Improvement Company, together with \u201call ... the rights, alleys, ways ... privileges, and appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining.\u201d In that deed, ARC \u201creserve[d] and retaine[d] ... the beds of all roadways, lakes and ponds....\u201d[].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Webster\u2019s Dictionary, 1913 Edition (Plaintiffs exhibit # 5) defines \u201croadway\u201d as a \u201croad; especially, the part traveled by carriages.\u201d The word \u201croad,\u201d in turn, is defined as any \u201cplace where one may ride; an open way or public passage for vehicles, persons, and animals; a track for travel, forming a means of communication between one city, town, or place, and another.\u201d It goes on to state the word road <em>\u201cis generally applied to highways, and as a generic term it includes highways, street, and lane\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Having considered the arguments of the parties, we find as a matter of law that the plain language of the deed is ambiguous with regard to whether ARC intended to convey the 10-Foot Strip to Homes Improvement Company, its successors and assigns, including the Lindsay Trust. Therefore, we will resolve that ambiguity, keeping in mind that it must be construed against ARPOA\u2019s predecessor in interest, grantor, ARC....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">Plaintiffs argument that the 10-Foot Strip is a road because it is a place where one is capable of riding or going from one place to on the other would turn the front yard of every house in the community into a road owned by AR-POA. Moreover, ARC retained ownership of <em>\u201cthe beds of </em>all roadways.\u201d (Emphasis added). Webster\u2019s 1913 Dictionary defined \u201croadbed\u201d as \u201cmaterial laid in place and ready for travel.\u201d That definition strongly suggests that ARC intended to retain only the beds of the improved roadways such as Carrollton Road. While there was every indication that Carrollton Road had been paved and was ready for travel in 1928, [appellants] offered no proof the same was true of the 10-Foot Strip in 1928 or 1929.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Even if one ignores the fact that the September 1928 Plat (prepared one month before ARC conveyed LOT 19 to Homes Improvement Company) did not designate the 10-Foot Strip as a road, if ARC had intended to retain ownership of the 10-Foot Strip, it could have drafted its 1927 and 1928 deeds to do so. For instance,' they could have specifically retained the \u201c10 foot path shown on the September 1928 plat located between lot 19 and 20.\u201d More generally, the deeds could have reserved all \u201cpaths,\u201d \u201calleys,\u201d \u201cways,\u201d or \u201cshared driveways\u201d along with \u201cbeds of roads, lakes and ponds.\u201d We find no clear intention by the grantor, [ARC] to retain the 10-Foot Strip, ARPOA\u2019s self-serving interpretation of the deeds does not alter the logical construction of its words....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">Not only did ARC fail to clearly state an intention to retain the 10-Foot Strip, the 1928 and 1929 deeds included a strong indication that ARC intended to convey it to its grantees. Those deeds transferred ownership of, \u201call ... alleys [and] ways ... and appurtenances and advantages to this same belonging or in anywise appertaining [to the lot].\u201d The 1918 Edition of Webster\u2019s defined a \u201cway\u201d as \u201c[t]hat by, upon, or along, which one passes or processes[.]\u201d That definition more closely describes the 10-Foot Strip in 1928/1929 than any other term used in the deeds or the arguments of [appellants]. In addition, Webster\u2019s defined \u201calley\u201d as a \u201cnarrow passage; especially a walk or passage in a garden or park, bordered by rows of trees or bushes; a bordered way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">We find, therefore, that ARC retained no rights, title, or interest in the 10-Foot Strip when it conveyed LOT 19 to Homes Improvement Company or LOT 18 to F.K. Mohler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">That conclusion applies with greater force when ARC conveyed LOTS 20 and 21 to Helen Sagrario in 1932. In that deed ARC once again conveyed \u201call ... alleys [and] ways ... and appurtenances and advantages to this same belonging or in anywise appertaining [to LOTS 20 and 21].\u201d <em>However, </em>ARC did not retain the roadbed or, for that matter, anything else in that deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Finally, for the reasons discussed above, ARC\u2019S 1928, 1929 and 1932 deeds contain no clear manifestation of any intention to retain ownership of the 10-Foot Strip....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A91\">(Footnote omitted) (some omissions and alterations in original). In the order of declaratory judgment, the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALb\">DECLARED, that [ARPOA] holds no right, title or interest in or to the strip of land binding upon LOTS 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Annapolis Roads subdivision, measuring 10 feet by 114-116 feet (+/-) and shown on Annapolis Roads Plat A, filed September 18, 1928 among the land records of Anne Arundel County at Cabinet # 1, Rod # 5, Plat # 8, and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">DECLARED, that except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph, this Declaratory Judgment does not declare the rights or obligations of any other person or entity.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On September 9, 2009, appellants, the Samorajczyks and Talbot, filed a Combined Motion and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, asking the circuit court to declare that the owners of Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21 in the Annapolis Roads development own the Strip as tenants in common. On October 6, 2009, appellees filed an amended counterclaim for declaratory relief seeking that the circuit court declare the Lindsay Trust the fee simple owner of the portion of the Strip that lies between Lots 19 and 20, including the triangular point at the end of the Strip that abuts Lots 18 and 21, and to declare that no party to the lawsuit has an easement on or over Lot 19, or on or over either the Strip, to the triangular point at the end of the Strip. On November 18, 2009, appellants filed an answer to the amended counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">On October 6, 2009, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment as to the amended counterclaim for declaratory relief.

On January 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>2010, appellees filed a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On March 12, 2010, the circuit court held a combined motions hearing on appellants\u2019 September 9, 2009, motion for partial summary judgment and appellees\u2019 October 6, 2009, motion for summary judgment. On June 29, 2010, the circuit court issued a second declaratory judgment (the \u201cSecond Declaratory Judgment\u201d) stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">DECLARED, that [appellee], the [Lindsay Trust], holds all right, title and interest in and to the strip of land binding upon lots 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Annapolis Roads subdivision, measuring 10 foot by 116.61 foot (+/-) <em>and the </em>5 foot by 35.38 foot extension thereto binding upon Lot 18, 19 and 21, according to a survey and plat made by James D.

In the opinion, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\"><em>With regard to The Lindsay Trust\u2019s argument that it has exclusive title to the 10 Foot Strip, </em>the most significant conveyances are: (1) Mr. and Mrs. Trouehauds\u2019 1957 conveyance of Lot 19 to the Solomons; (2) the Solomons\u2019 1962 acquisition of Mr. and Mrs. Hortons\u2019 title to the 35.38' by 5' portion of Lot 18; and, (3) the Solomons\u2019 1976 purchase of Mr. and Mrs. Talbots\u2019 title to Lot 20 and 21 part of the 1925,10 Foot Strip binding Lots 20 and 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">When they purchased Lot 19 in 1957, the Solomons took title to the portion of the strip binding <em>that lot, </em>to the 10 Foot Strip\u2019s midpoint. <em>See, </em>former Art. 21, \u00a7 5-[114], In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>1962, the Solomons acquired by express grant from Mr. and Mrs. Horton, title to the 35.38' by 5' piece of land, which, until that grant, had been part of Lot 18. In 1976, the Solomons acquired by express grant from Mr. and Mrs. Talbot, title to the remaining portion of the 10 Foot Strip; that is, <em>the portion binding Lots 20 and 21.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">As a result of the 1957, 1962 and 1976 conveyances, Mr. and Mrs. Solomon became the fee simple owners of the entire strip, including the 1962 Extension. In 2006, they conveyed their right, title and interest in Lot 19, and then the entire strip, to The Lindsay Trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In the opinion, as to the Strip being subject to an easement to Lot 18, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">The fact that The Lindsay Trust holds title to the entire 10 Foot Strip does not invalidate Lot 18 owners\u2019 easement. In 1976, when the Talbots conveyed their right, title and interest to the Lot 20 and 21 portions of the Strip, they did not (and could not) extinguish the Lot 18 owners\u2019 right to use the Strip to access Carrollton Road. Instead, the Solomons purchased title to the Lot 20 and 21 portions of the 10 Foot Strip from the Talbots <em>subject to that easement. </em>The Solomons\u2019 several purchases merely reduced the number of servient tenements from four to one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">[W]e find that [appellees] did not rebut the presumption that the reference to the 1928 Plat included in the 1928 Deed demonstrated ARC\u2019s intention to convey Lot 18\u2019s original grantee, an easement to use the 10 Foot Strip for access to Carrollton Road. That easement thereby became appurtenant to Lot 18 in 1928 and, as a result, passed to all subsequent owners of the property, including Mr. and Mrs. Samorajezyk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The circuit court found that the original conveyance of Lot 18 occurred on December 10, 1928, and, based on the land records, the court stated that \u201cthe reference in the December 10, 1928 ARC-to-Mohler deed to Lot numbered Eighteen (18) of <em>Section \u2018D\u2019 in a development known as \u2018Annapolis Roads\u2019, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>as designated on the plat of said Annapolis Roads made by Olmstead Brothers, which said plat is recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County in Plat Book W.N.U. <em>No. 2 folio 8\u201d </em>(emphasis added), refers to the 1928 Plat. As indicated above, it clearly depicts the 10 Foot Strip.\u201d (Some internal quotation marks omitted). The circuit court rejected appellees\u2019 argument that \u201cthe first Lot 18 deed did not refer to a plat that established the 10 Foot Strip and, as a result, created no presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the use of the Strip as part of the conveyance.\u201d The circuit court stated that \u201c[t]he critical point ... is whether the first deed conveying the property refers to a plat \u2018depicting\u2019 the easement; not whether the plat referred to was the first plat on which the right of way was drawn.\u201d The circuit court found that: \u201c[A] reference to a plat filed after the establishment of a right-of-way may go to the weight of the inference to be drawn from that reference.\u201d The circuit court rejected appellees\u2019 argument that the deed\u2019s reference to the plat cannot be interpreted to convey an easement because the plat contains no legend identifying the Strip as a right of way, finding that the lack of a legend is not conclusive evidence that the parties did not intend to establish an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On June 30, 2010, the circuit court issued an order denying appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and the motion to strike appellees\u2019 amended counterclaim. On August 5, 2010, appellants noted an appeal and on August 9, 2010, appellees noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">(1) First Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">A. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in August 2009, by granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, finding that ARPOA owns no interest in the Strip. Appellants contend that the circuit court misapplied Md.Code Ann., Real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Property Art. (\u201cR.P.\u201d) \u00a7 2-114, and wrongly concluded that the 1928 deed of Lot 19 in which ARC reserved all rights \u201cin the beds of all roadways\u201d was not an express and written reservation to the transferor of \u201call the right, title, and interest to the\u201d Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Appellants argue that the \u201cessential question, in construing the 1928 deed of Lot 19 is whether ARC\u2019s reservation of rights \u2018in the beds of all roadways\u2019 was an \u2018express\u2019 and written reservation to the transferor of \u2018all the right, title, and interest to the street or highway\u2019 in question,\u201d <em>ie. </em>the Strip. Appellants contend that the circuit court must have concluded that the Strip was a not a roadway within the meaning of the term as it was used in the 1928 ARC deed of Lot 19. Conversely, appellants argue that the circuit court must have concluded that the Strip was a \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201chighway\u201d or R.P. \u00a7 2-114 would have been inapplicable. Appellants maintain that the plain language and definition of \u201croadway\u201d demonstrate that the circuit court erred in concluding that the Strip was not a roadway. Appellants contend that \u201cto suggest that the reservation in the 1928 ARC deed of Lot 19 in the \u2018beds of all roadways\u2019 was in any way \u2018ambiguous,\u2019 or that it did not apply to the [Strip], which the circuit court must have found to be a \u2018street\u2019 or \u2018highway,\u2019 stretches these common words beyond recognition.\u201d Appellants argue that if the Strip was found to be a street or highway for the purpose of R.P. \u00a7 2-114, the reservation in the 1928 ARC deed of Lot 19 in the \u201cbeds of all roadways\u201d was an express and written reservation of ARC\u2019s rights in all of that street or highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in finding that \u201cthe definition of \u2018roadbed\u2019 strongly suggests that ARC intended to retain only the beds of the <em>improved </em>roadways such as Carrollton Road,\u201d and in finding that \u201cthere was every indication that Carrollton Road had been paved and was ready for travel in 1928, [appellants] offered no proof that the same was true of the ... [S]trip in 1928 or 1929.\u201d Appellants argue that appellees produced no evidence prior to the August 2009 Order showing that Carrollton Road was paved in 1928. Appellants contend that the fact that the Strip was or was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>paved was clearly material to the First Declaratory Judgment, and as such, a genuine dispute of material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Appellants argue that the facts show a clear intention of ARC to reserve rights in the Strip. Appellants maintain that ARC, in the 1920s intended to create a common scheme and plan for the development of the community and, in the 1920s, owners of land would dedicate portions of their land to common use. Appellants argue that the Strip was dedicated to be used as a roadway by the community, including the four lot owners whose properties bound the Strip.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In contrast, appellees contend that the circuit court correctly determined that ARPOA retains no interest in the Strip. Appellees argue that R.P. \u00a7 2-114 \u201ccreates a presumption that a conveyance by a grantor who owns property on either side of a street conveys to the center of the street, and the burden to prove otherwise is on the person claiming that the conveyance did not convey to the center of the streetf,]\u201d <em>ie. </em>ARPOA. Appellees assert that reservations of rights in land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>under R.P. \u00a7 2-114 are strictly construed. Appellees contend, pursuant to R.P. \u00a7 2-114(b), that ARC conveyed to the center of the Strip when it first conveyed Lots 19 and 20 because, in 1928, ARC owned the properties on both sides of the Strip. Appellees point out that in 1932, the conveyance of Lots 20 and 21 from ARC to Sagrario expressly conveyed all alleys and ways, and the deed did not contain any reservation of the beds of the roadways.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellees contend that the lack of an express reservation in the 1932 deed conveying Lots 20 and 21 from ARC to Sagrario rebuts appellants\u2019 argument that AR-POA reserved interest in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Appellees contend that the reservation of \u201cthe beds of all roadways\u201d in the 1928 deed to Lot 19 \u201cis not sufficiently clear and specific to constitute an \u2018express reservation\u2019 of a strip of land designed to provide driveway access to two lots.\u201d Appellees discount appellants\u2019 argument that there are \u201coverwhelming contemporaneous facts [to] demonstrate that ARC intended to reserve all rights to the Strip when it reserved its right to the beds of all roadways.\u201d Appellees assert that these facts are irrelevant because the plain language of the deeds did not contain an express reservation of rights in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Appellees maintain that \u201c[i]t is not at all inconsistent to conclude that the Strip is not a \u2018roadway\u2019 for purposes of an \u2018express reservation\u2019 in a deed but that it is a \u2018street\u2019 for purposes of [R.P.] \u00a7 2-114.\u201d Appellees argue that a \u201cshared access driveway for several lots is not, by definition, a road or roadway\u2014it is a shared driveway.\u201d Appellees assert that a street is \u201cconstrued broadly under State law because the policy behind [R.P.] \u00a7 2-114, is to ensure that all land that could potentially be retained by a developer instead be conveyed out to adjoining land owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Alternatively, appellees argue that if this Court were to look beyond the plain language of the deeds, there is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>that ARC intended to reserve all rights to the Strip. Appellees contend that: (1) Lot 19 is not shown on various plats as including the Strip because title to the Strip was conveyed by operation of law and not by way of deed; (2) it is illogical that ARC would have dedicated the Strip to public use given that the purpose of the Strip was to provide access to Carrollton Road for only two lots; (3) the circuit court correctly concluded that the Strip is not a roadway for purposes of an express reservation under state law; (4) Carrollton Road is a road within the ordinary meaning of that term, and it is designated as such on the 1928 Plat and the Strip is a shared driveway, with no label or designation on the 1928 Plat, thus the Strip and Carrollton Road are different; (5) the Strip is closer in nature to an alley or way than a road.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Appellees argue that there is \u201c \u2018overwhelming\u2019 evidence that ARC did not reserve any rights in the Strip or dedicate it to public use.\u201d Appellees contend that: (1) ARC made no attempt to reserve any rights to the Strip in connection with the first conveyance of Lots 20 and 21; (2) the owners of Lot 20 and 21 have acted as the owners of the Strip, and by deeds in 1950, 1953, and 1959, the owners of Lot 20 conveyed one-half of the Strip to their grantees; and (3) the 1950 deed, in which the Trouchauds conveyed to the Andersons one-half of the Strip, reserved a \u201cuse in common\u201d over the Strip, indicating that the Strip was intended to be, and was treated as, a common driveway and not as a roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Appellees argue that even if the reservation of title to the \u201cbeds of all roadways\u201d somehow served as an express reservation of interest in the Strip, the 1932 deed to Sagrario conveyed ARC\u2019s rights in the Strip. Appellees point out that, in 1928, ARC conveyed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company and, therefore, in 1932, when ARC conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Sagrario, it did not own Lot 19. Appellees contend, pursuant to R.P. \u00a7 2-114, that \u201c[i]f the grantor of property does <em>not </em>own property on the opposite side of the street, the deed passes to the grantee <em>all </em>of the grantor\u2019s ownership interest in the street to the grantee.\u201d Therefore, appellees maintain that the Talbots, as owners of Lots 20 and 21, held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>an interest in their one-half of the Strip, and in 1976, the Talbots conveyed all of their interest in the Strip to the owner of Lot 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">B.

He has power by apt words to reserve what and as much as he pleases, or so to frame the language of his conveyance as to limit the land conveyed to the line of the stream or highway, without extending further, and in all such cases, courts are bound to give effect to his expressed intention. But in the absence of words showing such an intention, it is not presumed that the grantor intended to retain in himself the fee to the street or stream when he has parted with the adjoining land. Therefore it may be said to be a universal rule, that a deed giving a stream as a boundary will convey title to the center of the stream or to low or high water mark, <em>depending upon how far the grantor\u2019s title extends. </em>By such a description the grantor will convey all that he owns, unless a contrary intent appears from the language of the deed. The deed is taken most strongly against the grantor in the application of this rule and courts will not favor the presumption that he has retained title to the bed of the stream.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">E. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">(1) <em>Road v. Shared Driveway</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Prehminarily, we must determine whether the Strip is a roadway. By deed dated October 8, 1928, ARC conveyed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company, together with \u201call ... the rights, alleys, ways, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining.\u201d (Emphasis added). In the deed, ARC \u201creserve[d] and retained] ... the beds of all roadways, lakes and ponds[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Strip is not a roadway, but rather it is a shared driveway. A review of the September 18, 1928, Plat clearly indicates that certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>rights of way were specifically designated as roads in the Annapolis Roads Community, demonstrated predominantly by the right-of-way labeled \u201cCarrol[l]ton Road.\u201d By contrast, the Strip has no designation as a road of any kind. Rather the 1928 Plat labels the Strip \u201c10'.\u201d A view of the 1928 Plat reveals that the Strip does not extend to Lake Ogleton, but rather ends at the top of Lots 18 and 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">A review of the 1928 Plat indicates that the Strip was shared access between Lots 18,19, 20, and 21. Looking at the plain language of the deeds, ARC only retained rights and interests in the beds of roadways, conveying \u201call ... alleys [and] ways, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining [to the lot].\u201d The 1913 Edition of Webster\u2019s Dictionary defined a \u201cway\u201d as \u201c[t]hat by, upon, or along, which one passes or processes[.]\u201d That definition more closely matches the description of the Strip set forth in the 1928 and 1929 deeds. Thus, on October 8, 1928, ARC\u2019s conveyance by deed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company, \u201c[t]ogether with the buildings and improvements thereupon erected, made or being; and all and every, the rights, alleys, ways, privileged, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining[,]\u201d included the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In our view, the circuit court correctly determined that, if \u201cthe [Strip] is a road because it is a place where one is capable of riding or going from one place to on the other[, then that] would turn the front yard of every house in the community into a road owned by ARPOA.\u201d In 1913, a roadway was defined by Webster\u2019s Dictionary as a \u201croad; especially, the part traveled by carriages.\u201d \u201cRoad,\u201d in turn, was defined in 1913 by Webster\u2019s Dictionary as any \u201cplace where one may ride; an open way or public passage for vehicles, persons, and animals; a track for travel, forming a means of communication between one city, town, or place, and another.\u201d A review of the record reveals that the Strip obviously did not provide a track for travel between cities or towns, but rather allowed the owners of Lots 18, 19, 20, and 21 to access Carrollton Road as a \u201cway.\u201d As such, the Strip was a part of the lots binding it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and when lots were conveyed, the portion of the Strip binding the lots was also conveyed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">(2) Even if the Strip is a \u201cRoad\u201d for the Purposes of R.P. \u00a7 2-114, There is No Express Reservation</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Having determined that the Strip is a not road, we conclude that ARC\u2019s reservation in the \u201cbeds of all roadways\u201d failed to expressly reserve any right to the Strip. Pursuant to Art. 21 \u00a7 5-114, a deed that conveys land binding on a street or highway \u201cshall be construed to pass\u201d to the grantee all of the grantor\u2019s right, title, and interest in the street or highway unless the grantor \u201cshall in express terms in the writing by which the devise, gift or conveyance is made, reserve to himself all the right, title and interest to the said street or highway.\u201d (Emphasis added). We agree with appellees that \u201c[i]t is not at all inconsistent to conclude that the Strip is not a \u2018roadway\u2019 for purposes of an \u2018express reservation\u2019 in a deed but that it is a \u2018street\u2019 for purposes\u201d of Art. 21 \u00a7 5-114 or R.P. \u00a7 2-114. The purpose of Art. 21 \u00a7 5-114 is for a grantor to convey all interest that the grantor has in the highway binding land, as reserving the strip of land would be of no value to the grantor, but would greatly hinder the grantee. <em>See Bowie, </em>133 Md. at 11, 104 A. 461 (\u201cThe natural presumption where a deed conveys land bordering on a stream or highway is, that the grantor means to convey what he owns, and not to reserve a strip of land of no value to him, but the loss of which to the grantee might be productive of great injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Applying the principles discussed above, as to Lots 18 and 19, ARC\u2019s reservation in \u201cthe beds of all roadways\u201d was not sufficient to constitute an \u201cexpress reservation\u201d in the Strip. The language of the deeds reserving the \u201cbeds of all road<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ways\u201d does not demonstrate a specific and express intent to reserve interest in the Strip. \u201cThe test for ambiguity is whether the terms are reasonably susceptible to two or more meanings.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Promenade Towers Mut. Housing Corp., </em>84 Md.App. 702, 717, 581 A.2d 846 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>324 Md. 588, 597 A.2d 1377 (1991) (citation omitted). The deeds conveyed to the grantees the \u201calleys\u201d and \u201cways,\u201d while reserving the interest in the \u201cbeds of all roadways\u201d; because the Strip was not labeled as a road on the 1928 Plat nor specified in the deed as a road, it is unclear whether the deed reserving the grantor\u2019s interest in the \u201cbeds of all roadways\u201d included an express reservation in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The burden is on the grantor to demonstrate an express intention to reserve the street after conveying the land bordering the street. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Bowie, </em>133 Md. at 11, 104 A. 461:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">[The grantor] has power by apt words to reserve what and as much as he pleases, or so to frame the language of his conveyance as to limit the land conveyed to the line of the stream or highway, without extending further, and in all such cases, courts are bound to give effect to his expressed intention. But in the absence of words showing such an intention, it is not presumed that the grantor intended to retain in himself the fee to the street or stream when he has parted with the adjoining land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review, we construe any words in the deed susceptible of more than one construction against the grantor and in favor of the grantee, and we conclude, therefore, that ARC failed to expressly reserve any interest in the Strip. <em>See Gunby, </em>174 Md.App. at 243-44, 921 A.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Applying this principle, and construing the language in favor of the grantees, the October 8, 1928, conveyance of Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company and the February 20, 1931, conveyance of Lot 18 to Mohler, conveyed with those Lots \u201cto the center of\u2019 the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">As to Lots 20 and 21, dispositive is appellants\u2019 concession that \u201cevery deed relating to \u2018Belmont Farms,\u2019 with the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tion of the 1932 S[a]grario deed [conveying Lots 20 and 21] and the 1944 Equitable deed of \u2018S[a]grario\u2019 property, contained an explicit reservation of rights in the \u2018beds of all roadways.\u2019 \u201d When ARC conveyed Lots 20 and 21 to Sagrario on June 23, 1932, ARC failed to expressly reserve a right to the beds of all roadways. Nothing in the June 1932, deed to Sagrario reserved the right to any road or way or retained the rights in a roadbed, or anything else, for that matter. The June 1932 conveyance of Lots 20 and 21 conveyed, by operation of law, any interest that ARC had in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Appellants contend that in the July 6, 1932, transaction, Sagrario put ARC\u2019S reservation back in the deed when she transferred Lots 20 and 21 to Mrs. Bradley using the standard form of contract sale and deed previously used by ARC prior to the conveyance to her. This contention is without merit. Once ARC conveyed the lots to Sagrario without the reservation, the original reservation as to the beds of roadways, or any other reservation omitted by ARC, was extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In the deed from Sagrario to Mrs. Bradley, the following language appears: \u201c[ARC] its successors or assigns, reserves and retains all riparian rights appurtenant to the land as well as the beds of all roadways ... for the perpetual use of th[e] residents of Annapolis Roads.\u201d ARC, however, was not the grantor\u2014or even a party to the transaction\u2014and therefore, by its plain language the deed effectively failed to create an easement by express reservation for ARC. Parties may create a deed of easement for the benefit of a third party, <em>see generally Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>\u2014 Md.App.-(2012), but that was not done in this case. Here, Sagrario and Mrs. Bradley did not create and reserve an easement on behalf of ARC, but rather inserted ARC\u2019S name into the deed, as ARC reserving an easement for itself even though it was not the grantor in the conveyance and had no interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Based on the conveyances discussed above, we conclude that the circuit court properly determined in its August 10, 2009, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Declaratory Judgment Order that ARPOA holds no right, title or interest in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">(2) Equitable\u2019s Mortgage on the Annapolis Roads Subdivision</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">A. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees and \u201cignoring] the effect of Equitable\u2019s mortgage on [the Annapolis Roads subdivision], which applied to the [Strip] and which was never released prior to the first conveyances of Lots 19 and 20.\u201d Appellants contend that in 1928, at the time of the first conveyance of Lot 19, Equitable owned fee simple title to all of the land in the Annapolis Roads subdivision because \u201cin 1927, at the start of development of \u2018Belmont Farms,\u2019 the Equitable Company of Washington, as Mortgagee], lent ARC some $250,000, subject to Equitable\u2019s mortgage [and,] [a]s part of the same transaction, ARC conveyed fee simple title to The Equitable Company with a grant of possession to ARC, until default of the loan, upon which event the Equitable Company would possess the property.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellants maintain that the Strip was not a part of Lots 19 and 20. Appellants contend that the 1932 conveyance of the twelve unsold lots to Sagrar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>io\u2014whom appellants maintain was a strawman\u2014did not convey any interest in the Strip, as the Strip was not part of any of the lots. Appellants argue that when the lots were conveyed to Sagrario, Equitable executed a Deed of Release, in favor of ARC, that released Equitable\u2019s mortgage on those twelve lots, but only those lots. Appellants point out that the release, however, provided that Equitable\u2019s lien mortgage would remain as to the remainder of the property therein described, which appellants contend included the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Appellants maintain that \u201cneither the first conveyance of Lot 19 (the Lindsay property) in 1928, nor the first conveyances of the adjacent Lot 20 in the 1932 S[a]grario transactions, resulted in a release or extinguishment of Equitable\u2019s title and mortgage interests in both the main part of Carroll-ton Road and the [Strip].\u201d Appellants argue that \u201cEquitable specifically retained its rights in all property (other than the lots themselves), whenever a conveyance occurred, and it asserted the same reservation of rights in the \u2018beds of all roadways\u2019 found in all other deeds, in the 1932 conveyance of Lot 20 by its strawman, S[a]grario, to Bradley.\u201d Appellants contend that \u201cevery reason existed for Equitable, the true owner of all of Carrollton Road [including the Strip], to maintain the common scheme and plan in force throughout the rest of Annapolis Roads, and to preserve its unreleased rights in all land that it owned, including the [Strip].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Appellants argue that this issue was not cured when the foreclosure proceedings were completed and legal and equitable title merged in Equitable. Appellants contend that R.P. \u00a7 2-114 does not operate to defeat a mortgage interest when there is an absence of any release of the interest in land that could have been affected by the statute, and in the face of specific language retaining Equitable\u2019s mortgage lien \u201cas to the remainder of the property therein described.\u201d Appellants argue that because legal and equitable title merged at the conclusion of foreclosure proceedings, this strengthens Equitable\u2019s complete ownership of the Strip, which was conveyed to Club Estates, and thereafter to ARPOA, which remains the owner of the Strip today.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Appellants contend that Deeds of Release must be strictly construed against the benefitting party. Appellants argue that ARC was the first beneficiary of the Deed of Release as to Lot 19 and, as such, the Deed of Release must be construed in Equitable\u2019s favor, not ARC\u2019s. Appellants point out that applying this logic, \u201cEquitable released its mortgage interest <em>only </em>in what was described on the \u2018foundational\u2019 plats as Lot 19, and nothing else.\u201d Appellants contend that the other Deed of Release from Equitable to Sagrario released only Equitable\u2019s mortgage as to the Lots themselves and nothing more.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">In contrast, appellees argue that \u201cEquitable\u2019s release of the lien of the mortgage on Lots 19 and 20 released the lien of the mortgag\u00e9 on the Strip because the release is a grant of Equitable\u2019s entire interest in each lot and that interest included the Strip.\u201d Appellees contend that Equitable\u2019s fee simple ownership of the land has no effect on title to the Strip, as \u201cMaryland law has long held that a conveyance of title to a mortgagee in a mortgage or deed of trust gives the mortgagee nothing more than a security interest in the property and the mortgagor is recognized as the true owner despite the conveyance of bare legal title to the mortgagee.\u201d Appellees, therefore, maintain that ARC was the true owner of the lots and the Strip and had the power to convey Lots 19 and 20. Appellees point out that appellants concede that the deeds by ARC of fee simple title to Lots 19 and 20 were valid conveyances of those lots, and as such, \u201c[i]f ARC had the conceded power to convey fee simple title to the lots, then ARC necessarily had the power and duty to convey title to the Strip, as required by State law.\u201d Appellees contend that \u201c[h]ere, because the Deeds of Release expressly released the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>lots from the mortgage and those lots <em>included </em>an interest in the Strip by virtue of State law, the releases included a release of the Strip.\u201d Appellees argue that reference in the Deeds of Release to Equitable\u2019s retention of the mortgage lien \u201cas to the remainder of the property\u201d was insufficient to retain a lien on the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">B.

In the instant case, the mortgage provided for a redemise of the property to ARC; as such, ARC was regarded as the real and beneficial owner of Belmont when the mortgage was executed. <em>Darnestown, </em>102 Md.App. at 587, 650 A.2d 1365 (\u201cWhen the mortgage provides for a redemise of the property, the mortgagor is regarded, both at law and in equity, as the substantial owner of the property[.] In effect, the mortgagor is regarded as the real and beneficial owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the redemised premises as to all persons except the mortgagee.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">As discussed above, the Strip was conveyed when ARC, as the real and beneficial owner, conveyed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company, Lot 18 to Mohler, and Lots 20 and 21 to Sagrario in 1928, 1928 and 1931, and 1932, respectively. When the lots were conveyed, the Strip was part of the conveyances, and Equitable specifically released its mortgage as indicated in the Deeds of Release set forth above. Appellant\u2019s contention that: \u201cEquitable released its mortgage interest <em>only </em>in what was described on the \u2018foundational\u2019 plats as Lot 19, and nothing else\u201d is unpersuasive because the Deeds of Release expressly released the lots from the mortgage and those lots included an interest in the Strip. Accordingly, the releases included a release of the Strip. To conclude otherwise is illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We conclude that the circuit court properly entered the First Declaratory Judgment finding that ARPOA holds no right, title, or interest in and to the Strip. When ARC conveyed Lot 19 to The Homes Improvement Company in 1928, Lot 18 to Mohler in 1928 and 1931, and Lots 20 and 21 to Sagrario in 1932, ARC conveyed its interest in the Strip. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Equitable had any interest in the Strip, when Equitable executed its Deeds of Release as to these Lots, Equitable released its interest in the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">(3) Second Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, and entering the Second Declaratory Judgment determining that the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title, and interest in and to the Strip.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellant reiterates that ARPOA and its predecessors eontin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ually owned the entirety of the Strip and that, as a result, neither the Trouchauds, Hortons, Talbots nor Solomons owned any interest that could be conveyed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in finding that the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title and interest in and to the Strip. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The circuit court properly issued the Second Declaratory Judgment holding that the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title, and interest in and to the Strip. The following conveyances support this conclusion. In 1957, the Trouchauds conveyed Lot 19 to the Solomons\u2014after this conveyance the Solomons owned the portion of the Strip binding Lot 19. In 1962, the Hortons conveyed title to one-half of the Strip owned by Lot 18 to the Solomons. The August 15, 1962, deed reserved to the Hortons and their successors a right to use the one-half of the Strip owned by Lot 18 to access Carrollton Road. At that point, the Solomons owned the portion of the Strip binding Lots 18 and 19. On May 25, 1976, the Talbots conveyed, by express grant, title to the remaining portion of the Strip, <em>ie. </em>the portion of the Strip binding Lots 20 and 21, to the Solomons. The May 25, 1976, deed provided that: \u201cALL of that 10 foot path or road lying between Lots 19 and 20 ... including that part of said 10 foot path or road lying contiguous to lots 21 and 18, ... to the end that said path or road may be closed, vesting title thereto in the [owners of Lot 19].\u201d Following these three conveyances, the Solomons became the fee simple owners of the Strip, including the 1962 \u201ctriangular\u201d extension. In 2006, the Solomons conveyed Lot 19 and their interest in the entire Strip to the Lindsay Trust. As such, the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title, and interest in and to the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellees filed a cross-appeal arguing that the circuit court erred in finding that the Strip is subject to an easement appurtenant to Lot 18. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">(1) Easements Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">This Court has recently explained the \u201cbasic legal principles governing easements\u201d in <em>Sharp v. Downey, </em>197 Md.App. 123, 13 A.3d 1 (2010), <em>cert. granted, </em>419 Md. 646, 20 A.3d 115 (2011). \u201cAn easement is broadly defined as a nonpossessory interest in the real property of another.... An easement involves the privilege of doing a certain class of act on, or to the detriment of, another\u2019s land, or a right against another that he refrain from doing a certain class of act on or in connection with his own land[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159-60, 13 A.3d 1 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Private easements are easements not enjoyed by the public, and every private easement consists of \u201ctwo distinct tenements\u2014one dominant and the other servient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Sharp, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">An easement can be described as a right of the owner of the dominant estate\u2014often, a right of way\u2014over the real property that comprises the servient estate. In other words: \u201cA dominant tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate that benefits from an easement\u2019; a servient tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate burdened by an easement.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">... [T]here are several ways to create an easement. \u201cAn easement may be created by express grant, by reservation in a conveyance of land, or by implication.\u201d An express easement, whether by grant or reservation, must be created by a written memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds; and \u201ca right[] of way created by deed\u201d must satisfy \u201c \u2018the mode and manner prescribed by the recording statutes.\u2019 \u201d ... In contrast, an easement by implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201c \u2018may be created in a variety of ways, such as by prescription, necessity, the filing of plats, estoppel and implied grant or reservation where a quasi-easement has existed while the two tracts are one.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 13 A.3d 1 (citations omitted) (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">One cannot have an easement to his own property, \u201cas the same object is obtained by him through the exercise of the general right of property.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Nagle, </em>150 Md. 125, 130, 132 A. 587 (1926) (citing <em>McTavish v. Carroll, </em>7 Md. 352, 358 (1855)). In <em>Kelly, </em>150 Md. at 131, 132 A. 587, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIt is true that when the same person becomes the owner of the dominant and servient estates, and there is no intervening or outstanding interest or title held by some one else in or to the appurtenant easement/<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>3 the unity of the two estates in the one individual necessarily extinguishes and merges the easement appurtenant to the dominant estate, because no person can have an easement in the land which he himself owns.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">(2) Express Easement</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Appellees contend that \u201c[t]here is no deed or other document from the owner of the Strip that grants an express easement over the Strip to the owners of Lot 18.\u201d Appellees argue that the 1962 deed from the Hortons to the Solomons does not constitute an express easement. Appellees assert that, in order to create an express easement, the instrument must contain \u201c \u2018the names of the grantor and grantee, a description of the property sufficient to identify with reasonable certainty, and the interest or estate intended to be granted.\u2019 \u201d Appellees point out that the deed was not signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>by the Solomons, it did not list the Solomons as the grantors, it did not describe the property that is the subject of any grant, and it failed to identify any interest sought to be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">An express easement by grant or reservation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">may be created only \u201cin the mode and manner prescribed by the recording statutes.\u201d Although no words of inheritance are necessary, the instrument must contain \u201cthe names of the grantor and grantee, a description of the property sufficient to identify it with reasonable certainty, and the interest or estate intended to be granted.\u201d ... we limited that requirement to rights of way created by deed and held that a right of way, otherwise sufficiently described, could be validly created by a memorandum that complied with the Statute of Frauds, <em>ie., </em>a writing signed by the party to be charged or that party\u2019s authorized agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHM\"><em>Kobrine v. Metzger, </em>380 Md. 620, 636, 846 A.2d 403 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">When interpreting an instrument creating an express easement, the Court of Appeals has outlined the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cIn construing the language of a deed, the basic principles of contract interpretation apply. The grant of an easement by deed is strictly construed.... The extent of an easement created by an express grant depends upon a proper construction of the conveyance by which the easement was created.... \u201cThe primary rule for the construction of contracts generally\u2014and the rule is applicable to the construction of an easement\u2014is that a court should ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made, if that be possible.\u201d ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cA court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intend it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give [way] to what the parties thought the agreement meant or intended it to mean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><em>White v.

Cloisters at Charles, Inc., </em>392 Md. 374, 392-93, 897 A.2d 206 (2006)). \u201cThe primary consideration in construing the scope of an express easement is the language of the grant.\u201d <em>Md.

The deed provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">Beginning for the same at an iron pipe previously found; said iron pipe being on the westernmost side of a 10 ft. right-of-way leading from Lots 18 and 21 to Carrol[l]ton Road all as shown on a plat entitled Annapolis Roads, Plat A, Section D recorded among the Plat Records of Anne Arundel County in Plat Book 6, page 31; said iron pipe being also at the end of the 12th line of the first described parcel in that conveyance from Eliot P.Y. Powell and Shirley T. Powell, his wife to Thomas F. Horton and Dorothy S. Horton, his wife by deed dated February 8, 1961 and recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County in Liber G.T.C. 1455, folio 232.

Pursuant to the deed dated August 15, 1962, the Hortons conveyed fee simple title to the 35.38' by 5' strip of land to the Solomons, who incorporated it into Lot 19. In doing so, however, the Hortons unambiguously reserved the right to use that strip of land for ingress and egress to Carrollton Road stating: \u201cReserving, however, a right of ingress and egress to Carrol[l]ton Road over the above described property for the benefit of the grantors herein, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d This deed thereby created the 1962 Extension by express reservation. The terms of that reservation are specific, and the location of the easement reserved is described by metes and bounds\u2014\u201c10 ft. right-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Determining that the Hortons enjoyed the right in 1962 to use the triangular portion of the Strip to access Carrollton Road, does not answer the question as to whether the Hortons, or any subsequent owners of Lot 18, have an easement over the entire Strip to access Carrollton Road. To answer this question, we must ascertain whether an easement across the Strip was present, in any form, in earlier conveyances of Lot 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">(3) Implied Easement By Virtue of Plat Reference</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Appellees contend that \u201cthe first conveyance of Lot 18 by reference to the 1928 Plat did not create an easement by implication because the plat itself does not contain any words that demonstrate the existence of an easement.\u201d Appellees argue that no easement by implication exists as there are two conditions precedent to obtaining an easement by implication\u2014(1) the deed to the property in question must expressly reference the plat; and (2) the plat itself must create easement rights\u2014the second of which was not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Appellees argue that \u201cany easement on the Strip created by the first conveyance of Lot 18 by reference to the plat is limited to an easement over the 1/2 of the Strip that borders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>on Lots 18 and 19.\u201d Appellees contend that ARC owned the one-half of the Strip that bordered Lots 20 and 21 when it conveyed Lot 18 to Mohler and when Mohler conveyed Lot 18 back to ARC, and, therefore, any easement merged into ARC\u2019s fee simple ownership of that one-half of the Strip. Relying on <em>Kelly, </em>150 Md. 125, 132 A. 587, appellees assert that \u201ca person cannot hold an easement in land that he himself owns because the easement is extinguished when the ownership of the dominant and servient estates is united in one person.\u201d Appellees maintain that ARC\u2019s second conveyance of Lot 18 to Mohler in 1931 did not create or convey an implied easement on the one-half of the Strip owned by ARC because the second conveyance did not include an express reference to the 1928 Plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Appellants respond that \u201c[ajppellees\u2019 argument that the first deed to Lot 18 did not and could not have created an easement\u201d is contingent upon the contention \u201cthat when ARC conveyed Lot 19 to the Homes Improvement Co[mpany] in October of 1928 it also conveyed one-half of the [Strip] that bordered on Lot 19, by operation of law.\u201d Appellants contend that the 1931 Mohler deed \u201cconveyed ARC\u2019s interests in \u2018[a]ll that piece of land situate, lying and being in the development known as \u2018Annapolis Roads\u2019 in the Second Election District of Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland, being part of the land which [ARC] obtained from The Armstrong Company by deed dated the 2d day of December 1927 and recorded among the Land Record of Anne Arundel County in Liber F.S.R. No. 2, folio 264, to wit: Lot eighteen (18) in Section \u2018D\u2019.\u201d Appellees argue that \u201c[a] competent land record examiner would have clearly understood, by the language in both the Mohler deed ... what was being reserved <em>and </em>what was subjected to an easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In their Reply Brief, appellees argue that the plain language of the first and second deeds to Mohler demonstrate that no reference to the plat was made in the second deed. The first Mohler deed included the following: \u201cto wit: [Lot 18] of Section \u2018D\u2019 in the development known as \u2018Annapolis Roads,\u2019 as designated on the plat of said Annapolis Roads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>made by Olmsted Brothers, which said plat is recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County in Plat Book W.N.U. No. 2 folio 8.\u201d The second deed to Mohler contained only the following \u201cto wit: [Lot 18] in Section \u2018D\u2019,\u201d and no reference to the plat whatsoever. As such, appellees argue that the reference to Section D in the second deed is insufficient to be considered a reference to the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u201cAn implied easement is based on the presumed intention of the parties at the time of the grant or reservation as disclosed from the surrounding circumstances rather than on the language of the deed.\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 688, 484 A.2d 630 (citation omitted). \u201c[G]rants of easements by implication are looked upon with jealousy and are construed with strictness by the courts.\u201d <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>184 Md. 317, 321, 41 A.2d 66 (1945) (citation omitted). \u201c[A] deed that is silent as to the right of way but refers to a plat that establishes such a right of way creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the right of way in the transaction.\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 689, 484 A.2d 630 (citation omitted). \u201cA party may therefore point to the existence of the plat to establish that the parties intended that the right of way depicted in the plat be used by the grantee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 694, 484 A.2d 630, the Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the Bouchers ha[d] an implied easement over George Street by virtue of the reference in their deed to the Piper Estates plat, which depicts George Street as a right of way to their property.\u201d The Pipers recorded a subdivision plat\u2014the Piper Estates plat\u2014which indicated that they were offering to dedicate George Street, which bounded two lots, to public use. <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 484 A.2d 630. The Pipers conveyed the two lots bounded by George Street in deeds that referenced the Piper Estates plat, and then conveyed the remainder of their interest to the Bouchers. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 484 A.2d 630. Frederick County did not accept George Street as a public road, but the Bouchers used George Street to access their property. <em>Id. </em>at 685, 484 A.2d 630. In reviewing whether or not the Bouchers had an implied easement by virtue of plat reference, the Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>As we see it, a deed that is silent as to the right of way but refers to a plat that establishes such a right of way creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the right of way in the transaction. <em>See generally Mullan v. Hochman, supra </em>[157 Md. 213, 145 A. 554 (1929) ] (when a grantor subdivides property shown on a plat as bordering streets he impliedly convenants that the grantee will have an easement over the street shown on the plat). A party may therefore point to the existence of the plat to establish that the parties intended that the right of way depicted in the plat be used by the grantee. In sum, we view this as a reasonable application of the common law rule that a deed reference to a plat incorporates that plat as part of the deed. <em>See Klein v. Dove, supra; Williams Realty Co. v. Robey, </em>175 Md. 532, 2 A.2d 683 (1938); <em>see also Schickli v. Keeling, </em>307 Ky. 210, 210 S.W.2d 780 (1948); <em>Goldstein v. Beal, </em>317 Mass. 750, 59 N.E.2d 712 (1945); <em>Vogel v. Haas, </em>456 Pa. 585, 322 A.2d 107 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 689, 484 A.2d 630. Because the Bouchers\u2019 deed referenced the Piper Estates plat \u201cas a means of describing the boundaries of their property[,]\u201d the Bouchers had an easement over George Street. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 484 A.2d 630. The Court noted that \u201call grantees from the common grantor (the Pipers) purchased their property with reference to the same plat, and all of the lots either bind or abut George Street. In our view, this indicates that the grantors intended that each grantee have at least an easement over the street.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In this case, we agree with the circuit court that the first conveyance of Lot 18 established an easement to use the Strip to access Carrollton Road, as \u201ca deed that is silent as to the right of way but refers to a plat that establishes such a right of way creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the right of way in the transaction.\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 689, 484 A.2d 630 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Appellees maintain that the first conveyance of Lot 18 deed did not refer to the plat that established the Strip and, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>such, the deed did not create a presumption that the parties intended to incorporate the use of the Strip as part of the conveyance. We disagree. As the circuit court correctly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">[T]he original, and thus relevant, conveyance of Lot 18 occurred on December 10, 1928. The February 1931 conveyance was the <em>third </em>conveyance of Lot 18. To the extent not conceded by [appellees] or contained in the court file, pursuant to Rule 5-201, we take judicial notice of the Anne Arundel County Land Records.... Those records demonstrate the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">(1) The 1928 Plat ... was originally recorded with the following description: <em>\u201cAnnapolis Roads, </em>Plat A, <em>Section D (FSR 2, folio 8), </em>Cabinet Number 1, Rod Number S\u201d. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">(2) The 1928 Plat was refiled on 9/18/28 with the following description: \u201cAnnapolis Roads Plat A, Section D (FSR 2, folio 8), <em>Original Recording 8, Cabinet Number 1, Rod Number S\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Appellees argued that the reference to Section D is insufficient to be considered a reference to the Plat. Again, we disagree. As stated earlier, the December 10,1928, deed from ARC to Mohler stated: \u201cLot numbered Eighteen (18) of Section \u2018D\u2019 in a development known as \u2018Annapolis Road\u2019, as designated on the plat of said Annapolis Roads made by Olmsted Brothers, which said plat is recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County in Plat Book W.N.U. No. 2 folio 8,\u201d refers to the 1928 Plat. The 1928 Plat clearly depicted the Strip, and as such, the presumption was created that the parties intended to incorporate the use of the Strip as part of the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Appellees argue that because the 1928 Plat did not establish <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Strip, the reference to the plat in the original Lot 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>deed could not, as a matter of law, create an implied easement by plat reference. We find no merit to this contention. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Boucher, </em>\u201cthat the Bouchers have an implied easement over George Street by virtue of the reference in their deed to the Piper Estates plat, which depicts George Street as a right of way to their property.\u201d 301 Md. at 694, 484 A.2d 630. From this holding, we conclude that an implied easement by virtue of plat reference may exist where the plat depicts a right of way. <em>See Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 692, 484 A.2d 630 (In another case, the Court of Appeals held that, although the property owners lacked a clause with an express right of use in an alley in their deed as other lot owners had, the Court \u201cdetermined that the[property owners] nonetheless had an easement because the development plat depicted the alley.\u201d (Citing <em>Atlantic Constr. Corp. v. Shadburn, </em>216 Md. 44, 51-52, 139 A.2d 339 (1958))).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The reference to the 1928 Plat in the deed from ARC to Mohler conveying Lot 18 creates a strong presumption that the conveyance included an easement to use the Strip for ingress and egress to and from Carrollton Road. The 1928 Plat depicts the Strip, and the Strip\u2019s location between Lots 18, 19, 20 and 21. Appellees concede that the original purpose of the Strip apparently was to provide access to Carrollton Road to the owners of Lots 18 and 21, as a review of the 1928 Plat reveals\u2014the Strip, as drawn on the 1928 Plat, runs from a 10 foot wide opening at Carrollton Road, between the length of Lots 19 and 20, and ends at openings at Lots 18 and 21, as soon as it reaches those two lots. The 1928 Plat clearly depicts the Strip as a right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Appellees contend that the second conveyance of Lot 18 to Mohler did not refer to the 1928 Plat and, therefore, any easement to use the Strip was extinguished at that time. A review of the second conveyance from ARC to Mohler in the 1931 deed confirms that the deed does not explicitly state a reference to a \u201cplat\u201d in the property description. Rather, the deed conveys the following parcel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[A]ll that piece or parcel of ground situate, lying and being in the development known as \u201cAnnapolis Roads\u201d in the Second Election District of Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland, being part of the same land which the said party of the first part obtained from The Armstrong Company by deed dated the 2nd day of December 1927 and recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County in Liber F.S.R. No. 24, folio 264, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Lot eighteen (18) in Section \u201cD\u201d[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">(Emphasis added). Despite lack of use of the term \u201cplat\u201d or the liber and folio for the 1928 Plat, the description above is a sufficient reference to, and incorporation of, the 1928 Plat to include notice of the easement. Significantly, the description of the property refers to: (1) the Annapolis Roads development, (2) Lot 18, and (3) Section D. Notably, none of the three pieces of information used to describe the property conveyed existed before the creation and recordation of the 1928 Plat. Prior to the creation of the 1928 Plat, the development was known as and referred to as \u201cBelmont,\u201d including in the December 2, 1927, deed referenced in the second conveyance to Mohler (\u201cLiber F.S.R. No. 24, folio 264\u201d). Only with the filing of the 1928 Plat did the name of the development change from \u201cBelmont\u201d to \u201cAnnapolis Roads.\u201d Additionally, until the recordation of the 1928 Plat and the creation of the Annapolis Roads development, specific lots and sections of land did not exist. The 1928 Plat created Section D and Lot 18 within Section D. Thus, although the 1928 Plat is not specifically mentioned by name in the second conveyance to Mohler, the conveyance refers to the 1928 Plat in three other specific ways\u2014by naming the development, the lot, and the section. Those three specific pieces of information, combined with the chain of title<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> containing the specific reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>1928 Plat, were sufficient to constitute a specific plat reference for purposes of conveyance and an easement to use the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">On December 10, 1928, when ARC first conveyed Lot 18 it did so by describing Lot 18 by specific reference to the 1928 Plat. On February 20, 1931, when ARC conveyed Lot 18 a second time to Mohler, it did so by describing Lot 18 by specific reference to the 1928 Plat, although the term \u201cplat\u201d was not used within that description. We, therefore, conclude that the first and second conveyances of Lot 18 established an implied easement by virtue of plat reference to use the Strip to access Carrollton Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">(4) Lack of Legend</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Appellees argue that \u201cthe 1928 Plat is silent as to the creation of an easement on the Strip.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> There is no legend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>that could form the \u2018source\u2019 of an easement on the Strip, [and as such,] even a conveyance that refers to the Plat does not include an easement by implication as part of the conveyance because the Plat does not itself establish an easement.\u201d Appellants argue that no legend on the foundational plats was necessary to create an easement over the Strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In <em>Klein v. Dove, </em>205 Md. 285, 287-88, 107 A.2d 82 (1954), a controversy arose between owners in a waterfront development over a ten-foot road or right of way shown on a plat along one side of the defendants\u2019 lot connecting to an interior road to a beach area.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The right of way was obstructed by the defendants and had been obstructed by them or by previous owners for some years before the institution of the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 107 A.2d 82. The plaintiffs sought to have right of access to the water by way of the lake area. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals noted the lack of a legend depicting the right of way to a \u201ccommunity area,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>It seems clear that the plaintiffs bought their lots in reliance upon the recorded plat of \u201cWild Rose Shores.\u201d The appellants make a point of the absence of any designation of the lake area as a \u201ccommunity\u201d area. The plat is rather scantily marked. What are evidently streets, roads or ways are not designated as such. An examination of the plat shows that they could not sensibly be regarded as anything else, and some of the wording in the \u201cNotes\u201d endorsed on the plat shows that this is what they are or are meant to be. Thus, the description of the garage area (for which there would be no reasonable use without roads) refers to a strip marked simply \u201c20'\u201d as \u201cthe 20' Road.\u201d Likewise, the reservation against dedication to the public speaks of the \u201cstreets and roads laid out on this Plat,\u201d and the more comprehensive reservation at the end of that note speaks of the \u201croadway\u201d at the southern end of the tract. This same reservation also speaks of the dock or pier at the end of the roadway and denies dedication to the public or to the public use or to any lot owner or owners. Other streets and roads are stated not to be dedicated to the public or to the public use but to be reserved by the owner to the use of herself, her heirs and assigns \u201cand to the mutual use and benefit of the owners abutting on said streets and roads.\u201d What are evidently piers are not designated as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Regardless of the absence of any such legend as \u201ccommunity beach\u201d on the lake area, there is no readily perceptible reason for the ten-foot right of way between what appears to be the main road of the development and the lake area except to give the owners or occupants of interior lots on this waterfront development access to boating, bathing, swimming and fishing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 291, 107 A.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Returning to the case at hand, we conclude that the absence of a legend does not establish that the parties did not intend to convey an easement. In <em>Klein, </em>the lack of a legend designating the right of way to a \u201ccommunity area\u201d did not prohibit the Court from granting the plaintiffs such a right of way. As the Court of Appeals held in <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 694, 484 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>A.2d 630, \u201cthe Bouchers have an implied easement over George Street by virtue of the reference in their deed to the Piper Estates plat, which depicts George Street as a right of way to their property.\u201d (Emphasis added). As is evident from the holding in <em>Boucher, </em>a deed which refers to a plat depicting a right of way may demonstrate an intention to convey an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">(5) Combination of Lots</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Appellees contend that Lot 18 no longer exists, as it merged into the remaining property owned by the Samorajczyks, and the circuit court, therefore, erred in finding that an implied easement appurtenant to Lot 18 was created when ARC first conveyed Lot 18. Appellees state that \u201cany easement appurtenant to Lot 18 is extinguished because Lot 18 no longer exists and the Samorajcks may not use any easement that ran to Lot 18 in their capacity as the owners of other lots.\u201d Appellees assert that Anne Arundel County law requires the merger of the Samorajczyks\u2019 lots and, therefore Lot 18, the lot to which the easement ran, no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Appellants respond that the plats show an intention to dedicate the Strip to use by more than a single landowner. Appellants argue that \u201cnothing in Art. 21 \u00a7 5-114, or its progeny, or in any of the deeds that are alleged by the [ajppellees to have conveyed, by operation of that law, an interest in one-half of the [Strip] to one of the private parties named in such deeds, sets forth any \u2018express condition\u2019 that would \u2018extinguish\u2019 the easement that was created by the \u2018foundational\u2019 1927 plats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>Boucher, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed this very issue. In <em>Boucher, </em>the appellees challenged the conclusion that Boucher had an implied easement. 301 Md. at 692-93, 484 A.2d 630. Appellees argued that former \u00a7 5-114 of Art. 21 compelled a different result and that former \u00a7 5-114 of Art. 21 \u201coperates to grant <em>\u2018all </em>the right, title and interest\u2019 of the grantor of the conveyed property in any street bounding upon the property. Because a conveyance of property bounding on a street conveys all right, title, and interest to the center of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the street, and because an easement is an \u2018interest\u2019 in the street,\u201d in <em>Boucher, </em>appellees contended that the \u201cgrantor was statutorily precluded from creating an easement in the street to the grantee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 484 A.2d 630. The Court noted the conflict, stating: \u201cThis reasoning would of course effectively abrogate the common law principle that a conveyance of property with reference to a recorded plat creates a rebuttable presumption that rights of way depicted on the plat are intended as easements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court resolved the conflict, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">To resolve the apparent conflict between these two rules, we must examine the purpose of each and reconcile them if possible. The purpose of former \u00a7 5-114 is to assure landowners that they will have access to streets bounding on their land by granting to them title to the center line of the street while recognizing an easement in the other half of the street. The implied easement by plat reference rule has an identical purpose, although it accomplishes its objective by creating an easement to the whole of the street rather than by granting fee simple title to part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 484 A.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Simply put, we disagree with appellees\u2019 contention that the Lindsay Trust\u2019s fee simple ownership of the Strip extinguished the easement by operation of former Art. 21, \u00a7 5-114\u2019s effect. As the circuit court correctly found: \u201cIn 1976, when the Talbots conveyed their right, title and interest to the Lot 20 and 21 portions of the Strip, they did not (and could not) extinguish the Lot 18 owners\u2019 right to use the Strip to access Carrollton Road. Instead, the Solomons purchased title to the Lot 20 and 21 portions of the 10 Foot Strip from the Talbots <em>subject to that easement. </em>The Solomons\u2019 several purchases merely reduced the number of servient tenements from four to one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">For all of the reasons set forth above, the circuit court properly found that the Lindsay Trust holds all right, title and interest in and to the Strip subject to an easement appurte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>nant to Lot 18 to use the Strip for ingress and egress to Carrollton Road.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Appellants list several facts in support of the contention that ARC reserved rights in the Strip: (1) all the plats in evidence reflect that the Strip is not part of Lot 19; (2) appellees admitted that, in 1928, when Lot 19 was first conveyed, Lots 18 and 21 were entirely landlocked, and the only access to the main part of Carrollton Road was through the Strip; therefore, \u2018\u2018[i]t is entirely logical that, to ensure the marketability of Lots 18 and 21, and without knowing what might happen in the future, the developers would have dedicated the [Strip] to public use, to guaranty that Lots 18 and 21 would forever have access to the main part of Carrollton Road\u201d; (3) \"every deed relating to 'Belmont Farms,' with the exception of the 1932 S[a]grario deed and the 1944 Equitable deed of 'S[a]grario' property, contained an explicit reservation of rights in the \u2018beds of all roadways\u2019 \u201d; (4) it is illogical to conclude that the developers, reserving all rights in the \"beds of all roadways,\u201d did not include both Carrollton Road and the Strip; (5) there is no basis for distinguishing between the main part of Carrollton Road and the Strip for the purpose of interpreting ARC\u2019s reservation of rights or for the purpose of applying R.P. \u00a7 2-114; (6) that the original plats do not contain an additional written \"legend\u201d to indicate the reservation of any land, including Carrollton Road, is not conclusive evidence establishing that the developer did not intend to dedicate the land; (7) the circuit court erred in \"drawing an inference of ARC\u2019s intention 'to retain the [ ] Strip' from the use of common language in deeds conveying \u2018all ... alleys [and] ways ... and appurtenances and advantages to this same belonging or in anywise appertaining [to the lot].' \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">. Contrary to appellants' argument that Sagrario was merely a straw-man, and therefore, had no real interest in what was conveyed to her, appellees argue that \u201ca deed to a strawman vests fee simple title in the strawman, and the strawman may then convey that title to another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">. <em>\"A </em>summary declaratory judgment [is] proper even though no formal motion for judgment [is] made.\u201d <em>Urbana Civic Ass\u2019n v.

In <em>Peabody Heights Co. v. Sadtler, </em>63 Md. 533, 536-37 (1885), the Court of Appeals described the common law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\"The established inference of law is, that a conveyance of land bounded on a public highway carries with it the fee to the centre of the road, as part and parcel of the grant. The idea of an intention in the grantor to withhold his interest in a road to the middle of it, after parting with all his right and title to the adjoining land is never to be presumed. It would be contrary to universal practice; and it was said, in <em>Peck v. Smith, </em>1 Conn. 103 (1814), that there was no instance where the fee of a highway, as distinct from the adjoining land, was ever retained by the vendor. It would require an express declaration, or something equivalent thereto, to sustain such an inference; and it may be considered as the general rule, that a grant of land bounded on a highway or river carries the fee in the highway or river to the centre of it, provided that the grantor at the time owned to the centre, and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent. But it is competent for the owner of a farm or lot, having one or more of its sides on a public highway, to bound it by express terms on the side or edge of the highway, so as to rebut the presumption of law, and thereby reserve to himself his latent fee in the highway. He may convey the adjoining land without the soil under the highway, or the soil under the highway, without the adjoining land. If the soil under the highway passes by a deed of the adjoining land, it passes as parcel of the land, and not as an appurtenant.\u201d 3 <em>Kent Comm., </em>433.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">.

The 10 foot roadway between lots 18, 19, 20 &amp; 21 was not released from the mortgage and the Mortgager] did not join into any of the conveyances for lots 18, 19, 20 &amp; 21. In 1932[ARC] conveyed various lots to Helen Sagrario but the Equitable Company of Washington, as mortgagee], did not release any of the land adjacent to those lots from the mortgage. Absent any joinder by Equitable, [ARC] had no interest to convey to Sagrario in deed 97-280, dated 06-23-1932. Ms. Sagrario did not acquire any title to the ten foot roadway between lots 19 and 20.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\">.

At oral argument, appellants contended that the circumstances in this case differ from those in <em>Boucher </em>because, in this case, the plat is silent as to an easement.

In <em>Boucher, </em>in reaching its holding, the Court of Appeals utilized precedent establishing that a plat\u2019s depiction of a right of way creates a presumptive easement. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 484 A.2d 630. Specifically, the Court of Appeals applied <em>Shadburn, </em>216 Md. 44, 139 A.2d 339, and <em>Hackerman v. City of Balt., </em>212 Md. 618, 130 A.2d 732 (1957), discussing the cases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Factually, the Shadburns owned a lot on a Baltimore City block, and appellants owned several lots on the same block. An alley separated the lots on the west side of the block from the lots on the opposite side (east side) of the block. After the appellants obstructed this alley, the Shadburns and others brought suit to enjoin the obstruction. This Court upheld the requested relief, holding that the Shad-burns and the other neighbors had a right to use the alley. Because some of the lot owners had express rights of use in their respective deeds, the <em>Shadbum </em>Court held that they had express easements. Although the Shadburns lacked this clause in their deed, we determined that they nonetheless had an easement because the develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ment plat depicted the alley. <em>Id. </em>[216 Md.] at 51-52, 139 A.2d 339; <em>see Hackerman v. City of Baltimore, 212 Md. 618, 130 A.2d </em>732 (1957) (easement by implication may be created when plat depicts a right of way) (dictum). In both <em>Shadburn </em>and <em>Hackerman, </em>we found that a plat that sets out a street or alleyway creates a presumption that a dedication was intended.... These cases, together with our discussion of this theory in the context of the instant case, convince us that the Bouchers have an implied easement over George Street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 692, 484 A.2d 630 (alteration in original); <em>see also Shadbum, 216 </em>Md. 44, 139 A.2d 339.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">.
