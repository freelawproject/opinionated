Appellee the Allegany County Department of Social Services (\u201clocal department\u201d) found that neglect of the child was \u201cindicated.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant John Doe (\u201cDoe\u201d) requested a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>before an ALJ to review the local department\u2019s determination. The ALJ ruled out child neglect under the circumstances of the case. Thereafter, the local department appealed the ALJ\u2019s ruling. The Circuit Court for Allegany County reversed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Doe filed a timely appeal and presents a single issue for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">I. Whether the administrative law judge erred as a matter of law in ruling out neglect of the child because the local department immediately undertook the care of the child after the child was not allowed to return home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Allegany County.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">On September 23, 2008, the local department received an allegation of child neglect involving M.C., who at that time was seventeen years old. M.C. and his brother E.C., who was sixteen years old, lived with their aunt, J.C., and her live-in boyfriend, Doe, for approximately eight years at that time. J.C. was M.C. and E.C.\u2019s blood relative and their adoptive parent. Nonetheless, Doe and J.C. assumed equal responsibility for the care of both M.C. and E.C. Approximately five months prior to the incident in question, M.C. was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">On the morning of the incident, M.C. reported the alleged events to a counselor when he arrived at school. The counsel- or called the local department which started an investigation into the incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> M.C. explained to the local department officer that Doe and M.C. had an altercation concerning how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>M.C. would get to school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Doe wanted M.C. to take the bus, while M.C. made plans to ride to school with friends. An argument ensued when M.C. told Doe about his plans to ride to school with his friends. During this argument, M.C. alleged that Doe grabbed him by the upper arms, lifted him up, shook him, and pushed him back on the bed. M.C. called for E.C.\u2019s assistance but Doe blocked the door to prevent E.C. from helping M.C. M.C. further explained that Doe and J.C. were more restrictive of his actions since his car accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Thereafter, the local department officer had a brief telephone conversation with Doe at work. During that conversation, Doe presented nearly the same course of events as M.C. One major difference between the two versions of the events was that Doe stated his actions were in response to taunting gestures and disrespectful actions by M.C. Prior to the local department officer having a more complete conversation with Doe, an agent from the Allegany County Health Department\u2019s Disabled Adults Unit (\u201cDisabled Adults Unit\u201d) called the local department officer to inform him that Doe called the Disabled Adults Unit. Doe told the Disabled Adults Unit that he could no longer care for M.C., and that someone from the Disabled Adults Unit needed to get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When the local department officer spoke with Doe later in the day, Doe reiterated that M.C. was no longer welcome at home. Doe explained that he did not want M.C. to return home because M.C. would not take his medications, attend counseling, or tend to his hygiene after his accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>over, Doe did not want M.C. to ruin his reputation by spreading lies about alleged abuse. The local department officer explained to Doe that the local department was not prepared to make a finding of neglect in connection with this incident. Additionally, the local department officer offered the local department\u2019s services to Doe and M.C. Doe, however, declined the services and insisted that he did not want M.C. to return home. Thereafter, the local department officer contacted J.C. who agreed with Doe that M.C. was no longer welcome in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The next day, the local department officer met with M.C. at school. During this meeting, M.C. expressed a desire to live with the family of a friend. The friend\u2019s uncle confirmed to the local department officer that the family knew M.C. and was willing to take care of him. J.C., however, refused this arrangement and requested that M.C. be placed in a foster home until his eighteenth birthday. The local department officer followed the request and placed M.C. in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The local department filed a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) petition after M.C. was placed in a foster home. Doe and J.C. both attended the CINA hearing and reiterated that M.C. was not allowed to return to their home and requested that he remain in foster care. After this hearing, M.C. was found to be a child in need of assistance. Additionally, the local department officer found that Doe and J.C. were responsible for indicated neglect of M.C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This finding was premised on the fact that M.C. needed many medications and other assistance that he would not receive had the local department not intervened and placed him in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Doe challenged the finding of indicated neglect in a contested hearing before an ALJ. Prior to this hearing, the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>department filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the issue of neglect was fully litigated during the CINA hearing. The ALJ granted the motion to dismiss. Doe filed a petition for judicial review of the decision with the circuit court. Prior to the circuit court entertaining the appeal, the local department and Doe agreed to remand the case to the ALJ for a determination on the merits because Doe was technically not a party to the CINA proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">On remand, the ALJ held a hearing on the merits. The ALJ rejected the local department officer\u2019s finding of indicated child neglect, and instead, ruled out child neglect. This decision was based on the ALJ\u2019s finding that M.C. was never at risk because there was no gap in custody between the care provided by Doe, J.C. and the local department. Additionally, the ALJ noted that Doe and J.C. did everything they could to help M.C. while he was in their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Subsequently, the local department filed a petition for judicial review. The Circuit Court for Allegany County reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and reinstated the finding of indicated child neglect. The circuit court found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was predicated on the actions of the local department rather than the conduct of Doe and J.C. which resulted in the local department taking M.C. into its custody. The circuit court judge ruled in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">The ALJ erred in reaching the conclusion that the Child was not at a substantial risk of harm since that conclusion was based upon the local department\u2019s ability to care for the child.... If we were to adopt the ALJ\u2019s stance then it would stand to reason that no child would ever be at a substantial risk of harm as long as the local department was capable of taking the child into care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>eminent Article. Under subsection (h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Generally, when reviewing the decision of an administrative agency a court must only determine \u201cif there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings- and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 568, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998) (citing <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). Therefore, we review the decision of the agency rather than that of the circuit court. <em>See Owens v. Prince George\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>182 Md.App. 31, 51, 957 A.2d 191, 203 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">Our review of the agency\u2019s factual findings consists solely of an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s fact finding and not an independent decision on the evidence. <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, supra, </em>349 Md. at 570, 709 A.2d at 753 (citing <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993)). This evaluation seeks to find whether the evidence is substantial. Thus, \u201ca reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency----\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985); <em>Anderson, supra, </em>330 Md. at 212, 623 A.2d at 210; <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 511-13, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)). In this context, \u201c \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 as the test for reviewing factual findings of administrative agencies, has been defined as \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion!)]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bulluck, supra, </em>283 Md. at 512, 390 A.2d at 1123).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It is well established that \u201creviewing courts are under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Engelman, </em>345 Md. 402, 411, 692 A.2d 474, 479 (1997)). Accordingly, we may reverse an administrative decision premised on erroneous legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Additionally, we are obligated to \u201creview the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency,\u201d because their decisions are <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson, supra, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d at 211; <em>Bulluck, supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124). The Court of Appeals has consistently stated that an adjudicatory agency\u2019s decision can only be reviewed on grounds identical to those relied upon by the agency. <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 112 n. 12, 771 A.2d 1051, 1053 n. 12 (2001). Finally, in an administrative appeal, the appellant bears the burden of establishing an error of law or that the agency\u2019s final decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Taylor v. Harford County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 222-23, 862 A.2d 1026, 1031 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Doe contends that the ALJ was correct and that the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the ALJ. Doe main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tains that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions were correct as a matter of law because the AL J found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">[T]he evidence is clear that neither [Doe] nor [J.C.] forced [M.C.] out of the house, i.e., kicked him out of the house, as it were.... At the time that [Doe] told [the local department officer] that [M.C.] was not welcome back home, [M.C.] didn\u2019t even want to return, indicating he was fearful of returning, even though [the local department officer] had quickly determined that no [neglect] had occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Based on these findings, Doe argues that he did not eject or throw M.C. out of the home. Doe proffers that M.C.\u2019s health and welfare were never at risk because the local department immediately took charge of M.C. Doe further argues that the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact concerning whether Doe forced M.C. out of the house allowed for multiple interpretations. Accordingly, Doe contends that because the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were open to multiple interpretations, the circuit court should have remanded the case for further clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The local department responds that the ALJ\u2019s decision was legally incorrect and that the ALJ misunderstood the legal implications of the local department\u2019s taking charge of M.C. when it was informed that Doe and J.C. would not allow M.C. to return to their home. Additionally, the local department contends that the manner in which M.C. left the home is not critical to a finding of neglect in this case. Therefore, the local department maintains that the circuit court\u2019s decision was correct and a remand was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">According to \u00a7 5-701(s) of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">\u2018Neglect\u2019 means the leaving of a child unattended or other failure to give proper care and attention to a child by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of the child under circumstances that indicate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">(1) that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(2) mental injury to the child or a substantial risk of mental injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">FL \u00a7 5-701(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">When a member of a Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) investigates a case of alleged neglect, he or she may arrive at one of three conclusions: 1) indicated child neglect; 2) unsubstantiated child neglect; or 3) ruled out child neglect. CO-MAR 07.02.07.13. In the instant case, the local department officer reached a finding of indicated child neglect. Thereafter, the ALJ reversed this decision and ruled out child neglect. The circuit court reversed the ALJ, finding that the local department\u2019s finding of indicated child neglect was correct under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The elements necessary to reach a finding of \u201cindicated\u201d child neglect and \u201cruled out\u201d child neglect are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">A. Indicated Child Neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">(1) Neglect\u2014Other than Mental Injury. Except as provided in \u00a7 A(2) of this regulation, a finding of indicated child neglect is appropriate when there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">(a) A current or prior failure to provide proper care and attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">(b) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the failure to provide proper care and attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">(c) The failure to provide proper care and attention was by the child\u2019s parent or caretaker; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">(d) The nature, extent, or cause of the failure to provide proper care and attention indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">(2) Neglect\u2014Mental Injury. A finding of indicated child neglect with mental injury is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">(a) A current or prior mental injury caused by a failure to provide proper care and attention and characterized by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>observable, identifiable, substantial impairment to the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function, which may be shown by the need for specific psychiatric, psychological, or social work intervention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">(b) The failure to provide proper care and attention to the child was by a parent or caretaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">(c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the failure to provide proper care and attention; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">(d) The nature and extent of the failure to provide proper care and attention indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">C. Ruled Out Child Neglect. A finding of ruled out child neglect is appropriate when child neglect did not occur. A finding of ruled out may be based on credible evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">(1) There was no failure to provide proper care and attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">(2) The child\u2019s health or welfare was not harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">(3) The individual alleged to be responsible for the child neglect was not a parent or a caretaker; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">(4) The alleged victim was not a child at the time of the failure to provide proper care and attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">We have held that a court does not need to wait until a child suffers physical or mental injury prior to determining that neglect occurred. <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 735, 614 A.2d 999, 1003 (1992). Neglect can be found if a child is placed in a significant risk of harm. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, neglect may be found if, depending on the facts, an act or omission of the child\u2019s caretaker creates a substantial risk of harm. <em>In re Andrew A., </em>149 Md.App. 412, 418, 815 A.2d 931, 935 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">In the instant case, the local department officer found neglect was \u201cindicated.\u201d This finding was based on the undisputed fact that M.C. was under eighteen when Doe and J.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>refused to let him return to their home. Doe and J.C. were M.C.\u2019s sole caregivers when they refused to allow M.C. to return home. The local department officer found that Doe and J.C.\u2019s actions placed M.C.\u2019s welfare at a substantial risk of harm because M.C. had nowhere else to go and he needed extensive attention and medication due to his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The ALJ reversed the local department officer\u2019s determination, finding instead that neglect could be ruled out. This decision was predicated on the fact that M.C. was at all times in the custody and care of either Doe and J.C. or the local department. When the local department ascertained that M.C. was no longer allowed to return home, it had no choice but to act and take custody and care of M.C. Because there was no lapse in time between when M.C. was not allowed to return home and when the local department took custody, the ALJ determined that M.C.\u2019s health and welfare were never at a substantial risk of harm. In that context, the ALJ held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">I find that [Doe]\u2019s actions did not harm [M.C.l\u2019s health.... In fact, the unchallenged evidence is that [Doe] and [J.C.] went out of their way to provide these necessities. So clearly there was no current harm to [M.C.]\u2019s health or welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Once it was clear to [the local department officer] and the local department that [M.C.] had no place to stay, he in essence became a charge of the local department. That being the case, there was no risk, and certainly no substantial risk, that [M.C.]\u2019s health or welfare would be harmed by not getting the necessities mentioned by [the local department officer]. In fact, the local department actually took charge of [M.C.]; found him temporary shelter and a foster care placement. The fact that his needs were being met is evidenced by the testimony of Ms. Pratt, the Poster Care Worker, who testified that she arranged for [M.C.] to be in physical therapy, get to physician appointments, remind him to take his medicine and to take a bath, and the like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The local department has failed to demonstrate that [M.C.]\u2019s health or welfare was harmed in any manner or that there was a substantial risk of such harm. Therefore, the determination that neglect was indicated is not consistent with the facts or the law. Furthermore, because the local department has failed to show any harm or any substantial risk of harm, the determination that is consistent with the law and the evidence is that neglect is ruled out....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">We find that the ALJ\u2019s finding is legally incorrect under the undisputed circumstances of this case. We have held on multiple occasions that a finding of neglect may be based on a substantial risk of harm to the child if the DSS does not take charge of the child. <em>See Owens, supra, </em>182 Md.App. at 54-55, 957 A.2d at 204 (affirming an ALJ\u2019s determination that a child had been neglected when her guardian would not let her return home); <em>In re Nathaniel A., </em>160 Md.App. 581, 601, 864 A.2d 1066, 1078 (2005) (finding a child was a CI\u00d1A, and therefore neglected, based solely on the substantial risk of harm if the child remained in custody of her mother and was not placed into foster care).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Indeed, if we agreed with the legal findings of the AL J, so long as the local DSS (or the equivalent governmental agency) was able to care for a child, it would be nearly impossible to find a child in substantial risk of harm. DSS is tasked with protecting children from situations nearly identical to those presented in the instant case. Accordingly, there will almost never be a situation when a child is not allowed to return home in which DSS does not immediately take charge of the child to ensure his or her health and well being.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The ALJ based his finding on the actions and abilities of the local department. Instead, the focus should have been on the impact the actions of Doe and J.C. could have had on M.C. had the local department not taken charge of M.C. \u201cThe purpose of subtitle 7 [of the Family Law Article] is to protect children\u2014not to protect persons alleged to have neglected or abused children.\u201d <em>Owens, supra, </em>182 Md.App. at 50, 957 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>at 202. In short, the actions or capabilities of DSS to take care of a child after an incident occurred are irrelevant in determining whether a child was placed at a substantial risk of harm due to an incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Additionally, before a court can commit a child to the care of DSS, the child must be found to be a child in need of assistance. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-819 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d). A CINA determination must be based on a finding that \u201c[t]he child has been abused, has been neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder.... \u201d CJ \u00a7 3-801(f)(l). Clearly, M.C. does not have a developmental disability or a mental disorder. As such, the finding that M.C. was a child in need of assistance must have been based on abuse or neglect. Therefore, the fact that the local department took charge of M.C. after he was found to be a child in need of assistance cannot possibly relieve Doe and J.C. of responsibility for neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Our decision that the ALJ\u2019s finding is legally incorrect is further buttressed by our ruling in <em>Owens, supra. </em>In that case, we upheld an ALJ\u2019s finding of neglect on nearly identical facts and circumstances presented here. In <em>Owens, </em>Mrs. Owens and her husband voluntarily took custody of their niece, Sandy, when Sandy was thirteen years old. After taking custody of Sandy, Mr. and Mrs. Owens cared for her for approximately two years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At some point, Sandy decided that she did not want to live with her aunt and uncle and moved in with a neighbor and her boyfriend\u2019s family. Due to behavioral issues, Mr. and Mrs. Owens decided that they would not allow Sandy to return home. The local department initiated an investigation into potential neglect and filed a CINA petition. At the CINA hearing, the DSS officer told Mrs. Owens that he would not charge her with neglect if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>would agree to take Sandy back into her care. Mrs. Owens refused. The DSS officer issued a finding of indicated neglect, and Sandy was found to be a child in need of assistance. Owens appealed the finding of neglect, which was affirmed by both the circuit court and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The only difference between <em>Owens </em>and the instant case is that the ALJ determined that Mr. and Mrs. Owens kicked Sandy out of the house. Doe proffers that this difference makes <em>Owens </em>inapplicable to the instant case. This suggestion, however, is misplaced. The manner in which the child was removed from the home was not the focus in <em>Owens. </em>The focus was the risk of harm to the child at the time the child was not allowed to return home. By not allowing the child to return home, the child in both cases was legally placed at substantial risk of harm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision was incorrect as a matter of law and the circuit court did not err in reversing his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Doe further argues that even if the circuit court believed the ALJ\u2019s conclusions were incorrect, it should have remanded the case rather than reversing the decision of the ALJ. This argument is based on Doe\u2019s belief that the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding whether M.C. was kicked out of the home were open to multiple interpretations. Doe maintains that the circuit could not determine whether the ALJ decided that Doe threw M.C. out of the house. Doe argues the circuit court\u2019s inability to reconcile the ALJ\u2019s factual findings whether Doe threw M.C. out of the home required a remand of the case. <em>See Simonds v. Simonds, </em>165 Md.App. 591, 611, 886 A.2d 158, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>170 (2005) (\u201cWe are unable to reconcile these conflicting factual findings, and must therefore remand for further proceedings at which the circuit court will ... resolve the conflict in its factual findings.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">While Doe is correct that a remand is required in certain instances, critical facts are not in conflict in this proceeding. The critical determination was M.C.\u2019s status when Doe and J.C. decided to bar him from returning home, not whether they kicked him out. Additionally, the findings of the ALJ demonstrate that the manner in which M.C. was removed from Doe\u2019s home was not critical to the decision in this case. The ALJ specifically noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">At the time [Doe] told [the local department officer] that [M.C.] was not welcome back home, [M.C.] didn\u2019t even want to return, indicating that he was fearful of returning....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Once it was clear to the [local department officer] and the local department that [M.C.] had no place to stay, he in essence became a charge of the local department. That being the case, there was no risk, and certainly no substantial risk, that [M.C.\u2019s] health or welfare would be harmed by not getting the necessities mentioned by [the local department officer].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In reaching his conclusion, the ALJ determined that M.C. was not at substantial risk of harm because he became a charge of the local department. Therefore, it is of no consequence how M.C. left the home. Critically, M.C. was not allowed to return home, and, as a result, his welfare was placed at a substantial risk of harm. Accordingly, we reject Doe\u2019s argument that the circuit court was required to remand the case to the ALJ for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">For the reasons stated above, the ALJ erred as a matter of law in ruling out neglect of the child. Accordingly, the circuit court was legally correct in reversing the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
