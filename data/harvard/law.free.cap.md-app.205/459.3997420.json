Hayes, and the appellee, Darien J. Pratchett, were involved in an automobile accident in the parking lot of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club located on Ballpark Road in Bowie, Maryland. Hayes was an employee of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club Tire Center, and Pratchett was his supervisor in the tire center. On August 15, 2006, Hayes signed a release agreement resolving any claims that he may have had against BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc. arising from the accident. On February 11, 2009, Hayes filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County asserting a single count of negligence against Pratchett. On October 22, 2010, Pratchett filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Hayes was precluded from bringing a civil action against Pratchett by the Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute. Specifically, Pratchett asserted that, as a supervisor performing a nondelegable duty of the employer in the course of his employment, he was immune from civil suit pursuant to Md. Code (1991, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-509 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 10, 2011, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>granted summary judgment in favor of Pratchett. On the same day, Hayes filed this appeal. He presents a single issue for us to decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">Whether the circuit court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that the exclusive remedy available to appellant was through the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In proceedings before the circuit court, the parties agreed to present a joint statement of facts, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">This case arises out of an automobile accident that took place in the parking lot of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, located on Ballpark Road in Bowie, Maryland, on July 26, 2006. At all relevant times, ... Hayes[ ] was a BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club employee who was leaving the BJ\u2019s parking lot, and ... Pratchett[] was a BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club supervisor in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tire service center. While ... Pratchett supervised ... Hayes during their work together in the tire center, at the time of the accident in question, [Pratchett] was neither supervising nor directing [Hayes] as [Hayes\u2019s] shift had ended for that particular day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">At approximately 1:40 PM on the day in question, [Pratchett], while working, was in the process of moving a customer\u2019s 1998 Honda Accord from a parking space into the tire service center. Due to the nature of the parking space and surrounding vehicles, [Pratchett\u2019s] vision to the right of the vehicle was obstructed. Accordingly, [Pratchett] sounded the car\u2019s horn to alert those nearby, and then proceeded to reverse the vehicle out of the space. [Hayes], proceeding through the same area of the parking lot in his own 2002 Ford Taurus, collided with the vehicle operated by [Pratchett], and both automobiles sustained damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">On December 22, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on Pratchett\u2019s motion for summary judgment. At the end of the hearing, the court granted Pratchett\u2019s motion concluding that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and \u201cthat on the basis of the facts of this case ... there is a nondelegable duty that the employer has and ... the Plaintiff[\u2019s] exclusive remedy here is under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute.\u201d Important to the court\u2019s decision was that the accident took place in the BJ\u2019s parking lot, and that the supervisor was driving a customer\u2019s car, not his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In granting a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court must determine \u201cthat there are no genuine disputes as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Laing v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>180 Md.App. 136, 152, 949 A.2d 26 (2008) (citing Md. Rule 2-501). \u201cIn reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, appellate courts focus on whether the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion was legally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 949 A.2d 26 (citation omitted). <em>See also Logan v. LSP Marketing Corp., </em>196 Md.App. 684, 703, 11 A.3d 355 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>418 Md. 588, 16 A.3d 978 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Hayes argues that he is entitled to a reversal because the duty to safely operate a motor vehicle is personal to each driver and not a nondelegable duty of the employer. He asserts that as the facts demonstrated, Pratchett was operating a motor vehicle at the time of the accident and was not acting as a supervisor or in a supervisory capacity with regard to Hayes. According to Hayes, because his complaint alleged breach of due care and not negligent entrustment or failure to provide a safe environment, it is irrelevant that Pratchett was driving a customer\u2019s vehicle, as Pratchett\u2019s direct act of negligence caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Pratchett responds that, under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, he was responsible for providing a safe work environment for his employees at the time of the underlying accident. According to Pratchett, the safety of the workplace was a nondelegable duty on the part of each party\u2019s employer, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club. In other words, if Pratchett was negligent in moving a customer\u2019s vehicle as alleged, then he was negligent in the performance of the employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to maintain a safe work environment for Hayes and other subordinate employees. Pratchett contends that, because routine work assignments and supervision are aspects of the nondelegable duty of providing employees a safe place to work, he is entitled to immunity as he was working within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the circuit court erred in determining that Hayes\u2019s sole remedy for his injuries arising from the accident with Pratchett was through the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201cThe Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute was enacted in 1914 to compensate employees who were injured in the course of their employment.\u201d <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 496, 520 A.2d 717 (1987). The Statute \u201cembodies a comprehensive scheme to withdraw all phases of extra-hazardous employments from private controversy and to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>vide sure and certain relief for injured [workers], their families and dependents regardless of questions of fault.\u201d <em>Hastings v. Mechalske, </em>336 Md. 663, 672, 650 A.2d 274 (1994) (citation omitted). It was intended to replace the common law tort system, which had previously been an injured employee\u2019s sole means of obtaining compensation for work related injuries, and had proven to be inadequate for this purpose. <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 496, 520 A.2d 717. Moreover, the Statute was intended to strike a balance between the interests of workers and employees. <em>Id. </em>As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Johnson v. Mountaire Farms of Delmarva, Inc., </em>305 Md. 246, 250, 503 A.2d 708 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">Workers lost their right to sue their employers for negligence but gained the right to quick and certain compensation for injuries sustained during the course of their employment, regardless of fault. <em>See Wood v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>260 Md. 651, 660-61, 273 A.2d 125, 131 (1971); <em>Victory Sparkler Co. [v. Francks,] </em>147 Md. [368, 376-77, 128 A. 635, 638 (1925).] In return, employers lost their defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow servant rule but gained the advantage of having their liability limited. <em>Wood, supra, </em>260 Md. at 660-61, 273 A.2d at 131; <em>Victory Sparkler Co., supra,, </em>147 Md. at 376-77, 128 A. at 638; <em>see also </em>2A A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 65.11 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute requires that employers of covered employees provide compensation for accidental personal injuries sustained by the covered employee regardless of the employer\u2019s fault. LE \u00a7 9-501.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Statute further states that \u201cthe compensation provided under this title to a covered employee or the dependents of a covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>employee is in place of any right of action against any person.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-509(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, where a third party is responsible for the covered employee\u2019s injury, the covered employee may either make a claim under the statute or bring an action for damages against the third party. LE \u00a7 9-901.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Hastings, </em>336 Md. at 673, 650 A.2d 274, a covered employee\u2019s ability to sue a third party for damages arising from the employee\u2019s injury includes coemployees of the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Although LE \u00a7 9-901 does not preclude tort actions between coemployees, it does exclude an action in tort by an employee against his employer. <em>Hill v. Knapp, </em>396 Md. 700, 711, 914 A.2d 1193 (2007); <em>Suburban Hosp. v. Kirson, </em>362 Md. 140, 145-46, 763 A.2d 185 (2000); <em>Athas v. Hill, </em>300 Md. 133, 137, 476 A.2d 710 (1984); <em>Hutzell v. Boyer, </em>252 Md. 227, 232, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>249 A.2d 449 (1969). This immunity from suit can extend to supervisory coemployees when the supervisor is performing a nondelegable duty of the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">[A] supervisory coemployee performing a nondelegable duty of the employer\u2014such as providing a safe place to work\u2014 does not thereby assume a personal duty toward his or her fellow employees. <em>[Athas v. Hill, </em>300 Md. 133, 148, 476 A.2d 710 (1984) ]. Such an employee is entitled to the benefit of the employer\u2019s immunity, even though he or she negligently performed the employer\u2019s duty.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Hastings, </em>336 Md. at 673, 650 A.2d 274. <em>Kruse v. Schieve, </em>61 Wis.2d 421, 213 N.W.2d 64 (1973),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which the <em>Athas </em>and <em>Hastings </em>Courts cited, is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cThe duty of proper supervision is a duty owed by a corporate officer or supervisory employee to the employer, not to a fellow employee. Under what circumstances can a duty be owed to a fellow employee additional to and different from the duty of proper supervision that is owed to the employer by a corporate officer or supervisory employee? Clearly something extra is needed over and beyond the duty owed the employer. In <em>Hoeverman </em>[u <em>Feldman, </em>220 Wis. 557, 265 N.W. 580 (1936) ], that added element was provided by the company president directing a particular employee to operate a particular machine in a particular manner. In <em>Wasley [v. Kosmatka, </em>50 Wis.2d 738, 184 N.W.2d 821 (1971) ], that additional factor was provided by the corporate officer actually driving the truck which caused the fatal injury. In both cases we deal not with any general duty or responsibility owed the employer but an affirmative act which increased the risk of injury. In both cases the officer\u2019s or supervisory employee\u2019s affirmative act of negligence went beyond the scope of the duty of the employer, which is nondelegable to \u2018provide his employees with a safe place to work, <em>i.e., </em>safe conditions.\u2019 If the corporate officer, in <em>Hoeverman, </em>had not personally directed the particular operation to be done in a particular manner, there would have been no basis for holding that he had become a coemployee and owed a common-law duty to a fellow employee under the circumstances. If the corporate officer, in <em>Wasley, </em>had not driven the truck that caused the injury, there would have been in that case no factual basis for finding him to have the status and duty of a fellow employee. If the company president and supervisory employee, in <em>Pitrowski [v. Taylor, </em>55 Wis.2d 615, 201 N.W.2d 52 (1972) ], had not been directly engaged in the truck loading that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>caused the injury, we see in that record no basis for holding either to have been coemployees with a common-law duty owned to the worker injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Athas, </em>300 Md. at 145-46, 476 A.2d 710 (quoting <em>Kruse, </em>213 N.W.2d at 67-68).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Athas, </em>the Court of Appeals thoroughly discussed the liability of a supervisory coemployee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute. There, Athas, a restaurant employee at a country club, was attacked with a knife by a coemployee. <em>Athas, </em>300 Md. at 134, 476 A.2d 710. Athas sued the supervisors at the country club asserting that they negligently discharged their duty to provide a safe place to work by hiring Athas\u2019s attacker despite knowing of the attacker\u2019s violent disposition. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 476 A.2d 710. The Court of Appeals held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute prevented Athas from recovering from the supervisors because the supervisors were performing the nondelegable duty of their employer to provide a safe place to work. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 476 A.2d 710. In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">Under Maryland law the employer owes his employees a nondelegable duty to provide a safe place to work and, thus, the employer cannot escape liability for breach of this duty. Therefore, a supervisory coemployee who performs the nondelegable duty of the employer does not thereby assume a personal duty toward his fellow employees. The decisions in <em>Jarka Co. v. Gancl, </em>149 Md. 425, 131 A. 754 (1926), and <em>Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. 214, 300 A.2d 665 (1973), established that at common law the ultimate responsibility of performing nondelegable duties remains with the employer notwithstanding the fact that an employee has been charged with carrying them out. Thus, under the workmens\u2019 compensation scheme as well as under the common law, the supervisory employee should not be held liable for breaching a duty such as providing a safe place to work. On the other hand, if a supervisory employee commits an affirmative, direct act of negligence toward an employee, and therefore negligently breaches a personal duty of care which is reasonably owed by him to the fellow employee, then he would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>immunized from liability. In that circumstance, he would be a third party within the meaning of [Md.Code, (1985), Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Article 101, \u00a7 58.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 476 A.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Thus, the Court in <em>Athas </em>recognized the established rule that \u00a7 58 allows an employee to sue a coemployee whose negligence caused an injury. The Court concluded that in performing managerial and personnel functions, such as providing Athas a safe place to work and retaining only nonviolent employees, the supervisors discharged only a nondelegable duty of the country club, their employer, and had no duty to Athas. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 476 A.2d 710. Nor did the Court find evidence that the supervisors committed any direct act of negligence by failing to reveal or inquire into the chefs criminal record. <em>Id. </em>The Court, therefore, found no duty of care owed by the supervisor to Athas.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Athas </em>Court adopted the \u201cWisconsin approach\u201d7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> regarding the liability of a supervisory coemployee, which it described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">Under the Wisconsin approach, a corporate officer or supervisory coemployee is subject to liability for negligence if he breaches a duty of care which he personally owed to the plaintiff. The negligence must have been directed toward the particular plaintiff and the tortious act must have been outside the scope of the employer\u2019s responsibility. The coemployee is not liable merely for breaching a duty that the employer owed the injured employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin stated, \u201cLiability of a corporate officer in a third party action must derive from acts done by such officer in the capacity of a coemployee, and may not be predicated upon acts done by such officer in his capacity as corporate officer.\u201d <em>Kruse v. Schieve, </em>61 Wis.2d 421, 426, 213 N.W.2d 64 (1973) <em>(Kruse I). </em>The rationale of this view \u201cis that worker\u2019s compensation is the exclusive remedy against an employer, and if there is a failure of an officer or employee to perform a duty owed to the employer, the employee\u2019s recourse is solely against the employer. When an officer or supervisor fails to perform the employer\u2019s duty, the failure is that of the employer, not the officer or supervisor.\u201d1<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aho\">300 Md. at 143-44, 476 A.2d 710 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The <em>Athas </em>Court further illustrated the Wisconsin approach by making reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in <em>Canter v. Koehring Co., </em>283 So.2d 716 (La.1973).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There, the Court delineated several principles for determining when an officer, agent, or employee should be held individually liable to the injured coemployee. The <em>Canter </em>Court concluded that an officer, agent, or employee could be held individually liable to an injured coemployee where the officer, agent, or employee has breached a duty delegated to him or her by the employer through personal fault. <em>Id. </em>at 721. However, the Court immediately clarified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEN\">personal liability cannot be imposed upon the ... employee simply because of his general administrative responsibility for the performance of some function of the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ment.... If the defendant\u2019s general responsibility has been delegated with due care to some responsible subordinate ... he is not himself personally at fault ... unless he ... knows or ... should know of its non-performance or mal-performance and has nonetheless failed to cure the risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the <em>Athas </em>Court concluded that \u201c[t]he duty of proper supervision is a duty owed by a corporate officer or supervisory employee to the employer, not to a fellow employee.\u201d 300 Md. at 147, 476 A.2d 710 (citation omitted). Therefore, a supervisory coemployee is not liable for injuries to a covered employee when the supervisor is delegating work assignments or supervising others in the performance of these assignments because such conduct is an aspect of the employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide a safe place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The Court of Appeals later stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\"><em>Athas ... </em>makes clear that a supervisor\u2019s negligence in the performance of his or her supervisory duties is not enough to subject him or her to personal liability. Only if the supervisor directs a negligent act toward a particular fellow employee will the supervisor be held personally liable. Thus, in order for a supervisory coemployee to avoid liability under the Act, at the time of the accident, the supervisor must be: (1) performing a nondelegable duty of the employer; and (2) acting within the course of his or her employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Hastings, </em>336 Md. at 676, 650 A.2d 274. With regard to the first prong,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals defined a nondelegable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>duty as \u201ca duty which the employer is \u2018primarily and absolutely obliged\u2019 to perform properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. 214, 238-39, 300 A.2d 665 (1973)). \u201cIn other words, the employer remains liable with respect to the duty, regardless of the acts or omissions of the person entrusted to perform it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Under the Statute, \u201can employer has the nondelegable duty to provide each employee of the employer with employment and a place of employment that are (1) safe and healthful; and (2) free from each recognized hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676-77. Additionally, the Court stated that \u201c \u2018routine work assignments and supervision are aspects of the nondelegable duty of providing employees a safe place to work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677 (quoting <em>Ramey v. Martin-Baker Aircraft Co. Ltd., </em>874 F.2d 946, 952 (4th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute, as well as the common law, the supervisory employee will not be held liable for breaching a duty such as providing a safe place to work. <em>Athas, </em>300 Md. at 149, 476 A.2d 710. \u201cOn the other hand, if a supervisory employee commits an affirmative, direct act of negligence towards an employee, and therefore negligently breaches a personal duty of care which is reasonably owed by him to the fellow employee, then he would not be immune from liability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In this case, the essence of Hayes\u2019s argument is that Pratchett was not performing the nondelegable duty of his employer to provide a safe place to work because he was not acting in a supervisory capacity when moving the customer\u2019s car. Rather, Hayes asserts that because Pratchett moved the car himself, he was acting in his capacity as a coemployee, and he owed Hayes a personal duty to exercise due care when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>operating a motor vehicle. Therefore, Hayes avers that Pratchett is not protected by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute because Pratchett committed a direct act of negligence in breach of his personal duty to exercise care when operating a motor vehicle and not his employer\u2019s duty to provide a safe workplace. Hayes argues that, unlike in <em>Hastings, </em>where the supervisory coemployee did not perform the act that caused the injuries to the employee but rather failed to ensure that the employee operating the equipment that caused the injury was properly trained, Pratchett performed the negligent act that resulted in Hayes\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In response, Pratchett argues that because he was a supervisor who was performing a specific job function in moving the customer\u2019s car, while he was on the job and at his place of employment, his duty to operate the customer\u2019s car in a safe manner was part of his employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace. Therefore, because Pratchett was performing a nondelegable duty of his employer within the scope of his employment, he claims that he is entitled to immunity from suit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute. Pratchett\u2019s argument hinges on the proposition that the performance of routine work assignments by a supervisor is an aspect of the nondelegable duty of providing employees with a safe place to work. Pratchett relies on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ramey v. Martin-Baker Aircraft Co., </em>874 F.2d 946 (4th Cir.1989), to support his argument, but a close reading of <em>Ramey </em>reveals that a supervisory co-employee performs his employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace where he delegates work assignments or supervises other employees in the performance of their assignments, but not where he performs the assignments himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In <em>Ramey, </em>the plaintiff, an Air Force trained aircraft mechanic working for Kirk-Mayer, Inc., was assigned to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for service at the Navy\u2019s Patuxent River Naval Air Test Center. 874 F.2d at 947. On October 27, 1981, Ramey\u2019s supervisor, Quinten Rix, instructed Ramey to assist Thomas E. Waller, another aircraft mechanic, with the removal of the SJU-5 ejection seat from an F-18. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>While removing the ejection seat, Ramey and Waller inadvertently triggered the seat\u2019s explosive charges. <em>Id. </em>The explosion caused Ramey to fall from the plane\u2019s wing resulting in injuries to Ramey\u2019s left leg and foot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Ramey and his wife sued Martin-Baker, McDonnell Douglas, Rix, and Waller in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s Comity seeking damages for Ramey\u2019s injuries and for harm to their marital relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 948. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of McDonnell Douglas holding that it was immune from suit under Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute. <em>Id. </em>The remaining defendants removed the suit to the federal district court. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Rix and Martin-Baker finding that Rix was immune from suit under the Statute because he was a supervisory employee acting in furtherance of a nondelegable duty of his employer and that Martin-Baker was immune from suit under the military contractor defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of both defendants. As to the judgment in favor of Rix, the Fourth Circuit held that Rix\u2019s actions \u201cwere in furtherance of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s nondelegable duty to Ramey, and created no personal duty of care on Rix\u2019s part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 952. In reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit stated that under the Wisconsin approach to coemployee liability, which the Court of Appeals adopted in <em>Athas, </em>\u201croutine work assignments and supervision are aspects of the nondelegable duty of providing employees a safe place to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in <em>Ramey, </em>the supervisory coemployee was not performing the routine work assignment himself, instead he was \u201cperforming McDonnell Douglas\u2019s duty of selecting and assigning workers to tasks\u201d and supervising those workers in the performance of their tasks. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it is not the performance of routine work assignments that is part of the employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace but the selection of which employees will perform which assignments and fthe supervision of employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in the performance of their assignments that is part of the employer\u2019s nondelegable duty. Here, Pratchett was not assigning tasks or supervising employees in the performance of their tasks; rather Pratchett was performing the task himself in moving the customer\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>Ramey, </em>the Fourth Circuit faced a similar fact pattern as the Court of Appeals in <em>Athas. </em>In <em>Ramey, </em>the plaintiff alleged that his supervisor was negligent in assigning him to remove the ejection seat from an F-18, while in <em>Athas, </em>the plaintiff alleged that his supervisors were negligent in hiring the employee who attacked him. In both cases, the allegedly negligent act involved supervisory tasks such as the distribution of work assignments or the hiring of employees. However, here, Pratchett was not assigning a task, but performing the task himself. This is a key distinction because in performing the task himself, Pratchett is no longer acting in his role as a supervisor, but instead he is acting as a coemployee. As a coemployee, he is not performing his employer\u2019s duty to provide a safe workplace. Rather, as the driver of a motor vehicle, he owes a personal duty of care to all other travelers, including Hayes. <em>See Brehm v. Lorenz, </em>206 Md. 500, 505, 112 A.2d 475 (1955) (\u201cThe general rule has been established in this state that every automobile driver must exercise toward other travelers on the highways that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under similar circumstances.\u201d) (citing <em>Cocco v. Lissau, </em>202 Md. 196, 95 A.2d 857 (1953); <em>Domeski v. Atl. Ref. Co., </em>202 Md. 562, 97 A.2d 313 (1953); <em>State v. Magaha, </em>182 Md. 122, 32 A.2d 477 (1943)). <em>See also Tavarez v. Klingensmith, </em>372 F.3d 188, 193 n. 4 (2004) (applying Virgin Island law and holding that a truck driver, who was injured when his left front tire blew out, could not sue his supervisor, who had refused to grant permission to have the left front tire replaced, because the supervisor was performing the employer\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace, but distinguishing Tavarez\u2019s suit involving the existence of a safe workplace from suits for breach of a personal duty such as exercising due care in operating a vehicle.).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The circuit court erred in its granting of the motion for summary judgment. The brief statement of facts indicates that Pratchett, while working, was in the process of moving a customer\u2019s 1999 Honda Accord from a parking space when the vehicle collided with a vehicle Hayes was driving. There is no indication in the record that this was the duty of a supervisor rather than a coemployee in the tire service center. The driving of the vehicle by Pratchett would be the \u201cadditional factor\u201d or \u201csomething extra\u201d which caused the injury to Hayes. That duty is different from the duty of proper supervision that is owed to the employer by a corporate officer or a supervisory employee. A supervisory employee\u2019s affirmative act of negligence goes beyond the scope of the nondelegable duty of the employer to \u201cprovide his employees with a safe place to work, <em>i.e. </em>safe conditions.\u201d <em>Athas, </em>300 Md. at 146, 476 A.2d 710 (citation omitted). Pratchett\u2019s actions at the time of the accident, on the facts as agreed, would not have entitled him to immunity from suit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.

Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 72.11, that as of 1983, only eleven states, including Maryland, extended immunity from liability for negligence to the employer alone and thus permitted suit against coemployees. It is interesting to note that, as Larson puts it, \"A strong tide toward coemployee immunity has been running. As recently as 1974, a majority of states permitted suits against coemployees.\u201d Several of the courts which have determined that coemployees are subject to tort liability have extended this rationale to corporate officers and supervisory employees. Larson states that, \"The clearest case for such liability is that in which the corporate officer is acting in his capacity as an employee\u2014even a managerial employee\u2014and in which the conduct involved is merely the kind of negligence or other misconduct that would normally make any coemployee liable.\u201d Other cases turn on \"the extent to which the defendant is in effect the alter ego of the corporation, or is at least acting as an agent or representative of the corporation, or being charged with violation of duties that are not his personal duties, but the nondelegable duties of the corporation.\" Further, Larson notes that, \"Suit is also barred if the duty allegedly violated was a nondelegable duty of the corporation, such as the duty to provide a safe place to work\u2014as distinguished from the duty of care owed by one employee to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">300 Md. at 140-41 (internal citations omitted).

In order for Pratchett to benefit from his employer\u2019s immunity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute, the second prong requires him to have acted in the course of his employment.
