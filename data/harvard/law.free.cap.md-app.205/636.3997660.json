The Yoders own and operate an adjacent dairy farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">MALPF is an entity of the Maryland Department of Agriculture. <em>See </em>MD. CODE ANN., AGRIC., \u00a7 2-502. Section 2-501 of the Agriculture article<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014It is the intent of the Maryland General Assembly to preserve agricultural land and woodland in order to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">(1) Provide sources of agricultural products within the State for the citizens of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">(2) Control the urban expansion which is consuming the agricultural land and woodland of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">(3) Curb the spread of urban blight and deterioration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">(4) Protect agricultural land and woodland as open-space land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">To carry out that intent, MALPF is granted the power to (1) \u201center into contracts generally and to execute all instruments necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes,\u201d and (2) to \u201cacquire, by gift, purchase, devise, bequest or grant, easements in gross or other rights to restrict the use of agricultural land and woodland as may be designated to maintain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>character of the land as agricultural land or woodland[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2\u2014504(2)\u2014(3).

Members of LGVA, [including the Yoders,] in fact, have placed their properties in conservation easements, including MALPF easements. The LGVA has contributed funds towards the purchase of at leas[t] one easement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">On January 12, 1997, the State, on behalf of MALPF, purchased an \u201cagricultural preservation easement\u201d on Belle-vale Farm for $796,500. Under the deed of easement (\u201cthe Easement Agreement\u201d), it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">the intention of the parties that the said land shall be preserved solely for agricultural use in accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Article, Title 2, Subtitle 5 ... and that the covenants, conditions, limitations and restrictions hereinafter set forth, are intended to limit the use of the above described land[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The section of the Easement Agreement labeled COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, and RESTRICTIONS states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">[A](l)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this instrument, the above described land may not be used for any commercial, industrial, or residential purpose....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[A] (3) The grantor reserves the right to use the above described land for any farm use, and to carry on all normal farming practices ... including any operation directly relating to the processing, storage, or sale of farm, agricultural or woodland products produced on the said above described land____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">[B] (6) If the Grantor has any doubts concerning the easement, covenants, conditions, limitations or restrictions herein contained with respect to any particular use of the said land, the Grantor may submit a written request to the Grantee for consideration and approval of such use.... [B](9) This easement shall be in perpetuity, or for so long as profitable farming is feasible on the Grantor\u2019s land and may be released only by the Grantee as provided by Agriculture Article, Section 2-514[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The Easement Agreement also states that it \u201cshall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland and the parties hereby expressly agree that the courts of the State of Maryland shall have jurisdiction to decide any question arising hereunder after all administrative remedies have been exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">As stated by MALPF\u2019s Executive Director, under the [Easement Agreement], consistent with \u00a7 2-513 ... Bellevale [is] prohibited generally from using the land for any commercial, industrial, or residential purpose. There are, however, exceptions to this general prohibition\u2014 one notable exception [is] the ability to use the land, as determined by MALPF, for \u201cfarm and forestry related uses and home occupations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">On August 1, 2007, Bellevale filed a request with MALPF seeking,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>to construct a 7,000 to 10,000 square foot building to house [a] creamery operation, processing facility and a farm store. As well, [Bellevale is] requesting a parking area that would accommodate fewer than 10 vehicles. The parking area is proposed to be located on Long Green Road with the creamery directly behind it. A short distance of access on an existing farm lane may be needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">According to MALPF\u2019s Executive Director,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">[o]n October 23, 2007, MALPF, pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 2\u2014513(b)(i), reviewed the ... request and approved the creamery operation, as proposed to the Board, having determined that the operation was a \u201cfarm related use\u201d that complements [Bellevale\u2019s] organic dairy operation\u2014a use that is compatible with agriculture and MALPF\u2019s program. MALPF took this action after being advised that the Baltimore County Agricultural Land Preservation Advisory Board already had reviewed [Bellevale\u2019s] request and voted favorably on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Appellants submit,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">[a]fter MALPF\u2019s approval of the Creamery Operation on October 23, 2007, [a]ppellants requested that MALPF reconsider its approval and enforce the terms of the Easement Agreement and State and County law. Appellants also requested that the Secretary of Agriculture intervene. Despite these requests, MALPF and the Secretary have refused to take further action to enforce the Easement Agreement and the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">On April 4, 2008, in Zoning Case No.2008-0506 (\u201cthe Zoning Case\u201d), appellants filed a \u201cPetition for Special Hearing\u201d before the Deputy Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County in order to determine \u201cwhether a dairy processing facility is permitted in an R.C.2 zone[.]\u201d On August 12, 2008, the Deputy Zoning Commissioner found the proposed facility was permitted. Appellants appealed that decision to the Board of Appeals, but later dismissed their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>On May 30, 2008, based on MALPF\u2019s approval of the proposed creamery, appellants filed an amended four-count complaint with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u2022 Count I: Writ of Mandamus\u2014MALPF\u2019s Failure to Enforce the Easement Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u2022 Count II: Writ of Mandamus\u2014MALPF\u2019s Failure to Enforce the Provisions of State and Local Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\u2022 Count III: Declaratory Judgment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u2022 Count IV: Permanent Injunctive Relief</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">As characterized by appellants, the complaint seeks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">(i) a writ of mandamus ordering MALPF to enforce the terms of the Easement Agreement and provisions of State and County law, (ii) a declaration that the proposed Creamery Operation violates the Easement Agreement, as well as State and County law, because it constitutes a commercial and/or industrial use, and (iii) an order permanently enjoining Bellevale from constructing and operating the Creamery Operation and further violating the Easement Agreement and State and County law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">In response, on June 27, 2008, Bellevale filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, averring that appellants \u201clack standing to bring their equitable claims[.]\u201d After the circuit court issued its Motions Ruling on August 6, 2008, and \u201cHELD [the motion] FOR FURTHER INFORMATION,\u201d MALPF filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, primarily based on appellants\u2019 lack of standing on all counts of the complaint. On October 7, 2008, appellants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, \u201crequesting] that the Court find, as a matter of law, that the Creamery Operation is a commercial use that is prohibited by terms of the Easement Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">At the hearing on the motions, the court said,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">[I] need to sit down and to make a declaratory judgment on the motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, whatever is filed in here, to the effect that this is an issue involving standing ... [and] the legislature has not indicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ed one way or another through any historical development or legislative history that I can see, whether or not there should be standing. So that means that we fall back on the issue of whether an easement itself gets standing and they have not said one way or another about that. In fact, they have specifically said that they have appointed somebody in the position called the State of Maryland, the Office of the Attorney General, etcetera to enforce this. Now, the next step is do they as property owners have this right. Well, <em>Sugarloaf </em>is very, very interesting because the property owners had that right because they were having a dump there and they were burning all sort of toxic materials and the Butlers and the other people claimed that it was harming their land. So I am not going to say the Court of Appeals is ever going to close the door completely on saying that these adjacent property owners don\u2019t have any right. What I\u2019m saying is I can\u2019t see that they have anything different as did occur in <em>Sugarloaf </em>because their properties were being destroyed or hurt through toxic substances coming over which is not manifest here because I don\u2019t see it, except for the desire not to have competition in this regard, I can\u2019t see your clients are in any other position here able to be articulated different from the public.... I, there\u2019s two matters of first impression here, that is the right or not of the public to enforce this easement and, secondly, the situation as to whether or not it\u2019s going to be considered a charitable trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">On March 19, 2009, the circuit court issued its ORDER OP COURT DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">It is ORDERED and DECLARED by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that [appellants] have no authority under [subtitle 5 of title 2 of] the Agriculture Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, ... Maryland law pertaining to easementsf,] or otherwise by any other principle or doctrine of law to challenge through direct primary jurisdiction the right of [Bellevale] to construct a creamery operation on property owned by [Bellevale] as they have alleged in their Complaint. [Appellants] have no standing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>It is the right of [appellants] to carry their dispute with [appellees] through the zoning, planning and permit process of land use enacted by the State of Maryland and Baltimore County as those laws pertain to [Bellevale Farm]. Any citizen who qualifies for standing in the administrative process may initiate that process with Baltimore County government____</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">For reasons more completely explained by this court on the record at the time of the hearing on the open motions, it is determined by this court that neither the legislative history of the MALPF enactment, the wording of the Statutory scheme or any COMAR regulation enacted pursuant to the statute indicate any intent to allow a taxpayer, an adjoining property owner, or any other individual or entity to challenge the decision made by MALPF to approve the creamery operation by direct application of primary jurisdiction with this court....</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">As a result of a consideration of the pleadings and papers filed in this case and upon a hearing it is ORDERED by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">1. [Bellevale\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment ... is GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">2.

There has been a gradual relaxation of this rule.... The Courts now generally recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>nize the right of a third-party beneficiary to sue on a contract made expressly for the benefit of either a donee beneficiary or a creditor beneficiary.

Extending the doctrine further, a conservation easement grantor\u2019s intent in perpetually protecting his or her property through use of a conservation easement would need to suffice as, or be substituted with, the trust creator\u2019s intent to create a charitable trust. Further, the land trust holding the conservation easement would have to fit the definition of a public charity or charitable trust in order for the analogy of a conservation easement donated by a property owner to a land trust to property placed in a charitable trust for the public\u2019s benefit to be viable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 776-777.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The primary benefit of construing a conservation easement as a charitable trust is the doctrine of <em>cy pres, </em>which is \u201c[o]ne of the unique features of the law of charitable trusts.\u201d Ronald R.

Richardson, Note, <em>Conservation Easements as Charitable Trusts in Kansas: Striking the Appropriate Balance Among the Grantor\u2019s Intent, the Public\u2019s Interest, and the Need for Flexibility, </em>49 Washburn L.J. 175, 192 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Based on the case law and the relevant statutory authority, and assuming, without deciding, that an agricultural preservation easement purchased by MALPF or the State for the benefit of MALPF qualifies as a \u201cconservation easement,\u201d we are not persuaded that the charitable trust doctrine <em>must </em>be applied to purchased, nonperpetual agricultural preservation easements, nor even that it <em>should, </em>be. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In Maryland, the elements necessary to the creation of a charitable trust are: (1) a fiduciary relationship, (2) duties of trustees, (3) trust property, (4) manifestation of intention, and (5) a charitable purpose. <em>Rosser v. Prem, </em>52 Md.App. 367, 377, 449 A.2d 461 (1982) (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts, \u00a7 348).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As to elements (l)-(3), appellants contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>These elements may be applied with little difficulty [to the Easement Agreement]. First, the conveyance of an agricultural preservation easement creates a fiduciary relationship because MALPF can be said to hold the property in trust for the benefit of the public, and owes an affirmative obligation to ensure that the land is used for the purposes specified in the easement and the law. Second, the Easement Agreement imposes duties on MALPF as trustee. Among other things, MALPF is charged with approving releases of lots from the easement, conducting inspections of the easement property, and enforcing the terms of the agreement. Third, there is trust property, of course, which is defined by property description in the Easement Agreement itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Elements (l)-(3) are not expressly disputed by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As to the fourth element, \u201capplication of the charitable trust doctrine to conservation easements requires finding that the grantor of the easement intended to create such a trust in the first place.\u201d Lindstrom, 9 Wyo. L.Rev. at 402. <em>See also </em>Restatement, \u00a7 351 (\u201cA charitable trust is created only if the settlor properly manifests an intention to create a charitable trust.\u201d). Comment b to \u00a7 351 recognizes that \u201c[n]o particular form of words or conduct is necessary for the manifestation of intention to create a charitable trust____A charitable trust may be created although the settlor does not use the word \u2018trust\u2019 or \u2018trustee.\u2019\u201d Appellants reference Austin Wakeman Scott &amp; William Franklin Fratcher, <em>The Law of Trusts </em>\u00a7 2.8, at 50 (4th ed. 1989),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">It is to be noticed that an express trust may arise even though the parties in their own minds did not intend to create a trust....

An express trust may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>created even though the parties do not call it a trust, and even though they do not understand precisely what a trust is; it is sufficient if what they appear to have in mind is in its essentials what the courts mean when they speak of a trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Appellants argue that \u201c[t]he Easement Agreement, the statutory scheme, and the MALPF program as a whole, all evidence the intent to create\u201d a charitable trust. Here, the Easement Agreement states that it is \u201cthe intention of the parties that the said land shall be preserved solely for agricultural use in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Article,\u201d with no mention of \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ctrustee.\u201d Section B(5) of the Easement Agreement expressly provides that the grantee, <em>i.e., </em>the State, \u201cto the use of the Department of Agriculture on behalf of\u2019 MALPF, may enforce the easement; it does not state any other parties who may enforce the easement. Nee <em>supra. </em>We find the following admonition instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">[wjhether a conservation easement conveyance is intended by the grantor to create a charitable trust, ... even though the deeds of conveyance typically do not contain the words \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ctrustee;\u201d even though many easement donors may not know that the intended relationship is called a trust; ... and even though creation of a charitable trust may add a dimension to the relationship between the landowner and easement holder that neither contemplated and that may substantially complicate that relationship; <em>is not something to be lightly inferred.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Lindstrom, 9 Wyo. L.Rev. at 403 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">First, negative easements or restrictive covenants are traditionally based on property law. <em>See id. </em>at 400; <em>see also </em>Jeffrey A. Blackie, Note, <em>Conservation Easements and the Doctrine of Changed Conditions, </em>40 Hastings L.J. 1187, 1190 (1989) (\u201cConservation easements do not fit easily into any previously existing category of property interests\u201d); Duncan M.

In addition, it can be argued that in the case of conservation easements, \u201cgrantors can reasonably assume that the easements they convey may be modified or terminated in the same manner as other easements, <em>i.e., </em>if both parties to the easement agree,\u201d Lindstrom, 9 Wyo. L.Rev. at 404. Therefore, \u201c[o]nly in the event of application of the charitable trust doctrine (or similar doctrines) to easement agreements are the parties precluded from jointly agreeing to amendments\u201d to conservation easements. <em>Id. </em>at 408. In this case, the Easement Agreement expressly provides for modification or termination by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">Second,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">The course of action between landowners and easement holders belies any intent by either party to the easement that the easement conveyance was intended to create a charitable trust under which modification or termination was not a matter, <em>within the context of existing legal constraints, </em>solely within the purview of the landowner and the easement holder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">When a landowner conveys a conservation easement, and the holder accepts the easement, they do so subject to the existing law of the state of the conveyance. As a matter of law, those who enter into an agreement are charged with knowledge of and make their agreements subject to, existing law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Parties to an agreement are presumed to know the law and to have contracted with reference to existing principles of law. These existing principles of law enter into and become a part of a contract as though referenced and incorporated into the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Lindstrom, 9 Wyo.

This observation undermines the argument that, in regard to conservation easements,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apm\">although municipalities and charitable organizations operate to benefit the public, history has shown that they cannot always be trusted to act in accordance with the public interest.

L.Q. 673, 700-01 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Fourth, although the applicability of the charitable trust doctrine may encourage some landowners to convey conservation easements, it may discourage others, as we discuss in more detail below. <em>Compare id. </em>at 675 (\u201cIndeed, the promise of permanent protection of cherished land has been a key selling point for land trusts attempting to convince private landowners to donate or sell conservation easements.\u201d), <em>and id. </em>at 702 (\u201cAd hoc, unsupervised modifications and termination of ostensibly \u2018perpetual\u2019 conservation easements would significantly undermine public confidence in the use of such easements as a land protection tool and chill future easement sales and donations.\u201d), <em>with </em>Lindstrom, 9 Wyo. L.Rev. at 410 (\u201c[T]he unpredictable and potentially intrusive effect of application of the [charitable trust] doctrine to conservation easements is highly likely, once word gets around, to discourage many landowners from contributing them in the future.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Fifth, the application of the charitable trust doctrine to a potentially <em>nonperpetual </em>conservation easement, such as the instant Easement Agreement, is particularly problematic, even among proponents of application generally. <em>See </em>McLaughlin, 34 Ecol. L.Q. at 707-712. Nonperpetual conservation easements include \u201ceasements that are drafted to endure indefinitely but expressly grant the holder some level of ... discretion to simply agree with the owner of the encumbered land to substantially modify or terminate the easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. We note that \u00a7 2-514.1, which was enacted by the General Assembly in 2004, states, \u201c[a]n easement whose purchase is approved by the Board of Public Works on or after October 1, 2004, shall be held by the Foundation in perpetuity.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKPq\">Here, the Easement Agreement states that \u201c[t]his easement shall be in perpetuity, <em>or for so long as profitable farming is feasible on the Grantor\u2019s land </em>and may be released only by the Grantee as provided by Agriculture Article, Section 2-514[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). In pertinent part, \u00a7 2-514 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMO\">(a) <em>Legislative </em>intent.\u2014It is the intent of the General Assembly that any easement whose purchase is approved by the Board of Public Works on or before September 30, 2004, be held by the Foundation for as long as profitable farming is feasible on the land under easement, and an easement may be terminated only in the manner and at the time specified in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>(b) <em>Request for </em>review.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, any time after 25 years from the date of purchase of an easement, the landowner may request that the easement be reviewed for possible termination of the easement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">(f) <em>Repurchase by </em>landowners.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">(1) If the request for termination is approved, an appraisal of the subject land shall be ordered by the Foundation at the expense of the landowner requesting termination of the easement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">(2) (i) No more than 180 days following the appraisal required under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the landowner may repurchase the easement by paying to the Foundation the difference between the fair market value and the agricultural value of the subject land, as determined by the appraisal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the agricultural value of the land is determined by the appraisal method that was in effect at the time the easement was acquired by the Foundation, either by the agricultural appraisal formula under \u00a7 2\u2014511(d) of this subtitle or by an appraisal that determines the price as of the valuation date which a vendor, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept, and which a purchaser, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay for a farm unit with land comparable in quality and composition to the property being appraised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Easement Agreement, which was executed in 1997, is potentially a terminable easement because \u00a7 2-514 provides an approach, after twenty-five years, for termination. In that situation, the Easement Agreement and the statute recognize that continuation of the Easement Agreement may become impracticable, and that a return to the pre-easement status is appropriate. Because of the flexibility built into the document and the legislation, there is no need to rely on <em>cy pres </em>and the charitable trust doctrine to react to a change of circumstances. <em>See </em>McLaughlin, 34 Ecol. L.Q. at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Section 2-514\u2019s legislative history supports our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>[i]t is recognized that, due to the voluntary nature of the easement purchase program, certain farms may be placed under easement only to find that, in the future, they are surrounded by development.

Lynn, </em>33 Mass.App.Ct. 271, 276, 598 N.E.2d 682 (1992) (\u201cWe have found no authority, nor is any cited to us, to the effect that the receipt of substantial consideration prevents a grantor from conveying property to a municipality in such manner as to establish a public charitable trust.\u201d). Some commentators agree. <em>See </em>Matthew J. Richardson, Note, <em>Conservation Easements as Charitable Trusts in Kansas: Striking the Appropriate Balance Among the Grantor\u2019s Intent, the Public\u2019s Interest, and the Need for Flexibility, </em>49 Washburn L. J. 175, 195 (2009) (\u201cApplying charitable trust law to conservation easements protects the public\u2019s interest, which exists regardless of whether the easement was donated or purchased.\u201d). As one commentator has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">[o]ne reason the topic of consideration cannot be completely ignored here is that every conservation easement transaction has some element of consideration. Ordinarily, a donor wants to see the land protected in a particular way and receives a promise to that effect, if nothing else. In that sense, preservation of property through a conservation easement agreement can be seen as a joint venture. When both parties have made substantial contributions toward a mutual goal of preserving property, the intent of both parties is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>presumably relevant to determining whether a trust has been established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Arpad, 37 Real Prop. Prob. &amp; Tr. J. at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">That said, we are not persuaded that the Easement Agreement before us reflects a \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d or a charitable intent on the part of Bellevale. Not only was the MALPF program created in part for economic reasons, but the consideration paid by MALPF for the easement\u2014$796,500\u2014was obviously beneficial to Bellevale and the continuation of Belle-vale\u2019s farming operation so long as it was practical to do so.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> From the \u201csettlor\u2019s\u201d viewpoint, any benefit to the public was incidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In sum, this case involves a conservation easement purchased for what we understand to be the grantor\u2019s asking price, and which expressly provides that it may be terminated after twenty-five years upon satisfaction of certain conditions. We think it unnecessary to our result, and express no opinion as to how the principles generally applicable to charitable trusts would apply to expressly perpetual conservation easements conveyed in whole or in part as charitable gifts, or purchased under other statutes or provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\n<em>C.

In doing so, like appellants in this case, 120 West Fayette invoked the primary jurisdiction of the court. On appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the Mayor and City, the Court opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">[bjecause \u201cland use ... is at least one of the prime considerations with which an urban renewal plan is reasonably sure to be concerned,\u201d the principles[, as espoused in <em>Sugarloaf, </em>] that confer standing upon an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner to seek judicial review of land use decisions, logically extend to an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner that is challenging a municipalities\u2019 allegedly illegal avoidance of urban renewal and procurement ordinances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 272, 964 A.2d 662 (quoting <em>Master Royalties Corp. v. Baltimore, </em>235 Md. 74, 92, 200 A.2d 652 (1964)). It concluded that, because \u201c120 West Fayette\u2019s property is located in close proximity to the urban renewal area and ... [bjecause, 120 West Fayette has alleged that it will be able to both see and hear the allegedly illegal redevelopment of these properties from its doorsteps, it follows that 120 West Fayette will be directly impacted by and has a direct interest in the redevelopment,\u201d and thus has standing. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 964 A.2d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As observed by appellants, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cland-use regulation\u201d as \u201c[ajn ordinance or other legislative enactment intended to govern the development of real estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884 (7th ed. 1999). Like the urban renewal plan in <em>120 W. Fayette, </em>\u201cland use ... is at least one of the prime considerations\u201d in the legislative effort to preserve agriculture and woodland, and, in that sense, MALPF\u2019s approval of a proposed use of Bellevale Farm for a creamery operation is a land use decision. <em>Id. </em>at 272, 964 A.2d 662. Although not a traditional land-use regulation, the program provides a financial incentive to landowners to voluntarily restrict their land to agricultural and woodland use rather than commercial, industrial, or residential use. <em>See </em>Craig A. Nielsen, <em>Preservation of Maryland Farmland: A Current Assessment, </em>8 U. Balt. L.Rev. 429, 430 (1979) (MALPF \u201cadministers a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>program for the purchase of development right easements from farm owners. The Foundation affords an opportunity for local governments to coordinate their <em>land-use </em>plans with each other and with the state in order to develop a workable comprehensive plan to promote the economic development of Maryland.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also supra </em>n. 22 (\u201cland-use objectives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Based on <em>120 W. Fayette\u2019s </em>extension of the standing principles of <em>Sugarloaf </em>and <em>Bryniarski </em>beyond the judicial review arena, it appears that adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owners may have standing to challenge as an illegal or <em>ultra vires </em>action the approval of a proposed use of land subject to a MALPF easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Appellants, in their amended complaint, assert that the Yoders own property adjacent to Bellevale Farm and that \u201c[appellants] will suffer irreparable harm if [appellees] are permitted to violate the Easement Agreement and the provisions of state and local law.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In their response to Belle-vale\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment, appellants also state, in the context of their \u201cintended beneficiaries\u201d argument, that they have standing because the Yoders \u201cown land adjacent to or nearby the easement property.\u201d In Bellevale\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, it states that the Yoders are \u201cneighbors.\u201d And in its answer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the amended complaint, MALPF admits that the Yoders own adjacent property.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Following the reasoning of <em>120 W. Fayette, </em>the Yoders would be considered <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved, and thus relieved of the burden of <em>alleging </em>specific harm. Once appellants alleged, uncontested, that the Yoders were adjacent and/or neighbors to Bellevale Farm, appellees, to challenge \u201cthe fact of aggrievement,\u201d had \u201cthe burden of denying such damage in [their] answer ... and of coming forward with evidence to rebut the presumption of aggrievement.\u201d <em>120 W. Fayette, </em>407 Md. at 271, 964 A.2d 662 (citing <em>Sugarloaf </em>344 Md. at 297, 686 A.2d 605). In the circuit court, neither appellee denied that the Yoders will \u201csuffer irreparable harm,\u201d or offered \u201cpersuasive evidence or argument indicating that [the Yoders] would not be impacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 964 A.2d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Thus, we conclude that the circuit court, without the benefit of <em>120 W. Fayette, </em>erred in determining on summary judgment that the Yoders lacked neighbor property owner standing.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The circuit court, on remand, and after appellees have the opportunity to rebut any presumption of aggrievement, should reconsider the standing issue in light of <em>120 W. Fayette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\n<em>III. Exhaustion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In its brief, Bellevale avers that \u201c[appellants\u2019 lack of administrative success ... does not grant them any right to pursue their equitable claims that are the subject of this appeal, wherein they effectively seek the same relief from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Circuit Court in a new cause of action.\u201d We agree. But to the extent Bellevale is suggesting that the failure to proceed with judicial review in the Zoning Case was a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>United States v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">[t]he doctrine of primary jurisdiction, like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, is concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties. \u2018Exhaustion\u2019 applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course. \u2018Primary jurisdiction,\u2019 on the other hand, applies where .a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In our view, appellants did not fail to satisfy their administrative remedies simply because they were unsuccessful in the Zoning Case and did not pursue judicial review. In the Zoning Case, appellants filed a \u201cPetition for Special Hearing\u201d before the Deputy Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County in order to determine \u201cwhether a dairy processing facility is permitted in an R.C.2 zone[.]\u201d The Commissioner determined that the proposed creamery constituted a \u201cfarm\u201d as defined in the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations. Here, the merits question is whether the proposed creamery qualifies as a \u201cfarm related use\u201d under \u00a7 2-513 of the Agriculture article. While these questions may be <em>similar </em>and the answer the same in each, they are not the <em>same </em>question. As MALPF admits, \u201cBellevale Farm\u2019s development and zoning rights, which were already addressed at the Baltimore County admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>istrative level, are totally separate from Appellee MALPF\u2019s permission for the proposed creamery at the Bellevale Farm under the MALPF Easement.\u201d It is possible, however, that some aspects of their aggrievement claims, <em>e.g., </em>stormwater runoff or other environmental claims, may have been addressed in the prior administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Although we are not persuaded that appellants have standing under the third-party beneficiary or charitable trust theories, the Yoders, as neighbors to Bellevale Farm, are deemed to be <em>prima, facie </em>aggrieved under the reasoning of <em>120 W. Fayette, </em>subject to appellees rebutting their aggrievement, and thus their standing, on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED.

The floor report for House Bill 777 of the 2004 General Assembly, which amended \u00a7 2-514 and created \u00a7 2-514.1, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">This bill requires an easement to be perpetual if its purchase by [MALPF] is approved by the Board of Public Works on or after October 1, 2004____According to MALPF, the original intent when MALPF was established was that easements would be perpetual. The repurchase option was included to allow the possibility of exceptional circumstances when profitable farming would no longer be possible on a property and the repurchase of its easement restrictions would be consistent with local and State land-use objectives. MALPF advises that most land preservation programs in other states do not have a repurchase option and those that do make it extremely difficult for an easement to be repurchased. In addition, MALPF is the only state easement purchase program that does not have an explicitly perpetual easement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">.
