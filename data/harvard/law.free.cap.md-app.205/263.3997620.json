What would seem to be certain to most was apparently not so to appellant, Sheng Bi. Hence, we shall discuss the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>FACTS and PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Alleging that he suffered bodily injury as a result of an automobile collision that occurred in Baltimore City on April 4, 2005, appellant filed a complaint against appellee, Delores A. Gibson, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on March 12, 2008. That complaint was timely filed, as limitations did not run until April 4, 2008. For some reason, unexplained in the record, appellant, by counsel, entered a voluntary dismissal of the complaint on September 10, 2008. That dismissal was filed before appellee filed an answer (and perhaps before appellee was served with the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Subsequently, on March 6, 2009, appellant, by counsel, filed a complaint in negligence against appellee, alleging the same facts that were said to support the earlier-filed complaint in 2008. Appellee responded by filing a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations as provided in Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.) Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings (\u201cCJ\u201d) \u00a7 5-101 (\u201cA civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Subsequent to several filings that are not relevant to the issue before us, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellant moved for revision, which the circuit court denied on August 23, 2010. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal followed on September 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The Maryland statute of limitations is codified at CJ \u00a7 5-101, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">A civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In <em>Doe v. Archdiocese of Washington, </em>114 Md.App. 169, 176, 689 A.2d 634 (1997), we pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">The purposes of statutes of limitations are to provide adequate time for a diligent plaintiff to bring suit as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to ensure fairness to defendants by encouraging prompt filing of claims. Statutes of limitations thus strike a balance between protecting the interest of a plaintiff who pursues his claim diligently and allowing repose to a potential defendant. They are intended to ensure fairness of preventing \u2018stale\u2019 claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(internal citations and quotations omitted). Moreover, statutes of limitations are to be strictly construed and courts will decline to apply strained construction that evades the effect. <em>Decker v. Fink, </em>47 Md.App. 202, 206, 422 A.2d <em>389 </em>(1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">There are, of course, several well delineated exceptions to the three-year statute of limitations: fraud, disability of a plaintiff, application of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d rule, for example. None of those exceptions, however, is remotely applicable to the facts before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Appellant argues that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article Section 5-101 on its face addresses the issue of timing only as to the commencement of the initial action and not to the refiling of such an action. Appellant filed Complaint 1 in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Appellant\u2019s Complaint 2 is essentially a restatement of Complaint 1 and it is neither a separate action nor an action based on different claims. The trial court erred precisely because it based its decision on Complaint 2 as a separate and distinct claim. In fact, the claim stated in Complaint 2 not only relates back to that alleged in Complaint 1, they are exactly one and the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Appellant further implicates Md. Rule 2-506(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as permitting a refiling of the same claim, after dismissal, asserting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201c[i]f such claimant were not permitted to refile the action thereafter, his/her rights would permanently be impaired.... \u201d Maryland Rule 2-506 relates to voluntary dismissal and provides no authority regarding limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Appellant essentially reads into CJ \u00a7 5-101 the ability to construe his re-filed complaint as \u201crelating back\u201d to the first-filed complaint. In support of his argument, appellant points out that other jurisdictions have enacted statutes that would permit filing a second complaint under the facts of this case. Specifically, at oral argument, he posited that several states, including Virginia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Illinois,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and North Carolina,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>relation back statutes that extend the time period for filing a complaint after an original complaint is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. While we recognize that other jurisdictions have enacted such statutes, Maryland has not done so. The enactment of such a statute is a matter of public policy left to the discretion of the General Assembly. We reject appellant\u2019s invitation to establish such a policy judicially.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Hence, in Maryland, following the voluntary dismissal of a civil action without prejudice, a second complaint based upon the same facts still must be filed within the applicable limitations period, absent assertions of fraud, implication of the discovery rule, or other recognized exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">As noted by appellant, an exception to this rule is set forth in CJ \u00a7 5-119,5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but that statute specifically excludes from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>purview \u201ca voluntary dismissal of a civil action or claim by the party who commenced the action or claim.\u201d Accordingly, no provision exists that would permit the untimely filing of appellant\u2019s second complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We are reminded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">[t]he courts are required to enforce the Statute of Limitations as adopted by the Legislature and have no authority to create an unauthorized exception merely on the ground that such exception would be within the spirit or reason of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\"><em>Young v. Mayne Realty Co., </em>48 Md.App. 662, 666, 429 A.2d 296 (1981) (citing <em>McMahan v. Dorchester Fertilizer Co., </em>184 Md. 155, 40 A.2d 313 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We hold, therefore, that neither CJ \u00a7 5-101 nor Md. Rule 2-506 provide appellant with the ability to avoid the bar of limitations where he voluntarily dismissed his complaint and filed an identical claim, based on the same facts, more than three years after the accrual of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Therefore, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\">. In his brief, appellant asks:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">1. Can Maryland Rule 2-506(a) be construed to require that a notice of voluntary dismissal of an action be filed within the statute of limitation period and, specifically, within three years of the date of the accrual of the action in a personal injury case?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">2. Does Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article Section 5-101 require that the same action be refiled within the original statute of limitation period in this case?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\">.

Except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute, a party who has filed a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may dismiss all or part of the claim without leave of court by filing (1) a notice of dismissal at any time before the adverse party files an answer or (2) by filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties to the claim being dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. Virginia\u2019s relation back statute is codified at Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-229(E) (2007 Repl.Vol.), and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">(3) If a plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-380, the statute of limitations with respect to such action shall be tolled by the commencement of the nonsuited action, and the plaintiff may recommence his action within six months from the date of the order entered by the court, or within the original period of limitation, or within the limitation period as provided by subdivision B 1, whichever period is longer. This tolling provision shall apply irrespective of whether the action is originally filed in a federal or a state court and recommenced in any other court, and shall apply to all actions irrespective of whether they arise under common law or statute.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. Illinois\u2019s relation back statute is codified at 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217 (West 2011). The prior version of this statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">In the actions specified in Article XIII of this Act or any other act or contract where the time for commencing an action is limited, if judgment is entered for the plaintiff but reversed on appeal, or if there is a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and, upon a motion in arrest of judgment, the judgment is entered against the plaintiff, or the action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff, or the action is dismissed for want of prosecution, or the action is dismissed by a United States District Court for lack of jurisdiction, or the action is dismissed by a United States District Court for improper venue, then, whether or not the time limitation for bringing such action expires during the pendency of such action, the plaintiff, his or her heirs, executors or administrators may commence a new action within one year or within the remaining period of limitation, whichever is greater, after such judgment is reversed or entered against the plaintiff, or after the action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff, or the action is dismissed for want of prosecution, or the action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>dismissed by a United States District Court for lack of jurisdiction, or the action is dismissed by a United States District Court for improper venue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The statute was amended by Public Act 89-7 to exclude actions voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff or for want of prosecution; however, that act was held unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Best v.

Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of this or any other state or of the United States, an action based on or including the same claim. If an action commenced within the time prescribed therefor, or any claim therein, is dismissed without prejudice under this subsection, a new action based on the same claim may be commenced within one year after such dismissal unless a stipulation filed under (ii) of this subsection shall specify a shorter time.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">.
