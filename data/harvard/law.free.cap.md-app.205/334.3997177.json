Tetso, appellant, of second-degree murder. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Criminal Law Art. (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 2-204. On November 23, 2010, appellant was sentenced to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment with all but eighteen years suspended followed by five years of supervised probation. Appellant noted an appeal raising five issues, which we slightly rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I. Was appellant denied the constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and to the effective assistance of counsel when a <em>venire </em>member, who served on the jury, responded that she believed appellant should be required to prove his innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">II. Was the evidence insufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for second-degree murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">III. Did the circuit court err in limiting appellant\u2019s questions of several witnesses that would have allegedly established that the victim had run away from home in the past and that the victim was seen by witnesses after the date on which the State claimed that she was murdered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">IV. Did the circuit court\u2019s instruction on circumstantial evidence constitute plain error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">V. Did the circuit court err in allowing the prosecutor to argue law in closing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We answer all five questions in the negative, and therefore, affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Appellant and Tracey Leigh Tetso (\u201cTracey\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were married in September of 2004, after a \u201csix or seven year[]\u201d relationship.

And they were kind of talking, I would say, in code. They mentioned some things about a cell phone, getting a new card for more minutes and meeting at a specific location. Not the recent location, the first location. Something to that effect. And so I stopped listening at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">And then I don\u2019t know exactly what day after that I contacted [appellant] to let him know I found something he might be interested in hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Liebermann testified that appellant wanted to hear the call and came in on a Saturday at the beginning of December to listen to the call.

Appellant told Detective Marll that a private investigator, hired by some of Tracey\u2019s co-workers, had talked to him and informed him that Tracey was supposed to go to a concert on March 6, 2005, with Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">During the first interview, Detective Marll asked appellant about his marriage and appellant stated that he and Tracey were having \u201cmarital problems.\u201d Appellant told Detective Marll that he believed Tracey was \u201cseeing someone else\u201d so he \u201cwent to where [Tracey] worked and approached ... and asked Liebermann asking if it was okay to listen to her phone calls.

Appellant told Detective Marll that in February, 2005, he obtained a protective order against Christian because of a confrontation that occurred in a convenience store. On February 10, 2005, however, appellant had the protective order rescinded.

This burden of proof never shifts to him. He does not have to testify, he does not have to present any evidence, he does not even have to argue or interpose objections. He can sit before you mute saying and doing nothing at all during the entire trial. And if the State does not prove to you beyond and to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt that he is guilty, you must find him innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">Is there any member of this panel who\u2019s unable to accept this legal principle?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">No juror responded affirmatively to these questions.

Bias</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Appellant contends that he was denied the right to an impartial jury because in response to a <em>voir dire </em>question, Juror No. 289\u2014who served on the jury\u2014indicated that she believed appellant should be required to prove his innocence. Appellant argues that his counsel and the circuit court failed to ensure the impaneling of an impartial jury by not striking or questioning further Juror No. 289. Appellant asserts that the <em>voir dire </em>\u201cplainly exposed [Juror No. 289\u2019s] actual bias in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>her clearly held belief that [appellant] had an obligation to prove his innocence.\u201d Appellant maintains that even if the circuit court \u201chad no <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to strike [Juror No. 289] for cause, [appellant\u2019s] counsel most certainly did and his failure to do so amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel[.]\u201d In a reply brief, appellant argues that the record is sufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel as the only reason for appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s inaction was that he \u201cpurposefully put a biased juror on the jury, or, defense counsel failed to take note of the juror\u2019s obvious bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The State responds that appellant\u2019s claim that Juror No. 289\u2019s presence on the jury deprived him of a fair trial is not properly before this Court because appellant\u2019s counsel had twenty peremptory challenges and used only fifteen, and appellant has failed to ask for plain error review. Alternatively, the State contends that the circuit court did not err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>strike prospective Juror No. 289, and asks this Court to decline to address appellant\u2019s contention that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to strike Juror No. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A criminal defendant has the right to trial by an impartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV; <em>Owens v. State, </em>899 Md. 388, 405, 924 A.2d 1072 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1144, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008). <em>Voir dire </em>is the means by which to \u201cidentify and challenge unqualified jurors[.]\u201d <em>Owens, </em>399 Md. at 402, 924 A.2d 1072. As the Court of Appeals described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">The purpose of voir dire is to ensure and secure a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial by permitting the selection of a jury comprised of venirepersons who do not hold preconceived notions or biases that would affect the outcome of the trial. As we have said, in pursuit of this goal, a trial court must question the venire and consider whether any of the answers reveals such a bias. Any question likely to elicit disqualifying information must be asked. Failure to do so taints the objectivity and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>impartiality of the jury, with negative implications for the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\"><em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 664, 989 A.2d 1150 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201cBias is a question of fact, the existence of which is a matter left to the trial judge, the focal point in the process, whose predominant function in determining juror bias involves credibility findings whose basis cannot be discerned from an appellate record.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 113, 904 A.2d 534 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The standard of review for such findings is abuse of discretion. <em>Moore, </em>412 Md. at 654, 989 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Prospective jurors are presumed to be unbiased, and the challenging party has the burden of proof to overcome that presumption. <em>Hunt v.

Juror No. 289 was impaneled as the ninth juror. Juror No. 289 answered the following <em>voir dire </em>question affirmatively\u2014\u201c[i]s there any member of this panel who thinks that [appellant] should be required to prove his innocence\u201d\u2014 but was not asked follow-up questions by appellant\u2019s counsel or the trial judge regarding this response. The record reflects that after responding affirmatively to general <em>voir dire </em>questions, jurors were called to the bench for individual or follow-up questions. Juror No. 289 was called to the bench and asked individual questions. Appellant\u2019s counsel failed to ask Juror No. 289 any individual questions regarding her response to the question at issue. After the individual ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tioning was completed, appellant\u2019s counsel accepted Juror No. 289 without objection upon the request of the courtroom clerk to impanel the juror. Prior to the completion of jury selection, appellant\u2019s counsel was asked whether the entire jury, with Juror No. 289 impaneled as Juror No. Nine, was acceptable to the defense, to which appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cThe jury is acceptable to the Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As the State points out, appellant\u2019s counsel had twenty peremptory challenges and he failed to use all twenty. <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 728, 481 A.2d 201 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1062, 105 S.Ct. 1779, 84 L.Ed.2d 837 (1985) (\u201cIf disqualification for cause is improperly denied, but the accused has not exercised all allowable peremptory challenges, there is no reversible error.\u201d); <em>Larch v. State, </em>201 Md. 52, 57, 92 A.2d 463 (1952) (\u201cIt is a general rule that if a party knows a cause of challenge and does not take it at the proper time,\u2014that is, while the jury is being impanelled,\u2014he cannot avail himself of the defect afterwards.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, appellant not only failed to use his allotted twenty peremptory challenges, but he also: (1) failed to object that no individual questions were asked of Juror No. 289 as to her affirmative response to the question regarding appellant\u2019s requirement to prove his innocence by the trial court; (2) failed to ask individual follow-up questions himself; (3) affirmatively accepted Juror No. 289 for impaneling on the jury; and (4) affirmatively accepted the jury with Juror No. 289 as a member. As such, appellant has not preserved any issue as to Juror No. 289\u2019s inclusion on the jury for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Nonetheless, we shall briefly address the merits of appellant\u2019s complaint. Appellant contends that the record demonstrates that Juror No. 289 was actually or presumptively biased because she responded affirmatively to the <em>voir dire </em>question\u2014\u201c[i]s there any member of this panel who thinks that [appellant] should be required to prove his innocence?\u201d We disagree two-fold because: (1) the record does not substantiate that Juror No. 289 was actually or presumptively biased and (2) the trial judge was not required to <em>sua sponte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ask further questions of Juror No. 289. We first point out that during <em>voir dire, </em>Juror No. 289 was asked numerous <em>voir dire </em>questions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">Does any member of this panel have any difficulty in accepting and applying the rule of law that [appellant] is presumed to be innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">The State has the burden of proving [appellant] guilty beyond and to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt. This burden of proof never shifts to him. He does not have to testify, he does not have to present any evidence, he does not even have to argue or interpose objections. He can sit before you mute saying and doing nothing at all during the entire trial. And if the State does not prove to you beyond and to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt that he is guilty, you must find him innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Is there any member of this panel who\u2019s unable to accept this legal principle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Is there any member of this panel who believes that they would be unable to give [appellant] a fair and impartial trial based upon a personal opinion about the criminal justice system or the judicial system?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Juror No. 289 did not respond affirmatively to any of these questions. The question to which Juror No. 289 responded affirmatively asked: \u201cIs there any member of this panel who thinks that [appellant] should be required to prove his innocence?\u201d The question did not inquire as to whether this is the standard the juror would employ in deciding the case. Juror No. 289\u2019s lack of response to <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning an inability to accept the rule of law that the defendant is presumed innocent and the State having the burden to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt with that burden never shifting to the defendant, renders nugatory appellant\u2019s contention that Juror No. 289 was actually or presumptively biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Recently, in <em>Alford v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 582, 602-04, 33 A.3d 1004 (2011), we reviewed <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000), and unambiguously held that the statement by the Court of Appeals in <em>Dingle, </em>that it is the task of the trial judge to impanel a fair and impartial jury, does not stand for the proposition that a trial court automatically commits reversible error in failing to, <em>sua sponte, </em>ask follow-up questions of a juror.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Alford, </em>202 Md.App. at 602-03, 33 A.3d 1004:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">In <em>Dingle, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in asking two-part <em>voir dire </em>questions. 361 Md. at 8-9 [759 A.2d 819], The two-part <em>voir dire </em>consisted of the trial court asking the jury panel whether any juror had experiences, such as having been a victim of a crime,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or associations, such as being associated with police officers,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and whether these experiences or associations would affect the juror\u2019s ability to be a fair and impartial juror. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4 [759 A.2d 819]. The Court of Appeals held that the <em>voir dire </em>procedure usurped the court\u2019s responsibility to ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification because the procedure allowed \u201cthe individual venire person to decide his or her ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 21 [759 A.2d 819]. The Court of Appeals stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">Because [the trial judge] did not require an answer to be given to the question as to the existence of the status or experience unless accompanied by a statement of partiality, the trial judge was precluded from discharging his responsibility, <em>i.e. </em>exercising discretion, and, at the same time, the petitioner was denied the opportunity to discover and challenge venire persons who might be biased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">The effect on the petitioner is particularly egregious: as we have seen, the party who would challenge a venire person for cause has the burden of presenting facts demonstrating the disqualification. As already pointed out, the strike for cause process encompasses the situation where the motion to strike is made on the basis of information developed during the voir dire process, not simply where the prospective juror admits an inability to be fair and impartial. Without adequate voir dire, there simply can be no such showing. The ability to challenge for cause is empty indeed if no way is provided for developing or having access to relevant information. What the dissent said in <em>Davis [v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993) ] applies just as forcibly to the case sub judice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cWhen the inquiries that constitute proper voir dire are restrictively interpreted, so that the voir dire process does not produce any information other than that which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>automatically disqualifying, the defendant may be deprived of the right to a fair and impartial jury; he or she is completely at the mercy of the good faith, objectivity, and astuteness of the individual venirepersons. I believe that it is an abuse of discretion for the court to so restrict the <em>voir dire </em>process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 17-18 [759 A.2d 819] (some internal citations and quotations omitted). To be sure, in Dingle, the Court of Appeals stated \u201cthe trial judge is charged with impaneling of the jury and must determine, in the final analysis, the fitness of the individual venire persons.\u201d 361 Md. at 8, 759 A.2d 819. The Court of Appeals made the statement under circumstances in which jurors were allowed to determine whether they had the ability to be fair and impartial before responding affirmatively to general voir dire questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A25\">(Footnotes in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In this case, we note, as we did in <em>Alford, </em>202 Md.App. at 603-04, 33 A.3d 1004, that the trial judge did not employ the compound question format used in <em>Dingle. </em>Here, the trial judge specifically asked jurors to stand if they answered the question posed affirmatively. Prior to beginning the jury selection process, the trial judge advised the jury pool, in the presence of counsel, that: \u201cAfter we\u2019ve gone through all the questions, everybody that stands up for one or more questions will be invited up here to explain their answer. And while you\u2019re here, you may be asked some additional questions by the attorneys or me.\u201d As such, the trial judge provided the opportunity for appellant to ask individual questions of Juror No. 289, explore the juror\u2019s qualifications and potential bias, and challenge the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In sum, appellant has not preserved an issue for review concerning Juror No. 289 as he failed to object in any manner to the court not questioning the juror regarding her affirmative response that appellant should prove his innocence, and agreed that Juror No. 289 was acceptable to the defense. We see no merit in appellant\u2019s contentions that the record demonstrates Juror No. 289 was \u201cactually or presumptively biased\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and that the circuit court had an obligation to <em>sua sponte </em>conduct questioning of or strike Juror No. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">B. Structural Error</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Next, appellant contends that the failure of counsel and the circuit court to ask follow-up questions of Juror No. 289 regarding her affirmative response to the question\u2014\u201c[i]s there any member of this panel who thinks that [appellant] should be required to prove his innocence\u201d\u2014was structural error. Again, we disagree. Initially, we observe that appellant, by failing to object, has not preserved an issue as to structural error. <em>See Savoy v. State, </em>420 Md. 232, 243 n. 4, 22 A.3d 845 (2011) (\u201c[U]n-preserved structural errors are not automatically reversible, but, instead, are subject to plain error review.\u201d (Citations omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Nonetheless, we perceive no error.

A structural defect or error is one that \u201caffect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself[,] ....

Trial defects that the Supreme Court has held to be structural error include: deprivation of the rights to counsel at trial, to an impartial judge, to self-representation, and to a public trial, as well as unlawful exclusion of members of the defendant\u2019s race from a grand jury. <em>See id., </em>499 U.S. at 310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265. The types of trial error that the Supreme Court has held not to be structural include the admission of an involuntary confession, a defendant\u2019s statements obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, and an out-of-court statement by a non-testifying co-defendant. <em>See id., </em>499 U.S. at 309-311, 111 S.Ct. at 1265.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In <em>Redman v.

Moreover, in those cases where the Supreme Court, and indeed other courts, have found structural error mandating automatic reversal, the errors appear to be of constitutional magnitude. Such defects include a defective reasonable doubt instruction, racial discrimination in grand jury selection, denial of a public trial, total deprivation of counsel, and a judge who is not impartial.

In <em>Alston, </em>177 Md.App. at 27, 934 A.2d 949, where the defendant alleged the trial court erred when the jury was not sworn until the State completed its case, we found no structural error, stating that: \u201cThe jury was instructed, before hearing any evidence, that it must listen carefully to the evidence and that its verdict must be based solely on the evidence. It was then sworn before it began deliberations. To conclude that this was structural error would logically mean that we believe that taking the oath is a prerequisite to listening.

Failing to ask a juror follow-up questions has not been held to be structural error by the Supreme Court or Maryland appellate courts. As we discussed above, Juror No. 289\u2019s response to the question at issue, when assessed in context of the responses to other <em>voir dire </em>questions, does not lead to the conclusion that Juror No. 289 was actually or presumptively biased.

Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970)). \u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, 466 </em>U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential ... [and, for fairness, must] evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time [of the alleged deficient representation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In Maryland, a defendant\u2019s attack of a criminal conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel generally takes place at post-conviction review, where the opportunity for further fact-finding exists. <em>Mosley v. State, </em>378 Md. 548, 558-59, 836 A.2d 678 (2003) (\u201c[A] post-conviction proceeding pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Maryland Code, \u00a7 7-102 of the Criminal Procedure Article (2001), is the most appropriate way to raise the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d) (footnote omitted). In <em>Addison v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 159, 174-75, 990 A.2d 614, <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6A\">The Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated that the \u201cdesirable procedure\u201d for presenting claims of ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>assistance of counsel is through post-conviction proceedings. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 434, 439 A.2d 542 (1982) (citation and internal quotations omitted); <em>see also, e.g., Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 706, 759 A.2d 764 (2000). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">In essence, it is because the trial record does not ordinarily illuminate the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel, that a claim of ineffective assistance is more appropriately made in a post conviction proceeding^] Moreover, under the settled rules of appellate procedure, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel not presented to the trial court generally is not an issue which will be reviewed initially on direct appeal, although competency of counsel may be raised for the first time at a [ ] post conviction proceeding. Upon such a collateral attack, there is presented an opportunity for taking testimony, receiving evidence, and making factual findings concerning the allegations of counsel\u2019s incompetence. By having counsel testify and describe his or her reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of, the post conviction court is better able to determine intelligently whether the attorney\u2019s actions met the applicable standard of competence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(Alterations in original). In <em>Mosley, </em>378 Md. at 566, 836 A.2d 678, this Court discussed the exceptional instances in which an ineffective assistance of counsel claim may be raised on direct appeal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">The rare instances in which we have permitted direct review are instructive, because they indicate our willingness to entertain such claims on direct review only when the facts in the trial record sufficiently illuminate the basis for the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. As we explained in <em>In re Parris W., </em>[363 Md. 717, 727, 770 A.2d 202 (2001),] direct review is an exception that applies only when \u201cthe critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In this case, appellant seeks to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on direct appeal where the opportunity for further fact-finding does not exist. As noted above, the record fails to establish that Juror No. 289 was actually or presumptively biased, and this is a not a case involving structural error. We conclude, therefore, as we stated in Addison, 191 Md.App. at 175, 990 A.2d 614, \u201c[w]here, as here, the record sheds no light on why counsel acted as he did, direct review by this Court would primarily involve the perilous process of second-guessing, perhaps resulting in an unnecessary reversal in a case where sound but unapparent reasons existed for counsel\u2019s actions.\u201d (Citation omitted). The record in the instant matter sheds no light on the reasons for appellant\u2019s counsel not asking follow-up questions of Juror No. 289. The record is equally unclear as to the reason for counsel\u2019s failure to object to Juror No. 289\u2019s impanelment and his acceptance of the entire jury with Juror No. 289 as a member of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Counsel\u2019s failure to ask follow-up questions and to object may have been part of a strategy to obtain Juror No. 289 in lieu of other members of the panel, whom he may have deemed to be less desirable. For example, although Juror No. 289 responded affirmatively that she held the belief that appellant should prove his own innocence, counsel\u2019s assessment may have been that this was a belief that the juror could put aside, based on the juror\u2019s responses to other <em>voir dire </em>questions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As discussed above, Juror No. 289 did not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>spond affirmatively to other <em>voir dire </em>questions, including whether she would have difficulty in accepting and applying the rule of law that appellant is presumed to be innocent. The potential validity of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim cannot be determined without the opportunity for fact-finding during a post-conviction proceeding. Accordingly, we will not review the issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">II. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AWA\">A.

Appellant argues \u201cgiven that the State\u2019s case was based on entirely circumstantial evidence which was contradicted by other evidence supporting innocence, the circuit court erred in denying [his] motion for judgment of acquittal and sending the case to the jury.\u201d Appellant asserts that \u201cnothing presented by the [S]tate, even when considered in its totality, leads to a conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Tracey\u2019s death was a homicide or that [appellant] is the criminal agent.\u201d Appellant maintains that in this case there was \u201cno confession, no admission, no forensic evidence, no eyewitnesses, and no body\u201d and, as such, \u201cnothing short of speculation and conjecture can explain the guilty verdict in this case[.]\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The State responds that the issue is not properly before this Court as appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case arguing that the evidence was insufficient, but failed to renew the argument as to second-degree murder in moving for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence. Alternatively, the State contends that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for second-degree murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-324(a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA defendant may move for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts, or on one or more degrees of an offense which by law is divided into degrees, at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence. The defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the motion should be granted.\u201d \u201cThe language of the rule is mandatory.\u201d <em>State v.

A defendant may not argue in the trial court that the evidence was insufficient for one reason, then urge a different reason for the insufficiency on appeal in challenging the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>Graves v.

State, </em>315 Md. 474, 488-89, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989), the Court of Appeals determined that this Court erred in finding that the defendant had failed to preserve for appellate review his claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. In <em>Warfield, </em>the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, stating with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 554 A.2d 1238. The motion was denied and the defendant moved at the close of evidence stating: \u201cI would renew\u2014renew my Motion for Acquittal on all three Counts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 554 A.2d 1238. The trial judge again denied the motion. The Court of Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">When a party makes anew a motion for judgment at the conclusion of all the evidence and states that the motion is based upon the same reasons given at the time the original motion was made, or when a party \u201crenews\u201d a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>judgment and thereby implicitly incorporates by reference the reasons previously given, the reasons supporting the motion are before the trial judge. If, for any reason, the judge desires that the reasons be restated, the judge may simply say so, and the moving party must then state the reasons with particularity. If the judge does not wish the reasons restated, he or she may proceed to decide the motion on the grounds previously advanced. Obviously, when the moving party wishes to advance new or different reasons at the time the second motion is made, that party may do so, but should be careful to state whether the reasons being advanced are in lieu of or in addition to the reasons previously given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">We caution, however, that it would be far better for the defendant to place on the record that his reasons are the same as previously stated, and set out such further reasons he may have, but we do not think the intent of the rule is that he must be denied a review of the evidence for failure to do so. There is a sharp distinction to be drawn between cases in which reasons have not been particularized on either motion, and cases in which adequate reasons were given to support the first motion but not expressly set out for the second motion. In short, the withdrawal of a motion by the offering of evidence by the defendant does not kill it. It may be resurrected by renewing it, and the renewal will usually incorporate the reasons previously given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 554 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">To begin, we conclude that the issue of sufficiency of evidence for appellant\u2019s conviction is not preserved for appellate review. We note initially that in moving for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel failed to argue with particularity that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for second-degree murder. Appellant\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, arguing, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">It\u2019s a one count indictment, Your Honor, as you know, but it\u2019s a statutory form indictment for murder. And I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>argue the following: That the law in Maryland is very clear that to prove premeditated first-degree murder, the State must adduce evidence that the Defendant possessed the intent to kill, that the Defendant had conscious knowledge of that intent, there was time enough for the Defendant to deliberate and time enough to have thought it out, that intent has to be premeditated and deliberate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">So as to first-degree murder, Your Honor, what\u2019s the evidence here of first-degree murder? There is none....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">As to first-degree murder, and I\u2019m going to argue second-degree murder later, but since I thought it would be the easiest thing for the Court to go one step at a time, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">(Emphasis added). After hearing from counsel, the circuit court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Although in making the motion for judgment of acquittal after the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cAs to first-degree murder, and I\u2019m going to argue second-degree murder later,\u201d the record unequivocally reflects that counsel failed to subsequently argue that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for second-degree murder. In other words, in spite of announcing an intent to address the offense of second-degree murder \u201clater,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel failed to do so. Although the State concedes in its brief before this Court that appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case arguing that the evidence was insufficient as to second-degree murder, the record demonstrates otherwise.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are not bound by the State\u2019s concession. In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>view, appellant\u2019s counsel failed to argue the insufficiency of evidence as to second-degree murder during the motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, and the issue was not preserved at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">After the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, appellant presented a defense, testifying on his own behalf. At the close of evidence, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">And I want to renew my motion for judgment of acquittal now at the end of all the evidence. It\u2019s a different standard. Doesn\u2019t go in the light most favorable to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">We make a motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of all the evidence now. No longer does the State get the benefit of having Your Honor apply the standard of taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. And I would argue strenuously at this time, without doing the same thing I did before earlier this morning, but I argue strenuously under the different standard, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of premeditation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Upon review, we conclude that appellant\u2019s counsel specifically limited the motion for judgment of acquittal at this point to the lack of evidence of premeditation. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he wanted to \u201crenew\u201d the motion \u201cwithout doing the same thing I did before earlier this morning ... there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of premeditation.\u201d As Maryland Rule 4-324(a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d Here, appellant\u2019s counsel unambiguously stated: \u201cAnd I would argue strenuously at this time, without doing the same thing I did before earlier this morning, but I argue strenuously under the different standard, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of premeditation.\u201d (Emphasis added). At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>this juncture, appellant failed to preserve for review an issue of sufficiency of evidence as to second-degree murder by limiting the motion for judgment of acquittal to the lack of evidence of premeditation. The element of premeditation is necessary for a conviction of first-degree murder. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 2-201(a)(1) (\u201cA murder is in the first degree if it is: (1) a deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing[.]\u201d). The defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, an offense that does not require premeditation. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 2-204 (\u201cA murder that is not in the first degree under \u00a7 2-201 of this subtitle is in the second degree.\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Equally as important, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>counsel could not renew what he did not earlier have\u2014a motion for judgment of acquittal on particularized grounds as to second-degree murder made at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case. In sum, the record reveals that appellant\u2019s counsel failed to argue at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, and at the conclusion of evidence, that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for second-degree murder. As such, appellant has not preserved an issue on appeal as to the sufficiency of evidence for second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">B. The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s failure to preserve the issue, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">(i) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u201cWe affirm the denial of a motion for acquittal unless we determine that no rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Neal v.

State, </em>10 Md.App. 389, 396, 271 A.2d 371 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 868, 92 S.Ct. 44, 30 L.Ed.2d 112 (1971) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">The standard for our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We defer to the fact finder\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, and resolve conflicts in the evidenced] While we do not re-weigh the evidence, we do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>cumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">The same review standard applies to all criminal cases, including those resting upon circumstantial evidence, since, generally, proof of guilt based in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence is no different from proof of guilt based on direct eyewitness accounts. Circumstantial evidence is entirely sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">Furthermore, the fact finder, not the appellate court, resolves conflicting evidentiary inferences. The primary appellate function in respect to evidentiary inferences is to determine whether the trial court made reasonable, <em>ie., </em>rational, inferences from extant facts.

State, </em>49 Md.App. 467, 468, 433 A.2d 1179 (1981), the defendant appealed his first-degree murder conviction, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction because there was not \u201cadequate evidence of <em>corpus delicti </em>independent\u201d of the defendant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>This Court reversed the conviction, holding that \u201ca defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession standing alone is, as a matter of law, insufficient to support a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court stated that: \u201cIn a homicide case the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 433 A.2d 1179 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In reversing the conviction, we held that the only evidence \u201cwhich is both independent and \u2018corroborative\u2019\u201d of the defendant\u2019s confession/statement was that the victim failed to return to work. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86, 433 A.2d 1179. We concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">In every Maryland case reported thus far involving the corroboration rule in the context of a homicide, the victim\u2019s body had been recovered and there was other independent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to suggest that the death was not the result of accident or suicide. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, 247 A.2d 530 (1968); <em>Hadder [v. State], supra </em>[238 Md. 341, 209 A.2d 70 (1965) ]; <em>Jones [v. State], supra </em>[188 Md. 263, 52 A.2d 484 (1947) ]. This, of course, does not imply that the inability to produce a body is an insuperable obstacle, in itself, to the obtention and sustention of a murder conviction. This Court, as well as the Court of Appeals, has repeatedly said that the independent evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u201cmay be circumstantial in nature when direct evidence is not available,\u201d <em>Miller, supra </em>at 382 [247 A.2d 530]; <em>Franklin v. State, </em>8 Md.App. [134,] at 140, [258 A.2d 767 (1969) ], and there is no reason to believe that this statement does not apply to the fact of death with the same force as it does to the criminal causation.... Nevertheless, it is clear from these cases that there must be independent evidence, at least circumstantial in nature, that relates to both elements of the <em>corpus delicti </em>Thus, the problem in the present case is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>that the State failed to produce [the victim\u2019s] body, for if she was, in fact, murdered as [the defendant] described, there would be no body to produce; rather, the problem here is that the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence, even of a circumstantial nature, that [the victim] is dead much less murdered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 438 A.2d 1179 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In <em>Hurley v.

Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">Worldwide communication and travel today are so facile that a jury may properly take into account the unlikelihood that an absent person, in view of his health, habits, disposition and personal relationships would voluntarily flee, \u2018go underground,\u2019 and remain out of touch with family and friends. The unlikelihood of such a voluntary disappearance is circumstantial evidence entitled to weight equal to that of bloodstains and concealment of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8i\"><em>Hurley, </em>60 Md.App. at 552, 483 A.2d 1298 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">More recently, in <em>Riggins v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 181, 186-87, 843 A.2d 115, <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 676, 851 A.2d 595 (2004), the defendant appealed his first-degree murder conviction, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction because there was no body or any other physical evidence indicating that a murder occurred. In <em>Riggins, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Notwithstanding the absence of physical evidence in this case to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime, the circumstantial evidence established that: the victim was close to her family, most especially her daughter; the victim had not been heard from in five years, despite an exhaustive record and document search in addition to national media awareness of the disappearance; the victim was aware of appellant\u2019s ongoing affair with Cole; the victim had stated that she was going to report the affair to the police; the victim was going to leave appellant; prior to the victim\u2019s disappearance, appellant had asked co-workers about killing a person and disposing of the body; appellant had asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>friends about obtaining a gun; appellant had stated to Cole that \u201che wanted to kill [the victim],\u201d stating that he would either \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201cstrangle her,\u201d and \u201cput her body in the truck with the waste,\u201d where \u201cnobody would ever find her\u201d; appellant stated that the victim \u201cwasn\u2019t coming back\u201d; and appellant had conspired to fabricate an alibi. Moreover, on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance, the evidence indicated that appellant left work early to meet with Cole. Cole then observed appellant go to his house. There was clearly sufficient independent evidence that the victim had been murdered to corroborate appellant\u2019s confession to David Marshall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">155 Md.App. at 214-15, 843 A.2d 115 (alteration in original). We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">In a homicide case the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone. The State may establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>by either direct or circumstantial evidence. The <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime of murder is ordinarily established through the presence of the victim\u2019s body and by direct evidence establishing that death resulted from criminal activity. Although it is certainly more difficult to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of homicide when the victim\u2019s body is missing, it is not impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 211-12, 843 A.2d 115 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In <em>Riggins, </em>this Court held that even without appellant\u2019s alleged confession, the evidence was sufficient to affirm the conviction of first-degree murder, stating: \u201cEven in the absence of the statements to David Marshall and John McKenny, we are satisfied that the circumstantial evidence in this case would have permitted a rational trier of fact to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed the crime of first degree murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215-16, 843 A.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Returning to the case at hand, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime of second-degree murder.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As this Court stated in <em>Lemons, </em>49 Md.App. at 473, 433 A.2d 1179: \u201cIn a homicide case the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, Tracey\u2019s complete disappearance from the face of the earth, lack of contact with friends and family, non-use of credit cards or bank accounts, and the inability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>after numerous searches and nationwide media coverage to locate her, is evidence substantiating the first element of <em>corpus delicti\u2014i.e. </em>that Tracey is dead. \u201c[T]he independent evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u2018may be circumstantial in nature when direct evidence is not available,\u2019 and there is no reason to believe that this statement does not apply to the fact of death with the same force as it does to the criminal causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 433 A.2d 1179 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Combined with the facts set forth above, the following circumstantial evidence more than establishes the first element of <em>corpus delicti: </em>(1) Tracey was extremely close to her friends and family, especially her grandmother; (2) Tracey has not been heard from since March 2005, despite testimony from Tracey\u2019s friends and family members about how reliable and responsive she was when called and how often she saw and spoke with those friends and family members; (3) Tracey\u2019s dogs were left at her home, despite testimony revealing that Tracey \u201cloved her dogs\u201d and they were like her children; (4) Tracey\u2019s Trans Am was found abandoned in a Days Inn parking lot, despite testimony that Tracey loved and took care of her Trans Am; (5) Spadaro testified that she was moving in with Tracey at the end of May 2005; (6) Cataldi testified that Tracey had told her prior to her disappearance that she had seen a divorce lawyer; (7) witnesses testified that Tracey made future plans to attend a baby shower in April 2005\u2014for which she already bought <em>presents\u2014and </em>to attend a party at Baptiste\u2019s house; (8) appellant told a friend that Tracey had picked up Easter baskets for appellant\u2019s children and they were having a birthday party for appellant\u2019s daughter; and (9) when discussing appellant moving out, Tracey informed a friend that she \u201chad already put things on layaway so that when [appellant] took things out of the house that she could just replace whatever he took.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As to the second element of <em>corpus </em>delicti\u2014that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by appellant\u2014the evidence established that: (1) appellant made inconsistent statements concerning his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>activities on the day Tracey disappeared\u2014during the first interview, telling Detective Marll he stayed at home all day, omitting that he traveled to Cycle World, within a mile and a half of where Tracey\u2019s Trans Am was discovered. During a second interview, appellant advised for the first time that he did leave home and go to Cycle World; and during a third interview, for the first time, appellant explained that Haven had come to his house; (2) appellant advised Detective Marll during the third interview that \u201cnothing happened\u201d in the house; (3) Tracey\u2019s Trans Am was recovered approximately a mile and a half from Cycle World; (4) cell phone records revealed that the 7:48 p.m. call from Tracey\u2019s cell phone on March 6, 2005, was made while the phone was traveling southbound through the Harbor Tunnel; (5) the Days Inn videotape showed an image of someone leaving Tracey\u2019s Trans Am in the parking lot of the Days Inn and that the car\u2019s headlights flashed seconds later, indicating that a keyless entry remote was used to lock the car; (6) the time on the videotape from Days Inn, under Daylight Savings Time, was 8:01 p.m.; (7) on March 17, 2005, appellant was in possession of the keyless entry remote to the Trans Am, wordlessly giving the remote to Detective Marll; (8) evidence at trial included a receipt indicating that a \u201csingular\u201d keyless entry remote had been ordered for Tracey\u2019s Trans Am; (9) appellant was aware of Tracey\u2019s affair with Christian; (10) Tracey had asked appellant to move out; (11) appellant moved items from storage lockers back into his house as soon as two weeks after Tracey disappeared; and (12) shortly after Tracey\u2019s disappearance, appellant engaged in a conversation with Pittman regarding appellant\u2019s desire to purchase an expensive boat, referring in the same conversation to Tracey\u2019s life insurance of which he claimed to be the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Appellant\u2019s own testimony revealed that he had confronted both Tracey and Christian regarding their affair and lied to law enforcement officers regarding how he obtained Christian\u2019s address and information. Appellant admitted to having Tracey followed, tapping the house phone without Tracey\u2019s knowledge, asking Tracey\u2019s supervisor, Liebermann, to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>an eye on Tracey\u2019s calls and to alert Mm if anything suspicious occurred, and going through Tracey\u2019s desk at work. Payne testified that appellant would call Tracey\u2019s work \u201casking what time did Tracey clock out last night. Because he was, like, watching her.\u201d Barilla testified that \u201cTracey couldn\u2019t go anywhere without [appellant] constantly calling her, asking where is she, who is she with, where is she going to be, how long is she going to be there____She would get really upset, which I don\u2019t blame her, you know. It wasn\u2019t just after things were breaking up, it was from the beginning.\u201d Liebermann testified that he played a call between Tracey and Christian and appellant \u201cwas antsy, kind of like pacing a little bit.\u201d According to Liebermann, while appellant listened to the call appellant said \u201che wasn\u2019t going to go through this again and there\u2019s three things he doesn\u2019t like, he doesn\u2019t like a liar, a cheat, and he doesn\u2019t want anybody to take his money.\u201d Appellant admitted that he did not participate in the searches for Tracey and he tore down fliers that were on his car and mailbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Regarding the question before us\u2014the sufficiency of the evidence to establish second-degree murder\u2014the circumstantial evidence was more than sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that Tracey is dead and that appellant caused her death. As we noted in <em>Hurley, </em>60 Md.App. at 552, 483 A.2d 1298, \u201c[w]orldwide communication and travel today are so facile that a jury may properly take into account the unlikelihood that an absent person, in view of his health, habits, disposition and personal relationships would voluntarily flee, \u2018go underground,\u2019 and remain out of touch with family and friends. The unlikelihood of such a voluntary disappearance is circumstantial evidence entitled to weight equal to that of bloodstains and concealment of evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted). The jury was well within its province to resolve any factual disputes in favor of the State. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, in addition to other facts, the evidence established one keyless entry remote used by the person departing Tracey\u2019s vehicle at 8:01 p.m. on March 6, 2005, and that appellant was, afterward, in possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>remote when the vehicle was recovered, and that Tracey was dead\u2014with appellant having caused her death. Prior to closing argument, the jury was instructed, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4qW\">Motive is not an element of the crime charged and need not be shown. However, you may consider the motive or lack of motive as a circumstance in this case. Presence of motive may be evidence of guilt. Absence of motive may suggest innocence. You should give the presence or absence of motive, as the case may be, the weight that you believe it deserves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">(Emphasis added). Although the State argued primarily at trial that all of the facts set forth above demonstrate the premeditation necessary for first-degree murder, the facts, including those evidencing appellant\u2019s motive, intent, and conduct, are more than sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">III. Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in limiting his cross-examination of several witnesses\u2014specifically, Regina Gardner and Detective Marll\u2014as to whether Tracey \u201chad run away from home in the past\u201d and whether \u201cshe was seen by witnesses after the date the State claimed she was murdered.\u201d Appellant argues that testimony that Tracey had run away in the past and that she was reportedly seen in Pennsylvania after March 6, 2005, was relevant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The State responds that this issue is not preserved for appellate review. The State argues that after the circuit court sustained its objections appellant failed to proffer the substance and relevance of the allegedly excluded evidence. The State asserts that \u201cregardless of the relevance of the evidence [appellant] sought to elicit, it is clear from the record that the evidence he sought to have admitted through his cross-examination of Detective Marll was [hearsay and] not otherwise admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Initially, we conclude that this issue is not preserved for appellate review. Maryland Rule 5-103(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(a) Effect of erroneous ruling. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">(1) Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was requested by the court or required by rule; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">(2) Offer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer on the record or was apparent from the context within which the evidence was offered. The court may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 281, 934 A.2d 1059 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 Md. 614, 943 A.2d 1245 (2008), this Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">Even as of this late date, Muhammad has not proffered to us on this appeal what his out-of-state witnesses would likely have testified about. A claim that the exclusion of evidence constitutes reversible error is generally not preserved for appellate review absent a formal proffer of the contents and materiality of the excluded testimony. Maryland Rule 5-103(a)(2); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 416, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (objection to exclusion of evidence unpreserved where appellate court is in no position to discern what the evidence may have been); <em>Ratchford v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 354, 368, 785 A.2d 826 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 241, 792 A.2d 1178 (2002) (failure to proffer contents of excluded testimony is \u201cabsolutely foreclosing\u201d as to claims). This impediment to appellate review effectively moots any consideration, as an alternate holding, of harmless error. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>certification for the out-of-state witnesses had been erroneously denied, we have no idea whether such a hypothesized error would have been harmful or harmless because we have no idea what the excluded testimony might have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>In this case, appellant contends that \u201cthe evidence [he] sought to introduce was clear from the questions asked\u201d and, as such, a proffer of the answers sought was not necessary. We disagree. During the cross-examination of Gardner, Tracey\u2019s stepmother, appellant asked: \u201cDid she [Tracey] have run-away problems with you all[,]\u201d and during the cross-examination of Detective Marll, appellant asked: \u201cAnd you went and interviewed Mr. Kerr about [Tracey] being in Pennsylvania[,]\u201d and \u201cNow, did you ever go out and interview a Thomas Tyler ... And that was another in regard to this, a report of [Tracey] in this case, a report of [Tracey].\u201d After all three of these questions, the State objected, and the circuit court sustained the objections. Appellant\u2019s counsel continued cross-examination without offering a formal proffer of the content and materiality of the excluded testimony. As such, a claim that the exclusion of evidence constitutes reversible error is not preserved for review. <em>Muhammad, </em>177 Md.App. at 281, 984 A.2d 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Alternatively, we perceive no abuse of discretion. \u201cGenerally speaking, the scope of examination of witnesses at trial is a matter left largely to the discretion of the trial judge and no error will be recognized unless there is clear abuse of such discretion.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 669, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993) (citation omitted). Maryland Rule 5-611(b)(1), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b)(2), cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. Except for the cross-examination of an accused who testifies on a preliminary matter, the court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 206, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), the Court of Appeals instructed that: \u201cThe determination of relevance is reserved for the discretion of the trial judge; we will not disturb the trial judge\u2019s ruling unless he has abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>that discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted). In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 97, 115, 792 A.2d 368, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 573, 801 A.2d 1033 (2002), we stated that: \u201cA judge must allow a defendant wide latitude to cross-examine a witness as to bias or prejudices, <em>but the questioning must not be allowed to stray into collateral matters which would obscure the trial issues and lead to the factfinder\u2019s confusion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In this case, appellant\u2019s question to Gardner\u2014\u201c[d]id [Tracey] have run-away problems with you all[ ]\u201d\u2014referred to Gardner\u2019s experience with Tracey as a child. During cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Gardner when Tracey lived with her, and Gardner responded that Tracey lived with her from 1981, when Tracey was ten years old, to when Tracey was about fifteen or sixteen years old. As such, the question would necessarily have elicited testimony about a time-period when Tracey was between the ages of ten and approximately fifteen or sixteen years old.- Tracey was born on March 21, 1971, and disappeared on March 6, 2005. At the time of her disappearance, Tracey was two weeks away from being thirty-four years old. That Tracey did or did not run-away from home between the ages of ten to fifteen or sixteen has no relevance to Tracey\u2019s disappearance as a thirty-three, almost thirty-four year old woman. Whether or not Tracey ever ran away between the ages of ten and sixteen\u2014a question to which we do not know what Gardner\u2019s answer would have been, as appellant\u2019s counsel failed to make a proffer\u2014is of no relevance, and we find no clear abuse of discretion in the circuit court sustaining an objection to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">During cross-examination, after Detective Marll testified that he interviewed Kerr and Tyler, appellant\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cAnd you went and interviewed Mr. Kerr about [Tracey] being in Pennsylvania[ ]\u201d and \u201cNow, did you ever go out and interview a Thomas Tyler ... And that was another in regard to this, a report of [Tracey] in this case, a report of [Tracey]. The State objected. We conclude that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in sustaining the objection.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The testimony appellant\u2019s counsel ultimately sought to elicit\u2014information given to the Detective Marll by Kerr and Tyler\u2014was hearsay and not otherwise admissible, <em>ie. </em>any attempt by appellant\u2019s counsel to elicit information Kerr or Tyler provided would have resulted in hearsay testimony. We, therefore, perceive no abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court in sustaining the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IY. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court improperly instructed the jury on circumstantial evidence. Appellant asks this Court for plain error review. Appellant contends that the jury instruction on circumstantial evidence deviated \u201csignificantly from the pattern jury instruction\u201d and \u201cresulted in conflicting definitions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The State responds that the circumstantial evidence instruction given by the circuit court, when read as a whole and in context, \u201cwas a correct statement of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Md. Rule 4\u2014325(e), however, provides that this Court has the discretion to recognize plain error in jury instructions, despite a failure to make an objection. This Court has stated that \u201cwe possess plenary discretion to notice plain error material to the rights of a defendant, even if the matter was not raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>Danna v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 448, 450, 605 A.2d 150, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 627, 612 A.2d 257 (1992). In <em>Boulden v. State, </em>414 Md. 284, 313, 995 A.2d 268 (2010), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">We decline to review the claimed error under a \u201cplain error\u201d analysis. \u201cSuch review is reserved for those errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>that are \u2018compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant of [a] fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson [v. State], </em>410 Md. [91,] at 111, 976 A.2d [1072,] at 1084 [ (2009) ] (quoting <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 588, 602 A.2d 677, 694 (1992)). We explained further in <em>Robinson </em>that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArP\">[w]e will intervene in those circumstances only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial. In that regard, we review the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">(Alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Maryland appellate courts have often been called upon to exercise the discretion to recognize plain error; however, neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has chosen to do so except in a few egregious cases. In <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 578-79, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010), the Court of Appeals stated that plain error review involves four steps or prongs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">First, there must be an error or defect\u2014some sort of [deviation from a legal rule\u2014that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error-discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Meeting all four prongs is difficult, as it should be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">(Quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>In this case, appellant takes issue with the following instruction given by the circuit court at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">There are two types of evidence, direct and circumstantial.

No greater degree of certainty is required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">Circumstantial evidence need not be such that no possible theory other than guilt can stand. It is not necessary that the circumstantial evidence exclude every possibility of the Defendant\u2019s innocence, or produce an absolute certainty of guilt. While it must afford a basis for an inference of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it is not necessary that each circumstance standing alone be sufficient to establish guilt, but the circumstances are to be considered collectively.1<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">In reaching a verdict, you should weigh all of the evidence presented, whether direct or circumstantial. You may not convict the Defendant unless you find that the evidence, when considered as a whole, establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">A conviction based upon circumstantial evidence alone is not to be sustained unless the circumstances taken together are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.1<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:01, entitled: \u201cDirect and Circumstantial Evidence,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>There are two types of evidence\u2014direct and circumstantial.

You may not convict the defendant unless you find that the evidence, when considered as a whole, establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Although appellant contends that the instruction given by the circuit court varies from the pattern jury instruction in the areas in bold above, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that plain error review is warranted. The two paragraphs with which appellant takes issue are accurate statements of law and, as such, there is no support for a conclusion that there was any error or deviation from a legal rule that had not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned\u2014the first prong under <em>Rich, </em>415 Md. at 578, 3 A.3d 1210. In <em>Williams, </em>342 Md. at 735, 679 A.2d 1106, the Court of Appeals discussed the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">While it is true that ... a conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone, we have also explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT4\">to ensure that the trier of fact bases a finding of guilt on the appropriate degree of certainty, ... a conviction [based] upon circumstantial evidence <em>alone </em>is not to be sustained unless the circumstances, taken together, are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqG\">(Citing <em>Oken, </em>327 Md. at 662-63, 612 A.2d 258) (quotation marks omitted) (alterations, emphasis, and omissions in original). The language in the jury instruction providing that: \u201cA conviction based upon circumstantial evidence alone is not to be sustained unless the circumstances taken together are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d is taken directly from <em>Williams </em>and a quote that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>specifically sought the circuit court to include in the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In <em>Hebron, </em>92 Md.App. at 514-15, 608 A.2d 1291, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">The Court of Appeals seems clearly to have adopted the general underlying premise that, in terms of quality, there is no difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. Quoting with approval from <em>Nichols v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 340, 350-51, 247 A.2d 722 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 735 (1969), the Court stated in <em>Gilmore v.

No greater degree of certainty is required when the evidence is circumstantial than when it is direct, for in either case the trier of fact must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">[Circumstantial evidence need not be such that no possible theory other than guilt can stand.... It is not necessary that the circumstantial evidence exclude every possibility of the defendant\u2019s innocence, or produce an absolute certainty in the minds of the jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">(Quotations marks omitted) (alterations and omissions in original). The language in the jury instruction\u2014stating: \u201cCircumstantial evidence need not be such that no possible theory other than guilt can stand. It is not necessary that the circumstantial evidence exclude every possibility of the Defendant\u2019s innocence, or produce an absolute certainty of guilt[ ]\u201d\u2014is a quote directly from <em>Hebron </em>and a quote to which appellant\u2019s counsel specifically advised the circuit court he had no objection. Under these circumstances, we will not exercise plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Demonstrating further appellant\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions necessary for plain error review is that to the extent appellant alleges the circuit court erred in giving the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>instruction on circumstantial evidence, there is no contention that the error was clear or obvious. When the circuit court discussed with counsel the State\u2019s requested jury instruction number six\u2014regarding circumstantial and direct evidence\u2014 the court asked: \u2018With the decision, it\u2019s <em>Hebron versus State </em>at 331 Md.App. [Md.] 219 [627 A.2d 1029], one paragraph, you don\u2019t object to that, [appellant\u2019s counsel]?\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d A review of the record demonstrates that not only did appellant\u2019s counsel fail to object to the jury instruction given, but counsel specifically conceded that he did not object to the language based on <em>Hebron. </em>The last paragraph of the instruction with which appellant now takes issue consisted of language derived from <em>Williams, </em>and was proposed and asked to be included by appellant\u2019s counsel. Concerning this language, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cYour Honor, that\u2019s a direct quote from <em>Williams. </em>I know he didn\u2019t say it went, but it\u2019s a direct quote from <em>Williams. </em>We\u2019d push that be put in there because[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYX\">After the instructions were given, appellant\u2019s counsel stated at a bench conference: \u201cFor the record the Defense would object to what we consider to be the incomplete spoliation instruction and incomplete circumstantial evidence instruction, which were already argued before in open court.\u201d This was not an objection or exception to the content of the instruction given by the circuit court to which it earlier agreed, but rather, apparently, an objection that the instruction failed to contain additional information. Counsel provided no information or explanation as to the grounds on which he contended the instruction to be incomplete. Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s specific agreement to the instruction containing language of <em>Hebron, </em>his requested inclusion of language derived from <em>Williams, </em>and the failure to object to any language contained in the instruction, supports the conclusion that appellant failed to satisfy the second prong of plain error review under Rieh-that the alleged legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Y. Closing Remarks</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in permitting the State to argue case law in closing argument. Appellant takes issue with the prosecutor, over objection, arguing a quote from <em>Hurley, </em>60 Md.App. at 552, 483 A.2d 1298, that: \u201cThe unlikelihood of such a voluntary disappearance is evidence\u2014it\u2019s circumstantial evidence that you can give weight to. The law says that you can give it weight equal to that of blood stains of evidence\u2014[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The State responds that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. The State contends that the prosecutor \u201cfocusing on the fact that the evidence in this case was largely (although not exclusively) circumstantial, included in his argument a statement, consistent with the court\u2019s instructions, that the circumstantial evidence in this case was entitled to be given the same weight as evidence of bloodstains.\u201d The State argues that appellant was not prejudiced by the remark because the comment did not \u201cactually mislead\u201d or influence the jury as it was a correct statement of law. The State asserts that if error at all, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In <em>McFadden v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 238, 255, 13 A.3d 68 (2011), this Court explained: \u201c \u2018The regulation of argument rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Grandison, </em>341 Md. at 224, 670 A.2d 398). Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(c) How given.

We stated that: \u201cArguing law includes stating, quoting, discussing or commenting upon a legal proposition, principle, rule or statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 499 A.2d 492 (citation omitted). We held that, \u201cunless there exists a dispute as to the proper interpretation of the law of the crime for which there is a <em>sound basis, </em>the court\u2019s instructions as to the law are binding on the jury and counsel as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 499 A.2d 492 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">Accordingly, to hold that counsel are permitted to read caselaw regarding the definition of reasonable doubt to a jury, whose only function is to determine the facts and, if appropriate, the law of the case, would be to permit the usurpation of the court\u2019s function and to again place a broader law-judging function in the jury. This, we cannot and will not do. The court committed no error, plain or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 103, 499 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Following <em>Newman, </em>in <em>White v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 100, 118, 502 A.2d 1084 (1986), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\"><em>Newman </em>teaches that counsel may argue law to the jury only where a dispute, as defined in <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Stevenson, </em>exists as to the law of the crime. 65 Md.App. at 101, 499 A.2d 492. <em>See also Woodland v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 503, 512-14, 490 A.2d 286 (1985); Rule 4-325(f). We interpret <em>Newman </em>to mean that where there is no dispute as to the law, counsel will not be permitted to argue law even where the argument is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the court\u2019s instructions____ Counsel are provided input as to the content of the instructions before they are given, and also may object if an instruction is not to counsel\u2019s satisfaction. Md.Rule 4-325. To allow counsel to embellish the trial court\u2019s instructions is fraught with the danger that the trial judge\u2019s binding instructions will be manipulated by counsel, result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ing in the jury applying law different than that given by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In <em>White, </em>66 Md.App. at 120, 502 A.2d 1084, we determined that \u201cthe prosecutor argued the legal concepts of reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence [and ujnder <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>neither of these areas is subject to dispute as the law of the crime, and the trial court\u2019s instructions were therefore binding.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We stated: \u201cThe due process requirement of reasonable doubt is expressly listed as not being part of the law of the crime subject to dispute, and we hold that an instruction defining circumstantial evidence is in that category. The definition of circumstantial evidence is applicable in every case is within the court\u2019s province; the jury only decides how to apply the facts of a particular case to the concept.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor in closing argument to argue law explaining reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In this case, similar to our determination in <em>White, </em>we conclude that the circuit court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor arguing law. Although we conclude that the circuit court erred in failing to sustain appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections, we must now ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument constitutes reversible error. In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">\u201cThe harmless error standard is highly favorable to the defendant, and \u2018the burden is on the State to show that [the error] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 and did not influence the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 66, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (citations omitted) (alteration in original). In <em>Perez, </em>the Court of Appeals instructed that in \u201c[a]pplying <em>Dorsey </em>and its progeny, we must determine, based on the record, whether the error possibly influenced the verdict in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 21 A.3d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Returning to the case at hand, we must determine whether, in light of the evidence presented and the instructions given, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We note that at the beginning of instructing the jury, consistent with Maryland Rule 4-325(c), the circuit court advised the jury as to the binding nature of the instructions, as follows: \u201cIt is your duty as jurors to follow the law as I state it to you and to apply the law to the facts as you find them from the evidence that you\u2019ve heard in this ease____It would be a violation of your duty to base your verdict upon any view of the law other than that given by me in these instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE5\">The prosecutor remarked in closing arguments that: \u201cThe unlikelihood of such a voluntary disappearance is evidence\u2014 it\u2019s circumstantial evidence that you can give weight to. The law says that you can give it weight equal to that of blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>stains of evidence!.]\u201d With this remark, the prosecutor emphasized the court\u2019s instruction that: \u201cThe law makes no distinction between the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d In this case, similar to the improper argument in <em>White, </em>\u201c[t]he prosecutor did not go beyond the law of the case by presenting argument which substantively altered the binding instructions, but merely helped define the concept of circumstantial evidence. The jury would have applied the same concepts of the law even if the prosecutor had not read the case law on circumstantial evidence!.]\u201d 66 Md.App. at 123, 502 A.2d 1084. The prosecutor\u2019s argument as to the law was neither incorrect nor materially inconsistent with the circuit court\u2019s instructions. We conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as the State did not exceed the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In <em>Washington, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to ask whether any prospective juror would be more likely to believe a witness solely by virtue of the witness having served in the military or being employed by the military.
