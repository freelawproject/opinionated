Krause, Jr. (\u201cKrause\u201d), a docking master licensed by the Maryland Board of Pilots (the \u201cBoard\u201d), filed a multi-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the State, the Board, the Association, and several individual members of the Association.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, the court granted appellees\u2019 motion for judgment at the conclusion of appellants\u2019 case in chief. Before this Court, only two of appellants\u2019 claims remain in dispute: (1) KMTC\u2019s assertion that the Association inhibited its ability to compete for tug business in violation of Maryland\u2019s Antitrust Act, <em>see </em>Md.Code Ann., Com. Law (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 11-201 <em>et seq. </em>(1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), specifically, CL \u00a7 11-204(a) (stating that \u201c[a] person may not ... unreasonably restrain trade or commerce.\u201d); and (2) Krause\u2019s claim that the Maryland Pilots Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), <em>see </em>Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. (\u201cBOP\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>(1989, 2010 Repl.Vol.), infringes upon his right to contract freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Appellants present four issues to us. First, KMTC asserts that the trial court erred in granting the Association\u2019s motion for judgment on KMTC\u2019s antitrust claim. We hold that the trial court did not err because KMTC did not prove that the Association\u2019s work rules unreasonably restrained competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Second, KMTC argues that the trial court erred in permitting the Association to assert a statute of limitations defense at trial, thus limiting its claim for damages. We need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>address this contention because we have decided against KMTC on its antitrust claim. As KMTC concedes, the statute of limitations issue would only be relevant if we decided in favor of KMTC on the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Third, Krause contends that the trial court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion for judgment on his claim that Maryland docking masters should not be required to be members of the Association. Krause argues that this requirement is an unconstitutional exercise of the State\u2019s police power. This contention, as presented to this Court, has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Finally, both appellants argue that the trial court erred by failing to issue a declaratory judgment as to their antitrust and constitutional claims. We agree. In disposing of appellants\u2019 claims, the trial court failed to enter a declaratory judgment, and we will remand the case to the circuit court for entry of a judgment declaring the rights of the parties in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>Overview: Pilotage and Tug Services in the Port of Baltimore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The majority of the relevant facts that fuel this dispute arise from tug boat activities in the Port of Baltimore. The Port is one of the busiest in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The container, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>vehicle transport, and bulk carrier ships that use the Port are enormous: they can be more than three football fields long, up to 138 feet wide and can draw nearly 48 feet. These vessels are too large to berth and unberth by themselves; they require the assistance of tug boats to safely accomplish this task.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">There are two types of pilots that help guide these maritime behemoths into and out of port. The first are bay pilots (also referred to as harbor pilots), who direct vessels from the open sea through the Chesapeake Bay to the ship\u2019s port of destination (and vice versa). S.B. 237 (2000), Fiscal Note at 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>second are docking masters (also called docking pilots), whose primary responsibility is to coordinate and direct the services of tugs to maneuver a ship as it moors and unmoors. H.B. 884 (2004), Fiscal Note at 5. Krause is a docking master; the regulation of docking masters (as opposed to bay pilots) is at the heart of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Moving these ships through the Chesapeake Bay to their destination requires tightly planned coordination. Each steamship line that does business in the Port of Baltimore maintains a \u201cship\u2019s agent.\u201d Prior to the arrival of a vessel in the Chesapeake Bay, the ship\u2019s agent notifies the Association that a bay pilot is needed to guide the ship to Baltimore. Sunset Review (2001) at 27. As the ship nears its destination, the ship\u2019s agent makes arrangements for the mooring of the vessel by notifying the Association that a docking master is required and by contacting a tug company. The Association assigns jobs according to established work rules that provide for rotation among pilots and docking masters. (We will discuss these work rules more fully later).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Three ship-docking tug companies serve the Baltimore harbor: KMTC,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McAllister Towing of Baltimore, Inc., and Moran Towing Corporation. Each company owns a number of tugs that vary in utility for a given job because of size, design and engine power. Either directly or through affiliates, McAllister and Moran provide tug services to numerous commercial ports in the United States. KMTC focuses primarily on the Port of Baltimore. The three marine tug companies compete for business. In contrast, as we will explain, docking masters have a legally-established monopoly for their services and their fees are regulated by the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\n<em>The Disputes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">There are two separate claims that we must address in this case. One involves an antitrust claim brought by KMTC against the Association. The other involves a constitutional challenge to the Act brought by Krause against the State. Both claims involve the Association\u2019s work rules for docking masters.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Association\u2019s work rules, dated February 2009, were entered into evidence before the trial court. These rules establish a rotation schedule so that each docking master is subject to approximately the same workload. Sunset Review (2009) at 4. Under these rules, docking masters work two weeks on duty and two weeks off duty, and when they are on duty they complete a three-assignment turn. When the three assignments are completed, the docking master returns to the back end of the rotation schedule. Critical to the underlying dispute in this case, when a ship\u2019s agent contacts the Association\u2019s dispatch unit to obtain a docking master for a ship, the docking master at the front end of the rotation schedule is automatically assigned to that vessel. As a result, steamship lines cannot contract directly with a particular docking master, nor can a docking master control which steamship line he or she serves on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">While the three tug companies actively compete for customers and commonly make arrangements with individual steamship lines to provide tug services to that line\u2019s vessels, the custom of the industry gives the assigned docking master final say in determining which and how many tugs are adequate for the job. <em>See Cooper/T. Smith, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>177 F.3d 1259, 1264-65 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cOnce a docking pilot receives the schedule of ships docking and undocking in the port on a given day, he decides the number of tugs that will be needed based upon factors such as the dimensions and power of the ship and tidal conditions.\u201d); <em>Guy v. Donald, </em>203 U.S. 399, 404, 27 S.Ct. 63, 51 L.Ed. 245 (1906) (describing the pilot, who was a member of the Virginia Pilots Association, as the \u201csole master of his course\u201d with a free ability \u201cto do what he thought best\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and \u201cno duty to obey\u201d advice from fellow pilots).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the assigned pilot decides that the tugs provided by a tug company are not adequate for a job, either the shipping line or the tug company must hire additional tugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">KMTC argues that this setup interferes with its contracts with steamship lines because the system prevents both steamship lines and KMTC from selecting the docking master of their choice. Because neither a steamship line nor a tug company can select its own docking masters, KMTC cannot ensure that the assigned docking master\u2014given the pilot\u2019s discretion as to the type and number of tugs necessary for a particular job\u2014will decide that KMTC\u2019s tugs are adequate, even though KMTC has a contract with the steamship line.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">KMTC asserts that \u201c[t]he prime example\u201d of its problem with the rotation system is seen at the New Ore Pier located at Sparrows Point. It claims that, in 2004, the Association passed a special guideline that caused it to lose work. The guideline stated that vessels with a draft of 44 feet attempting to moor or unmoor at that facility must use at least three tugs, each with at least 3000 horsepower and the ability to maintain a 90 degree angle to the vessel. KMTC asserts that the guideline was adopted because of a dredging project in the area but that the guideline remained in place even after the dredging was completed. KMTC asserts that it does not own three tugs that comply with the guideline and that the requirements listed in the guideline are no longer necessary to safely moor vessels at Sparrows Point. As a result of the guideline, some docking masters have refused to use KMTC tugs at Sparrows Point. As explained by KMTC, if it had the power to bypass the rotation system and select its own pilot, then, in the event the initially scheduled pilot decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>KMTC\u2019s tugs did not meet the Sparrows Point guidelines, KMTC could select a different pilot willing to do the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">KMTC also points to three instances when individual docking masters decided that, under the weather and environmental conditions at the time, KMTC\u2019s tugs were inadequate to safely moor a ship. As an example, Joann Krause testified on behalf of KMTC that a docking master, Captain Jankowiak, refused to dock a ship, the M/V MAKIKI, in winds blowing at 25 knots with single screw tugboats owned by KMTC. KMTC alleges that this is just one example of a docking master obstructing the work of KMTC \u201cunder the guise of safety, to prevent [KMTC] from executing its contracts with the shipping companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Krause\u2019s grievance against the State is much narrower. He asserts that docking masters should not be forced to be members of the Association; instead, he argues that masters should be able to work independently of the Association\u2019s work rules. Krause challenges this required membership as an infringement on his freedom of contract rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">KMTC and Krause filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 18, 2008 and thereafter filed an eleven count amended complaint asking for compensatory and punitive damages and declarative and injunctive relief. The amended complaint listed the following defendants: the State, the Board, the Association, and various members of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In November 2009, the trial court issued several orders granting summary judgment in favor of appellees as to several counts. In December 2009, at the time of trial, only six counts remained: namely, Count V (antitrust claim by KMTC against the Pilot Defendants and the Association); Count VI (antitrust claim by KMTC against the State of Maryland for enacting BOP \u00a7 11-603); Count VII (freedom of contract claim by KMTC against the State); Count IX (antitrust claim by KMTC against the State for granting authority to the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of Pilots); Count X (antitrust claim by Krause against the State); and Count XI (freedom of contract claim by Krause against the State). The court conducted a five day bench trial on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Appellants filed a motion for declaratory judgment but, on the first day of trial, requested the court to defer a ruling on its motion until after trial, which the trial court agreed to do. Upon the conclusion of appellants\u2019 evidence, appellees moved for judgment. The court received extensive argument on the motion on January 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On April 22, 2010, the trial court issued an order, granting appellees\u2019 motions for judgment. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Having considered the plaintiffs evidence at trial on December 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14, 2009; having considered the oral and written motions of the defendants for judgment; having considered the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in opposition; and having considered the defendants\u2019 replies thereto, it is this 22nd day of April, 2010, hereby,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">ORDERED that the \u201cMotion for Judgment\u201d filed by the Association of Maryland Pilots, Eric A. Nielsen, John Traut, and Alan Watts and the \u201cMotion for Judgment\u201d filed by the State of Maryland, the Maryland State Board of Pilots and Eric Nielsen in his capacity as a member of the Maryland State Board of Pilots are GRANTED <em>for the reason that the plaintiffs failed to present any credible evidence sufficient to establish any of their claims against any of the defendants. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal and, after the parties obtained a clarifying order from the circuit court entering judgment in favor of appellees on Counts V, VI, VII, IX, X and XI, appellants filed a Supplemental Notice of Appeal. This Court consolidated the appeals. The appeal only concerns Counts V and XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Maryland Rule 2-519(b) provides that \u201c[wjhen a defendant moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>plaintiff in an action tried by the court, the court may proceed, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts and to render judgment against the plaintiff....\u201d We review the court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Cattail Assocs. v. Sass, </em>170 Md. App. 474, 486, 907 A.2d 828 (2006). In contrast, we set aside a trial court\u2019s factual determinations only when they are clearly erroneous and, in making that evaluation, we must \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The trial court found \u201cthat the plaintiffs failed to present any credible evidence sufficient to establish any of their claims.\u201d It did so without stating what specific evidence it found to be unworthy of belief. This presents a significant challenge for the appellants because it is \u201calmost impossible for a judge to be clearly erroneous when he is simply not persuaded of something.\u201d <em>Bricker v. Warch, </em>152 Md.App. 119, 136, 831 A.2d 453 (2003) (emphasis removed); <em>see also Starke v. Starke, </em>134 Md.App. 663, 680-81, 761 A.2d 355 (2000) (\u201cMere non-persuasion, on the other hand, requires nothing but a state of honest doubt. It is virtually, albeit perhaps not totally, impossible to find reversible error in that regard.\u201d). Appellants have tailored their appellate contentions accordingly, limiting themselves to those based upon facts that were not challenged at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I. The Association\u2019s Rotation System and the Maryland Antitrust Act</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">KMTC contends that the \u201cAssociation has a state-granted monopoly over docking in the Port [of Baltimore]\u201d and that the \u201canti-competitive effect [of the monopoly] outweighs the pro-competitive effect, if any.\u201d KMTC further argues that the Association\u2019s work rules, which allow docking masters to bypass KMTC\u2019s tugboat services, significantly harm its opportunity to compete with the two larger, higher priced towing companies. This, according to KMTC, not only negatively affects its own business, but it also raises prices in the towing market and hurts the bottom line of the steamship companies serving Maryland\u2019s ports. In short, KMTC contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Association\u2019s work rules impose an unreasonable restraint on competition and violate state antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The factual scenario that gives rise to this claim against the Association, and the basis of KMTC\u2019s antitrust argument, is summarized in the testimony of Joann Krause, a part owner of KMTC. She explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">[T]here is a serious problem with the [Association\u2019s] rotation system ... The pilot calls [ ] in certain instances and says that he is not going to do the job with my tugs for whatever reason, whether it\u2019s windy, there\u2019s not enough water under the draft, it\u2019s not enough bollard pull,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] it\u2019s not enough horsepower, whatever it is. [And] I don\u2019t have the luxury of going down the list [to select another pilot], even though there are pilots qualified to do the work, I\u2019m at a standstill. I lose the work.... and this is my problem. And that\u2019s really why I\u2019m here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Thus, in a situation where a docking master decides that he or she cannot safely perform a particular job using KMTC services, KMTC believes it should have the option to designate another docking master to perform the job in the place of the docking master assigned by operation of the Association\u2019s rotation system. It is only this situation, <em>viz., </em>\u201cwhere [KMTC is] not allowed to seek and secure a docking pilot who would trade with the assigned pilot and do [KMTC\u2019s] work,\u201d that KMTC objects to on appeal and complains is an unreasonable restraint on trade.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Before we begin our analysis of KMTC\u2019s antitrust claim, we note that, if a trial court grants a motion for judgment without clearly articulating its reason for doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion for judgment if the record indicates that at least one of the grounds asserted by the moving party supported the court\u2019s decision. <em>See Smigelski v. Potomac Insurance Co., </em>403 Md. 55, 61, 939 A.2d 189 (2008); <em>Phillips v. Allstate Indem. Co., </em>156 Md.App. 729, 740, 848 A.2d 681 (2004); <em>Ross v. Am. Iron Works, </em>153 Md.App. 1, 10, 834 A.2d 962, (2003) (stating the proposition that in a summary judgment context an appellate court will affirm a trial court\u2019s decision if the record indicates that at least one of the grounds asserted in favor of the motion for summary judgment supported the trial court\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Association based its motion for judgment on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">(1) The Association could not constitute a \u201ccombination or conspiracy\u201d for purposes of an antitrust violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(2) The Association\u2019s rules are not governed by the Sherman Act because they are the product of a clear policy of the State and are actively supervised by the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(3) Any alleged restraint of trade is not unreasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(4) KMTC failed to prove the monetary damages it claimed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(5) Most of the monetary damages KMTC claims are time-barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">We will focus on the Association\u2019s third issue\u2014whether the alleged restraint of trade by the Pilots Association was reasonable\u2014in analyzing this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Maryland\u2019s Antitrust Act was enacted \u201cto complement the body of federal law governing restraints of trade, unfair competition [and related matters] ... in order to protect the public and foster fair and honest intrastate competition.\u201d CL \u00a7 ll-202(a)(l).

If an arrangement \u201cmight plausibly be thought to have a net pro-competitive effect, or possibly no effect at all on competition,\u201d more than a \u201cquick-look\u201d is required, and a court must conduct \u201ca more thorough enquiry into the consequences of those restraints....\u201d <em>Cal.

To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The Court of Appeals has adopted the rule of reason analysis for claims arising under Maryland\u2019s Antitrust Act. <em>Natural Design, </em>302 Md. at 54-55, 485 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We will analyze the alleged restraint in this case using the \u201crule of reason.\u201d On appeal, KMTC does not assert, and the Association does not contest, that either a <em>per se </em>analysis or a \u201cquick-look\u201d analysis is appropriate; both parties posit that the rule of reason applies to these facts.

Lawrence A. Sullivan, Antitrust, \u00a7 68 at 187 (1977) (\u201cTo apply the rule [of reason], one must first identify specifically the practice involved.\u201d). Here, the relevant restraint that KMTC challenges is the Association\u2019s rotation system; more specifically, as stated in KMTC\u2019s brief, KMTC challenges \u201cthe aspect of the Association\u2019s work rule rotation system\u201d that \u201cdenies marine towing companies (and vessel owners) the right to seek to use an \u2018independent contractor\u2019 docking pilot of their choice to perform docking services for their customers.\u201d With this alleged restraint in mind, we will consider the \u201crule of reason\u201d factors that are relevant to the facts of this case. Because of the nature of this dispute, much of our \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis will focus on background information and \u201cthe facts peculiar to maritime pilotage.\u201d Specifically, in this first portion of the analysis, we will address (1) the historical evolution of the Act and Maryland\u2019s pilotage regulations; (2) the authority that the Act gives to the Board; (3) the duties of the Association in administering pilotage work rules; (4) the development of the law regulating docking masters; (5) the addition of the conflict of interest provision, BOP \u00a7 11-603, to the Act; and (6) the effect of these developments on tug companies in the Port of Baltimore. After providing this background information and discussing \u201cthe facts peculiar to maritime pilotage,\u201d we will then proceed to address the history of the restraint, the evil sought to be addressed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>restraint, and the reasons for the particular remedy adopted by the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">We begin with the facts peculiar to maritime pilotage, \u201ca unique institution [which] must be judged as such.\u201d <em>Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm\u2019rs, </em>330 U.S. 552, 558, 67 S.Ct. 910, 91 L.Ed. 1093 (1947). Pilots must possess substantial technical skill and knowledge to guide vessels amidst the \u201cinfinite variety of navigation hazards, currents, tides, sand bars, submerged objects, weather conditions and the like that mark the harbors ... open to commercial vessels.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Marine Exploration Co., </em>583 F.2d 1336, 1338 (5th Cir.1978). These considerations apply as fully to docking masters as to other pilots. Nicholas J. Healy <em>&amp; </em>Joseph C. Sweeney, The Law of Marine Collision 260 (1st ed. 1998) (\u201cThe tug master must know water levels, depth of water and state of the tides, currents, ordinary obstructions, width and length of channels, and clearance of bridges.\u201d). As Justice Black explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">Pilots are ... indispensable cogs in the transportation system of every maritime economy. Their work prevents traffic congestion and accidents which would impair navigation in and to the ports. It affects the safety of lives and cargo, the cost and time expended in port calls, and, in some measure, the competitive attractiveness of particular ports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"><em>Kotch, </em>330 U.S. at 558, 67 S.Ct. 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Every maritime state has both a mandatory pilotage requirement and pilot licensing regulations. Paul G. Kirchner <em>&amp; </em>Clayton L. Diamond, <em>Unique Institutions, Indispensable Cogs, and Hoary Figures: Understanding Pilotage Regulations in the United States, </em>23 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 168, 187-89 (2011). Maryland is no exception. We will now address the specific aspects of Maryland\u2019s scheme at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\n<em>(1) The History of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The General Assembly first passed a law regulating pilots of vessels in 1787. 1787 Md. Laws (November Session) at 277-80.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute required ships above a certain size to use State-licensed pilots while in that portion of the Chesapeake Bay within the boundaries of the State, set out qualifications for licensure, and established a licensing and regulatory board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Growing from these core requirements, Maryland\u2019s pilotage law has been supplemented and amended many times throughout the years and is now codified as the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Among other things, the current Act establishes the manner in which pilots are employed and compensated. Under BOP \u00a7 ll-501(a), \u201c[e]ach American vessel engaged in foreign trade and each foreign vessel shall employ a licensed pilot to pilot the vessel when it is underway on the navigable waters of the State, including when the vessel is towing or being towed by another vessel.\u201d Pilotage and docking master fees are established by the Public Service Commission. BOP \u00a7 11-502; <em>see also </em>Md.Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. (\u201cPUC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 4-303(a) and 4-303.1 (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.) (The Public Service Commission establishes \u201cfees and charges\u201d for both pilotage services and docking services \u201cat a just and reasonable rate.\u201d). These fees are paid by the owners of the vessels. BOP \u00a7 ll-501(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Under the Act, all Maryland bay pilots and docking masters who service foreign ships are licensed by the Board. Additionally, these pilots are members of the Association. Sunset Review (2009) at 2. Pilots are regulated both by the Act, which the Board has been given authority to enforce, and by work rules passed by the Association. Thus, the Board and the Association play pivotal roles in the administration of pilotage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>services in Maryland. A discussion of both entities is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\n<em>(2) The Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Board \u201chas been in existence for over 200 years, and its priorities and legislative mandate remain largely the same today as when the Board was first established: to provide safety in navigation of Maryland\u2019s commercial waterways in the interests of the ships, the citizens of the State, and the environment.\u201d Sunset Review (2009) at 3. It is the express power of the Board to \u201cadopt regulations and pass orders to govern and regulate licensed pilots.\u201d BOP \u00a7 ll-205(a). BOP \u00a7 ll-205(b)(2) states that \u201cthe Board shall ... be responsible for safety in providing pilotage.\u201d To help ensure the pilots are properly trained, BOP \u00a7 11-305 authorizes the Board to determine which potential pilots are sufficiently qualified for the positions and allows the Board to determine how many pilots are \u201cnecessary to protect the commercial interests of the State.\u201d BOP \u00a7 ll-305(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>(3) The Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u201cAll pilots licensed by the State Board of Pilots are also members of the Association of Maryland Pilots, founded in 1852.\u201d Sunset Review (2009) at 4. The Association plays two important roles in the State\u2019s regulatory scheme. First, it is the collection agent for the receipt and disbursement of all pilotage fees. BOP \u00a7 11-503; \u00a7 11-602(c)(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>has the authority to require the Association to make retirement and disability payments to certain inactive pilots, <em>see </em>BOP \u00a7 11-504 and \u00a7 11-505, and to reserve a portion of its income in a capital replacement fund, disbursements from which can be made only with the Board\u2019s approval. BOP 11-506(a)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Second, the Association maintains work rules for its members. Rules that pertain to \u201cpilot list administration, appointments [and] assignment intervals\u201d must be approved by the Board, as well as rules that \u201caffect safe operations of vessels by Maryland pilots.\u201d COMAR 09.26.04.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>(k) The Regulation of Docking Masters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Today, both the Board and the Association have the authority to regulate bay pilots and docking masters, but this was not always the case. Before 2000, docking masters were specifically exempt from the regulation and licensure requirements of the Act. Instead, docking masters held Coast Guard licenses entitling them to operate a tug and were usually employees of tug companies. Parks &amp; Cattell, <em>supra, </em>at 999. The Coast Guard grew concerned about the accountability of docking masters because the Coast Guard licensing procedure did not involve an evaluation of the licensee\u2019s experience or skills in any docking master function. <em>Id. </em>at 1002. Following a series of administrative law proceedings involving negligence or misconduct by docking masters in other ports in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, the Coast Guard \u201ccontacted the state authorities in those states in which the use of docking masters was common ... to express concern that there were persons over whom no one was asserting jurisdictional control, who were docking and undocking vessels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002; <em>see also </em>Sunset Review (2009) at 6 (\u201cPrior to 2000, ... accountability in the event of a docking incident was not clearly defined.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Maryland\u2019s Docking Master Law, enacted in 2000, addressed this regulatory gap by establishing a State Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Docking Masters to license and regulate docking masters. <em>See </em>S.B. 287 (2000), Fiscal Note at 2 (explaining that the bill addresses the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s concern \u201cabout which legal authority (the State or federal officials) has jurisdiction should there be an accident in the port itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In 2004, however, with the passage of House Bill 884 (2004), the Docking Master Act was repealed, the Board of Docking Masters was abolished and the docking masters passed under the regulatory aegis of the State Board of Pilots. <em>See </em>BOP \u00a7 11-101 (i) (defining \u201cpilotage\u201d to include \u201cmaneuvering a vessel during berthing and unberthing operations\u201d and \u201cshifting a vessel within a port with tug assistance.\u201d). Thus, beginning in 2004, both bay pilots and docking masters received their licenses from the Board and were both generally regulated by the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>(5) BOP \u00a7 11-603\u2014The Conflict of Interest Provision in the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Of particular import to this appeal, the 2004 legislation added a conflict of interest provision to the Act. <em>See </em>BOP \u00a7 11-603.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under BOP \u00a7 11-603, a licensed pilot may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>allow \u201cpersonal financial interests to conflict with professional responsibilities,\u201d \u00a7 11\u2014608(b)(3), and can be paid for his or her services only through the Association. BOP \u00a7 11\u2014603(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The General Assembly\u2019s decision to prohibit financial relationships between docking masters, tug companies and steamship lines is consistent with the independence of judgment traditionally afforded pilots:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Under law and custom [pilots] have an independence wholly incompatible with the general obligations of obedience normally owed by an employee to his employer. [ ] Their fees are fixed by law and their charges must not be discriminatory. As a rule no employer, no person, can tell them how to perform their pilotage duties. When the law does not prescribe their duties, pilots are usually free to act on their own best judgment while engaged in piloting a vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., </em>349 U.S. 85, 93-94, 75 S.Ct. 629, 99 L.Ed. 911 (1955) (plurality opinion) (citing, among other authorities, <em>The China, </em>7 Wall. 53, 67, 19 L.Ed. 67 (1869); and <em>Smith v. Pierce, </em>1 La. 350, 357-58 (1830)). As two commentators explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A key aspect of the state pilotage system is that in virtually every circumstance the state pilot is independent of the vessel and the vessel operator____The primary responsibility of every state pilot is to protect the public interest by facilitating the safe and efficient movement of vessels in state waters. <em>In that respect, the principal customer of the pilot\u2019s services is not the vessel\u2019s operator but rather the state and its public interests.11</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Kirchner &amp; Diamond, <em>supra, </em>at 188 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>(6) The Effect of the Current Regulations on Tug Services in the Port of Baltimore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Association\u2019s rotation system and the Act\u2019s conflict of interest provision, BOP \u00a7 11-603, both protect the independence of judgment traditionally afforded to pilots in a direct and concrete fashion. The evidence presented by KMTC demonstrates the difficulties faced by docking masters as they guide very large, unwieldy vessels to moorings in the face of narrow channels, high winds, and adverse tide conditions. Maryland\u2019s pilotage scheme allows pilots to perform their duties in an independent fashion, separate from the pressures that may stem from the vessel\u2019s operator. This serves to ease the tension between the interests of a shipping line\u2014to have its vessels moored and unmoored as quickly and inexpensively as possible\u2014and a docking master\u2019s duty to the public to perform those duties safely. The facts peculiar to pilotage support the notion that Maryland\u2019s fixed rotation system, which has the effect of immunizing docking masters from pressure from the master of a vessel, is a reasonable approach to a complex problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Next, we will discuss, concurrently, the history of the restraint, the evil sought to be addressed, and the reasons for the particular remedy adopted by the Association. This requires us to return to the history of the Pilots Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The Association designed the rotation system to ensure that pilots have approximately the same workload and to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>against sending out fatigued pilots. <em>See </em>Sunset Review (2000) at 4 (explaining that \u201cmaintaining the work rotation schedules ... ensure[s] pilots are subject to approximately the same workload and they have had enough rest prior to boarding and piloting the next ship.\u201d). While application of the Association\u2019s rotation rules to docking masters may be of relatively recent origin, Maryland\u2019s policy of diminishing competition among pilots is not. <em>See, e.g., </em>1787 Md. Laws 278, Vol. 204, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 (requiring licensed pilots to offer their services \u201cfirst to the vessel nearest the land or in most distress\u201d and the masters of such ships to accept the pilot). In this regard, Maryland is no different from other maritime states. <em>See Kotch, </em>330 U.S. at 561, 67 S.Ct. 910 (explaining that pilot associations arose to prevent competition among pilots and that \u201c \u2018[o]ne of the unfortunate results of intense competition was the fact that frequently pilots could not be had when wanted, [as] they might be far out to sea in quest of business.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Pilotage in the United States 28 (Department of Commerce 1917))).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We perceive significant benefits to the public in a work rule that allows a docking master to exercise discretion in calling for equipment that he or she thinks most suitable for a particular task. The rule allows the docking master to make this decision without fearing that the owner of the vessel will replace him or her with another docking master willing to attempt to perform the job with different tugs. In this regard, the work rule furthers the purpose and effect of BOP \u00a7 ll-603(b)(2), which prohibits pilots from taking any action with the intent to benefit, or to harm, the economic interests of a tug company.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Moreover, the corresponding harm to KMTC is limited. Not only is the type of harm suffered by KMTC discrete in nature (the fact that KMTC cannot choose its own pilots), but the frequency of harm is small as well. At oral argument, all parties agreed that there are approximately 5,000 calls for tug services per year in and around the Port of Baltimore. Even so, at trial, KMTC presented evidence on just three instances that it believed restrained its ability to fairly and freely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>conduct business. On these three occasions, KMTC lost business because the docking master in each instance independently determined that the available KMTC tugboats were inadequate to safely moor the vessel in question because of weather conditions. This was the extent of KMTC\u2019s harm on this issue. There was no evidence of any anti-competitive intent on behalf of the docking masters involved.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Our review of the record establishes that Maryland\u2019s regulated pilotage system provides highly specialized services vital to the State\u2019s economic health as well as to the environment of the Chesapeake Bay. The Association\u2019s work rules and BOP \u00a7 11-603 have the effect of permitting docking masters to perform their duties free from any consideration other than the safe and efficient mooring of a vessel. The work rule also allocates the burden of providing docking master services among the handful of licensees. There is an incidental anti-competitive effect but, as we have explained, limitations on competition among pilots have long been an aspect of Maryland\u2019s pilotage law and are typical features of pilotage laws in the United States. <em>See Kotch, </em>330 U.S. at 561, 67 S.Ct. 910; <em>Olsen v. Smith, </em>195 U.S. 332, 344-45, 25 S.Ct. 52, 49 L.Ed. 224 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Indeed, the rotation schedule that KMTC criticizes is a common aspect of pilots associations. Parks <em>&amp; </em>Cattell, <em>supra, </em>at 1049 (\u201cThe general form of a pilot association is that of a loose partnership, in which the various members maintain a central accounting and dispatch office and operate out of a pool; that is, the individual pilot members take turns piloting vessels on a rotation basis.\u201d); Thomas J. Schoenbaum, 2 Admiralty and Maritime Law 96 (5th ed. 2011) (\u201c[Pilots] associations maintain a roster of pilots and a central office that receives requests for pilotage. [Pilots Associations] may dispatch pilots for duty on a rotating basis.\u201d); <em>accord Guy, </em>203 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>U.S. at 404, 27 S.Ct. 63 (describing the Virginia Pilot Association as an \u201cunincorporated association\u201d made up of pilots whom \u201c[b]y their agreement ... take turns in boarding vessels required by law to take a pilot\u201d). That, on rare occasions, individual docking masters concluded that KMTC\u2019s tugs were inadequate does not weigh heavily in our analysis of the utility and reasonableness of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In light of all of these considerations, we hold that KMTC failed to demonstrate that the Association\u2019s work rules implementing the rotation system are unreasonable or violate Maryland\u2019s Antitrust Act. The trial court did not err in granting the motion for judgment of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II. Mandatory Membership in the Association</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">To this Court, Krause argues, under two distinct theories, that it is an unconstitutional use of a State\u2019s police power to require a pilot to be a member of the Association. Under one theory, he contends that the Act infringes upon his freedom of contract rights in violation of the due process clause of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The other argument asserted by Krause is that, under the equal protection portion of Article 24,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Act unfairly distinguishes between pilots and \u201cany other state professionals, licensed or otherwise\u201d by requiring docking masters and pilots to be members of the Association. Krause asserts that, under either theory, \u201cthe required Association membership provision ... cannot surmount the hurdles that [the law] <em>not </em>be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary1 or \u2018discriminating.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The State argues that Krause did not raise a due process or equal protection argument based on Article 24 before the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>court and that accordingly these contentions have not been preserved for appellate review. We agree with the State but only in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">A review of the record establishes that Krause did not raise an equal protection argument before the trial court. We will not consider this contention for the first time on appeal. With regard to Krause\u2019s due process claim, it is true that Krause presented <em>a </em>due process argument to the trial court; however, as we will discuss, the due process argument that he presents to us on appeal is radically different from and inconsistent with the argument that he offered to the trial court. Accordingly, Krause\u2019s due process argument is not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The scope of our appellate review is determined by what \u201cplainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.... \u201d Rule 8-131 (a). This rule \u201c \u2018is a matter of basic fairness to the trial court and to opposing counsel, as well as being fundamental to the proper administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Kaleb K., </em>390 Md. 502, 513, 889 A.2d 1019 (2006) (quoting <em>Medley v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 225, 231, 448 A.2d 363 (1982)). Specifically, \u201c[o]n matters of such import and significance as constitutional questions, we cannot overstress the necessity of fully preserving the issue below. The trial court should be given not only the opportunity to rule, but also the assistance of counsels\u2019 arguments and memoranda in reaching its result.\u201d <em>Hall v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 240, 245, 323 A.2d 435 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Throughout the proceedings before the trial court, Krause argued that the Pilots Act as a <em>whole, </em>and specifically BOP \u00a7 11-603, were facially invalid and unconstitutional.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>appeal, Krause\u2019s position is diametrically opposed to the position that he set forth before the trial court. He no longer challenges the Pilots Act <em>as a whole, </em>but instead claims that the appeal is only a challenge \u201cto the required Association membership.\u201d As stated in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">To reiterate, this is not a challenge to the constitutionality of the Pilots Act as a whole, nor to the \u201cconflict of interest\u201d provision, \u00a7 11-603. It is a challenge only to the required Association membership, as violative of the Declaration of Rights, MD Code, Constitution, Art. 24, by depriving Captain Krause of his \u2018liberty or property,\u2019 i.e., his freedom to work as an independent contractor docking pilot.\u201d[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">There are problems with Krause\u2019s new position. First, this much narrower question\u2014which involves \u201ca challenge only to the required Association membership\u201d and not a facial challenge to the Pilots Act\u2014was not before the trial court. Second, Krause has failed to identify the portion of the Act (if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the Act as a whole or BOP \u00a7 11-603) that he wants invalidated. Krause insists that this is a challenge \u201cto the required Association membership,\u201d but we cannot address this assertion if Krause does not direct us to the offending provision of the Act. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5); <em>Citizens v. Board of Elections, </em>201 Md.App. 605, 622 n. 18, 30 A.3d 245 (2011) (this Court will not consider arguments that are not presented with particularity). For these reasons, Krause\u2019s due process argument has not been preserved. Rule 8-131(a).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">III. The Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u201cIt has long been held that a person whose rights are affected by a statute may obtain a declaration of his rights and status.\u201d <em>DeWolfe v.

This review process is known as a \"sunset review\u201d because the agencies subject to review usually have termination dates in their authorizing statutes. <em>See Sunset Review, </em>Department of Legislative Services (March 27, 2012), http://dls.state.md.us/Content.aspx?page= 105.

At the time of trial, KMTC was owned by Krause\u2019s wife, Joann Krause, and his son, David Krause. From 1989 to 2000, Krause was a part owner of KMTC. In 2000, Krause relinquished his stake in KMTC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. This principle was confirmed by the testimony of Captain Michael Duarte, a docking master in Boston's harbors and KMTC\u2019s expert witness on tugboat capabilities, who agreed that a docking master must exercise discretion in \"choosing how to accomplish a particular job\u201d and stated further that this \u201cwould have a lot to do with the docking pilot, his experience, knowing his boats and the people running the boats ... and knowing the waters and the berths.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">. \"Bollard pull\" is a term for the towing capacity of a tug.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">. In its brief, KMTC asserts that it \"does not challenge the rotation system itself\" but rather challenges \"the aspect of the Association\u2019s work rule rotation system ... that restrains and excludes [KMTC] from competing to serve some of its own customers.\" To the extent we can distinguish these two positions, we interpret this to mean that KMTC only criticizes the rotation system as it affects its preexisting contracts with shipping lines, not as it operates generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b230-11\">. We have selected the third issue partly as a result of a process of elimination. With regard to the first issue, we cannot determine whether the concerted action by the Pilot Defendants could constitute a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act because the record contains very little relevant information. <em>See American Needle, Inc. v. NFL, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2201, 2209, 176 L.Ed.2d 947 (2010) (Whether parties are engaged in a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act is not based upon legal formalities but rather on \"a functional consideration of how the parties involved in the alleged anticompetitive conduct actually operate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">As for issue two, the Association claims that it is immune from liability under the state action doctrine. The state action doctrine is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>affirmative defense to an antitrust claim that requires a defendant to show \u201cfirst, [that] the State has articulated a clear and affirmative policy to allow the anticompetitive conduct, and second, [that] the State provides active supervision of [the alleged] anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private actors.\u201d <em>FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>504 U.S. 621, 631, 112 S.Ct. 2169, 119 L.Ed.2d 410 (1992) (citation omitted). Because the trial court resolved this case on a motion for judgment, the Association was never required to present evidence on its state action defense. Thus, the record is scant as to the degree to which the Board actually supervised the Association's work rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">With regard to issue four, the trial court\u2019s order granting judgment gives us no indication as to whether the court concluded KMTC\u2019s evidence as to damages was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Finally, we will not focus on the argument that most, but not all, of KMTC\u2019s claimed damages were time-barred because resolving this issue would not fully address the disputes between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In contrast, the record is sufficient for us to determine whether the anti-competitive effects of the Association's work rules are reasonable. Moreover, in light of the importance of docking masters to the efficient operation of the Port of Baltimore, resolution of this question is in the public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. A \"rule of reason\u201d analysis is conducted in various stages, where each party must satisfy an initial burden before a court conducts a complete review of the relevant facts.

Salvino, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 290, 317 (2d Cir.2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Under the rule of reason, the plaintiffs bear an initial burden to demonstrate the defendants\u2019 challenged behavior had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market. Because the antitrust laws protect competition as a whole, evidence that plaintiffs have been harmed as individual competitors will not suffice. If the plaintiffs satisfy their initial burden, the burden shifts to the defendants to offer evidence of the pro-competitive effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>their agreement. Assuming defendants can provide such proof, the burden shifts back to the plaintiffs to prove that any legitimate competitive benefits offered by defendants could have been achieved through less restrictive means. Ultimately, the factfinder must engage in a careful weighing of the competitive effects of the agreement\u2014both pro and con\u2014to determine if the effects of the challenged restraint tend to promote or destroy competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">(Citation omitted).

To understand Krause\u2019s <em>volte face, </em>we must return briefly to the proceedings before the trial court and consider an affirmative defense raised by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Prior to filing the current action, Krause was the subject of an administrative disciplinary proceeding brought by the Board against him for an alleged violation of \u00a7 11-603. The Board prevailed before the administrative law judge. Krause sought judicial review and, eventually, the administrative decision was affirmed in part and reversed in part by a panel of this Court in <em>State Board of Pilots v. Krause, </em>No. 2979, September Term, 2007 (filed July 24, 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 Md. 357, 983 A.2d 432 (2009). Krause did not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 11-603 in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Before the trial court in the instant case, the State asserted that Krause waived the right to challenge \u00a7 11-603 by failing to raise it in the administrative proceeding. In response, Krause argued that the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable because he was challenging the Pilots Act as a whole, citing <em>Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States, </em>339 Md. 596, 619, 664 A.2d 862 (1995). Krause was adamant about characterizing his claim as a facial attack on the constitutionality of the Act (as opposed to a challenge to a discrete, fact-specific situation) to rebut the \"exhaustion of administrative remedies\" defense proffered by the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\">. Our own review of the Act leads us to conclude that no single provision of the Act requires pilots to be members of the Association. BOP \u00a7 11\u2014603(c)(1) prohibits pilots from receiving remuneration for their services other than through the Association and BOP \u00a7 11-505(a)(2)(iii) requires the Association to distribute net fees to \"regularly working licensed pilots who are members in good standing of the Association.\u201d The two statutes operate together to impose an effective requirement of Association membership, at least for those pilots who wish to earn a living through their services. Krause cannot simultaneously assert that \"this is not a challenge to ... the 'conflict of interest\u2019 provision, \u00a7 11-603\u201d while also contending that this \u201cis a challenge only to the required Association membership\u201d when \u00a7 11-603 is an integral part of the statutory scheme requiring membership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
