Griggs and her late husband, Victor G. Griggs, refinanced the mortgage on their home with Beneficial Mortgage Company of Maryland. One of the mortgage instruments the Griggses executed, when they met with representatives of Beneficial Mortgage to obtain the refinancing, contained an arbitration rider, providing that disputes \u201carising from or relating\u201d to their agreement with Beneficial Mortgage, \u201cshall be resolved, upon the election of [either party] by binding arbitration.\u201d At that time, they also signed an application for a credit life insurance policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from Household Life Insurance Company, appellee, covering them both.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Two years after the refinancing, Mr. Griggs died, whereupon Mrs. Griggs requested payment under that policy. When Household Life denied that request, claiming that the policy papers the Griggses had signed contained inaccurate information regarding Mr. Griggs\u2019s health history, Mrs. Griggs, on behalf of herself and her late husband\u2019s estate, brought an action, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, against Household Life, alleging breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">After considerable discovery, Mrs. Griggs filed successive amended complaints, adding a claim of insurance fraud and, as defendants, the individuals who had participated in the meeting, at which she and her late husband had executed both the refinancing documents and the credit life insurance application, namely: Integrated Real Estate Processing LP (\u201cInte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>grated Real Estate\u201d), which was engaged in the business of closing mortgage loans for financing companies, such as Beneficial Mortgage; Luke Evans, Beneficial Mortgage\u2019s office manager; Marc Kurlander, an independent loan closer who worked, under contract, for Integrated Real Estate; and Andreas Teddy Dailey, Jr., an account executive for Beneficial Mortgage; whom, together with Household Life, we shall collectively refer to as \u201cappellees.\u201d All three individual appellees\u2014Kurlander, Evans, and Dailey\u2014participated both in closing the Griggses\u2019 loan and in procuring the Griggses\u2019 application for credit life insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">After Evans and Dailey were added to the suit, they, together with Household, filed a motion to dismiss. In that motion, Evans and Dailey\u2014but not Household Life\u2014demanded arbitration, citing the arbitration rider the Griggses had executed as part of their mortgage lending agreement with Beneficial. That demand was coupled with a request that all other proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. When the Baltimore City court granted the request of Evans and Dailey for arbitration \u201con all issues\u201d and stayed all proceedings until arbitration was concluded, Mrs. Griggs noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Because we conclude that the circuit court erred in granting the request for arbitration, we shall vacate that court\u2019s order compelling arbitration and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Mr. and Mrs. Griggs owned a home in Randallstown, Maryland, which was financed by notes secured by two deeds of trust. In early January 2006, they received an unsolicited telephone call from appellee Andreas Teddy Dailey, Jr., an account executive for Beneficial Mortgage, offering to refinance their mortgage. The Griggses accepted that offer. After the Griggses\u2019 home was appraised, appellee Dailey told them that their loan had been approved and that he had arranged an appointment at Beneficial\u2019s office in Owings Mills to complete their refinancing. It was, at that time, he claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that he suggested to the Griggses that they purchase a credit life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">As agreed, on January 20, 2006, the Griggses went to Beneficial\u2019s office to execute the loan documents. Present for that occasion were, in addition to the Griggses, appellees Evans, Dailey, and Kurlander. At Beneficial\u2019s office, the Griggses were, in the words of the complaint Mrs. Griggs filed, \u201cpresented with a voluminous amount of paperwork to sign and initial.\u201d They did so as to a host of documents, including a note, deed of trust, and arbitration rider (all of which we shall collectively refer to as the \u201cMortgage Agreement\u201d), as well as an application for credit life insurance. Mrs. Griggs claims that neither she nor her husband were aware that the life insurance application was among the documents they were executing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Appellee Luke Evans, Beneficial\u2019s office manager, purportedly reviewed the documents after the Griggses had signed and initialed them. When Evans completed that task, the Griggses were handed a package which, according to the complaint, contained copies of all of the documents they had just executed. Mrs. Griggs maintains, however, that the package did not contain a copy of the application for credit life insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Appellee Marc Kurlander, an independent loan closer working, under contract, for Integrated Real Estate, actually filled out the insurance application. In doing so, he asked the Griggses, he claims, each question and recorded their answers on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Among the questions set forth in the application was a series of queries regarding the Griggses\u2019 respective medical histories. Of particular relevance here was this query:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">Have you been diagnosed by a member of the medical profession as having (1) high blood pressure, (2) cancer or tumor, (3) AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) or an ARC (AIDS Related Complex), (4) heart disease, (5) stroke, (6) diabetes, (7) drug or alcohol related condition; any disease or disorder of the (8) digestive system, (9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>lungs, (10) kidneys, (11) liver, or (12) blood (other than AIDS)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Directly across the page from this query were two check-boxes, one labeled \u201c1st Applicant\u201d and the other \u201c2nd Applicant.\u201d Each box was checked \u201cNo.\u201d But, according to Mrs. Griggs, neither she nor her husband was ever asked any questions about their medical histories during the refinancing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">. Shortly after the completion of the refinancing, the Griggses became aware of the existence of the insurance policy, as the first loan statement they received included a monthly insurance premium of $162.50. When the Griggses telephoned the office of Beneficial Mortgage to inquire about the charge, they were informed that it was a monthly premium for credit life insurance. The Griggses paid the premium and did so each month thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On January 12, 2008, Victor Griggs died of lung cancer. After her husband\u2019s death, Helen Griggs filed an insurance claim with Household Life, demanding payment of $150,000, the maximum benefit under the policy. In March 2008, a representative of Household called Mrs. Griggs, asking about Victor\u2019s health prior to his terminal illness. Mrs. Griggs disclosed that Victor had suffered from diabetes and hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In a letter dated April 14, 2008, Household Life denied Mrs. Griggs\u2019s insurance claim on the ground that Victor Griggs had failed to disclose material facts about his medical history that, if they had been disclosed, would have resulted in a denial of coverage for him. The letter therefore rescinded coverage of Mr. Griggs, \u201cdeclaring] it void from its inception in accordance with the insurance certificate.\u201d The letter concluded with the statement that Mrs. Griggs would \u201creceive a premium refund check\u201d and that the Griggses\u2019 joint life insurance was \u201cno longer in force on this account,\u201d but that single life insurance would \u201cremain in force for Helen Griggs.\u201d Attached to the letter was a copy of the Griggses\u2019 insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>application, including the page containing the medical history questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Mrs. Griggs claims that neither she nor her late husband filled out the insurance application, that neither of them \u201cwere asked any questions regarding their health,\u201d and that, although the application \u201cappears to contain her signature and that of Victor Griggs[,] ... she can only guess that [the insurance application] must have been slipped into the voluminous numbers of papers they signed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On September 18, 2008, Mrs. Griggs filed a complaint against Household Life in the Baltimore City circuit court, alleging breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On October 15, 2008, Mrs. Griggs filed an amended complaint, joining Evans as a defendant, and adding an additional count alleging civil conspiracy: specifically, that appellees Household Life and Evans conspired to fill out a fraudulent credit life insurance application, with the understanding that, if a claim were ever subsequently made, it would be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On January 5, 2009, Household Life and Evans filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. After a hearing, the court dismissed the breach of contract claim against Evans and the civil conspiracy claim against both him and Household, without prejudice. Household and Evans thereafter filed answers to the remaining counts of the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On April 10, 2009, appellee Household Life propounded its first set of interrogatories and request for production of documents. One week later, the circuit court issued a scheduling order. On May 6, 2009, Household Life and Evans filed a motion for protective order with respect to Mrs. Griggs\u2019s notice of deposition <em>duces tecum. </em>On May 29, 2009, the parties filed a consent motion to amend the scheduling order to extend various deadlines for scheduling depositions and designating expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">On July 17, 2009, with the benefit of discovery, Mrs. Griggs filed a second amended complaint. That complaint joined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>three new defendants: appellees Integrated Real Estate, Kurlander, and Dailey; and re-alleged breach of contract by Household Life, intentional infliction of emotional distress by Household, Evans, Kurlander, and Dailey, and civil conspiracy involving Household and Evans. In addition, it asserted three new counts. One of the new counts alleged insurance fraud by all of the appellees; the remaining two new counts claimed that Household Life and Integrated Real Estate were vicariously liable for the acts of their respective agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Common to all counts in the second amended complaint was the assertion that the individual appellees\u2014Evans, Dailey, and Kurlander\u2014as actual or apparent agents of Household Life and Integrated Real Estate and acting for their own pecuniary gain, fraudulently completed and then submitted the credit life insurance application in the Griggses\u2019 names. Their purpose, according to the Griggses, was to wrongfully extract premiums from them and to use the fraudulently obtained application to deny any claim that might subsequently be made by either her or her husband, after the other\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">From July to late September 2009, the parties conducted substantial discovery, holding depositions, issuing subpoenas <em>duces tecum, </em>and filing designations of expert witnesses and corporate representatives to be deposed. On August 28, 2009, appellees Household Life, Evans, and Dailey filed a motion to dismiss. In that motion, Evans and Dailey moved, in the event that dismissal was not granted, to compel arbitration and, if compelled, to stay all proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">After a hearing on the motion to compel, the court issued a one-page order, granting the motion, ordering the Griggses \u201cto submit to arbitration on all issues,\u201d and staying the proceeding pending the outcome of arbitration. Mrs. Griggs then, individually and on behalf of her husband\u2019s estate, noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Although this case falls within the Federal Arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Act (\u201cFAA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the arbitration rider is part of a contract involving interstate commerce and it expressly states that it is governed by the FAA, we nonetheless turn to state law in determining whether appellees can enforce that arbitration rider, <em>Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, </em>556 U.S. 624, 129 S.Ct. 1896, 1904, 173 L.Ed.2d 832 (2009); <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995); <em>accord Cheek v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc., </em>378 Md. 139, 147, 835 A.2d 656 (2003), because state law \u201cis applicable to determine which contracts are binding under \u00a7 2 [of the FAA] and enforceable under \u00a7 3 [of the FAA] \u2018if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlisle, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1902 (quoting <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 493 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In so doing, we note, at the outset, that Maryland follows the objective standard of contract interpretation, which requires that \u201cwhere the language employed in a contract is unambiguous, a court shall give effect to its plain meaning and there is no need for further construction by the court.\u201d <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 251, 768 A.2d 620 (2001). We apply that standard here, even though it evolved from cases in which the contest was between signatories to the contract and not, as here, where none of the parties, except the Griggses, are signatories to the arbitration rider, as that provision is in the Mortgage Agreement, not the credit life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Integration Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The credit life insurance policy, prepared by Household Life, not only does not include an arbitration clause but contains an integration provision, designated the \u201cEntire Contract\u201d provision. That provision states that \u201c[t]he Group Policy, the attached application for it, and application for insurance, if any, are the entire contract of insurance.\u201d By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>this provision, Household Life disclaimed any suggestion that the provision or clause of any other contract, which would include the Mortgage Agreement and its arbitration rider, was incorporated by reference into the credit life insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Having rejected, by implication, the arbitration rider, it may not now, on appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claim its benefits. More broadly stated, just as <em>\u201ca </em>party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit,\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960), so, it may not invoke an arbitration agreement it has refused to be bound by, when such an invocation suits its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201cSignificant Relationship Test\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The arbitration rider at issue provides that either the \u201cLender,\u201d that is, Beneficial Mortgage, or the Griggses \u201cmay request that any claim, dispute, or controversy ... arising from or relating to\u201d the Mortgage Agreement \u201cor the relationships which result from\u201d that agreement, \u201cincluding the validity or enforceability of [the] arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire [a]greement, shall be resolved, upon the election of\u2019 either party, by binding arbitration. It is undisputed that this is a \u201cbroadly worded\u201d arbitration clause. <em>See Am. Recovery Corp. v. Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc., </em>96 F.3d 88, 92-93 (4th Cir.1996) (arbitration clause covering any dispute \u201carising out of or related to this ... Agreement\u201d held \u201cbroadly worded\u201d). What is disputed are the consequences that flow from that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">That is because a \u201cbroadly worded\u201d arbitration clause triggers the \u201csignificant relationship test,\u201d by application of which we determine whether an arbitration contractual provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>sion applies to a dispute that does not arise from the governing contract (such as the Griggses\u2019 Mortgage Agreement), but under a related agreement (such as the Griggses\u2019 credit life insurance policy). According to that test, \u201cwhen a \u2018significant relationship\u2019 exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained,\u201d those claims must be submitted to arbitration. <em>Long v. Silver, </em>248 F.3d 309, 316 (4th Cir.2001), <em>overruled on other grounds, Hertz Corp. v. Friend, </em>559 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 1190-92, 175 L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellees contend that \u201cthis dispute unquestionably has a significant relationship with the mortgage document containing the arbitration rider.\u201d They reason that, because Mrs. Griggs\u2019s claims, under the life insurance policy, \u201carise from and relate to the execution of the mortgage and life insurance documents, and the execution of those documents only\u201d and because \u201ca life insurance policy like the one at issue here is not even available standing alone, but can only be obtained as part of a mortgage transaction,\u201d the significant relationship test is satisfied, and thus, the arbitration rider applies to this dispute. (Emphasis deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Appellees maintain that <em>American Recovery, supra, </em>96 F.3d 88, provides ample support for their contention that the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d between the Griggses\u2019 claims and the Mortgage Agreement, containing the arbitration rider, enables them to invoke arbitration as to the Griggses\u2019 claims, based on the credit life insurance policy. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In that case, after entering into a joint venture to install thermal imaging equipment in hospitals in China, Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc. (\u201cCTI\u201d), contracted with American Recovery Corporation (\u201cARC\u201d), a consulting firm, \u201cto provide assistance in seeking the services of a professional communications engineering firm for the project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90. The consulting agreement contained an arbitration clause providing that \u201cany dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or related to this [cjonsulting [ajgreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn addition to the consulting agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ment with CTI, ARC entered into noncircumvention agreements with two engineering firms, Fluor-Daniel and Parsons Engineering, which prevented those ... firms from negotiating with the consortium [to which CTI belonged] except through ARC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At CTI\u2019s direction, ARC successfully negotiated with a third party, Electronic Data Systems (\u201cEDS\u201d), to provide capital and technical expertise to CTI as part of the joint venture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">After ARC had purportedly performed under the consulting agreement but was not paid, Richard V. Secord, Director and President of ARC, resigned and was hired by CTI. Mr. Secord then assisted CTI in securing the services of Fluor-Daniel to work on the China project.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Following CTI\u2019s failure to pay ARC for its services and Mr. Secord\u2019s departure from ARC to CTI, ARC filed suit, in federal district court, against CTI, Mr. Secord, and others,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging, among other things, that CTI induced Mr. Secord\u2019s alleged breach of his fiduciary duty to ARC, that CTI persuaded Fluor-Daniel to breach its noncircumvention agreement, and that ARC was entitled to be paid by CTI for its role in securing financing. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91. In response, CTI moved for arbitration, citing the arbitration clause in its consulting agreement with ARC. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The district court, relying on <em>Mediterranean Enters, v. Ssangyong Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir.1983), denied CTI\u2019s motion, reasoning that ARC\u2019S \u201cclaims against CTI neither arose out of nor related to the consulting agreement that contained the arbitration clause upon which CTI based its motion.\u201d <em>American Recovery, </em>96 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The Fourth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s order denying arbitration, asserting that the district court had \u201cused the improper legal standard for determining whether ARC\u2019S claims were arbitrable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The federal appellate court ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>plained that, unlike the narrowly worded arbitration clause in <em>Mediterranean Enterprises, </em>which covered only \u201cdisputes arising\u201d under the consulting agreement, 708 F.2d at 1461, the broadly worded arbitration clause in <em>American Recovery </em>covered any claim \u201carising out of or related to\u201d the contract. 96 F.3d at 93. In short, it was a \u201cbroadly worded\u201d arbitration clause, and thus, the correct standard was the \u201csignificant relationship test.\u201d ARC\u2019s claims, it then concluded, were significantly related to the consulting agreement and hence were arbitrable. <em>Id. </em>at 93-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In reaching that result, the Fourth Circuit observed that \u201cthe factual allegations underlying\u201d ARC\u2019s first claim, that CTI tortiously induced Mr. Secord to breach a fiduciary duty owed to it, fell \u201cwithin the scope of the consulting agreement\u2019s arbitration clause,\u201d reasoning that that claim was tantamount to a \u201cconten[tion] that CTI, through the personal services agreement [between CTI and Secord], induced Secord to misappropriate a corporate opportunity that rightly belonged to ARC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. To prevail on that claim, ARC, it pointed out, was required to show that it had a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d in a particular business opportunity. <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted). But, to establish that it had such a legitimate interest, ARC relied on the terms of its consulting agreement with CTI. <em>Id. </em>at 94. Thus, proof of ARC\u2019s claim that CTI induced Secord to breach his fiduciary duty was \u201crooted in the existence and terms of the consulting agreement,\u201d or, in other words, that claim was significantly related to the consulting agreement, with its broadly worded arbitration clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Furthermore, ARC\u2019s claim that CTI tortiously induced Fluor-Daniel\u2019s breach of its noncircumvention agreement was, the Fourth Circuit found, significantly related to the consulting agreement, since an \u201cexpress term of the consulting agreement mandatefd] that CTI ... not enter into any agreement with Fluor-Daniel in violation of the non[-]circumvention agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, finally, ARC\u2019s quantum meruit claim was, also, significantly related to the consulting agreement, declared the Fourth Circuit, as ARC \u201cagain clearly relie[d] on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the terms of the consulting agreement to prove its claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95. Specifically, ARC\u2019s quantum meruit claim depended on \u201ca prior amendment to the consulting agreement\u201d as well as its allegation that Mr. Secord had assured it of compensation for its efforts to secure funding from EDS \u201cthrough the vehicle of an amendment to the consulting agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The facts of <em>American Recovery </em>differ materially from those of the instant case. In contrast to <em>American Recovery, </em>where arbitration was successfully invoked by a signatory to the contract containing the arbitration clause, none of the appellees currently before us is a party to the Mortgage Agreement containing the arbitration rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, in <em>American Recovery, </em>the plaintiffs claims were significantly related to the consulting agreement with its broadly worded arbitration clause. As previously noted, ARC relied upon the terms of the consulting agreement to prove its claims. Here, in contrast, the Griggses\u2019 claims do not rely at all on the terms of the Mortgage Agreement, the contract which includes the broadly worded arbitration rider. Rather, their claims\u2014breach of the insurance policy and insurance fraud\u2014are based solely on the terms of the optional credit life insurance contract and the circumstances surrounding the formation of that contract. We therefore reject appellees\u2019 contention that, merely because \u201ca life insurance policy like the one at issue here is not even available standing alone, <em>but can only be obtained as part of a mortgage transaction,\u201d </em>the \u201csignificant relationship test\u201d is satisfied. <em>American Recovery </em>is neither controlling nor even applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Furthermore, claims arising under a contract, which is transactionally related to another contract containing a broadly worded arbitration clause, are not necessarily \u201csignificantly related\u201d to the contract containing that arbitration clause, and application of the \u201csignificant relationship test\u201d does not always require arbitration of such claims. A Fourth Circuit decision rendered ten years after <em>American Recovery, </em>in <em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d 762 (4th Cir. 2006), illustrates precisely this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Schmidt, the owner of a successful business, wished to sell his business while minimizing taxes that would be due on the \u201cvery substantial capital gain\u201d resulting from that sale. <em>Id. </em>at 765. To achieve this end, investment advisors from Wachovia recommended that he make highly leveraged investments in the stock of United Bank of Switzerland (\u201cUBS\u201d). That strategy would, according to the Wachovia advisors, enable Schmidt to enjoy a \u201cbasis shift,\u201d thereby shielding his capital gains from federal taxation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">To implement this investment plan, Schmidt borrowed $3.5 million from Wachovia, executing a note and security agreement in favor of Wachovia. The note contained a broadly worded arbitration clause. Then, to accomplish the plan\u2019s objective, Schmidt used the proceeds from the loan to purchase a warrant in the stock of a Cayman Islands company, which held a leveraged position in UBS stock. The warrant also contained a broadly worded arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3. Thereafter, Schmidt paid off the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">But, after Schmidt purchased the warrant and paid off the note, the Internal Revenue Service issued a public notice, advising that \u201cbasis shifting\u201d tax shelters, such as that which Wachovia advisors had persuaded him to implement, \u201ccould be subject to disallowance for tax purposes, interest on unpaid taxes, and potentially penalties as well.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 766. As a result, Schmidt ended up facing more than three million dollars in back taxes as well as additional interest and penalties. That unexpected result led Schmidt to file suit in state court against Wachovia, alleging civil conspiracy, fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, unfair trade practices, and breach of fiduciary duties. Wachovia responded by turning to federal district court and filing there a petition for an order compelling arbitration. When the federal district court denied the petition, Wachovia appealed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The Fourth Circuit affirmed, rejecting, among other things, Wachovia\u2019s contention that Schmidt\u2019s claims were \u201csignificantly related\u201d to the note. After pointing out that \u201cWachovia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Schmidt had two distinct relationships,\u201d that is, Wachovia served both as Schmidt\u2019s financial adviser and as his lender, the Fourth Circuit found that, because Schmidt\u2019s claims \u201cderive[d] solely from actions Wachovia took as a financial advisor to induce Schmidt to participate in\u201d the investment strategy, they were not \u201csignificantly related\u201d to the note and its broadly worded arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In the instant case, as in <em>Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 768, appellees Evans, Dailey, Kurlander, and Integrated Real Estate \u201chad two distinct relationships\u201d with the Griggses: specifically, they served as agents of Beneficial Mortgage in closing the mortgage loan, and they acted as agents of Household Life in selling the optional credit life insurance policy to the Griggses. Appellee Household Life, itself, was not even involved in closing the Griggses\u2019 mortgage loan. In fact, Household Life\u2019s only relationship with the Griggses was in providing them with credit life insurance. Moreover, as in <em>Schmidt, </em>the Griggses\u2019 claims \u201cderive solely from actions\u201d taken by Evans, Dailey, Kurlander, and Integrated Real Estate, acting as Household\u2019s agents, to induce the Griggses to purchase credit life insurance and were not \u201csignificantly related\u201d to the Mortgage Agreement and its broadly worded arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Finally, if signatories to an agreement containing an arbitration provision cannot, as in <em>Schmidt, </em>enforce that provision because of the absence of a \u201csignificant relationship\u201d between the claims and the contract containing the arbitration provision, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>non-signatories to such an agreement, as appellees were, cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Equitable Estoppel and Agency</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Nor do we find appellees\u2019 invocation of equitable estoppel and agency, as alternative bases for granting their arbitration request, convincing. The doctrine of equitable estoppel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> permits non-signatories to enforce an arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>provision, first, when a signatory \u201cmust rely on the terms of the written agreement [containing the arbitration clause] in asserting [its] claims,\u201d <em>Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., </em>10 F.3d 753, 757 (11th Cir.1993), and \u201cseeks to claim the benefit of\u201d such an agreement \u201cwhile simultaneously attempting to avoid the terms of an arbitration provision contained therein,\u201d <em>Long, supra, </em>248 F.3d at 320 (citation and quotation omitted); or, second, \u201cwhen the signatory to the contract containing [an] arbitration clause raises allegations of substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the non[-] signatory and one or more of the signatories to the contract,\u201d <em>Westmoreland v. Sadoux, </em>299 F.3d 462, 467 (5th Cir.2002), or, more succinctly put, \u201cwhen the issues the non[-]signatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed.\u201d <em>Thomson-CSF, S.A. v. Am. Arbitration Ass\u2019n, </em>64 F.3d 773, 779 (2d Cir.1995). The doctrine of equitable estoppel is rooted in the equitable principle that it would be unfair \u201cfor a party to \u2018rely on [a] contract when it works to its advantage, and repudiate it when it works to its disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 769 (quoting <em>Hughes Masonry Co. v. Greater Clark County Sch. Bldg. Corp., </em>659 F.2d 836, 839 (7th Cir. 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s application of equitable estoppel to an arbitration dispute, we apply this standard: \u201c[I]f the determination on equitable estoppel is based on the resolution of disputed facts, the decision is reviewed for sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>stantial evidence, but if there is no dispute of facts, but only a dispute on the legal effect of those facts, de novo review is appropriate.\u201d <em>Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Services, LLC v. Schuele, </em>183 Md.App. 44, 54, 959 A.2d 833 (2008) <em>(Case Handyman I), vacated on other grounds, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010) <em>(Case Handyman II). </em>Since there is no dispute of facts before us, but \u201conly a dispute [as to] the legal effect of those facts,\u201d we apply, in the analysis that follows, a de novo standard. <em>Accord Thompson v. Witherspoon, </em>197 Md.App. 69, 79-80, 12 A.3d 685 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We turn now to four cases that frame the issue before us. Two of those <em>cases\u2014Case Handyman I </em>and <em>MS Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin, </em>177 F.3d 942 (11th Cir.1999)\u2014 present circumstances where courts have required signatories to an arbitration agreement to arbitrate their disputes with non-signatories under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. And, as we shall explain, those cases present a factual profile that does not match that of the instant case. The other two <em>cases\u2014Brantley v. Republic Mortgage Insurance Co., </em>424 F.3d 392 (4th Cir.2005), and <em>Schmidt </em>(which we discussed earlier but in a different context)\u2014where courts have held that non-signatories could not compel arbitration under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, present, on the other hand, a factual profile that largely matches the contours of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As noted above, the first instance in which non-signatories may enforce an arbitration clause is when a signatory \u201cmust rely on the terms of the written agreement [containing the arbitration clause] in asserting [its] claims,\u201d <em>Sunkist, supra, </em>10 F.3d at 757, and \u201cseeks to claim the benefit of\u2019 such an agreement \u201cwhile simultaneously attempting to avoid the terms of an arbitration provision contained therein.\u201d <em>Long, supra, </em>248 F.3d at 320 (citation and quotation omitted). Relying on that principle, we held, in <em>Case Handyman I, </em>that homeowners suing a construction company for failure to perform certain work for them were estopped from denying that their claims were arbitrable, despite the fact that the construction company was a non-signatory to the arbitration agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ment that had been entered into by the homeowners with a franchisee of the construction company. 183 Md.App. at 48-50, 959 A.2d 833. The homeowners\u2019 entire case, we noted, \u201c \u2018hinge[dj on [their] asserted rights under the ... contract,\u2019 \u201d and, consequently, they were estopped, we concluded, from refusing to arbitrate their dispute with the construction company. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 959 A.2d 833 (quoting <em>Int'l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen &amp; Anlagen GMBH, </em>206 F.3d 411, 418 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The second instance in which a non-signatory may enforce an arbitration clause is \u201cwhen the signatory to the contract containing [an] arbitration clause raises allegations of substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the non[-]signatory and one or more of the signatories to the contract,\u201d <em>Westmoreland v. Sadoux, </em>299 F.3d 462, 467 (5th Cir.2002). Illustrative of this application of equitable estoppel is <em>MS Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin, supra, </em>177 F.3d 942. Franklin bought a car from Jim Burke Motors. The car sales contract (\u201cBuyers Order\u201d) incorporated by reference a \u201cRetail Installment Contract,\u201d which obligated Franklin to purchase a service contract through MS Dealer for an additional $990.00. The Buyers Order contained a broadly worded arbitration clause, requiring the arbitration of \u201call disputes and controversies of every kind and nature between Buyer and Jim Burke Motors, Inc. arising out of or in connection with the purchase of this vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">When Franklin found that the car she had purchased had several defects, she filed suit in state court against Jim Burke Motors, MS Dealer, and Chrysler Credit Corporation, the assignee of the Retail Installment Contract, alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraud, and conspiracy. In response, MS Dealer filed a petition in federal district court to compel arbitration of Franklin\u2019s claims. The district court denied the petition on the ground that MS Dealer was a non-signatory to the Buyers Order and, thus, lacked standing to compel arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that \u201c[b]oth of the circumstances giving rise to equitable estoppel exist[ed]\u201d there. <em>Id. </em>at 947. But, for our purposes, we shall focus only on the second of those circumstances\u2014the interdependence between Franklin\u2019s claims against the signatory, Jim Burke Motors, and the non-signatory, MS Dealer. The Eleventh Circuit found that all of Franklin\u2019s claims were based on the same facts and were inherently inseparable. As the federal appellate court observed, Franklin alleged that MS Dealer, Jim Burke Motors, and Chrysler Credit Corporation conspired to defraud her by charging her excessive amounts for the sendee contract, thereby \u201cinducing her to incur needless debt and corresponding interest expenses in connection with her purchase of the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. Although, of the three alleged conspirators, only Jim Burke Motors was a signatory, \u201cFranklin\u2019s obligation to pay the $990.00 charge arose under the Buyers Order,\u201d the contract containing the arbitration clause, and Franklin \u201cspecifically allege[d] that MS Dealer worked hand-in-hand with Jim Burke and Chrysler Credit Corporation in this alleged fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, her \u201c \u2018allegations of such pre-arranged, collusive behavior\u2019 \u201d established, according to the federal appellate court, that her claims against MS Dealer were \u201c \u2018intimately founded in and intertwined with the obligations imposed by the [Buyers Order]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc., </em>981 F.Supp. 1423, 1433 (M.D.Ala.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">But, while <em>Case Handyman I </em>and <em>MS Dealer </em>present circumstances where non-signatories to an agreement containing an arbitration clause have successfully invoked to that clause under equitable estoppel, <em>Brantley v. Republic Mortgage Insurance Co., supra, </em>424 F.3d 392, offer circumstances under which non-signatories\u2019 invocation of an arbitration clause has failed. The Brantleys bought a home with the help of a mortgage obtained from SouthStar Funding, L.L.C. As part of the mortgage lending transaction, the Brantleys also entered into a separate, broadly worded arbitration agreement with SouthStar Funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Because they financed the entire purchase price of the home, SouthStar Funding required them, as a condition of the loan, to purchase mortgage insurance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Brantleys purchased that insurance from Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (\u201cRepublic\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Republic Mortgage purportedly charged them higher insurance premiums based on information in their consumer credit reports but did not notify them of that fact, a possible violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681-1681t. Consequently, they filed suit against Republic, alleging willful and negligent violations of that federal act. In response, Republic Mortgage, a non-signatory to the SouthStar mortgage lending agreement, containing the arbitration clause, moved to compel arbitration under that clause. <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 394-95. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Notwithstanding Republic\u2019s contention that its insurance contract was so intertwined with the lending contract that it should be entitled to enforce the latter\u2019s arbitration provision, the Fourth Circuit found that Republic could not satisfy either of the potential non-signatory applications of equitable estoppel and affirmed. Pointing out, first, that the Brantleys\u2019 claims invoked \u201ca statutory remedy under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and [were] wholly separate from any action or remedy for breach of the underlying mortgage contract that is governed by the arbitration agreement,\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 396, and, second, that \u201c[a]lthough the mortgage insurance relate[d] to the mortgage debt, the premiums of the mortgage insurance [were] separate and wholly independent from the mortgage agreement,\u201d the Fourth Circuit held that the district court was correct in concluding that \u201cthe mere existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of a loan transaction requiring plaintiffs to obtain mortgage insurance cannot be the basis for finding their federal statutory claims, which [were] wholly unrelated to the underlying mortgage agreement, to be intertwined with that contract.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Moreover, the Brantleys\u2019 claims did not, said the Fourth Circuit, \u201craise allegations of collusion or misconduct by SouthStar,\u201d but rather, were \u201cbased entirely on actions taken by Republic Mortgage, a non[-]signatory to the arbitration agreement,\u201d and, thus, equitable estoppel could not be justified on the ground that the claims alleged \u201c \u2018substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the non-signatory and one or more of the signatories to the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>MS Dealer, supra, </em>177 F.3d at 947) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt, supra, </em>445 F.3d 762, a case we discussed previously for its analysis of the \u201csignificant relationship test,\u201d also illustrates when a non-signatory cannot invoke an arbitration clause under equitable estoppel. That case, as we previously observed, involved a dispute between an investor, Schmidt, and his lender and financial advisor, Wachovia, arising from a failed investment in a \u201cbasis shifting\u201d tax shelter which was subsequently invalidated by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">To implement the investment plan, Schmidt purchased a warrant in the stock of a Cayman Islands company which held a leveraged position in UBS stock. That warrant contained a broadly worded arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66 &amp; n. 3. Wachovia was not a signatory to the warrant, though it provided financing and financial advice to Schmidt as part of the plan, and the loan documents contained a separate arbitration clause signed by both Schmidt and Wachovia.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">As we previously noted, when Schmidt sued Wachovia for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practices, and related charges, Wachovia moved to compel arbitration, on the ground that the loan was significantly related to Schmidt\u2019s claims, an argument, which, as we previously noted, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>rejected by the Fourth Circuit on the ground that Schmidt was equitably estopped from denying the applicability of the arbitration clause in the warrant because he had received valuable benefits from that instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In rejecting the latter argument as well, the Fourth Circuit observed that Schmidt, had not \u201cinvoke[d] any rights under the terms of the [wjarrant,\u201d nor had he sought \u201cto impose any of [its] obligations on Wachovia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770. As for Wachovia\u2019s contention that Schmidt received benefits from the warrant, the federal appellate court observed that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d that Schmidt received the benefits Wachovia had promised and that, in any event, Schmidt, as a signatory, did not \u201cenjoy the pure windfall experienced by a non[-]signatory who receives only a contract\u2019s benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the \u201cfact that a signatory receives benefits from a contract is ... insufficient, in and of itself, to estop it from asserting that a non[-]signatory is not entitled to invoke the contract\u2019s arbitration clause\u201d and that Wachovia had \u201cfailed to establish any other inequitable conduct on [Schmidt\u2019s] part that justifie[d] an estoppel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The foregoing cases lead inexorably to the conclusion that appellees\u2019 invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel to compel the Griggses to arbitrate their dispute is unfounded. As in <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 396, and as in <em>Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 770, none of the allegations in the instant case against any of the appellees implicates a breach of a duty arising from the agreement which contains the arbitration rider. And, as in <em>Brantley, </em>it is undisputed that there has been no breach of the Mortgage Agreement by anyone. Moreover, as in <em>Brantley </em>and <em>Schmidt, </em>the Griggses\u2019 claims do not rely on their own rights or obligations under the Mortgage Agreement. Instead, all of the counts of the Griggses\u2019 final complaint are based on either the Griggses\u2019 rights under the credit life insurance policy or on alleged torts committed in procuring their agreement to purchase the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In contrast, in <em>Case Handyman I, the </em>homeowners\u2019 entire case depended on their asserted rights under the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>containing the arbitration clause; and, in <em>MS Dealer, </em>the car buyer\u2019s claims were \u201cintimately founded in and intertwined with the obligations imposed by\u201d the contract containing the arbitration clause. 177 F.3d at 948. Moreover, in <em>MS Dealer, </em>the arbitration clause at issue was incorporated by reference into the service contract that the car buyer contended she was fraudulently induced to sign, quite unlike here, where the credit life insurance policy disavowed incorporation by reference in its integration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thus, the Griggses\u2019 claims have, at most, an incidental relationship to the Mortgage Agreement, as the policy would not have been obtained in the absence of the Mortgage Agreement. Such an attenuated relationship is hardly sufficient to estop the Griggses from denying the applicability of the arbitration rider. <em>See Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 770-71; <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Furthermore, the Griggses\u2019 complaint does not allege any wrongdoing by Beneficial Mortgage, the signatory to the arbitration rider and Mortgage Agreement. Every claim concerns the allegedly fraudulent procurement of the Griggses\u2019 signatures on the contract for credit life insurance or the alleged breach of that contract by Household Life. Thus, as in <em>Brantley, </em>the claims in the instant case are \u201cwholly separate from any action or remedy for breach of the underlying mortgage contract that is governed by the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 396. And, as in <em>Schmidt, </em>those claims do not \u201cinvoke any rights under the terms\u201d of the Mortgage Agreement, nor do they \u201cseek to impose any of [its] obligations on\u201d any of the non-signatories. <em>Schmidt, </em>445 F.3d at 770. Furthermore, although the credit life insurance \u201crelates to the mortgage debt,\u201d the alleged breach of the policy is \u201cseparate and wholly independent from the mortgage agreement.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>424 F.3d at 396. The Mortgage Agreement and its arbitration rider are simply irrelevant to the claims in the Griggses\u2019 second amended and final complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Moreover, in <em>Brantley, </em>the Fourth Circuit held that \u201cthe mere existence of a loan transaction requiring plaintiffs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>obtain mortgage insurance cannot be the basis for finding their federal statutory claims, which are wholly unrelated to the underlying mortgage agreement, to be intertwined with that contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the Griggses were permitted, but not required, to obtain credit life insurance, the mere existence of the Mortgage Agreement does not provide the basis for a finding that the Griggses\u2019 claims, which are wholly unrelated to the underlying Mortgage Agreement, are intertwined with that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Appellees next contend that they are also entitled to enforce the arbitration rider under an agency theory\u2014that is, not as agents of Household Life, but as agents of Beneficial Mortgage, a signatory. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In <em>Westmoreland, supra, </em>299 F.3d 462, 466, the Fifth Circuit declared that \u201ca non[-]signatory cannot compel arbitration merely because he is an agent of one of the signatories.\u201d We agree, and, if the agent seeks to compel arbitration, he is, as the Fifth Circuit observed, \u201csubject to the same equitable estoppel framework left to other non[-]signatories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Although, admittedly, some courts have held that an agent of a signatory may enforce an arbitration agreement. <em>See, e.g., Thomson-CSF, supra, </em>64 F.3d at 776; <em>Davidson v. Becker, </em>256 F.Supp.2d 377, 383-84 (D.Md.2003), we decline to so hold, here, for two reasons: First, the principal, Beneficial Mortgage, is not a party;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and second, the alleged actions of appellees Evans, Dailey, Kurlander, and Integrated were either on their own behalf, or to further the interests of a non-signatory, Household Life, rather than those of the signatory, Beneficial Mortgage. The scope of the claims does not, we observe, encompass the specific terms of the Mortgage Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ment, and Mrs. Griggs does not seek to enforce any rights under that separate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Indeed, where courts have permitted a non-signatory agent to enforce an arbitration agreement executed by his principal, the claims must relate to the agent\u2019s actions on behalf of the principal to trigger the arbitration agreement. <em>See, e.g., Letizia v. Prudential Bache Secs., Inc., </em>802 F.2d 1185, 1186-87 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that brokerage employees accused of churning customer\u2019s account could enforce arbitration agreement between customer and principal); <em>Kruse v. AFLAC Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>458 F.Supp.2d 375, 382-84 (E.D.Ky.2006) (holding that agent may enforce arbitration agreement executed by principal when agent was sued for actions taken in capacity as employee or agent); <em>Rowe v. Exline, </em>153 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284-85, 63 Cal.Rptr.3d 787 (2007) (holding that non-signatory sued either as the agent or alter ego of a signatory may enforce arbitration agreement executed by signatory corporation). <em>See also InterGen N.V. v. Grina, </em>344 F.3d 134, 147-48 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that agent may commit its non-signatory principal to an arbitration agreement, but only if the principal-agent relationship is relevant to the legal obligation in dispute); <em>Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, </em>4 F.3d 742, 748 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that agent may not enforce arbitration agreement executed by his principal because acts alleged were \u201csubsequent, independent acts of fraud, unrelated to any provision or interpretation of the contract\u201d and thus \u201cdo not impose any contractual liability, vicariously or otherwise, upon\u201d agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In sum, the claims do not relate to any of the appellees\u2019 actions on behalf of Beneficial Mortgage, but only to their actions on behalf of Household Life and Integrated Real Estate, and it is simply irrelevant that Evans and Dailey happened to be actual or apparent agents of Beneficial. Therefore, appellees, all of whom are non-signatories, may not enforce the arbitration rider as agents of Beneficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY COMPELLING ARBITRATION AND STAYING <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>PROCEEDINGS VACATED.

Mortgage insurance should not be confused with mortgage life insurance, the type of credit life insurance which is at issue in the instant case. \"Mortgage insurance obligates the insurer to underwrite the risk of default associated with the loan of the borrower,\u201d <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>Republic Mortgage Ins. Co., </em>424 F.3d 392, 394 n. 1 (4th Cir.2005), while mortgage life insurance obligates the insurer to underwrite the risk that a mortgagor might die prior to full payment of the note. Mortgage insurance is typically required by the lender when the loan-to-value (\"LTV\u201d) exceeds a certain level, usually 80 per cent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. Although appellees cast this as a strategy of artful pleading meant to evade enforcement of the arbitration rider, we disagree. The Griggses\u2019 claims are similar to those in <em>Brantley, supra, </em>424 F.3d 392, a case in which the Fourth Circuit held that claims regarding a mortgage insurance contract did not fall under the arbitration agreement contained, as here, in a separate mortgage lending agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
