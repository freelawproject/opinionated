Code Ann., Crim. Law Art. (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 2-201 (first-degree murder); C.L. \u00a7 2-205 (attempted first-degree murder); C.L. \u00a7 3-202 (first-degree assault); C.L. \u00a7 3-403 (attempted rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>bery with a dangerous weapon); C.L. \u00a7 4-204 (use of a handgun in the commission of a crime); C.L. \u00a7 4-203(wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun). On September 28, 2009, the circuit court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for first-degree murder, two life sentences consecutive for attempted first-degree murder, and twenty years\u2019 imprisonment concurrent for use of a handgun in a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant noted an appeal raising three issues, which we rephrased and reordered into four:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that appellant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights before speaking to law enforcement officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">II. WThether the circuit court erred in allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine appellant about prior statements to other people, which appellant characterizes as \u201cinadmissible testimonial hearsay\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">III. Whether the circuit court deprived appellant of the right to a fair trial by: (A) permitting incorrect testimony which was later corrected by a stipulation; and (B) allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine appellant regarding the invocation of the right to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">IV. Wdiether the circuit court erred in allowing the prosecutor to make alleged improper remarks during closing and rebuttal argument?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>We answer all four questions in the negative and, therefore, affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">On September 17, 2007, appellant was indicted in connection with a robbery and shooting that occurred at Robinson Place in Waldorf, Maryland, that resulted in the death of Briona Porter, a thirteen-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Reading of Appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress statements he made to Detective John Elliott at the Charles County Police Headquarters Building on July 6, 2007. On April 18, 2008, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion. As a witness for the State, Detective Elliott testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">Before I asked [appellant] any questions I read him his Miranda Rights and a right for his Prompt Presentation before a District Court Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">I read word for word from my Rights card and I stated to [appellant], \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in court. You have the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions and to have a lawyer with you during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you. If you want to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you will still have the right to stop answering questions at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The State questioned Detective Elliott, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Now, after you advised him of these rights, what, if anything did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] I asked him if he understood his right [sic] and he said, \u201cyes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Let me ask you this. Are you familiar with individuals under the influence of alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] All right. Did you have, did [appellant] appear to be under the influence of any alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] No sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">[PROSECUTOR:] Or any drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did he appear to understand you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Can you continue with what happened after you advised [appellant] of his Miranda Rights and Right to Prompt Presentment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] I asked [appellant] where he had been up to the week leading to where he was arrested. [Appellant] explained to me that he had seen his picture on the news Monday or Tuesday, the previous Monday or Tuesday, and that he was wanted for murder, and that he was visiting family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. And what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] I questioned [appellant] specifically about the murder and the incident which occurred on Robinson Place. [Appellant] said that he was there on the scene when it occurred. First he said he was by himself, but then he said, no, he was with a person who he identified as Man and Deonte [sic]. And he explained to me that he was on Robinson Place in the area of what they call \u201cthe cut\u201d. And while in \u201cthe cut\u201d he observed an ice cream truck drive into Robinson Place, he heard a gunshot, everybody ran and he went to, who he identified as, Little Ray\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. What else occurred during this interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] I specifically asked [appellant] if he was responsible for this. He denied doing the shooting. And he was unable to provide or identify anyone that was responsible for the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Anything else that you can recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] At one point during the interview I asked [appellant] to show me the palms of his hands. I asked him what he saw. [Appellant] told me, \u201cfingerprints.\u201d I explained to him, while showing him a picture of a metal cashbox, which was just inside the ice cream truck, the night the incident occurred. I asked him, \u201cDo you realize the significance of your fingerprints on this cash metal box?\u201d He replied to me that it didn\u2019t look like a metal box to him. As soon as the questioning stopped he didn\u2019t provide an explanation and I didn\u2019t question him any further about that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Did there come a time when he indicated that he didn\u2019t want to answer any more questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALq\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">[PROSECUTOR:] What, if any offers of reward did you make to [appellant?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOTT:] I did not make any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">[PROSECUTOR:] What, if any threats did you make to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOT:] I did not make any threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZq\">[PROSECUTOR:] What, if any inducements did you make to him in order to get him to talk to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">[DETECTIVE ELLIOT:] None at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Detective Elliott testified that \u201c[a]t about quarter to [one] in the morning [appellant] told me he didn\u2019t want to answer any more questions without a lawyer and I stopped questioning him.\u201d The circuit court ruled orally from the bench, granting the motion, in part, and denying it, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">[I] do find Det. Elliott\u2019s testimony to be credible. That he did in fact read [appellant] his Miranda Rights. He read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>from the card. He read both sides of the card; the Miranda Rights and also the Prompt Presentment Rights. That Det. Elliott stated that he asked the defendant if he understood his rights and he responded, \u201cyes.\u201d Det. Elliott also described how [appellant] did not appear to under [sic] the influence of drugs or alcohol, he appeared to understand his questions when being asked and [appellant] proceeded to give some statements. I find that those statements were voluntary and that the State has met its burden on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">I do find, however that when [appellant] stated, T don\u2019t want to talk any more,\u2019 or something to the effect, T\u2019m done talking,\u2019 at that point that was his invocation of his right to remain silent and any statements made thereafter, I believe would have required probably a re-Mirandaization or some safeguard. But at this point I find that that was a full invocation of his right to remain silent and anything elicited after this is suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">At trial, as a witness for the State, Charlene Woodland testified that she owned and operated an ice cream truck as a business to help raise money to send her daughter to college. Woodland testified that, as of June 29, 2007, she had not yet operated the truck for ice cream sales during 2007. According to Woodland, that night, after getting the truck\u2019s generator fixed, she took the ice cream truck for a \u201ctest drive\u201d and ended up at Robinson Place. Woodland\u2019s thirteen-year-old daughter, Briona, and Woodland\u2019s friend, Tanya Butler, accompanied her in the rear of the truck. Woodland testified that she stopped her ice cream truck at the end of Robinson Place to adjust her side mirrors. According to Woodland, she went in the back of the truck and saw a man, whom she identified at trial as appellant, with a gun in the window. Woodland testified that Butler said they were being robbed and told her to get the money box. Woodland retrieved the money box, shoved it at appellant, ran back to the driver\u2019s seat, and started driving away. Woodland testified that she h\u00e9ard gunshots, and that Briona screamed \u201cmommy, he hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>me.\u201d Woodland continued driving until she saw a law enforcement officer, who came to her assistance. Briona was taken from the scene by medical personnel and Woodland testified that this was the last time she saw Briona alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">During appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Woodland, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, Ms. Woodland, isn\u2019t it true that you never told anyone that you could recognize the man who shot your daughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">[WOODLAND]: It\u2019s not true. I told the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You\u2019re saying you told one of the State\u2019s Attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">[WOODLAND]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You actually ... you didn\u2019t tell the State\u2019s Attorney until after the first trial had already started?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">[WOODLAND]: No. Before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can we approach, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">During a bench conference, the prosecutor stated that appellant\u2019s counsel \u201chas confused [Woodland] as to the date.\u201d The circuit court stated that: \u201cWe all know that she is confused. She is confused with dates.\u201d The cross-examination resumed, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Ms. Woodland, you\u2019re telling us that you told [the prosecutor] that you could recognize the person who shot your daughter, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[WOODLAND]: I told him yes I could tell him who it was. The same person who I saw June 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So, the time you first said that you thought you could recognize the person who shot your daughter was some time when you were in this courthouse, but you were not inside this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO-\">[WOODLAND]: That was not the first time. The first time I could identify him was the night he had the gun in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>face. That\u2019s when I could identify him. I will never forget that face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Later in the trial, after Woodland\u2019s testimony, the circuit court read the following stipulation to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">The State and the Defense have agreed that on May 13th, 2008, the day after the jury trial started in the first trial of this matter, Charlene Woodland, while located in the State\u2019s Attorney in this courthouse [sic] for the first time said that she would be able to identify the individual responsible for the alleged robbery and shooting involving her ice cream truck on June 29th, 2007. These facts are not in dispute and should be considered proven.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Tanya Butler testified, as a witness for the State, that on the night of June 29, 2007, she accompanied Woodland and Briona in the truck to obtain gas for the generator. She and Briona were riding in the back of the ice cream truck that Woodland was driving. According to Butler, the gas station was closed and Woodland said she would show them a place \u201cwhere there\u2019s a lot of kids where [she goes] to all the time.\u201d Woodland pulled into a \u201ccommunity\u201d and stopped to fix the mirrors on the truck. After the truck was parked, a man, whom Butler identified at trial as appellant, came up to the truck, bought a bag of potato chips, walked away and came right back, pulled out a gun, and demanded money. According to Butler, as she responded to the man, Woodland approached the rear of the truck. Butler told Woodland the man was robbing, them. Butler corroborated Woodland\u2019s testimony that she gave the man the money box, and the man shot at the truck as they drove away. Butler testified that Briona was shot in the back. Like Woodland, Butler testified that Briona said \u201cmommy, he shot me, mommy.\u201d Butler testified that Briona was \u201clike [her] niece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">As a witness for the State, Roy James Irby testified that while he and appellant were in the same unit at the county jail, appellant discussed the case with him. According to Irby, appellant told him that he had been out \u201cpartying, drinking and drugging\u201d with Deante Duckett, and he (appellant) shot at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>an ice cream truck. Irby testified that appellant told him that \u201cI guess you heard, I\u2019ve got a body. And, I [Irby] said a body? You mean a child ... a thirteen year old child. I said, why did you do it? And, he goes, because I can.\u201d Irby testified that appellant stated \u201cand the ice cream truck came along. It pulled up. And, now he [appellant] was harassing them ... was harassing the people in the truck ... the women in the ice cream truck. And, apparently she didn\u2019t like what was going on. And, he said she said something and took off. Well, he the[n] demonstrated pulling out a gun and going, boom, boom, boom. And, the of course running.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As a witness for the State, Deante Duckett testified that, on June 29, 2007, he was near Robinson Place drinking alcohol with appellant, who was wearing a black and red Chicago Bulls baseball cap. According to Duckett, appellant went to an ice cream truck, bought a bag of potato chips, and went back to the truck. Duckett testified that he saw appellant sticking a gun into the truck and asking for money. Duckett testified he saw the truck accelerate and then heard gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Kevin Wise, appellant\u2019s father, testified as a witness for the State, that on July 1, 2007, he saw his son in Washington D.C. Appellant advised Wise that he was being accused of killing a child and was going to go to Charles County to turn himself in.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In his own defense, appellant testified that on June 29, 2007, he went to Robinson place to sell drugs. Appellant testified that he had been wearing a black and red Chicago Bulls hat. According to appellant, five other people, including Duckett, were present and were drinking with him. Appellant testified that he saw a truck coming up Robinson Place and thought that it was law enforcement. Appellant testified that he went to Oakley Drive and then heard gunshots coming from Robinson Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">State\u2019s Cross-Examination of Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">During the State\u2019s cross-examination of appellant, the following colloquies occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: You don\u2019t remember having a conversation with Man, William Smothers, over in the jail about this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Remember telling him how you stuck the gun up in there and started shooting in the ice cream truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Don\u2019t remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">[APPELLANT]: I never told him nothing like that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. That\u2019s what you say today, but that\u2019s not what you told Detective Elliott, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9O\">[APPELLANT]: That\u2019s what I told him back then when he ... when he questioned me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: That you were on Oakley when the shots were fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: You didn\u2019t tell him you were on Robinson Place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-15\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now, you told Detective Elliott you didn\u2019t know you were wanted until Monday or Tuesday, which would have been ... let\u2019s see, the 29th was a Friday, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-17\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And, the 30th was Saturday. And, July 1st, that\u2019s when you went down to your father\u2019s house, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-19\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-20\">[PROSECUTOR]: Said you didn\u2019t know you were wanted until Monday or Tuesday, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-21\">[APPELLANT]: No, I told him Sunday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Told him you knew you were wanted Sunday morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. But, now that\u2019s not what your father said earlier, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t know what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7l\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you were sitting right there when he testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Alright. Now, you said you were there by yourself to Detective Elliott first, right? And, then you quickly changed up and said, no, I wasn\u2019t out there by myself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: You didn\u2019t say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">[APPELLANT]: N. [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: And, you said I ... it don\u2019t even look like a metal box to me, right? Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">[APPELLANT]: I said something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHI\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And, it\u2019s at that point when he presses you on the fingerprints and you say I don\u2019t want to answer any more questions, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: So, you didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t want to answer any more questions or I don\u2019t want a lawyer or any of that stuff until he puts this picture in front of your face and tells you the significance of the fingerprints, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaj\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: You don\u2019t know Jonathan Marshall over in the jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-17\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Don\u2019t even ... never talked to him over there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>[APPELLANT]: No, sir. Never heard of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Never heard of him?

Talking about this murder, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: You didn\u2019t say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Didn\u2019t say I had to put that joint up in there? Didn\u2019t say that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: You weren\u2019t doing any bragging over there in the jail about shooting this girl, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARE\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: No. Okay. Not at all, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2K\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: And, you didn\u2019t try to get Frank Leopard to lie on Deante Duckett for you, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: I mean, you know who Frank Leopard is now, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-17\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Do you remember Frank Leopard ... you ... you told him that the person ... you wanted him to come to your trial and testify that the person that tried to rob him was Deante Duckett and he had a silver nickel plated gun, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-19\">[APPELLANT]: Incorrect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-20\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. You never told Frank Leopard that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-21\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.

You certainly would sit up here and tell us, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right? Matter of fact, this is the first time you\u2019ve ever said anything publically to anybody about this meeting you had with Deante Duckett the next day, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: He has a constitutional right to remain silent until his attorney....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Q\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019ll rephrase, Your Honor.

This presumption remains with the defendant throughout every stage of the trial and is not overcome unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">The State has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden remains on the State throughout the trial. The defendant is not required to prove his innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">The following things are not evidence and you should not give them any weight or consideration: ... questions and objections of counsel.... You must disregard questions that I did not permit the witness to answer and you must not speculate as to the possible answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Opening statements and closing arguments of the lawyers are not evidence in this case. They are intended only to help you to understand the evidence and to apply the law. Therefore, if your memory of the evidence differs from anything the lawyers or I may say, you must rely on your own memory of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Closing Arguments</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated: You also heard from Charlene Woodland. And, what does she say, ladies and gentlemen, when she comes back she sees [appellant] pointing a gun in her face. And, she told you that she will never forget that face of the man who is pointing a gun at her. And, ladies and gentlemen, that makes sense. She is not going to forget the face of the man who killed her only child. She saw him under the same lights that Tanya Butler saw him. You can judge their credibility, but they were not mistaken, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Appellant did not object during the State\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">During appellant\u2019s closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the State had not proven the occurrence of a robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Ladies and gentlemen, I don\u2019t think you should be convinced that a robbery occurred as they said it occurred. Now remember, the Judge instructed you that the defense is presumed innocent and we don\u2019t have to prove anything. You don\u2019t have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Deante Duckett did it ... to find [appellant] not guilty. And, you don\u2019t have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that these two women\u2019s [Woodland\u2019s and Butler\u2019s] stories are not the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth in order to find [appellant] not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">Now, that doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t robbed. I just said to you that I don\u2019t ... I can\u2019t believe beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>doubt that they [Woodland and Butler] were robbed, but rather none of us should because they\u2019re not telling the truth, the whole truth. They ... they go over there and they say that they stopped to fix the mirrors. Why aren\u2019t Charlene Woodland\u2019s fingerprints on the mirrors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">And, if you had expert testimony that would help you know the likelihood ... the probabilities then you could put some value to that evidence. They don\u2019t mind coming in here and telling you it\u2019s one in 6.6 million chances that it is [appellant\u2019s DNA on that bottle. But, they can\u2019t tell you the probability of someone shooting a gun at a moving target and hitting the very same hole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">During the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">I sit there and listen to [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s arguments and the first thing that comes up to me is unbelievable that he can actually stand there and say the things that he did like this is no robbery; can\u2019t believe it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">A lot of sound and fury. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that phrase before. Well, that\u2019s actually a quote. It\u2019s from Shakespeare, from Macbeth, and the full quote is: It is a tale ... and I\u2019m quoting now ... it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. That\u2019s what the entire argument told by [appellant\u2019s counsel] was. Didn\u2019t mean a thing. Means nada. Nothing. Not a dag on thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">He stood up here in front of you on several occasions and said that if the forensic evidence ... if this fingerprint doesn\u2019t show this, this fingerprint doesn\u2019t show that you have to find [appellant] not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">It is a red herring, ladies and gentlemen. And, quite frankly, that\u2019s what [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] argument was all full of ... red herrings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>[I]s there anybody in this case who is more desperate to get this right than Tanya Butler and Charlene Woodland? Please tell me you understand the mother of the thirteen year old child ... their only child ... wants to see it done right. Do you think they\u2019re going to be led around by the nose and put it on anybody that the police want to select as [appellant\u2019s counsel] wants you to believe? Do you think they\u2019re going to engage in essentially a conspiracy? Because that\u2019s what he is talking about. Okay? That\u2019s what he has come up with. Not only conspiracy with the witnesses, but with me the State, all the police. Do you think they\u2019re going to willingly, voluntarily walk in here and say that guy did it if he didn\u2019t? Motive to tell the truth. Because if that ain\u2019t the right guy then they\u2019re letting poor Briona lay there without any justice and they\u2019re a party to it. That\u2019s motive to tell the truth, ladies and gentlemen. That\u2019s a lot of motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">And, speaking of hats, where is [appellant\u2019s hat? He doesn\u2019t have any burden whatsoever putting the evidence on whatsoever. But, he got up there and said, hey, I had a black hat on with red, this that and the other. Same scrutiny as every other witness. He wants to be believed. Where is the hat? We don\u2019t have it. Wasn\u2019t out there on the scene. He was on the run for five, six, seven days, whatever it is. Shoot, he could have had him [sic] momma buy a hat like he described and bring in here. We wouldn\u2019t have known the difference. No hat. Could have had a black hat on just like they said ... like Deante [Duckett] said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">[H]ow in the world does Roy Irby [who, as a witness for the State, testified that appellant told Irby in jail that appellant robbed the ice cream truck] know that the gun shots ... the bullets went into the back of this truck? Remember he testified to that? I hope you caught it. I said, where did [appellant] tell you he was standing in location to the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>when he shot it? He said, he was in the back in the rear. How does he know that? That\u2019s not in any police report anywhere. Excuse me. I misspoke. Certainly in a police report. It\u2019s not in any press anywhere. How is anybody going to know ... how is anybody going to know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">And, let me say something else to you because it was kind of interesting. When we were selecting the jury here somebody talked about, you know, when you talk about a child being killed around an ice cream truck I think the immediate vision everybody gets is, you know, five or six kids are hanging around the ... the ice cream truck buying ice cream. Right? And, somebody starts popping off rounds. You know, it could happen any way, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">My point is is [sic] that Roy Irby has the factual scenario correct. And, that struck me, actually, during the selection of this jury because one of the people who is not in the jury said, well, you know, with a whole bunch of kids around the ... around the ice cream truck, you know, why in the heck would somebody start firing? And, it just struck me that, you know, yeah, this could happen any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">But, it doesn\u2019t just happen any way. It happens the way Roy Irby said it happened. It happened the way that Deante Duckett said it happened. But, how does Roy get it right unless [appellant] told him? Unless he told him, and he did tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel is] up here railing against the DNA ... railing against the DNA, and puts his client up on the stand and says, hey, yeah, I was drinking out of a bottle. It\u2019s all a red herring. It signifies nothing. It\u2019s a whole bunch of sound and fury on the DNA and Deante Duckett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">You\u2019ve got an eyewitness to the crime [Deante Duckett] who could not have committed the crime. You have two other witnesses [Woodland and Butler] who say, yeah, that\u2019s the guy ... under oath; here in court, two people ... two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>people who you cannot disbelieve because more than anybody ... more than you they want to get it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Don\u2019t let [appellant\u2019s counsel] obfuscate, confuse, and bring up all these red herrings to distract you from the real truth here ... the truth that this evidence has borne out ... that\u2019s [appellant] killed Briona Porter; tried to kill them. Three eyewitnesses right there at that window at that time. All that other noise, all that sound and fury means nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Appellant did not lodge any objections to the above comments made during the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in admitting statements he made to law enforcement officers concerning his actions on the night of June 29, 2007. Specifically, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that the State met its burden in proving that he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights during a custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In contrast, the State maintains that appellant \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The State contends that the prosecution need only show that \u201cthe suspect understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, engaged in a course of conduct inconsistent with the assertion of those known rights, and was not subjected to any police coercion that overcame his will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">In <em>Moore v. State, </em>422 Md. 516, 528, 30 A.3d 945 (2011), the Court of Appeals discussed the standard of review for <em>Miranda </em>issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, here, the State.

The heavy burden shouldered by the State is only proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The question whether an accused waived <em>Miranda </em>rights is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In <em>Donaldson v.

[I]t would be absurd to think that mere recitation of the litany [of <em>Miranda </em>rights] suffices to satisfy <em>Miranda </em>in every conceivable circumstance. And, in contrast to traditional voluntariness, there is an absolute prohibition upon any trickery which misleads the suspect as to the existence or dimensions of any of the applicable <em>[.Miranda </em>] rights[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (most omissions and alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In <em>Ashford v.

This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">\u201cWhen the issue is voluntariness, rather than <em>Miranda </em>compliance ... the failure of a defendant to testify almost forecloses any chance of prevailing. ... The voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s response to possible pressures ... is very subjective. Only the defendant can truly tell us what was going on in the defendant\u2019s mind. Without such testimony, there is usually no direct evidence of involuntariness.... [Here, the defendant] asks us to guess what was in his head. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>He actually asks us to second-guess [the circuit court] for not having guessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 56, 807 A.2d 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2262, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010), the Supreme Court stated: \u201cWhere the prosecution shows that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain silent.\u201d In <em>Berghuis, </em>the Supreme Court held that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights even though the defendant declined to sign a waiver and there was \u201cconflicting evidence\u201d of whether the defendant \u201cverbally confirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2256. The defendant was \u201c[l]argely silent\u201d during the interrogation before he responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cDo you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2256-57. The Supreme Court noted that: (1) \u201cthere [was] no contention that [the defendant] did not understand his rights; and from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he spoke\u201d; (2) the defendant\u2019s \u201canswer to [the detective]\u2019s question ... is a \u2018course of conduct indicating waiver\u2019 of the right to remain silent\u201d; and (3) \u201cthere [was] no evidence that [the defendant\u2019s statement was coerced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2262-63 (citations omitted); <em>see also North Carolina v.

After Detective Elliott read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked appellant if he understood his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>rights, appellant replied \u201cyes.\u201d Appellant then made uncoerced statements in which he admitted that \u201che was there on the scene\u201d of the shooting; appellant later asserted his right to an attorney. As in <em>Berghuis, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2262-63, here, (1) \u201cthere is no contention that [appellant] did not understand his rights; and from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he spoke\u201d about being at the crime scene; (2) appellant\u2019s answer to Detective Elliott\u2019s questions constitutes \u201cconduct indicating waiver of the right to remain silent\u201d; and (3) Detective Elliott, the law enforcement officer responsible for the interrogation, testified that appellant was not coerced. According to Detective Elliott\u2019s testimony, which the circuit court found credible, appellant did not assert the right to an attorney until after answering questions, at which point Detective Elliott immediately ended the interview. Like the defendant in <em>Ashford, </em>147 Md.App. at 56, 807 A.2d 732, appellant did not testify at the motion hearing, thus \u201caskfing] us to guess what was in his head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Given the testimony as to Detective Elliott\u2019s verbatim <em>Miranda </em>reading and appellant\u2019s response of \u201cyes,\u201d at the motion hearing, the State demonstrated that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given and that it was understood by appellant. As in <em>Berghuis, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2262, appellant\u2019s \u201cuncoerced statement established] an implied waiver of the right to remain silent.\u201d For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the circuit court properly found that appellant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in allowing the State to cross-examine him about statements he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>allegedly made before trial, admitting to the crimes that took place on June 29; 2007. Appellant argues that \u201cthe State used inadmissible hearsay declarations from unavailable witnesses in an attempt to impeach\u201d him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant maintains that the line of questioning by the State contained two levels of hearsay\u2014the first level being appellant\u2019s alleged confession to out-of-court declarants and the second level being the communication by the out-of-court declarants to State investigators to convey the alleged confession. Appellant argues that this error violated his right to cross-examine the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In contrast, the State maintains that the circuit court properly permitted the prosecutor to ask appellant whether he had confessed committing the crime to others. The State argues that \u201c[ajsking a witness, and particularly the accused, to deny his or her own prior statement is a quintessential form of proper impeachment.\u201d The State contends that there was no error as the prosecution impeached appellant with his own prior statements, rather than the statements of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We review hearsay rulings <em>de novo.

State, </em>423 Md. 610, 623-24, 33 A.3d 435 (2011), the Court of Appeals discussed <em>Bell, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVG\">In <em>Bell v. State, </em>114 Md.App. 480, 691 A.2d 233 (1997), the Court of Special Appeals reversed manslaughter and attempted first degree murder convictions on the ground that the trial court should not have allowed the prosecutor to ask the appellant a series of \u201cwould it surprise you that\u201d questions by which the State \u201csucceeded in placing before the jury the written content of\u2019 a statement made to investigators by a person who did not testify at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 691 A.2d at 240. While rejecting the State\u2019s argument that it was entitled to use the out-of-court statement for purposes of impeachment, the <em>Bell </em>Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Statements that are otherwise inadmissible are not salvaged by invoking the mantra of \u201cimpeachment.\u201d If the State could not properly use the statement under the applicable rules of evidence, we fail to see how it could, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>instead, read the statement to the jury, apparently line by line, through the questions it posed to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Unquestionably, a party may attempt to impeach a witness by challenging his or her credibility---- But impeachment must be consistent with the common law and the rules of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 691 A.2d at 241.

Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in overruling his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s questions: \u201cRemember telling [Smothers] how you stuck the gun up in there and started shooting in the ice cream truck?\u201d and \u2018You don\u2019t know Jonathan Marshall over in the jail? ... you never said anything to him about I had to try my hand; you know me; you know how I get it, right? Talking about this murder, right?\u201d By these questions, however, the prosecutor was attempting to elicit a prior inconsistent statement from appellant, using the process set forth in Rule 5-613(a). As it turned out, appellant denied making any such statements to Smothers or Marshall, so the prosecutor did not elicit a prior inconsistent statement from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Maryland Rule 5-616(a)(l) explicitly allows a party to impeach a witness with that witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statements. Appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe State used inadmissible hearsay declarations from unavailable witnesses in an attempt to impeach\u201d him is without merit, as the prosecutor only questioned appellant as to any out-of-court statements he might have made to Smothers or Marshall. Appellant urges that the prosecution not be able to question a defendant about out-of-court statements the defendant allegedly made to a third party, unless the prosecution calls that third party at trial-whether the third party be a law enforcement officer, a witness, or any other person. Appellant contends that the State having gained knowledge of appellant\u2019s statements derivatively, via a third party, renders the statements hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">At oral argument, the State argued, in essence, that Maryland Rule 5-616 contemplates the use of a defendant\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>prior inconsistent statements acquired by the prosecution from third parties to whom a defendant has made statements concerning a crime. We agree. To adopt appellant\u2019s contention would limit the prosecution to impeaching defendants, pursuant to Maryland Rule 5\u2014616(a)(1), only with prior inconsistent statements defendants made to third parties when the third parties are called to testify at trial and the prior inconsistent statements are proven extrinsically, as opposed to intrinsically. This would abrogate the very basis and purpose of Maryland Rules 5-613(a) and 5-616, that is-to permit a party to examine a witness about an oral statement if the content and circumstances under which the statement is made, including the person to whom it was made, are disclosed, to attempt to elicit the statement directly from the witness himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In this case, the State questioned appellant concerning prior statements appellant allegedly made to Smothers and Marshall. Appellant was given an opportunity to admit, deny, or explain the statements. He denied making them. Thereafter, the State was permitted\u2014although not required\u2014to prove the statements through extrinsic evidence as contemplated by Maryland Rules 5-613 and 5-616. Here, the State chose to accept appellant\u2019s response and not call Smothers and Marshall to the stand as witnesses. That was proper and the State\u2019s choice to make. The result of that choice was that no prior inconsistent statement by appellant was proven, either intrinsically (through him) or extrinsically (through Smothers or Marshall). The circuit court did not err by permitting cross-examination of appellant as to his alleged out-of-court statements made to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that <em>Bell </em>is dispositive because the prosecutor in <em>Bell, </em>in the midst of asking a series of \u201cwould it surprise you questions,\u201d asked: \u201cHow about this one that when you get back to the house, Cory Tart\u2019s house, after you have shot Chris and Bryan Maxwell you say \u2018Those b[ ] aren\u2019t going to be calling us b[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>anymore?\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 691 A.2d 233. The argument is unpersuasive as the error found by this Court in <em>Bell </em>concerned the use of the \u201cwould it surprise you\u201d questions. In <em>Bell, </em>we identified the use of Buckler\u2019s out-of-court statements to cross-examine Bell as the impermissible form of questioning, not the question regarding Bell\u2019s out-of-court statement to Tart. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 691 A.2d 233. Nowhere in this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Bell, </em>did we determine that the State is precluded from asking a defendant in a criminal case whether he made out-of-court inculpatory statements that a third party claims he made. It is axiomatic that the State will learn of the defendant\u2019s alleged out-of-court statements from other people. We shall not hold that where the defendant is confronted with his own alleged out-of-court inculpatory statements, which the State learned of from a third party, the State must call the third party as a witness at trial to establish that the out-of-court statements were made. If the defendant denies making the statements, and the third party is not called as a witness, the State is bound by that testimony, in that no prior inconsistent statement is proven through the defendant. If, however, the State wants to pursue calling the third party to testify that the defendant made the statement to him, the State can do so. It is not required to do so, however.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Appellant contends that he was deprived of the right to a fair trial because the circuit court erred in allowing Woodland to testify erroneously that she told the prosecutor before the first trial that she could identify the shooter, before her testimony was corrected by a stipulation. Appellant argues that \u201c[t]he State improperly relied on [Woodland\u2019s] perjured testimony to secure a conviction against the Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In contrast, the State maintains that it \u201cconsistently took the position that Woodland was either confused by [appellant\u2019s] counsel\u2019s cross-examination or simply mis-recollected the precise time.\u201d The State argues that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s closing argument never cited much less relied on Woodland\u2019s claim to have been able [to] identify [appellant] before the first trial, an assertion with which the prosecutor personally disagreed and, for that reason, agreed to the stipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), the Supreme Court explained that \u201cit is established that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.] The same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s allegation that the State relied on perjured testimony to secure the conviction. Rather than ever suggesting that Woodland committed perjury, the circuit court found that Woodland was simply \u201cconfused.\u201d As mandated by <em>Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, the circuit court did not \u201callow[ false testimony] to go uncorrected\u201d; instead, the circuit court corrected any error by reading a stipulation that appellant\u2019s first trial was the first time that Woodland said that she was able to identify appellant. We, therefore, conclude that the State did not use \u201cperjured\u201d testimony and that the circuit court properly corrected the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Appellant contends the State improperly questioned him in a manner that permitted a negative inference to be drawn from his invocation of the right to remain silent. Appellant argues that the prosecutor impermissibly referred to his right to remain silent by asking on cross-examination \u201cis [this] the first time you\u2019ve ever said anything publically to anybody about this meeting you had with Deante Duckett the next day, right?\u201d Appellant argues that the State implied to the jury that he asserted his right to remain silent when asked about facts that would be \u201carguably inculpatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In contrast, the State responds that appellant was confronted during custodial interrogation with this direct accusation long before he invoked the right to remain silent, <em>ie. </em>that the Detective asked appellant what occurred with Duckett well prior to his invocation of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), the Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment ... forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d In <em>Griffin, </em>the Supreme Court reversed where the prosecutor argued in closing that the victim \u201cis dead, she can\u2019t tell you her side of the story. The defendant won\u2019t.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 85 S.Ct. 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In <em>Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 261, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe federal constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination prohibits prosecutorial comment on the accused\u2019s silence or failure to testify.\u201d (Quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>367 Md. 348, 353, 787 A.2d 152 (2001)). The Court held that the prosecutor improperly argued in closing: \u201cThere are several pieces we don\u2019t have. <em>We don\u2019t have [the defendant\u2019s thoughts </em>[.]\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>415 Md. at 256-57, 999 A.2d 1029 (emphasis in original). Similarly, in <em>Smith, </em>367 Md. at 352, 358, 787 A.2d 152, the Court of Appeals held that the prosecutor improperly argued in closing: <em>\u201cWhat explanation </em>has been given to us <em>by the defendant </em>for having the leather goods? Zero, none.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Returning to the instant case, we conclude that the issue is not preserved for appeal. The prosecutor cross-examined appellant about whether he had previously mentioned his meeting with Duckett. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected prior to a response being given to the question and the State rephrased the question to ask whether appellant told Detective Elliott about his meeting with Duckett, and, notably, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object. Appellant responded: \u201cYes, I told him.\u201d As with the hearsay issue discussed above, appellant fails either to acknowledge that appellant\u2019s counsel did not object or to ask this Court to review for plain error. Thus, this is a yet another instance of \u201cnon-preservation squared.\u201d <em>Garner, </em>183 Md.App. at 152, 960 A.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Alternatively, we are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not constitute an impermissible reference to appellant\u2019s right to remain silent. Appellant never answered the original question to which appellant\u2019s counsel lodged an objection. The circuit court properly instructed the jury that questions are not evidence, and that the jury could not speculate about possible answers. The circuit court allowed the prosecutor to rephrase the question and appellant\u2019s counsel offered no further objection. In response to the rephrased question, appellant responded that he had told Detective Elliott about Duckett. Thus, the testimony was not that appellant invoked his right to remain silent. Although the prosecutor asked whether appellant had previously spoken publicly about Duckett\u2019s alleged part in the offense or told Detective Elliott of Duckett\u2019s role, appellant failed to establish that the questions: (1) occurred after his request for an attorney, or (2) that in response to the questions, appellant invoked the right to remain silent. For the reasons stated above, we assign no error to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in allowing the prosecutor to make improper remarks during closing argument and rebuttal closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In contrast, the State maintains that by not objecting at trial appellant failed to preserve these issues for appellate review. The State argues that, even \u201c[i]f reviewed for plain error, the circuit court soundly exercised its discretion to regulate the prosecutors\u2019 closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In <em>McFadden v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 238, 255, 13 A.3d 68 (2011), this Court explained: \u201cThe regulation of argument rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Quoting <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 224, 670 A.2d 398 (1995)). In <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989 (2009), the Court of Appeals explained the latitude that counsel enjoys during closing arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">As to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way----Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the prosecution produces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">(Citation omitted). \u201cFurther, counsel may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.\u201d <em>McFadden, </em>197 Md.App. at 255, 13 A.3d 68 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">A. Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The record reveals that appellant failed to lodge any objection whatsoever during the State\u2019s closing argument and failed to object to the comments at issue in this appeal during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument. As such, any issue as to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks is not preserved for appellate review. Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d); <em>Conner v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 124, 135, 366 A.2d 385 (1976) (\u201cA failure to object [to a prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments] and to request the Court\u2019s correction is a waiver of the contention for appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Alternatively, we conclude the prosecutor\u2019s comments failed to rise to the extreme level of impropriety warranting reversal. In <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 159, 872 A.2d 25 (2005), the Court of Appeals discussed the factors that appellate courts may consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">When assessing whether reversible error occurs when improper statements are made during closing argument, a reviewing court may consider several factors, including the severity of the remarks, the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice, and the weight of the evidence against the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">(Citing <em>United States v. Melendez, </em>57 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir.1995)). In addition to the factors described above, appellate courts may consider whether a prosecutor\u2019s remark during closing arguments \u201cwas an isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial.\u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d 25 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">B. Prosecutors\u2019 Remarks on Witnesses\u2019 Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In <em>Curry v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 250, 255, 258, 458 A.2d 474 (1983), this Court held that, despite the fact that the defendant failed to object, a prosecutor made improper remarks about witnesses\u2019 credibility. The prosecutor argued in closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">[T]he prosecutor represented to the jury that the two youthful witnesses, upon whom he relied to establish the connection between the defendants and the decedent, had no \u201ccriminal\u201d records. That representation was true so far as it went. Malcolm, as we have seen, had a juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>record, while Tracy, although charged with assault, had not, at the time the statement was made been convicted of any crime. Because the prosecutor\u2019s statement about the two youths was verisimilar, it was most certainly, under the circumstances of the instant case, deceiving to the jury. Moreover, characterization of the two witnesses as having lived \u201cexemplary\u201d lives was a gross misstatement of fact designed to evince the trustworthiness of the witnesses and thus bolster the State\u2019s circumstantial case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d 25, the Court of Appeals held that the following remark during the State\u2019s closing argument, made over the defendant\u2019s objection, \u201cwas an isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">The second point I wanted to make to you is that the Officer in this case\u2014the Defense\u2019s argument is that Mr. Spain was outside his house. He was going to attend a Superbowl party and was buying beer. Part of what you have to determine is the credibility of the witnesses. The defense put on a witness who testified, and the State put on one witness, the Officer in this case. You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He would have to perjure himself on the stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 151, 872 A.2d 25. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">Attorneys ... feel compelled frequently to comment on the motives, or absence thereof, that a witness may have for testifying in a particular way, so long as those conclusions may be inferred from the evidence introduced and admitted at trial.... [WJhere a prosecutor argues that a witness is being truthful based on the testimony given at trial, and does not assure the jury that the credibility of the witness based on his own personal knowledge, the prosecutor is engaging in proper argument and is not vouching[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s invitation for the jury to consider whether the officer had a motive to lie did not amount to improper vouching because the comments did not express any personal belief or assurance on the part of the prosecutor as to the credibility of the officer. Nor did such comments, in isolation, explicitly invoke the prestige or office of the State or the particular police department or unit involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">More importantly, however, before jury deliberations began, the trial judge gave, among others, a jury instruction, based on Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 3:10, that emphasized the argumentative nature of closing arguments, and explicitly instructed the jurors as to relevant factors to consider and their roles as the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial. Maryland courts long have subscribed to the presumption that juries are able to follow the instructions given to them by the trial judge, particularly where the record reveals no overt act on the jury\u2019s part to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 160, 872 A.2d 25 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In contrast, in <em>Sivells v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 275-76, 280, 9 A.3d 123 (2010), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>421 Md. 659, 28 A.3d 704 (2011), this Court held that, over the defendant\u2019s objection, a prosecutor made improper remarks about the credibility of law enforcement officers, who were the only witnesses against the defendant. The prosecutor had argued in closing: \u201cEspecially two veterans who have a lot to loose [sic] by making things up, pensions, credibility, livelihood. Everything to loose [sic] and nothing to gain. Not one thing to gain by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 9 A.3d 123. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper because \u201cthere was no evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the police would lose their pensions or their livelihood if they \u2018made things up.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 9 A.3d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks\u2014that Woodland \u201cis not going to forget the face of the man who killed her only child,\u201d that \u201cyou cannot disbelieve\u201d Woodland and Butler, and that Woodland and Butler \u201cwant to get it right\u201d\u2014were not improper. The prosecutor based the remarks on facts in evidence: Woodland lost her daughter, and Butler lost a girl she considered a \u201cniece.\u201d Under the circumstances, the two eyewitnesses were likely to have stark, vivid memories of the event. This is commonsensical, and did not require \u201cexpert testimony\u201d as appellant argued. The instant situation is unlike Si<em>vells, </em>196 Md.App. at 280, 9 A.3d 123 a case in which the prosecutor argued a witness\u2019s credibility based on a fact not in evidence\u2014that the law enforcement witness would lose his pension for lying on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Similarly, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remark that the law enforcement witness would have had to \u201cconspir[e] with the witnesses, [and] with me the State, all the police\u201d was not improper. Again, the prosecutor made no mention of facts not in evidence and the remark was neither inflammatory nor depreciative of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">C. Burden-Shifting During State\u2019s Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 596, 886 A.2d 876 (2005), the Court of Appeals held that the State improperly shifted the burden to the defendant by arguing that the defendant had offered no evidence that the victim had a motive to lie. The error merited a new trial because \u201c[t]he primary evidence in this case was provided directly or indirectly by the victim\u2019s statements[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In contrast, in <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 139, 145, 751 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000), this Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument were not improper when the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">I\u2019m going to ask you not to speculate, not to speculate because that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to ask you, because the defense didn\u2019t produce a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>There\u2019s no evidence that the defendant was waiting for a bus. Where did you hear that? You heard that in [the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] opening statement which the judge just told you is not any more evidence than mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">Nobody got on the stand and testified to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">(Emphasis omitted). We held that the comments were proper because \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was drawing attention to the fact that defense counsel had failed to fulfill his prediction in opening statement as to what he would develop at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 751 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In this case, it is apparent that the prosecutor\u2019s remark about appellant\u2019s hat did not improperly shift the burden of proof to appellant. Prior to closing arguments, the circuit court instructed the jury on the State\u2019s burden of proof, and the prosecutor prefaced his remarks with a reminder that appellant need not prove anything. Both appellant and Duckett testified that appellant had been wearing a Chicago Bulls hat on June 29, 2007. Given that appellant testified that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat at the scene on the night of the shooting, the prosecutor was entitled to bring up that the hat was neither found at the crime scene, nor in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">D. Appealing to Juries\u2019 Fears During State\u2019s Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 596-97, 886 A.2d 876, the Court of Appeals held that the following remarks by the prosecutor during closing argument improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s fears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\u201cWhat does a monster look like? Looks like different things to different people. What does a sexual molester look like? He looks like someone you know. He looks like your uncle, your brother, your sister, your cousin. It\u2019s possible. But there is no certain way that someone who molests children looks. But they do ingratiate themselves. They make themselves indispensable. They are friendly, always there to watch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cNot everyone is like that, but please don\u2019t misunderstand me because the important point here is that a child molester looks like anybody else. That\u2019s why they are able to do what they do, because they look like all of us, and we trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201c[Although the prosecutor did not say \u2018this defendant\u2019 is a monster and a child molester, it is clear that she intended to imply to the jury that he was that monster and child molester.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 886 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were aimed at validating Irby\u2019s testimony about appellant having admitted that he shot a moving ice cream truck. After hearing all of the testimony, the jury was fully aware that the situation that the prosecutor hypothesized\u2014a stopped ice cream truck surrounded by children\u2014was not the circumstance under which the offense took place. Under the circumstances in this case, we discern neither an appeal to the jury\u2019s fears nor unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">E. Remarks on Appellant\u2019s Counsel and Appellant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We conclude the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as to appellant\u2019s counsel and appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s arguments were not improper. The prosecutor\u2019s calling appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s arguments \u201cred herrings\u201d was \u201coratorical conceit or flourish\u201d that was well within the wide latitude granted to counsel in summation. <em>McFadden, </em>197 Md.App. at 255, 13 A.3d 68 (citation omitted). As to the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cidiot,\u201d the prosecutor made the following remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">I sit there and listen to [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] arguments and the first thing that comes up to me is unbelievable that he can actually stand there and say the things that he did like this is no robbery; can\u2019t believe it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">A lot of sound and fury. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that phrase before. Well, that\u2019s actually from a quote. It\u2019s from Shakespeare, from Macbeth, and the full quote is: It is a tale ... and I\u2019m quoting now ... it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. That\u2019s what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>entire argument by [appellant\u2019s counsel] was. Didn\u2019t mean a thing. Means nada. Nothing. Not a dag on thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">He stood up here in front of you on several occasions and said that if the forensic evidence ... if this fingerprint doesn\u2019t show this, this fingerprint doesn\u2019t show that you have to find [appellant] not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel contended that the use of the term \u201cidiot\u201d denigrated the role of defense counsel and was inappropriate. To begin, we note that appellant\u2019s counsel failed to lodge any objection to this remark. Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object undermines the argument that this remark was utterly improper and offensive, and it also causes the issue to not be preserved for appellate review. As noted by Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., speaking for this Court, the purpose of objections \u201cto preserve the issue for appellate review is not an arbitrary one. It is supported by a solid rationale. At the most basic level, it recognizes that appellate courts do not range forth, like knights errant, seeking flaws in trials. Their quest is far more modest. They monitor a trial for the limited purpose of seeing if the trial judge committed error.\u201d <em>Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 264-65, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In addition to the lack of an objection, reading the remark in context, the prosecutor argued that appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention that no robbery occurred was \u201csound and fury.\u201d The prosecutor sought to rebut appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention that no robbery took place, rather than argue that appellant\u2019s counsel was an \u201cidiot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">During closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be convinced that a robbery occurred as they said it occurred.\u201d \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t robbed. I just said to you that I don\u2019t ... I can\u2019t believe beyond a reasonable doubt that they [Woodland and Butler] were robbed, but rather none of us should because they\u2019re not telling the truth, the whole truth. They ... they go over there and they say that they stopped to fix the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>mirrors. Why aren\u2019t Charlene Woodland\u2019s fingerprints on the mirrors?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">During the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor stated: \u201cI sit there and listen to [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] arguments and the first thing that comes up to me is unbelievable that he can actually stand there and say the things that he did like this is no robbery.... A lot of sound and fury. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that phrase before. Well, that\u2019s actually from a quote____the full quote is: It is a tale ... and I\u2019m quoting now ... it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\u201d Whether a prosecutor has exceeded the limits of permissible comment depends upon the facts of each case. <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 158, 872 A.2d 25. In this case, given the prosecutor\u2019s obvious attempt to rebut appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention that no robbery occurred, we perceive no error warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">F. Cumulative Prejudice from Improper Remarks During Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In this case, having examined the severity of the alleged improper remarks and determined that the remarks in isolation do not warrant reversal, we conclude that the remarks by the prosecutor do not cumulatively rise to the level of prejudice requiring reversal. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks, whether taken individually or as a whole, were not so improper that they tainted the results of a trial in which there were three eyewitnesses against appellant-Woodland, Butler, and Deante Duckett\u2014as well as the witness\u2014Irby\u2014who testified that appellant admitted shooting at the ice cream truck. As to the weight of the evidence against the accused, in our view, this was a strong case in which the evidence weighed heavily in the State\u2019s favor. This was not a close case, of the \u201che said, she said\u201d variety that turned primarily on the credibility of one witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Any prejudicial effect of the State\u2019s remarks was diminished by the instructions given by the circuit court prior to closing argument, the number of witnesses, and the overall weight of the evidence against appellant. As in <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>872 A.2d 25, before closing arguments, the circuit court properly instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence. Consequently, upon balancing the factors identified in <em>Spain, </em>we are satisfied that the State\u2019s remarks in relation to the totality of the evidence did not rise to the level of having misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the defendant, and do not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY AFFIRMED.

State, </em>425 Md. 210, 223-24, 40 A.3d 25 (2012), when a defendant waives his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then subsequently invokes his right to counsel or to remain silent, no further impermissible continuing interrogation may occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">.
