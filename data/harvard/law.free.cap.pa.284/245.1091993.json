They not only gave it this name to distinguish it from the other election they were providing for but they also expressly said that this general election could be held only in even-numbered years: Com, ex rel. v. Sharetts, 231 Pa. 525; Penn v. Bruff, 20 Pa. Dist. R. 989.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-12\"><em>Rufus 8.

The writ was allowed and served; to the defendants\u2019 answers the Commonwealth demurred; argument was had thereon, and judgment entered for the defendants; from this the Commonwealth prosecutes the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The only question argued below and here, was and is: Does the Act of May 13, 1915, P. L. 306, violate article XV, section 1, of the Constitution of the State, in so far as it attempts to authorize such elections to be held in odd-numbered years, since article VJII, section 2, which originally declared all fall elections to be general elections, was amended in 1909 to limit that term to those held in even-numbered years? This record does not call for a decision of that question. We held in Armstrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>v. King, 281 Pa. 207, and Hollinger v. King, 282 Pa. 157, that where the people of the State, in their sovereign capacity and pursuant to a right reserved in their Constitution, had voted to alter their frame of state government, their action became final and conclusive, and could not thereafter be attacked in any form of proceeding. No valid reason can be given why the same rule should not be applied where, as here, a specified portion of the people, in a like capacity and pursuant to a similar reservation (article XV, section 1, supra), vote to alter the frame of their municipal government. In each, since there has been \u201ca change made by the people in their political institutions,......the question is no longer judicial\u201d: Armstrong v. King, supra, page 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
