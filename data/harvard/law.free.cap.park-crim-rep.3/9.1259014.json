The witness stated that he did not know what kind of beer it was; there was a difference in beer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-9\">The district attorney asked the witness if it was. intoxicating liquor. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the question on the ground that it called for the opinion of the witness. The court overruled the objection, and the counsel for defendant excepted. The witness answered that it was, if one drank enough of it. The witness further stated that he bought one glass of Dutch beer of defendant on the 16th day of January, 1854, and paid him for it. The district attorney Offered to prove by the witness that defendant sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>intoxicating liquors on other days and at other times than 16th day of January, 1854. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected. The court overruled the objection, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The witness also stated that he knew of defendant\u2019s selling a glass of the same kind of beer to one Chapman, in March, 1854. Witness also stated on his cross-examination that he had seen and drank strong beer; never knew of any one getting intoxicated on Dutch beer; that it had not the same taste as strong beer; was not as strong as strong beer, though stronger than small beer. The district attorney then called a witness and proved that he bought beer of defendant in winter of 1854, and paid for it; it was Dutch ale; does not think it is intoxicating. Witness had drank it with other liquors, then it would intoxicate; small beer taken after whiskey would have the like effect, but not so great effect; think it stronger a good deal than small beer, and not as strong as strong beer. Whereupon the said defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that the several matters given in evidence on the part of the people were not sufficient to authorize the jury to convict the defendant of violating the statute in relation to the sale of spiritous liquors, and that there was no evidence before the jury of the defendant\u2019s having sold any spiritous liquors or strong beer, as charged in the indictment, and asked the court so to instruct the jury; but the court refused, and the defendant excepted. The defendant, by his counsel, then asked the court to charge the jury that there was a material variance between the proof .as given by the people and \u25a0 the charge in the indictment, and that the proof did not sustain the allegations in the indictment. The court refused so to instruct the jury, and the defendant, by his counsel, excepted. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to quash the indictment on the ground that the proof did not sustain the averments in the indictment. The court refused the motion, and the defendant, by his counsel, excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The court then charged the jury that the question for them to pass upon was whether or not the beer as described by witness had been sold by defendant, and if they believed the witness they were authorized to convict the defendant; that as a question of law the beer described by the witness was strong or spiritous liquor within the meaning of the statute; the defendant excepted, and the jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-5\">A bill of exceptions having been made and settled, a <em>certiorari </em>was sued out and the proceedings brought up for review.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-6\"><em>R. P. Wisner, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-7\">I. The court erred in permitting the witness to give his opinion in regard to the effect produced by the article when drank. The indictment specifies the kind of liquor sold by defendant, and it cannot be aided by the opinion of the witness, that the beer sold would intoxicate. The proof received was immaterial under the ruling of the judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">II. The court should have instructed the jury that there was no evidence before them that defendant had sold any such liquor as charged in the indictment. The term strong beer, as used in the indictment, has a specific meaning, and must be understood to include only that liquor known and recognized as strong beer. It is not a generic term, and cannot include the different kinds of beer used at the present day. The people having made a specific charge against the defendant, they were bound to prove it as laid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-9\">III. The charge of the court as given, and the refusal of the court to charge as requested, were equally erroneous. If the court was right in receiving the evidence of the effect of the beer when drank, then there was a question of fact for the jury to pass upon. If the crime charged in the indictment consisted in the sale of beer that would produce intoxication when drank, then clearly a question of fact was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>presented for the consideration of the jury. The court having decided that \u201c Dutch beer \u201d came within the terms of the indictment, without reference to its effect upon those who drank it, took away from the defendant the right to prove its composition, or to give any evidence to show that it was not \u201c strong and spiritous liquors and wines.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-5\"><em>James Woods, Jr. </em>(District Attorney), for the people, cited <em>Nevin </em>v. <em>Ladue </em>(3 <em>Denio, </em>43, 437).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b18-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>T. R. Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">The word \u201cbeer,\u201d in its ordinary sense, denotes a beverage which is intoxicating, and is within the fair meaning of the words \u201cstrong or spiritous liquors,\u201d used in the statutes applicable to this case. <em>(Webs. Dict., \u201cBeer;\u201d Nevin </em>v. <em>Ladue, </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>43; <em>same case in error, id., </em>437.) Some qualifying word may be used in connection with the word \u201cbeer,\u201d as \u201croot beer,\u201d \u201cmolasses beer,\u201d &amp;c., and the two together signify a drink which is not intoxicating, and it may also be shown, by proving the materials and the mode of production of what is called \u201cbeer,\u201d that it is notan intoxicating drink; but when the sense is not thus restricted, the word must be understood to mean one kind of the \u201c strong and spiritous liquors referred to in those statutes. The \u201cbeer\u201d in the present case was \u201cDutch beer;\u201d but there is nothing in the ordinary sense of the word \u201cDutch\u201d to qualify the meaning of the word \u201cbeer,\u201d when used alone, in respect to intoxicating qualities. No evidence was given of the mode employed or materials used in making it. I think, therefore, in the absence of such evidence, the judge was right in advising the jury that \u201cthe beer described by the witnesses was \u2018strong and spiritous liquors\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">The indictment charges the sale of \u201c strong and spiritous liquors,\u201d to wit, among other liquors, \u201c one pint of strong beer.\u201d The evidence- is that the defendant sold \u201cDutch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>beer,\u201d and, as I understand the bill of exceptions, the counsel for the defendant objected that this proof varied from and did not support the indictment, as \u201cDutch beer\u201d is not \u201c strong beer.\u201d I do not think there is a material variance. The terms*\" strong beer\u201d and \u201cDutch beer,\u201d without explanation, must both be understood to mean intoxicating liquors of a similar character, produced from similar materials, and in a like way, to express which the former term is appropriate. By \u201cstrong beer\u201d is understood, I suppose, a malt inebriating liquor, and I understand that \u201cDutch beer\u201d is a malt inebriating liquor, not differing substantially from \u201cstrong beer,\u201d thus understood, in the kind of materials used or the mode of its manufacture, but only in its strength, being less intoxicating. As well might it be urged, if the sale of \u201cale\u201d was proved, that the charge of selling \u201cstrong beer\u201d was not sustained, as to object that the proof of the sale of \u201c Dutch beer \u201d does not support the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">New trial denied and proceedings remitted to the sessions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
