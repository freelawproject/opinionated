R. Beebe, <em>City Judge.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">By the bill of exceptions, also returned with the above record of conviction, it appeared that the prisoner, having pleaded not guilty and demanded a separate trial, was tried before Judge Beebe, city judge, on the 9th of November, 1854. It appeared, upon the trial, that the warehouse, which it was alleged the prisoner had attempted to set fire to, was not in actual contact with the inhabited dwelling-house of either of the persons named in the indictment, but was only four or five feet distant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-11\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, among other things, requested the court to charge as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-12\">That dwellings, to be adjoining to the warehouse or building of the defendant, within the statute, must actually touch, or be in close contact with the latter building; that the word \u201c adjoining \u201d meant actual contact, and that unless the dwellings mentioned in the testimony for the prosecution were in actual contact with the defendant\u2019s building, the indictment was unsustained in this particular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-13\">The court refused so to charge, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-14\">There were several other questions which arose on the trial, but they need not be stated, as no opinion was expressed upon them by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-15\"><em>John </em>Graham, for the plaintiff in error, made, among other points, the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-16\">VI. The definition of the word \u201cadjoining,\u201d as given in the request of the court to charge the jury, was correct, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the refusal of the court so to charge, and its charge, as given upon this point, were erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">The statute uses language that has a perfectly well understood meaning. The building attempted to be fired must adjoin, or, if not adjoin, must be within the curtilage of an inhabited dwelling. In other words, the former building must touch the latter, or if it does not, and is removed any distance from the latter, it must be within the common fence. To take this as the standard by which to construe the statute is to assume a safe one. Any other would be productive of the greatest laxity. But for the exertions which are made to arrest fires, any building on fire, or attempted to be set on fire, could be said to adjoin another, for the purposes of danger, no matter how far off the two buildings might be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">The error of the court was, in allowing the jury to define for themselves the word \u201cadjoining,\u201d with reference to distance. No two juries would think alike on such a subject. Some might take a greater and some a less distance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">It must be observed, too, that this is a penal statute, and as such to be strictly, literally construed.

The Latin word <em>\u201cadjungo,\u201d </em>from which it has sprung, signified \u201ctc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>join to;\u201d but the etymology of a word would be an uncertain guide to its present popular or even technical meaning. Not only words of classical and foreign origin, but those indigenous to the Anglo-Saxon stock, have, in many instances, widely departed from their primitive acceptation, and, in some instances, have been transformed into one entirely opposite and dissimilar. The word \u201cprevent\u201d may be cited, among many others of a similar history. It is derived from the Latin <em>\u201cprcevenio,\u201d </em>\u201cto go before,\u201d and, in our translation of the Bible, in the liturgy, and in old theological standards, it is employed to express the idea of \u201c assisting \u201d and \u201cgoing before.\u201d At present it means \u201chindrance,\u201d \u201cimpediment,\u201d and is used in no other sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The word \u201cadjoin\u201d seems popularly to have no fixed meaning. I have no doubt that it is frequently employed in ordinary language merely to express nearness; but there are no indications, in the instances in which it is more formally used, that its present signification is at all different from that of its Latin original.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Mr. Crabbe, in his <em>English Synonyms, </em>classifies together \u201c adjacent,\u201d \u201c adjoining\u201d and \u201c contiguous;\u201d and, after giving the etymology of these words, illustrates the difference between them in the following manner: \u201c What is <em>adjacent </em>may be separated by the intervention of some third object: \u2018They have been beating up for volunteers at York, and the towns <em>adjacent, </em>but nobody will list.\u2019 Granville. What is <em>adjoining </em>must touch in some part: \u2018 As he happens to have no estate <em>adjoining, </em>equal to his own, his oppressions are often borne without resistance.\u2019 <em>Johnson. </em>What is <em>contiguous </em>must be fitted to touch entirely on one side: \u2018 We arrived at the utmost boundaries of a wood, which lay <em>contiguous </em>to a plain.\u2019 <em>Steele. </em>Lands are <em>adjacent </em>to a house or town; fields are <em>adjoining </em>to each other; houses <em>contiguous </em>to each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In the case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hodges </em>(1 <em>Mood, &amp; Malk., </em>341), this meaning was given to the word \u201cadjoining,\" in a case not unlike the present. The prisoner was indicted, on the <em>7th. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and <em>8th George IV. (ch. </em>29, \u00a7 38), for stealing pear trees, described, in one of the counts of the indictment, as growing on ground \u201c adjoining,\u201d &amp;c., to a dwelling-house; held, \u201c adjoining \u201d imported \u201cactual contact,\u201d and, therefore, ground separated from a house by a narrow walk and paling, with, a gate in it, was not within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">One of the statutes under which the prisoner in this case was indicted provides that \u201c every person who shall willfully set fire to or burn in the night-time any shop, warehouse or other building, not being the subject of arson in the first degree, but <em>adjoining </em>to, or within the curtilage of, any inhabited dwelling-house, <em>so that such house shall he endangered hy such firing, </em>shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of arson in the second degree.\u201d The court below were of opinion that the words, \u201c <em>so that such house shall he endangered hy such </em>firing,\u201d were sufficient to show that the statute meant any house near enough to be endangered. It must be admitted that there is some force in this view, as these words appear to be superfluous if the word \u201c adjoining\u201d signified only a house in actual contact with the place set fire to; for every house in actual contact, it may be alleged, must necessarily be endangered by such an act; but if such a qualification of the word \u201c adjoining \u201d were to be accepted, it would give the term a much more extended signification than the prosecution contends for or than the court below evidently intended. It would be impossible to limit, in a city, the distance in which any house may not be endangered when any other building in it is on fire; the danger would depend upon the combustibleness of the intervening houses, the preparations of the incendiary, the state of the weather, and the means of suppressing the original fire or of arresting its progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Even if these words, therefore, cannot be applied to any other antecedent, it is safer to consider them as surplusage, than to give them the effect of changing a term from its well established and recognized signification.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>I am of opinion that the court below erred in its charge to the jury on this point, and that a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<author id=\"b75-5\">Mitchell, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5o\">The act under which the defendant was indicted provides (omitting some words not now material ) that every person who shall willfully set fire to or burn, in the night-time, any building not being the subject of arson in the first degree, but adjoining to or within the curtilage of any inhabited dwelling-house, so that such house shall be endangered by such firing, shall be guilty of arson in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The building set fire to by the defendant was a store and not inhabited, and did not touch any inhabited house, nor was it within the curtilage of any, but was in a block where there were several dwelling-houses; two of them, each, on another lot; and not more than ten or twenty feet from the store. The act may admit of two constructions : one, that it applies to a person who shall so set fire to or burn a building, &amp;c., adjoining an inhabited house, that such adjoining house shall be endangered by such fire; the other, that it applies to a person who sets fire to a building, &amp;c., which so adjoins a dwelling-house that the dwelling-house is endangered by the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">If this construction were right, then the sentence would read, that the person should be guilty who should set fire to a building, &amp;c., so adjoining to or so within the curtilage of any inhabited dwelling-house that such house should be endangered by such fire; and the \u201cso\u201d must then qualify the term \u201c within the curtilage,\u201d as well as the term \u201c adjoining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">There could be no need of thus defining the meaning of being \u201cwithin the curtilage;\u201d that was already sufficiently understood, and this makes it probable that the term \u201c so \u201d was meant not to qualify the words \u201cadjoining,\u201d or being \u201cwithin the curtilage,\u201d but the verbs \u201cshall set fire to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>burn.\u201d If the prisoner should set fire to or burn a store, in such a manner that he endangered an inhabited dwelling-house, adjoining to or within the same curtilage as the store, by such fire, then he was to be deemed guilty. But if he set fire to the store in such manner that the adjoining dwelling-house was not in danger by such fire, then he was not guilty under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">This being the proper reading of the section, the question remains, what does \u201cadjoining to\u201d mean in this act. In addition to what my brother, Clerke, has said on that subject, it may be proper to refer to 2 <em>Revised Statutes (p. </em>657, \u00a7 10), which, after arson in the first degree is defined in section nine, declares that no warehouse, outhouse, &amp;c., shall be deemed a dwelling-house, or part of a dwelling-house, within the meaning of the preceding section, unless the same be joined to, immediately connected with, and part of a dwelling-house.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">If this store and the two dwelling-houses near them had been separated as they are, and had been used as parts of a hotel, and no one ever slept in this store, or was in it when it was set on fire, could it, by possibility, have been held that the defendant was guilty of arson in the first degree, and that this store joined to and was immediately connected with it for the purposes of the hotel, and to which it was applied, although not by contact, but it would not be joined to it. If the terms, \u201cjoined to and immediately connected with,\u201d both refer to the position of the building, and not to the uses to which they are applied, as is probably correct, then each helps to define the other, and to show that both were used, as well as the words \u201c part of the dwelling-house,\u201d so as, by an accumulation of words of nearly the same meaning, to secure the construction which each phrase was intended to have, an actual contact. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The term \u201c adjoining \u201d is used in its strict sense, as indicating actual contact, in the law as to division fences (1 <em>R. S.. </em>553, $$ 30, 31, 33), and in section four hundred and one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Code, prescribing the counties in which motions shall be made, and probably in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The offence of the defendant is so great that it is quite natural an effort should be made to bring him within the section under which he is convicted; but the court is not at liberty to go beyond the fair meaning of the legislature in a highly penal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">A new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial'ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
