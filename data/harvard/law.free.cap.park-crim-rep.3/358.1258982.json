The affidavits mentioned by the witness James Catillay I found on the files in my office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-11\">It further appeared in the evidence that the county judge was sitting upon the bench, and engaged in his official duties at the time of the making and swearing to the paper mentioned in the testimony of James Catillay, in same room.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-12\">The affidavits were offered in evidence by the district attorney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-13\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to their receipt on the ground \u201c they were incompetent,\u201d and further that no foundation had been laid for their introduction, which objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>was overruled by the court, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">The affidavits were then read in evidence. At the close of the evidence on the part of the prosecution, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved that the defendant be discharged on the following grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">First. That it appears that the affidavit of the defendant, if made at all, was made in the Lewis County Court, for the purpose of.procuring the said James Catillay to be naturalized, and to receive a certificate of citizenship from said court; that said court had no jurisdiction in the premises, and the pretended affidavit was therefore extra-judicial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">Second. It does not appear from such affidavits that they were made in proceedings in the Lewis County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">Third. That it does not appear that the person of the alien, mentioned in said indictments and in said affidavits, were one and the same : which motion was denied by the court, to which decision the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\">After the close of the trial the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that the clerk had no jurisdiction to naturalize, and that if the jury find that he assumed to entertain and.act upon applications, and that of the said Catillay in particular, on the general authority of the court to act in court or out, that the affidavit in this case produced in evidence was extra-judicial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">The court, upon said request, charged that the clerk had no jurisdiction to naturalize, and that if the affidavit was in fact taken out of court, the oath was extra-judicial, and declined to charge otherwise on the remainder of the proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\">The court further charged that, in order to sustain the allegation of perjury in this case, it was not necessary that the affidavit of the defendant should be submitted to the actual inspection of the 'court, but that the indictment was sustained if the jury should find that the oath was actually taken in the presence of the court, and while it was in open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>session, but if it was necessary to give effect to the oath, it would be presumed, in the absence of any proof to the contrary, that the court discharged its legal duty; to which ruling, and each and every part thereof, the counsel for defendant excepted. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-5\"><em>John Clarke, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">I. The alleged perjury is not an offence against the laws of New-York, but only against those of the United States; by which the terms are prescribed on which a foreigner may become a citizen, not of the State of New-York, but of the United States. <em>(Dred Scott case.) </em>These terms are, that certain facts shall exist, and be proved before a Superior, or Circuit or District Court of a state, or Circuit or District Court of the United States; and by another section it is provided that \u201c every Court of Record in any individual state, having common law jurisdiction, and a seal and clerk or prothonotary, shall be considered as a District* Court within the meaning of the act, and every alien who may have been naturalized in any such court shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as if he had been naturalized in a District or Circuit Court of the United States.\u201d <em>(Act April </em>14, 1803.) It is a law of the United States against which the offence is committed; it is committed in a court of the United States, made so by the act itself, having no authority except as such court. Hence, there can be no perjury in the case punishable by the state laws. Jurisdiction, even in the state court, in such case, is denied. (1 <em>Wheat., </em>330; <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>17 <em>John., </em>4.) In these cases the court deny the authority of the state court to act at all under such delegated power; and in <em>ex parte Smith </em>(5 <em>Cow., </em>273), sustain only the powers of a magistrate to arrest and hold for examination, on the principle of national comity. These cases decided that, under the United States constitution, congress cannot vest any portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>judicial power of the United States except in courts ordained and established by itself. <em>(Dudley </em>v. <em>Mayhew, </em>3 <em>Comst., </em>15.) State courts cannot take cognizance of a perjury committed in making an affidavit under an act of congress relative to the sale of public lands. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>4 <em>Bl. Com., </em>146; 5 <em>U. S. Dig., </em>250.) No state can pass naturalization laws. <em>(Chirac </em>v. <em>Chirac, </em>2 <em>Wheat., </em>259.) The false oath must be against the interests of the state. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>3 <em>Murphy, </em>226.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">II. The County Court is not a court of common law jurisdiction. Common law is defined to be \u201c that which derives its force and authority from the universal consent and immemorial practice of the people.\u201d (2 <em>Bouv. L. Dic., 9.) </em>True, in the seventh article of amendments to the constitution of the United States, it is provided that \u201cin suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall not exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved;\u201d and it is said the term in that place is used in contradistinction to equity, admiralty and maritime law. But common law jurisdiction, as applied to the courts which may naturalize, may, and probably does mean, original jurisdiction also. A mere appellate jurisdiction, confined to cases of appeal from Justices\u2019 Courts, and cases arising in such courts where title is in question, which is the only semblance of common law jurisdiction that court has, does not make it a court of common law jurisdiction within the meaning of this provision. The old Court of Errors was not, and certainly this court cannot arrogate to itself such jurisdiction. The decision in <em>Kundolf </em>v. <em>Thalheimer </em>(2 <em>Kern., </em>593) is put upon this distinction, as remarked by one of the judges, \u201cif common law actions are to be turned into special cases in this way,\u201d &amp;c. The constitution provides' that the County Court shall have such jurisdiction, in cases arising in Justices\u2019 Courts, and in special cases as the legislature may prescribe, but shall have no original civil jurisdiction, except in such special cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>III. As the legislature have not conferred the jurisdiction to naturalize aliens in the County Court, even if it could do so, there is for that reason no jurisdiction. It is not made one of the special cases. This would be conclusive, were it a subject of state law and jurisdiction. If it be not so, the court, <em>pro hac vice, </em>is a United States Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">IV. The naturalization act requires the court to make a judicial examination of the applicant and his witnesses. It requires a trial by and before the court, on oath administered in open court. It does not contemplate or allow an affidavit as in this case. Here was no conformity, no hearing, no oath, no adjudication. The indictment is not based on any such proceeding;\"nor is any such proceeding proved.\" On the contrary, the indictment is based \"on an affidavit alone; and the proof is that such affidavit alone was made. It was inadmissible for any purpose. The court could not act upon it. (7 <em>Hill, </em>137; 18 <em>Barb., </em>444.) The indictment must allege an examination on oath in open court. <em>(Copeland </em>v. <em>The State, </em>24 <em>Miss., </em>257.) It must state that a question was presented to and for the adjudication of the court, and that evidence was duly given thereon. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Moffat, </em>7 <em>Humph., </em>250; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>9 <em>Yerg., </em>349; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Park.

By the act of congress of April 14, 1802, jurisdiction to naturalize is given to' state Courts of Record having common law jurisdiction, with a seal and a clerk. County Courts of this state are Courts of Record, have a seal and a clerk, and possess common law jurisdiction sufficient to meet the requirements of the act of congress above mentioned (Co<em>nst. N. Y., art. </em>6, \u00a7 14; <em>id., art. </em>14, \u00a7 5): First. Because they have appellate jurisdiction over a large class of common law actions originating in Justices\u2019 Courts; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Second, And exclusive jurisdiction over a common law action originating in a Justices\u2019 Court, where title comes in question, and also the right to issue executions on judgments obtained in Justices\u2019 Courts, over the amount of $25, and docketed in said County Court, and control over the same; Third. Because, in their nature, organic structure, rules and practice, they are common law courts, and also exercise jurisdiction in a class of common law actions. <em>(Const. N. Y., art. </em>6, \u00a7 14; <em>id., art. </em>14, \u00a7 5; 5 <em>Barb., </em>169, 182; 11 <em>id., </em>619; 17 <em>id., </em>506; 2 <em>Seld., </em>176; 2 <em>Kern., </em>592; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 596.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">II. The case in 2 <em>Kernan </em>only rules that County Courts have not original jurisdiction in common law actions. It does not overrule the case of <em>Kundolf </em>v. <em>Thalheimer </em>(17 <em>Barb.) </em>by saying they have not common law jurisdiction of some kind within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">III.

The oath having been duly administered, it is presumed that the proceedings were regular and that the court properly discharged its duty.

The offence of perjury is a common law offence, cognizable by the courts of the various states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">VI. Though it is an offence against the laws of the United States, yet, being committed in a state court, it is cognizable by both the federal and state courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-10\">VII. Offences against the United States are also, in many cases, offences against the several states, and are punishable by the state courts. (3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>196; 11 <em>id., </em>196; 8 <em>Metc., </em>313; 2 <em>Hill, </em>687; 3 <em>Hamilton's Works, </em>265.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b374-11\">Bacon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5s\">The only questions which arise on this <em>certiorari </em>are, first, whether the County Court of Lewis county had power to naturalize the alien on whose applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>cation the perjury was alleged to have been committed; second, whether the courts of this state have jurisdiction to punish for a violation of what is claimed to be a law of the United States; or, in other words, whether the offence charged was not an offence against the laws of the United States and not the laws of New-York.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On the first point, I entertain no doubt that the County Court has jurisdiction to naturalize aliens. The act of Congress adopts every state court as its agent, to do this service, that is a court of record, and has a common law jurisdiction, and a seal and clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The County Court possesses all these powers and functions. If it has common law jurisdicton, that is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">It has such exclusive jurisdiction in the common law action of trespass, commenced in a Justice Court, when title to land comes in <em>question; </em>and although this tribunal is shorn of much of its power by the constitution of 1846 and the decision of the Court of Appeals under it, I believe it is not yet divested of this power, not to speak of others which savor of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The second objection, it seems to me, does not arise in this case. No such objection was taken, on the trial, and no motion to quash the indictment was made on that ground. The only defect of jurisdiction alleged was the want of power in the County Court to naturalize. If the objection can be entertained, I am sorry to say that I fear that it must prevail, and a case of gross criminality will go \u201cunwhipped of j ustice.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The County Court acted as the agent of the government, and was, <em>pro hac vice, </em>a tribunal of the United States; and in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lathrop </em>(17 <em>John., </em>4) the Supreme Court of this state held that a state court has no jurisdiction of criminal offences against the United States. The offence being committed in a court of the United States was an offence which could only properly be charged, as is said by Platt, J., in his dissenting opinion, \u201cas an offence commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ted against the\" state, a sovereign whose courts sit in judgment on the offender\u201d The cases cited by the counsel of the people do not uphold the doctrine put forth in the point made by him, but apply to quite a different state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u2022 I repeat that I regret to come to this conclusion, and shall be quite willing to yield my impressions to my brethren, -if they come to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">As at present advised, my opinion is that the conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b376-7\">Pratt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alc\">An important question in this case (although not absolutely necessary to be considered) is raised upon the part of the defendant in regard to the jurisdiction of the state courts to try him for the crime charged against him in this judgment. The question to be considered is,\u2019 whether the offence charged is one against the laws of the United States, or one against the laws of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">There, are many crimes made punishable by the laws of the United States which are also made punishable by the laws of the state. In such cases it has been held that the state courts have jurisdiction of the crime. Forging the coin of the United States is an example of this class. As the constitution of the United States gives to congress an exclusive power to coin money and to regulate the value of the same, it would seem to follow- that congress is vested with the power to\u2019 make laws to prevent its being counterfeited. But this would not necessarily take away the power from the state to make the crime also punishable under its laws. And, when the crime is thus made punishable by state laws, it follows as a matter of course that the state courts have jurisdiction to enforce those laws (8 <em>Metc., </em>313 ; 9 <em>Ohio, </em>133; 1 <em>Doug., </em>267; 2 <em>Const. R. S. C., 77; Curt. Com. on the Const., \u00a7 </em>133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Th\u00e9fe is another class of cases in which the state courts had jurisdiction'before the adoption of the federal constitution, such as crimes punishable at common law. Though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>such crimes are brought under the cognizance of the federal courts by the constitution of the United States and the legislation of congress, yet, unless such jurisdiction is made exclusive by the terms of the constitution, or by the acts of congress, the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to try them. (8 <em>Metc., </em>313; 12 <em>How., </em>284; <em>Curt. Com., </em>\u00a7 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">There is still another class' of cases where congress has attempted to vest in state courts jurisdiction of matters arising under the laws of congress. Interesting questions \u2018have arisen in cases of this kind, and there is a great conflict of judicial authority whether jurisdiction in the federal courts is not necessarily exclusive in such cases. The preponderance of authority, at least in the state courts, seems to be against the power of congress to confer such jurisdiction, especially when the remedy necessarily involves proceedings either by action or by indictment. (1 <em>Wheat., </em>336; 5 <em>id., </em>49 ; <em>Serg. Const. L., ch. </em>27; 17 <em>John, </em>15 ; <em>Virg. Cas., </em>321; 7 <em>Conn., </em>239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">There is another class of cases in which duties, judicial in in their nature, have been conferred in special cases upon state magistrates and courts, which it has been held that they are not bound to discharge, but may or may not discharge them at their own option, such as the arrest and examination of persons charged with crime, the arrest of fugitives from service under the act of 1793, and various other cases not necessary to enumerate. <em>(Prigg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 <em>Peters, </em>531.) The naturalizafcionlaws confer powers upon state courts of substantially the same character; and, without attempting to examine the question in regard to the power of the federal government to confer such jurisdiction upon state courts and magistrates, it seems to me quite clear that, in entertaining such proceedings, they are exclusively under the laws of the United States and should be deemed, <em>quoad hoc, </em>courts of the United States. The crime, therefore, with which the prisoner was charged in the indictment was, in my opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>a crime against the laws and sovereignty of the United States, and not against the laws and sovereignty of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">First. The subject of naturalization is exclusively within the jurisdiction of congress. The constitution confers upon congress the power to eastblish a uniform rule of naturalization, and, having passed laws establishing such rule, the states are excluded from interfering in any manner with the subject. (2 <em>Wheat., </em>269; 2 <em>Dal., </em>370; 3 <em>Wash. C. C. R., </em>313; 5 <em>Wheat., </em>49; 1 <em>Kent, </em>426.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Second. The state courts, in entertaining these proceedings, are acting directly under the laws of the United States, and form a portion of the judicial agency of the federal government for carrying these laws into effect. They exercise in these proceedings no common law powers, but simply follow the express directions of the act of congress. (2 <em>U. S. Stat. at Large, </em>154.) They should be deemed, therefore, as acting, in such proceedings, as courts of the United States; and such I presume would be the undoubted construction of the acts of magistrates in the examination of persons accused of crime, under the laws of the United States, or fugitives from service under the act of 1793 ; and yet there is no reason why the same rule should not apply to naturalization proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Third. These proceedings, being under the laws of the United States, and part of the necessary judicial agency provided by those laws for canying them into effect, it would seem to follow that false swearing, by a person giving material testimony in those proceedings, must necessarily constitute an offence against tho laws of the United States, and, if so, he must be punishable under the laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">' The prohibitions against perjury, in the statutes of our state, manifestly contemplate perjury in the state courts, or in proceedihgs before magistrates under the state laws, and not under the laws of another state. In <em>The State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(4 <em>Blackf., </em>146) it was held \u201cthat if an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>be made under an act of congress, relative to the sale of public lands, and the party making it commit perjury, he may be punished under the act of congress prohibiting the offence, but the courts of the state had no jurisdiction.\u201d The statute of Indiana provides that \u201c any person who willfully, corruptly and falsely makes an affidavit, &amp;c., should be deemed guilty of perjury.\u201d <em>(Rev. Code </em>1831, <em>p </em>186.) This provision is quite as general as the provisions of our statute against the commission of perjury, yet the court in that case held that it was not an offence against the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It will be seen that perjury is made an offence by the laws of the United States, and that there is no reservation of jurisdiction in the state courts of that offence. \u25a0 It is provided by the act of 1790 <em>(ch. </em>9) that \u201cIf any person shall willfully and corruptly commit peijury, on his or her oath or affirmation, in any suit or controversy, matter or cause, depending in any of the courts of the United States, or in any'deposition taken pursuant to the laws of the United States, every person offending shall suffer,\u201d &amp;c. By act of September 24, 1789 (ch. 20), exclusive jurisdiction is given to the Circuit Courts of the United States \u201c of all crimes and offences cognizable under the laws of the United States, except when the act otherwise provides or the laws of the United States shall otherwise direct.\u201d I have found no statute of the United States conferring jurisdiction upon the state courts to punish for the crime of p.eijury, under the laws of Congress; although, by subsequent acts, this exclusive jurisdiction has been taken away in regard to some other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">If I am right, therefore, in the position that the court, in these proceedings, is to be deemed a court of the United States, there can be no doubt but that the exclusive jurisdiction of the crime charged in the indictment in this case was in the federal courts, and that the Lewis County Oyer and Terminer had no jurisdiction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>But, independent of the question of jurisdiction, I think the conviction should be reversed. The laws of Congress require the application to be made to the court, and the proof of five years\u2019 previous residence must be taken in open court. It must also be common law evidence, taken by the oral examination of the witness. Previously prepared affidavits are not competent. Such was the construction given to the act hy this court in 7 <em>Hill </em>(137), and 18 <em>Barb. </em>(444). In this case there was no proof that any application was made to the court at all, or that the witness was ever sworn in open court, or that the court, in any manner, passed upon the matter. No presumption can be raised in favor of the regularity of the proceedings' until it be proved that such proceedings were pending before the court.' Until jurisdiction is shown, the presumptions are all the other way. It was therefore necessary to prove, in the first place, the pendency of the proceedings before that court. Before that was done there could be no presumption that the witness was examined orally, and his testimony afterwards put in the form of affidavits. Affidavits found on file were clearly not competent to prove the pendency of such- proceedings, especially as there is no law requiring the examination to be taken in writing and filed; and, until the pendency of the proceedings is proved, the certificate of the clerk to these unauthorized affidavits does not prove anything. It is all in the nature of hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The minutes of the court should have been produced, showing the pendency of the proceedings and the actual oral examination of the witness, before it was competent to show that his testimony was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">. I think, therefore, that the exception to the introduction of the affidavit was well taken, and the conviction, for this reason, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Conviction reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
