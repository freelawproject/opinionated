Roosevelt, one of the justices of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">The district attorney, in his opening, stated that Rose Williams, the deceased, came to her death by poison (arsenic) administered to her by the prisoner, her husband, on the night of Saturday, the 29th day of April, 1854, and on the evening of Wednesday, the 3d day of May, 1854.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">The following testimony was then taken:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\"><em>Mary Campbell, </em>being sworn, testified: I resided on the first of May last in No. 58 Duane-street,; I had been there prior to that three months; I knew the deceased for about a year; we then lived together at No. 28 City Hall-place; we left there and immediately came to Duane-street. Mrs. Williams was with me four months, from February up to her death; I knew her husband; deceased and her husband did not live together; they have not lived together since I became acquainted with her; the last Saturday before her death, she left my house with clothing for her husband (who was a watchman on some ship in the North river), as she said. \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">This was said in answer to a question by the district attorney, who asked the witness to state where the deceased said she was going on Saturday evening previous to her death. The prisoner\u2019s counsel objected to the question, but the court overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted. The witness proceeded:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">She did not return until five o\u2019clock the next morning; when she came in she appeared very ill; she said she got sick on board the vessel on which her husband was; she said she had not been drinking; she said that her whole frame seemed as if it were on fire, and her heart felt awful, On the day she returned her husband called to see her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>she was in bed; when he came in she was so glad to see him that she rose up and put on some of her things; she then gave me fifty cents and told me to go out and get her some apples and candies. When he came in the wife told him that I had said she had been drinking some liquor, and he said she had not been drinking anything; I then went out for the things and brought them in and gave them to the deceased, and the deceased gave them to the prisoner; I was absent about five minutes; I put the apples and candy on the trunk, and deceased handed them to him; she vomited during the whole Sunday, both day and night; and when she took any water, which she was continually calling for, she brought it up; he did not stop very long on Sunday; I did not notice their conversation particularly; on Monday, a little before two o\u2019clock, the doctor came; the prisoner was there on Monday in the afternoon; he told her then that he had left $10 at the City Hall for her,- to pay her weekly allowance; he said that he would call again, and did so on the Monday evening at eight o\u2019clock; she was no better then, and was vomiting all the time; she told him that she had \u201c felt awful \u201d ever since she had tasted what he had given to her in a pitcher; he then told her it was the water she had drank that made her feel so bad; she then asked for some water, and he would not let her have any; she then told him to leave, but he said there was time enough; he then went down stairs and brought up some butter, a loaf, and some sponge cake; he ate most qf it himself; he offered her some, but she would not eat it; she was frequently asking for water, but he would not let her have any; she then asked him to lie down, when he would not go; it was a far advanced period of the night at this time, and he would not leave, so that he should prevent her from getting water; he laid down; I slept in the same room; he remained all night; she, during the night, wanted water, and he seemingly would be asleep, and when she attempted to get out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of bed to get water he prevented her; at five o\u2019clock on Tuesday he left my room; he did not come on Tuesday, and she was no better, vomiting all the time ; he came on Wednesday, about half-past six, P. M.; on Wednesday she felt better, and was up by seven, A. M.; when he came she was in bed, and I was talking to her; he asked her how she felt; she said she felt no better; he sat down by the bedside, and she took hold of his hand and put it on her heart and said the pain was there; she felt as if she was all' on fire; she told him to look at her gums; they were all raw; when I last saw that her gums were raw, she asked her husband to look at them; he said they were not so bad as she said they were; he asked her if she had eaten anything ; she said yes, some tea witness had made for her, having some toasted bread in it; I made the tea, used the brown sugar taken at the inquest, and tried to get her to take some more of it before he came in, but she could not; placed the bowl on the stove; no fire in it; when he came in it stood in the same place, with toast in it; I drank some of the tea that was in the bowl; he took the bowl and tasted the tea; said it was not sweet enough; she said she did not want any more sugar in it as it made her thirsty; he then asked her if she wanted anything; she said no; I told him a little port wine would strengthen her; he said yes, go and get some; I did so, and returned in about ten minutes, when he was sitting on the bedside with my baby on his lap; I gave her a little of the wine in a tumbler ; she did not wish it, but he insisted, and she drank about a tea-spoonful of it; when I came in the toast was broken, and stirred in with the tea, and the spoon was in the middle of the bowl; when I left the toast was whole, and the bowl was nearly full; he took the bowl after I had put the wine away, and asked if there was any sugar; Mrs. Williams replied there was plenty; I got the sugar jar and held it up; he shook the spoon before he put it into the sugar; he took one spoonful and mixed it with the tea and toast; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>then said he would feed her with that, as she had often fed him; she then laid on her back on the bed; he gave her one spoonful and told her to sit up; she sat up, and he gave her a few spoonsful more; she said, Andrew, dear, I cannot take any more; he said she must take it, as it would strengthen her a good deal, and if she would he would give her a splendid dress and a new hat; she then put her hand round his neck and kissed him; she had drank nearly all the tea, and then said to me, Mrs. Campbell, you ought to examine your sugar ; I asked her what was the .matter with it, and she said it was all sand; I then looked at her, and it was like the cracking of salt under her teeth, and he was scraping the bowl, and giving 'her what was left of it; she took it all; he gave her all; he then set the bowl on my trunk and came back to the bedside, and said, Mrs. Campbell, you did not take any of the wine, and he got up and poured some in the tumbler; I told him I did not care for the wine; I drank it; he then put a spoonful in the tumbler and gave it to his wife; he was then going to leave, and she said on Friday she would be able to go after money; he said she would not ,\u2022 he said he would call on Friday to see how she was, and if she was not able to go he would bring the money himself; as he was leaving he said he would get the money, and leave it with her; he then kissed his wife, and shook hands with her; I then lit him down stairs; when I returned she was vomiting; she told me her whole body was all in a flame, and that her two ears were burning; she said she should not live till five o\u2019clock in the morning; she died about three o\u2019clock, Thursday morning; I was with her when she died, with the exception of a few minutes ; from the time I lighted him down stairs, her condition was most awful, vomiting and drinking water; she was conscious to the time of her death; I went to Mrs. Lambert to come in about an hour before her death, for I was frightened at being left there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Cross-examined. </em>The bowl out of which she had been fed was on the trunk when she died ; I cannot say how long it remained there; there were half a dozen people in the room from breakfast time until she died; I took hold of the bowl to look at it and set it down again; I handed the police-, the bowl about ten minutes after she died; I prepared the tea for her about half-past five o\u2019clock on Wednesday afternoon ; I got the water to make the tea from Mr. Hart\u2019s store; I got it in a wooden pail; I boiled it in a tin vessel which belonged to me; I do not know how many bowls full it would hold; I got the tea from Mr.Cashen\u2019s,- at the opposite corner; deceased bought the tea on the Saturday previous; we used to use each other\u2019s provisions occasionally; when she purchased- the tea I had none in my room ; I did not purchase any between Saturday and Wednesday; the tea was kept in a glass bottle which I got in-Hart\u2019s store; I placed it in my trunk; it was not locked then; when the tea was ready I went to the trunk and got a bowl $ the bowl was near her bed during the day; I poured out one bowl of the tea for her and*two for myself, and sweetened them of the same sugar,; she had a slice of toast which I prepared, and she broke it in two and put half in the tea; she took two or three swallows of tea before he came in; she retained the tea on her stomach; I proposed to go* out and get some port wine, as it would do her good, and he asked me to go for it; I got the wine in a small black bottle; I got the tumbler from which she drank the wine from outside of my trunk; the tea might have been on the stove an hour before I went for the wine;. I had not touched it during that time; the spoon was. in the bowl, resting against the side; when-I came back, I noticed that the bread was mixed up in the bowl; I made such a statement before the coroner; when I came in, the spoon was standing in the centre of the bowl, upright; the prisoner came four times to see his wife during her illness; once on Sunday, twice on Monday, and once on Wednesday; he came the first time on Monday, before Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Bishop came, and the next time after; the first time he remained but a short time; he came the second time at about eight o\u2019clock in the evening; when he came the first time he said he had left the money at the hall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\"><em>David Uhl, M. D., </em>testified: I am a physician ; I made a <em>post mortem </em>examination of the body of Bose Williams; Coroner Wilhelm\u2019s deputy, Dr. Bichardson, assisted me; I did so on fifth of May, at 58 Duane-street, between eleven and twelve o\u2019clock; I found the woman lying in her bed; her limbs were rigid and contracted; she had purple spots around the mouth and on other parts of her face; there was a slight bruise on the left leg, below the knee, and no other violence on the body ; on opening the chest, from the neck down, I found the lungs congested; the heart was healthy, but filled with clotted blood; I then tied both ends of the stomach and laid it on a clean rag on the floor; I then examined the intestines, and laid a portion of them by the stomach; I then took out the liver; I took the contents of the stomach and emptied them into two pint bottles, and sealed them up ; the fluid I emptied into them contained a large quantity of white powder which was in large cakes; the mucous membrane was inflamed; I put the stomach and liver, in a cloth, and sewed up the body; I then went to the coroner and labeled the bottles; the stomach also contained a large quantity of this white powder. I then took the stomach, bottles and liver to Dr. McCready; he was not in, and I waited until he came in, and I delivered them over to him personally, in the same state in which they were when I took them from the body; the coroner gave me the bowl, which I did not take up to McCready\u2019s at that time, because I could not carry it; I locked it up, and took it to him in the evening; I received the bowl at the coroner\u2019s office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\"><em>Question. </em>In what condition was it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">This question was objected to by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, and the objection overruled and an exception taken.

McCready </em>testified: I am a physician; have been a graduate twenty years; have lectured on toxicology; Dr. Uhl requested me to analyze a human stomach, with two bottles with contents labeled and sealed; on fifth May he brought me the bowl and a spoon; from examination of the contents of the body, no doubt arsenic was in the stomach; from its contents four drachms of arsenic were produced; fifteen or twenty grains would produce death; on taking arsenic, the patient feels as though the abdomen was on fire, and vomiting is incessant; the patient complains of its grittiness when swallowed; I would attribute but little importance to blue spots on the body after death; I made a separate analysis of the contents of the bowl and spoon together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel objected to proving the analysis of the contents of the bowl, but the objection was overruled and an exception taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">The bowl and the spoon were nearly clean and there was no dry powder upon them, but a dirty substance was scraped from them, and, the proper analysis having been made, arsenic was discovered; about two or three grains of matter were taken from the bowl and the spoon, and nearly all of that was arsenic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\"><em>The Coroner </em>testified: That he held an inquest on deceased on Friday, fifth May, between ten and eleven o\u2019clock; that he received the bowl in question from Lieutenant Bingham, of the sixth ward station-house, about twelve o\u2019clock; that when he received it it was not clean, but there was a whitish stuff adhering to the sides and at the bottom; that he took the bowl with him to the office and gave it to Dr. Uhl, the physician, to make the analysis, and that it did not go out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of Ms (the coroner\u2019s) hands till he delivered it to Dr. Uhl, and that, when given to the doctor, it was in the same state as when he received it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>James Lanagan </em>identified the bowl and testified that he received it from Mrs. Campbell, at the house where deceased died, and took it to the station-house and delivered it to Lieut. Bingham; that there was a substance around the side and bottom of the bowl.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>Alonzo Bingham </em>testified: That he received the bowl from Lanagan; that he noticed some substance in it that looked like gruel; that he set it on a book-case, about eight feet high, in the front office; that he took it from the same place two days afterwards, when he delivered it to the coroner, and that it was .then apparently in the same state as when he placed it there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">On <em>cross-examination, </em>he said he was not in the office the whole time the bowl was there, and that forty policemen might have been in the room during the forty-eight hours it was there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">A jar of brown sugar was produced on the trial, which was identified as belonging to Mrs. Campbell, and being the one referred to by her, and which it was proved had been taken from her and delivered to the coroner at the inquest, and had been kept by the coroner till produced on the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\"><em>George Kellogg, Jr., </em>testified: I am the agent for the governors of the alms-houseI know the deceased and the prisoner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\"><em>Question. </em>Do you know of any complaint having been made by the deceased against her husband ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-11\">Counsel for the prisoner objected, as the recognizance was not produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-12\">Mr. Kellogg produced the recogmzance, dated June 7th, 1853.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-13\">Counsel for prisoner objected to its reading.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-14\"><em>Examination resumed. </em>Payments indorsed on the back of the recognizance have been paid by the prisoner to me up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>to the second of May; I am sure it was on the second of May (Tuesday), at the time of making that payment to me, he stated he thought his wife would not be able to come for the money, and that he would call and take it to her; I asked him \u201c why ? \u201d he said she was sick; I told him we could pay it to no other person but her; he then left; the last payment was ten dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>We generally require a month\u2019s payment in advance; we paid her by weekly installments of two dollars a week; we generally paid on Friday; sometimes she would come for the money and I refused to give it to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">The district attorney then proposed to put the recognizance in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">The counsel for the prisoner objected to the recognizance being put in evidence, or read to the jury, on the ground that the magistrate had not been produced to prove that it was subscribed and taken before him, and that there was not even proof of the signature purporting to be that of the magistrate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">The court overruled the objection of the counsel for the prisoner, received the recognizance in evidence and permitted it to be read to the jury. To which said decision, of the court the counsel for the prisoner excepted. The recognizance was in words'and figures following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">\n<em>City, and County of New-York, ss:</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\"

Anything which Mrs. Williams said to the witness Campbell, relative to the pain she was suffering and the particular nature of her complaint, was admissible; but that portion of her conversation which related to her alleged visit to her husband, and to what occurred during that visit, could only have been received on the ground that she made those statements under the ' apprehension of death. To warrant this, she must have been conscious of danger, and must have abandoned all hope of recovery, indicating a condition which the law supposes calculated to impress on the mind an obligation equal to that imposed by an oath administered in a court of justice. It is, indeed, the province of the judge, and not of the jury, to determine whether the circumstances under which the declarations were made are sufficient. But there must be some proof that the deceased was conscious of approaching and inevitable death. It is not necessary that this should be uttered in express terms; but it may be inferred from the tenor of his conversation, the nature of his sufferings, and his whole demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In the present case nothing sufficiently definite was presented to the judge to direct his attention to the subject; the witness was not asked a single question on this point; indeed it is probable, at the time when she made the declarations in question, she had no thought that her life was in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the court erred in admitting those declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">A new trial should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b104-8\">Mitchell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYM\">I concur; and am also of opinion that the recognizance was not sufficiently proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The cause was then brought into the Court of Appeals by a writ of error issued on behalf of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>A. Oakey Hall </em>(District Attorney), for the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I. The Court of Oyer and Terminer were correct in admitting the declarations of the deceased, excepted to, and the court correctly charged the jury upon them. First. There were declarations made by her when leaving to visit her husband. Second. There were those made in presence of her husband. Third. There were some made <em>in extremis. </em>Fourth. There were: others regarding feelings of and symptoms of bodily condition. The declarations embraced by third and fourth subdivisions are so clearly admissible, it will not become necessary to discuss them. There were two classes of facts, embraced by the prosecution, unto which these declarations related: First. Showing that deceased died from poison; Second. Showing that prisoner poisoned her. It is respectfully insisted that the general term mistook the extent and effect of the testimony thus excepted to. The evidence concerning the \u201cgoing\u201d of the deceased was pertinent, to show her then healthy state, her frame of mind, her disposition toward her husband, and particularly herein rebutting the idea of suicide by the deceased. The delaration, answering question excepted to, viz.: \u201cState where deceased said she was going on the Saturday evening previous to her death,\u201d accompanied an act. It was (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 109, 123) \u201ca verbal act, indicating present purpose and intention.\u201d It was a declaration, part of, and accompanied by, and explanatory of an act. (1 <em>Phil. on Ev., </em>204.) There was a declaration, \u201c She said she got sick on board the vessel,on which her husband was; she said she had not been drinking,\u201d' &amp;c. There was no exception taken to this upon the trial, but the court, at general term, \u25a0 criticise it in the opinion. No exception was taken, for the very obvious reason that, when the prisoner came to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the deceased, after her return, from \u201csomewhere,\u201d the conversation and remark between the two showed that she had been with him, in accordance with her intention expressed at starting. And the declaration as to her being taken sick from drinking, &amp;c., &amp;c., was also remarked upon by prisoner. Now, it is insisted that, even if the \u201c verbal act,\u201d or her declaration of whereabouts, were inadmissible, the fact which they went to prove (presence with husband on the vessel and sickness.there) was evidenced by the husband\u2019s admissions and remarks on the subject. The defect, if defect, was cured. Then the judge charged \u201cthat the jury might <em>infer </em>that the deceased was with her husband on the Saturday night preceding her death, <em>although the evidence on that \u2022point is very </em>slight.\u201d The expressions of symptoms were competent testimony (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 102; 1 <em>Phil. Ev., </em>190; <em>Aveson </em>v. <em>Kinniard, </em>6 <em>East, </em>189), relevant to show the first fact averred in the indictment, \u201c death by poison-, ing.\u201d It. was said below that the symptoms could not charge the prisoner. The suggestion is made that the general term mistook the effect and extent of this testimony respecting symptoms, because the evidence of the poisoning whereof she died was upon an occurrence unaffected by the declarations as to departure and symptoms; indeed, upon an occurrence subsequent to the time of their being made. Saturday, in the evening, she leaves to visit her husband. Sunday, in the morning, she returns; prisoner comes to see her. Monday, in the afternoon, prisoner calls again and leaves; returns in the evening and stays all night until Tuesday, to five in the morning, and goes away. Wednesday, in the afternoon, he came again, and then sedulously fed her from the bowl whose contents showed presence of arsenic, &amp;c. Thursday, near daybreak, she died. Had the prisoner been, how could he be, affected by the alleged declarations ? The evidence came in as part of the <em>res gestae </em>in a chronological chain of testimony from the time she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ceased to be in good health until she died. But the poisoning itself is upon evidence entirely unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">II. The Court of Oyer and Terminer correctly admitted the testimony concerning the bowl and its contents. 1. It was competent for the jury. The jurors could give to it what regard they chose. The bowl was traced for identity in the same manner in which any fact of the same nature is traced by lines of evidence. 2. The bowl was traced from the prisoner most directly. The prisoner placed it upon a trunk, from whence Mrs. Campbell, the witness, took it; she gave it to officer Lanagan; officer Lanagan to Lieut. Bingham; Lieut. Bingham to the coroner; coroner to Dr. Uhl, and to Dr. McCready, and the two make an analysis. There was arsenic found in the bowl. The jury found that this bowl was the same bowl which the prisoner used when feeding his wife. Their finding is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">III. The court properly allowed the introduction of the recognizance. It was pertinent to show a motive for the crime. 1. It was a recognizance, and not a bond. <em>(Laws of </em>1833, 11, \u00a7 7 ; 2 <em>R. S., </em>920, \u00a7 31, <em>4th </em>ed.; <em>id., </em>53, 54; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>540, 543.) 2. It was a record, and proved itself. <em>(Id.) </em>3. It was authorized by statute, and taken and acknowledged before an officer thereunto authorized. <em>(Id.) </em>4. It came from the custody of those entitled to sue upon it by statute. 5. But the court will see, from the manner of the production of the recognizance, that it came not only as if proving itself, but in connection with the testimony of George Kellogg, Jr., Alms-house superintendent, exactly as if it were a private admission of the prisoner, and upon which he had acted. 6. The recitals proved nothing more than the evidence of Mr. Kellogg, showed to be the fact. 7. This being the case, how has the prisoner been, or rather how could he have been, prejudiced?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\"><em>Henry L. Clinton, </em>for the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>I. The court erred in admitting in evidence the declarations of the deceased, as stated by Mary Campbell. This answer was elicited by the district attorney asking the witness to state \u201cwhere the deceased\"said she was going on the Saturday evening previous to her death,\u201d and taken under defendant\u2019s objection and exception. The court also erred in charging \u201cthat the jury might infer that the deceased was with her husband on the Saturday night preceding her death.\u201d \u25a0 This inference -rested solely-on these declarations of the deceased, made in the absence of the prisoner. The testimony was mere hearsay, and was clearly inadmissible. In the case of <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>The State </em>(9 Yerger, 383), it was held that evidence that the deceased, while on- his way to the place where he was found murdered, and the day before he was supposed to be killed, had stated that he was:going to that place, and that the defendant was going with him, was incompetent. In <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>The State </em>(2 <em>Halst., </em>220), it was held that conversation of the deceased with a third person, or acts of the deceased which never came to the knowlege of .the prisoner, cannot be received in evidence. The principle of these cases is too clear and well established to require a citation of further authorities. There was no pretence on the trial that these statements of the deceased were dying declarations, and if they had been ofFered as such they would have been clearly inadmissible; because they were not made <em>in articula mortis, </em>or under the consciousness of impending dissolution.' On the contrary, the deceased, during the time these declarations were made, and afterwards until a few hours before her death, indulged the -hope of recovery. When her husband left her on Wednesday evening, she stated that \u201con Friday she would bel able to go after her money.\u201d <em>(Rose. Cr. Ev., </em>27, 33; 1 <em>Phil. Ev., 285, 9th ed.; 2 Russ. on Cr., </em>752-4, <em>6th Am. ed.)' </em>The declarations formed no part of the <em>res gestee. </em>The most important declaration of the deceased was: \u201c She did not return until five o\u2019clock the next morning1; wlien she <em>came-she said she </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>got sick on board the vessel on which her husband was.\" </em>This, if true, was a narrative of a past occurrence. In 1 <em>Green-leaf's Evidence {% </em>110), the author, in speaking of what constitutes <em>res gestae, </em>says: \u201cIt is to be observed that where declarations offered in evidence are merely <em>narrative of a pasi occurrence, </em>they cannot be received as proof of the existence of such an occurrence. They must be <em>concomitant </em>with the principal- act, and so connected with it as to be regarded as the mere result and consequence of the co-existing motives, in order to form a proper criterion for directing the judgment which is to be formed upon the whole conduct.\u201d The declarations of deceased as to her symptoms were not evidence to charge the deceased, nor were her declarations any evidence of the truth of what she declared. <em>(See opinion of Justice Cl erke.) </em>The point as to the admissibility and effect of these declarations, and particularly as to the declaration of deceased that \u201cshe got .sick on board the vessel on which her husband was,\u201d is distinctly raised: First. By the decision of the court allowing the declarations to be given in evidence.. Exception was taken to the decision of the court below, in allowing the particular answer of the witness embracing these declarations to be regarded as evidence; Second. The point is distinctly raised in the exception to the charge of the court, \u201cthat the jury might infer that the deceased was with her husband on the Saturday night preceding her death,\u201d there being no evidence of the fact other than these declarations; Third. Now the statute provides that, on \u201cevery conviction for a capital offence,\u201d &amp;c., the court may consider any question of law arising in the cause, whether exception was taken or not. The prisoner suffered material prejudice in the introduction of these declarations; they formed the material links in the chain of evidence which resulted in his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00cdI. The testimony of Dr. Uhl as to the condition and contents of the bowl, taken under exceptions, and the analysis of the contents of the bowl by Prof. McCready, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>taken under exceptions, were improperly admitted because they were not sufficiently identified; and the court erred in refusing to charge as requested on that subject. Even in the case of larceny or counterfeiting, the identity of the stolen property or counterfeiting must be proved. (1 <em>Russ. on Cr., </em>125; <em>Rose. Cr. Ev., 632.) A </em>double reason exists for proving the identity of the poison in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">III. The court erred in receiving in evidence the recognizance without due proof of its execution. This instrument was introduced, not as a record, but as a private writing. There was .no legal proof of the acknowledgment of this paper, or of its having been filed as a recognizance or bond. The certificate of proof or acknowledgment being in these words, \u201cTaken and acknowledged before me the day and year first above written,\u201d and purporting to be signed by \u201c A. Bogart, Jr., Police Justice,\u201d does not entitle the instrument to be read in evidence without further proof thereof, because it does not certify that the individual was known to the officer, or identified by satisfactory proof, and because the officer was not authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real estate, and his signature was not proven. (1 <em>R. S., </em>758, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 15, 16; 2 <em>id., </em>42, 43, <em>3d ed.) </em>Police justices are not named among the officers referred to <em>(1 R. S., </em>758, \u00a7 16) as having authority to take proof or acknowledgment of conveyances of real estate. The courts of this state are strict and uniform in requiring a substantial compliance with these statutory provisions, and in no case have they dispensed with the certificate of an officer having jurisdiction or authority to take the acknowledgment, and in requiring him to state that he knew or had satisfactory evidence that the person making such acknowledgment was the individual described in and who executed such conveyance. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>1 <em>John., </em>498; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Gumaer, </em>2 <em>Cow., </em>552; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Vickory, </em>1 <em>Wend., </em>412; <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Covenhoven, </em>4 <em>id., </em>563; <em>Broadstreet </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>12 <em>id., </em>673; <em>Dibble </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>13 <em>id., </em>541; <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>24 <em>id., </em>87; <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Horsen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u25a0<em>2 Bari. Ch. R., </em>232; <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>10 <em>Paige Ch. R., </em>183; \u2022 <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Shepherd, 2 John., </em>79.) The court also erred in receiving the recognizance in evidence, because it tended to show the prisoner guilty of the offence of being \u201ca disorderly person,\u201d and his character could not be attacked in that way. (2 <em>Russ, on Cr., </em>784; <em>Russ. Cr. Ev., </em>97; <em>Arch., Cr. Pr., </em>111.)</p>\n<author id=\"b111-5\">Denio, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQd\">The evidence to show that the deceased came to her death from the effects of arsenic taken into her stomach was quite satisfactory; and there was strong reason to believe that she swallowed a portion of this poison during her absence from the house in Duane-street, between Saturday evening and Sunday morning. If, during that absence, she was in the. company of the prisoner, the latter had an opportunity to administer it to her in food or drink. His subsequent conduct was such as to attach suspicion to him, and to lead to the belief, more or less strong, that if she was poisoned during that absence he was guilty of the act, provided it was made to appear that he had an opportunity of committing it. Hence it was an important fact for the prosecution to establish that these persons met together while the deceased was abroad on Saturday night. It was competent to show this by the evidence of persons who saw them in each other\u2019s company; or it might have been proved by the prisoner\u2019s confessions. There was some evidence of the latter character; for the prisoner was proved to have asserted that the deceased did not indulge in drinking while she was from home, at the time referred to, a fact which he could scarcely have known except by having been with her. Although the inference from this declaration was pretty strong, and might have enabled the jury to find the fact, it was not of such a conclusive character as to preclude other testimony upon the point, and the prosecution sought to furnish such othe.r evidence by proving the declaration of the deceased, of her intention to go to her husband, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>she set out from home on Saturday evening. . The question to be determined is whether that declaration was competent to be given in' evidence. The evidence of the witness Mary Campbell, of what the .deceased said, after her return, as to her having been with her husband, was not objected to. It was, however, clearly incompetent. It was not admissible as a dying declaration; for, although the' deceased returned very ill, there is no evidence, nor any reason for\" believing, that she then apprehended a fatal result. The circumstance that it was received without objection, and that it tended even more strongly to show the existence of the material fact sought to be proved than the declaration which was objected against, does not relieve us from the duty of examining the validity of that \"objection^ The jury may have disregarded the incompetent declarations made by the deceased after her return and have relied upon the proof of her declared design on setting out, which the court had held to be competent; or the ruling of the court, admitting her declaration last mentioned to be received, may have led them to the belief that all her declarations which were proved\" were competent. We must therefore determine whether the decision of the court below, admitting proof of the statement that she was going to see her husband, when she left the house on \u2022 Saturday night, was correct or not. - It was attempted, on the argument, to be sustained as a declaration characterizing an act, and constituting, in legal understanding, part of the act itself. This is a recognized exception to the rule excluding hearsay as evidence; for when it is necessary, in the course of a cause, to inquire into the nature of a particular act, or the intention of the person who did the act, proof of what the person said ' at the time of doing it is admissible in evidence for the purpose of showing its true character. (1 <em>Phil. Ev., </em>231, <em>Gould's ed.) </em>But to render the declaration competent, the act with which it is connected should be pertinent to the issue; for where the act is in its-own nature irrelevant, and when the declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tian is <em>per se </em>incompetent, the union of the two will not render the declaration admissible. <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>7 <em>Adolph. &amp; Ellis, </em>289.) The material fact here was, that the prisoner and the deceased were together on Saturday night. Even this was not a principal fact, but only a circumstance to show that the prisoner had an opportunity to. commit the offence. That the deceased left the house in Duane-street at a particular time was of no materiality, unless it was also shown that during her absence she met the defendant. The act itself was indifferent to the issue, whatever the intention was with which it was done. If the deceased met the prisoner, and thus afforded an opportunity of committing the offence, it is immaterial whether she intended or expected thus to meet him or not; and so, of course, if she failed to meet him he could not properly be prejudiced by the circumstance that she went out with a design to go to him. The evidence was not offered to qualify an act connected with the issue, but to induce the jury to infer another act not otherwise shown to exist: that of his being in company with the deceased. Suppose a declaration had been made by the deceased, on the previous day, of an intention to go to her husband on that particular evening: such declaration being unaccompanied by any act would' rest wholly in assertion, and would be clearly without the rule referred to; yet the proof would be essentially of the same character, and subject to.no greater objections than the evidence we are considering. I am of opinion, therefore, that the case was not within the rule admitting a declaration accompanying an act, on the ground of its being a part of the <em>res gestee; </em>and I know of no other ground upon which the case can be taken out of the general rule which excludes, under the name of hearsay, declarations not made under the responsibility of an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Enough has been said to show that the judgment of the Supreme Court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Upon a second trial the question will again arise as to the admissibility of the evidence showing that arsenic was found in the bowl which was examined by the chemist. We have looked carefully into the evidence of identity, and are of opinion that it was sufficient to authorize the court to submit the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The judgment of the Supreme Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b114-6\">Hand, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3r\">The proof of what the deceased said when she was leaving the house of Mrs. Campbell was not admissible. It was no part of the <em>res gestee, </em>for it was no part of the principal transaction, nor cotemporaneous, or even incidental to it. It was spoken at a time previous to any part of the transaction constituting the supposed offence, and in the absence of the prisoner, and when the deceased had no apprehension of danger, and much less <em>in extremis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">I see no objection to the testimony in relation to the bowl or its contents. Whether the evidence was sufficient to identify the former, or show what constituted the latter, were questions for the jury, and the proof given on these points was competent for their consideration. No one portion of it, or that given by one witness, might have been sufficient; but all of it together might be, and the prosecution was not obliged to give conclusive' proof at every step.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">It was also competent for the prosecution to prove that the prisoner had made payments upon the paper produced in court. That was a mere circumstance, and the production of the paper and such proof did not contravene any rule of evidence in relation to the proof of written instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">But the recognizance itself was given in evidence without any proof of its execution, except what appeared upon the face of the instrument, and the testimony of an agent of the governors of the alms-house that the prisoner had made payments upon it. \"I am inclined to the opinion this was not sufficient. A recognizance is said to be a matter of record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>(1 <em>Chit. Cr. L., </em>90; <em>The People </em>v. Kane, 4 <em>Denio, </em>530.) But this was taken before a police justice in the city of New-York, under the statute in relation to disorderly persons, and is but an acknowledgment, upon which, perhaps, a record might be made up. It does not appear to have been filed with any officer, and there was no proof of its execution nor of the identity of the persons recognized, except by the payments. Using one\u2019s own affidavit in a cause may sometimes be sufficient evidence of identity as against the party making it; but, as a general rule, even an affidavit cannot be given in evidence, at least before it is filed with the proper officer, without some proof. (1 <em>Chit. Cr. L., </em>576; 1 <em>Phil. Ev., </em>379; <em>Bellinger </em>v. <em>The People, </em>8 <em>Wend., </em>598; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 <em>Stra., </em>126; 2 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill, </em>1100.) This recognizance must have been introduced for the purpose of showing an inducement to commit the crime, or that difficulties had existed between the husband and wife. It purported to have been signed by the prisoner and another, and to have been taken before an officer; but it would be dangerous, especially in a capital case, to admit such a document without any proof whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">However, it is not necessary to pursue this point further, as the admission of evidence of what the deceased said before the commission of the supposed offence clearly entitled the prisoner to a new trial, and the Supreme Court was therefore right in reversing the judgment on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The j udgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The other judges concurring,</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The judgment of the Supreme Court, reversing that of the Oyer and Terminer and ordering a new trial, was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
