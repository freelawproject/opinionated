And in answer to an inquiry made by the defendant\u2019s counsel, he stated that he did not expect or propose to prove by any direct evidence that the infant daughter was dead or had been murdered, or that her dead body had ever been found or seen by any one ; but that from the lapse of time since the child and her mother, the defendant\u2019s wife, had been last seen on the 23d day of June, 1845, and from the other facts and circumstances he had stated in the opening, he should ask the jury to infer and presume and find that the infant daughter was dead, and that she was murdered by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">Hereupon the counsel for the defendant moved and insisted that the court should arrest the further progress of the trial for the want of proof of the <em>corpus delicti ; </em>that the rule laid down by Lord Hale, that \u201cno person should be convicted of murder or manslaughter unless the fact were proved to be done, or at least the body found dead,\u201d is the rule universally acted upon by our courts, and should never be departed from.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-7\">The presiding justice decided that the most judicious disposition of the question now raised was to reserve it until the close of the evidence, that he might see what would be proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The counsel for the defence then called and had sworn, <em>Ephraim, Schutt, </em>who testified as follows: I live in the town of Dryden; I lived there in 1843 and 1845 ; I had a sister by the name of Harriet, who was afterwards Mrs. Rulloff; my father\u2019s family lived in that town; first knew the defendant in May, 1842; he said he came from New Brunswick; said he was a German; spent part of the summer there ; he was engaged on the canal at the time; the next winter he taught school; my sisters Jane and Harriet attended his school; the summer following he studied medicine, and after-wards practiced it; he married my sister Harriet the last day of December, 1843 ; that marriage was not much opposed by the family; the first winter they spent mostly at my father\u2019s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-5\">Did they live happily together ?

But the court declined, and refused so to advise, instruct and direct the jury; to which refusal the counsel for the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">The cause was then summed up to the jury by the counsel for the respective parties, and the presiding justice charged the jury as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\"><em>Gentlemen: </em>The prisoner at the bar, Edward H. Rulloff, was indicted in the Tompkins County Oyer and Terminer for the murder of his infant daughter, about three months old. The indictment was carried into the Supreme Court by <em>certiorari, </em>and the cause came down to the Tompkins Circuit in August last for trial. The court, being unable to obtain a jury in that county, ordered the trial to be had in this county, and hence in the discharge of my duty, as judge presiding in this circuit, the duty of presiding on this trial has unexpectedly fallen upon me; and the same act which has devolved this highly responsible duty upon me, has also cast upon you the great responsibility of determining this traverse between the government and the prisoner at the bar. The charge against the prisoner is no less than the murder of his own infant daughter of two or three months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of age. Murder, under our statute, is defined to be the unlawful killing of a human being. First. When such killing is perpetrated from a premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any human being. Second. When perpetrated by an act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual. Thirdly. When perpetrated without any design to effect death by a person engaged in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">You should not forget, gentlemen of the jury, that we commence this trial with the presumptions all in favor of the prisoner. The law, in its clemency, presumes the entire innocence of the prisoner, and the government, before they have a right to ask the conviction of the prisoner, are bound not only to prove the alleged murder, but are required also to adduce evidence to establish the guilt of the prisoner beyond any reasonable doubt. In order to maintain their case, the government are called upon to prove, first, that a murder has been committed ; and secondly, that the prisoner at the bar is the person who committed such murder. The first branch of the case, the <em>corpus delicti, </em>as it is termed in the law, by which is meant the body of the crime, the fact that a murder has been committed must be clearly and conclusively proved by the government. The <em>corpus delicti </em>is made up of two things: first, of certain facts forming the basis of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>by which is meant the fact that a human being has been killed ; and secondly, the existence of criminal and human agency as the cause of the death. Upon this first branch of the case the counsel for the prisoner claims and insists that it can only be proved by direct and positive evidence; that the government must prove the fact of death by witnesses who saw the killing, or at least the dead body must be found. It has been said by some judges that a conviction for murder ought never to be permitted unless the killing was positively sworn to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the dead body was found and identified. This, as a general proposition, is undoubtedly correct, but like other general rules has its exceptions. It may sometimes happen that the dead body cannot be produced, although the proof of death is clear and satisfactory. A strong case in illustration is that of a murder at sea, where the body is thrown overboard in a dark and stormy night, at a great distance from land or any vessel. Although the body cannot be found, nobody can doubt that the author of such crime is guilty of murder. In such a case, the law permits the jury to infer that death has ensued from the facts proved. The circumstances being such as to exclude the least, if not almost every, probability that such person could have escaped with life, and yet there is a bare possibility in such a case that the person may have escaped with life. I am of opinion that the rule, as understood in this country, does not require the fact of death to be proved by positive and direct evidence, in cases where the discovery of the body after the crime is impossible. In such cases the fact may be established by circumstances, where the evidence is so strong and intense as to produce the full certainty of death. By the proof of a fact by presumptive evidence, we are to understand the proof of facts and circumstances from which the existence of such fact may be justly inferred. The facts and circumstances to establish the death in the case of murder, in the absence of any positive evidence, must be so strong and intense as to produce the full certainty of death, or, as Mr. Wills, in his <em>Treatise on Circumstantial Evidence </em>(p. 162; <em>Burr. Cir. Ev., </em>680), says, the death may be inferred from such strong and unequivocal circumstances as render it morally certain and leave no ground for reasonable doubt. The government claim that they have proved the body of the crime in the case under consideration up to the strictest requirements of this rule. This is for you to determine, gentlemen of the jury. The determination of it involves the examination of all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>I am very much relieved from calling your attention to these facts and circumstances by the very full and able argument of the counsel for the prisoner and the people, who have rendered you very great aid in your duties, and have relieved the court in the performance of its duty by their comments upon the evidence of the case. This question is to be determined by you, gentlemen of the jury, in view of all the evidence reflecting in the least degree upon this branch of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">The government places great reliance, to establish the death in this case, upon the sudden disappearance of this woman and child under the circumstances of this case, without any apparent cause, and the failure to find either the mother or child after the most diligent search for eleven long years. The fact is very proper to be taken into account in determining this question, and is a fact of no little importance in determining the question; but, although this unaccountable disappearance and failure to ascertain any trace of them may lead to a strong suspicion that those parties have come to an untimely end, yet they are not alone sufficient proof of the death of this child and mother to justify a conviction, because the fact may be accounted for on the hypothesis (however improbable) that they may have absconded and eluded all inquiry, or may be kidnapped and concealed and be still alive, and upon this branch of this case it is your duty to take into consideration the fact, which seems to be admitted on this trial, that the prisoner at the bar was convicted in the year 1846 of having abducted his wife alive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">' The government rely on the confessions of the prisoner made to and proved by Mr. Swift, to prove the death of this child; Swift proves the prisoner in Chicago, on the 4th of August, 1845, and he says that he told him he had lost his wife and child about six weeks before. He stated that they died south of Chicago, in Illinois, about six weeks before. It is for you to say, gentlemen of the jury, what construction should be put upon this language. You are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>by the law to take this confession all together, as well that which makes for the prisoner as that which makes against him. The law, however, does not compel you to adopt the whole confession, if you find that the other evidence in the case proves any part of the confession to be untrue. I should say to you, however, that confessions are a doubtful species of evidence, and are to be received with great caution by both courts and jurors; and the law requires me to say to you that no man can be convicted of a criminal offence upon his own confession alone that a crime has been committed. 'Confessions are competent evidence in the case, but alone ar\u00e9 not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">You have listened to the detail of the evidence adduced by government from the evening of the 23d of June, 1845, when the prisoner at the bar is proved to have been in his 'own house with his wife and infant child, up to the time when be is arrested in the city of Cleveland and brought back by Ephraim Schutt, and lodged in the Tompkins county jail, and all of these facts and circumstances have just been so ably and elaborately commented upon by both the counsel for the prisoner and the people, and the legitimate deductions to be drawn therefrom have been so fully presented to your consideration, that I am relieved from the duty of going over the evidence. It is proper, however, that I should state to you the rule which should govern you in the ultimate conclusion to be attained from the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">In regard to the first branch of the case, the establishment of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>the body of the crime, before you find it against the prisoner, you must be satisfied, from the evidence in the case, that it. is established by presumptive evidence of the most cogent and irresistible kind; that it is established by circumstances proved so strong and intense as to produce the full certainty of death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-7\">In regard to the second branch of the case, by which we mean the traverse between the government and the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>as to the question of the defendant\u2019s guilty agency in the commission of the alleged murder, as to this question of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime imputed, the rule which should govern is this : The government are required, before they can claim a conviction, to prove, by their evidence, the guilt of the prisoner beyond any rational doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">If, upon a full and fair consideration of all the evidence in the case, doubts remain in the minds of the jury, it is the duty of the jury to acquit. Upon this branch of the case the doubts, however, which require an acquittal should be rational doubts. They are not doubts which may arise in a speculative mind, after the reason and judgment are thoroughly convinced by the evidence in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">To so much and said parts of said charge and instructions given to the jury as submit to them to infer, presume and find, without direct proof, the death and the murder of the infant daughter, the counsel for the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">The defendant, having made a bill of exceptions, moved for a new trial, and the cause came on to argument before the Supreme Court at general term in the sixth, judicial district.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-9\"><em>Joshua A. Spencer, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-10\">I. The counsel for the prosecution, in opening the cause to the jury, distinctly admitted that he did not expect or propose to prove, by any direct evidence, that the infant daughter of the prisoner was dead. or had been murdered, or that her dead body had ever been found or seen by any one. Upon this admission the court should have stopped the prosecution. \u201cIn these cases of homicide, the precaution of Lord Hale seems to be enough for laying the foundation of circumstantial evidence : \u2018 I would never convict any person of murder or manslaughter, unless the fact be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>proved to be done, or at least the body found dead.\u2019 (2 <em>Hale P. C., </em>290.) A departure from this important suggestion, which is now universally acted upon, was a capital error in <em>Miles\u2019 case (cited supra, from Phil, opp.) </em>The body being afterward found, it plainly appeared that the death was accidental. In the two illustrative cases cited by Hale, one of the persons supposed to have been murdered was sent on a long sea voyage and the other had run away. The late remarkable case of <em>Stephen and Jesse Boorn, </em>in Vermont <em>(Boorn\u2019s case, Burr. Cir. Ev., </em>579, <em>note C), </em>was in truth of the latter character, though the prisoners actually confessed their imputed guilt.\u201d (1 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, </em>394.) In the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Burdett </em>(4 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald., </em>161; 6 <em>Com. L., </em>386), a case of libel, Chief Justice Abbott, in discussing the doctrine of presumptive evidence, says: \u201c It was said, and truly said, on the argument, that guilt and crime are never to be presumed; and the cases of supposed murder mentioned by Lord Hale, and which have since operated as a caution to all judges, were quoted on this occasion. But the cases are wholly different. In those cases there was no actual proof of the death of the person supposed to have been slain, and consequently no proof that the crime of murder had been committed. The <em>corpus delicti </em>was not established.\u201d Nor was it in <em>Boom\u2019s case, </em>though the guilt was confessed. Nor in the case at bar, for it is more barren of proof of death or murder than any case reported. No bloody weapon or blood stains or marks of violence shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">II. At the close of the evidence, with an entire failure to prove any death or murder, or the production of the dead body, the learned judge should have instructed the juiy, as requested, that they should acquit the <em>prisoner; </em>that the law did not permit a conviction for murder without proof of the <em>corpus delicti; </em>that the rule of Lord Hale is the true rule, by which courts and juries have since been governed. He erred, also, in charging the jury that without such proof they might lawfully convict the prisoner of the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>murder. In 2 <em>Starkie's Evidence, </em>944, this rule is recognized as the true rule. He says: \u201cThe proof of killing another involves the proof of the death of the person, and that it was occasioned by some act done by anotherand he cites Lord Hale\u2019s rule with approbation. In the case of <em>Webster </em>(5 <em>Cush., </em>295), if the body of Parkman had not been found and identified, and a felonious killing proved, no one would have thought of convicting Webster of his murder. It is called a case of circumstantial evidence, but the rule of Lord Hale is adhered to ; the dead body was found and identified, and its condition proved its violent death. Who was the murderer was proved by circumstantial evidence, as it always may be. In the case of <em>Wilbor </em>for the murder of Barber, tried at the Madison Oyer and Terminer, the parties were co-travellers on a canal boat, left together at Canasaraga to cross a piece of woods and join the boat at Chittenango. Wilbor joined the boat alone and said Barber had gone on to Syracuse, and claimed to take charge of his trunk. The next spring a human skeleton was found in the woods between Canasaraga and Chi'ttenango, the skull of which was broken, apparently by a stone lying near by; the clothes were identified as Barber\u2019s, by his daughters, and they had several holes through the vest and pants, as if cut by a dirk, and a wallet was found in a pocket of the clothes, which was also identified by the daughters. Wilbor was convicted and executed. Now, would any one have thought of convicting Wilbor of murder if the body of Barber had not been found and identified? The death (killing) is proved by direct evidence, and also the identity; but who was the murderer was alone proved by circumstantial evidence. The rule of evidence for which we contend is well stated by Burrill, in his <em>Treatise on Circumstantial Evidence (p. 678): </em>\u201cIn cases of alleged homicide, the proof of a <em>corpus delicti </em>involves that of the following points or general facts: First. The fact of death, particularly as shown by the discovery of the dead body or its remains; Secondly. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>identification of such body or remains as those of the person charged to have been killed; and, Thirdly. The criminal agency of another as the cause of the death. First. The fact of death. This is the basis of the <em>corpus delicti; </em>and the circumstance which furnishes the best proof of it, as well as the most effectual means of ascertaining its cause, is the finding and inspection of the dead body itself. Hence, it is a general rule of evidence that a dead body must have been discovered and seen, so that its existence and identity can be testified to by eye-witnesses. It is considered unwarrantable! and dangerous to infer the fact of the death of a person from the circumstance of his sudden and unaccountable disappearance, even when followed by long continued absence, and even although such circumstances may be connected with others apparently casting suspicion upon a particalar individual.\u201d It is true that the rule that the dead body must be found has its exceptions, as in cases of piracy, where the body is thrown overboard, or where the body is destroyed by other means; but in all these cases the other alternative of Lord Hale\u2019s rule is satisfied, \u201cthe fact, killing, is proved to be done,\u201d by direct evidence, as shown by all the cases cited to illustrate the rule. A death must be proved by direct evidence. When the death is shown, if by the dead body being found, the-question arises, by what cause? Was the death natural? Was it accidental? Was it by suicide? Was it a felonious killing by another, and by what means ? and by whom ? All these questions may be answered by circumstantial evidence. But before any of them can arise a death must be proved. If by any other evidence than the dead body, it must and will show why the dead body is not found, by what'means the killing was effe'cted, and by whom; and these facts must be established by direct evidence; and they were so established in all the reported cases, where the dead body was not found. (2 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>944.) In <em>Wharton's American Criminal Law </em>(283), is found this language: \u201c There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the <em>corpus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>delicti. </em>The fact of the commission of the offence must necessarily be the foundation of every criminal suit; and until that fact is proved, most dangerous would it be to convict.\u201d He cites Lord Hale\u2019s rule, and then adds: \u201cEqually emphatic was the language of another great judge (Lord Stowell): \u2018 To take presumptions in order to swell an equivocal and ambiguous fact into a criminal fact, would, I take it, be an entire misapplication of the doctrine of presumptions.\u2019 The death, in such a case, should be distinctly proved, either by direct evidence of the fact, or inspection of the body. The proof must be clear and distinct.\u201d In <em>Roscoe's Criminal Evidence (p. </em>13), the rule of Lord Hale is cited and approved, as also 4 <em>Blackstone's Commentaries </em>(p. 358) and <em>2 Leach </em>(p. 571). In <em>Regina, </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(8 <em>Carr. &amp; Payne, </em>591), the jury were directed by Lord Abinger to acquit the prisoner, because the body of her child was not found, nor the death otherwise proved by direct evidence. He says: \u201c With respect to the child, which really was the child of the prisoner, she cannot, by law, be called upon either to account for it or to say where it is; unless there be evidence to show that her child is actually dgad.\u201d In <em>2 Leach (p. </em>571), is found a very strong case. The mother and reputed father of a bastard child were observed to take it to the margin of the dock in Liverpool, and after stripping it to throw it into the dock. The body of the infant was not afterwards seen, but as- the tide of the sea flowed and reflowed into and out of the dock, the learned judge who tried the father and mother for the murder of their child, observed that it was possible the tide might have earned out the living infant, and the prisoners were acquitted. <em>(Ros. Cr. Ev., </em>13.) In 1 <em>Parker's Criminal Reports (p. </em>609, <em>Videtto's case), </em>Walworth, J., says: \u201c One rule, however, which never ought to be departed from, is that no one should be convicted of murder upon circumstantial evidence, unless the body of the person supposed to have been murdered has been found, or there be other clear and irresistible proof that such person is actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>dead. In <em>2 Parker's Criminal Reports (p. </em>14, <em>Porter's case of blasphemy), </em>the same judge held that the offence could not be established by evidence of the defendant\u2019s confessions made out of <em>court; </em>but that it must be proved that the crime had been committed by persons who heard it. Many other cases might be cited, but the foregoing are deemed sufficient. It is believed that modern writers have in no respect called in question the safe old rule of Lord Hale, but that, since its announcement, it has been universally approved by judges and publicists. It is therefore submitted, that his honor who tried this case fell into a fatal error, and that the verdict should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-5\"><em>Daniel S. Dickinson, </em>for the people.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">To establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>in this case, and the guilt of the prisoner, proof of two facts was necessary: First. The death of the prisoner\u2019s infant daughter; Second. That she died by his felonious act. His Honor, Justice Mason, held at the circuit that these facts, and each of them, might be established <em>by </em>circumstantial evidence, as follows: First. The first branch, \u201c by presumptive evidence of the most cogent and irresistible kind, so that it is established by circumstances proved so strong as to produce the full certainty of death.\u201d Second. The second branch, \u201c the government are required, before they can claim a conviction, to prove by their evidence the guilt of the prisoner beyond any rational doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">To these rulings the counsel for the prisoner excepted, and the only question to be discussed is whether they were correct or erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">I. The whole course of authority, ancient and modern, elementary and adjudged, shows that a murder, like any other crime, may be proved by circumstantial evidence so strong and convincing in its character as to produce full certainty.

The dictum of Lord Hale (2 <em>Hale's Pl.

The only principle upon which circumstantial evidence can be rejected as to the death, must be, to guard with greater certainty against, first, <em>mistake; </em>second, perjury. But direct evidence is subject to the same defects. The witness is liable to be mistaken in the person who commits the act, in the act committed, in the person upon whom it was committed and in the effect produced, whether it was a mere blow or a fatal stab. And if perjury is to be feared, it is more dangerous in direct than in circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">III. Identifying the body is still more liable to mistake, and direct evidence, in many cases, is more unsatisfactory than a chain of strong consistent circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">The counsel cited numerous cases where direct evidence had been relied on to identify remains, showing its uncertainty and error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b449-8\">Mason, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmO\">The only question presented by the prisoner\u2019s counsel upon the bill of exceptions in this case is, whether, upon the trial of an indictment for murder, the <em>corpus delicti </em>can be proved by any other than direct evidence. The question is one of the highest importance, and I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>examined it with the most anxious desire to arrive at a just conclusion and a correct determination of the question, and have bestowed upon it the most careful and deliberate consideration ; and the result is a firm conviction that there is nothing in the results of experience, or in the nature and character of circumstantial evidence, which forbids the <em>corpus delicti </em>being proved and- established by indirect evidence, any more than there is the guilt of the prisoner, or any other fact in the case. There is no more insecurity in the sanctions given to circumstantial evidence, as administered at the present day in the courts of England and this country, than there is in direct evidence ; and every attempt which has been made to assail circumstantial evidence from the results of experience has done no more than to prove that it necessarily partakes of the infirmities incident to all human testimony. Every consideration which has been argued against it on this ground has only tended to detract from the credibility of human testimony generally, and has shown that the infallibility of human testimony applies to circumstantial only in common with other evidence. If the annals of the judicial history of England, from the time of William the Conqueror to\" the present day, could be put into a volume, it would show more convictions of innocent persons in capital cases by direct evidence, the results of fraud and- perjury and honest mistake, than those upon circumstantial evidence alone. Thera is little doubt that if the catalogue of victims be confined to perjured witnesses alone, the result would show a greater number than can be imputed to the account of circumstantial evidence; and yet honest mistake and fallibility in direct and positive proof, would remain to claim its share.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The testimony of the senses cannot be implicitly relied on, even where the veracity of the witness is above all suspicion, and consequently, lamentable mistakes have occurred in direct and positive proof as to the identity of the prisoner. Sir Thomas Damont, an eminent-English barrister, a gentle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>man of acute mind and strong understanding, swore positively to the identity of two men whom he charged with robbing him in open day-light.\u201d But it was proved by the most conclusive evidence that the men on trial were, at the time of the robbery, at so remote a distance from the spot that the thing was impossible. The men were acquitted, and some time afterwards the robbers were taken, and the articles stolen found upon them. Sir Thomas, on seeing these men, candidly acknowledged his mistake, and, it is said, gave a recompense to the men who so narrowly escaped conviction. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Wood and Brown, </em>28 <em>State Trials, </em>819 ; <em>Wills on Cir. Ev., </em>31, 47, 48.) The case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Clinch and McAckley </em>(3 <em>Par. &amp; Fon., </em>144), where the prisoners were convicted at the Old Bailey Sessions, in 1797, of the murder of one Frier, and executed. The identity of the prisoners was positively sworn to by a lady who was in company with the deceased at the time of the robbery and murder. It turned out afterwards that she was mistaken in the persons. <em>(Wills on Cir. Ev., </em>110.) An equally fatal mistake was made in the conviction of Robinson, at the Old Bailey, in July, 1824, upon direct and positive proof. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Robinson, Sess. Papers, </em>1824; <em>Wills on Cir. Ev., </em>110.) A similar mistake was made by another prosecutor, a few months before the last mentioned case, where a young man was tried for highway robbery, and the prosecutor swore positively that the prisoner was the man who robbed him of his watch. <em>(Wills on Cir. Ev., </em>111.) <em>Grow's case </em>was a conviction for murder by an honest mistake in the witnesses of personal identity. They mistook. Grow for Geddely, the real criminal. The remarkable case of Hoag, tried in the city of Hew-York, for bigamy, forcibly illustrates how easy it. is to be mistaken upon a question of personal identity. <em>(5 C. H. Rec., </em>124.) Cases of this description might be greatly multiplied, but they would only serve to establish the fallibility of even direct and positive proof. The evidences of the identification of the dead body, in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of the cases referred to by the counsel for the people, upon the argument of this case, although classed under the head of direct evidence, are less satisfactory proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>than the evidence in the case at bar furnishes. In the case of <em>Eugene Aram, </em>where the skeleton was found in a cave thirteen years after the murder, the proof of the identity of the body as that of Clarke was very faint, and but for the strong circumstantial evidence, a conviction could never have been justified. Charles I., after being much disfigured, was identified by a resemblance to the head upon the coins issued during his reign. The Marchioness of Salisbury, found among the ruins of Hatfield House, was identified by gold appendages to the artificial teeth. In the case of <em>Mary Martin, </em>the identification was by missing teeth. In the case of <em>Clows, </em>the body was identified twenty-three years after the murder by the peculiarity of the teeth. In the recent case of <em>Dr. Webster, </em>in our own country, the identification of the body consisted in the evidence of a dentist as to the identity of the artificial teeth. There is little use in going over the cases of this description. The evidence of identity in very many of these and similar cases, which might be greatly multiplied, are, although classed under the head of direct evidence, far less satisfactory proof to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>than many cases which rest entirely upon circumstantial evidence. It is no reason, therefore, for rejecting circumstantial evidence that a few cases can be found in the course of, perhaps as many centuries, where innocent men have been convicted upon this species of evidence, for the results of experience have demonstrated that the same accusation, with equal if not greater force, may be brought against direct evidence. It was well and beautifully said by Park, J., in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Thurtell, </em>tried for the murder of Weare, at the Hartford assizes, in January, 1824, that \u201c the Eye of Omniscience can alone see the truth in all cases; circumstantial evidence is there out of the question <em>; </em>but clothed as we are with the infir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>mities of human nature, how are we to get at .the truth without a concatenation of circumstances? Though, in human judicature, imperfect as it must necessarily be, it sometimes happens, perhaps in the course of one hundred years,. that in a few solitary instances, owing to the minute and curious, circumstances which sometimes envelope human transactions, error has been committed from a reliance on circumstantial evidence ; yet this species of evidence, in the opinion of all those who are most conversant with the administration of justice, and most skilled in judicial proceedings, is much more satisfactory than the testimony of a single individual who has seen the fact committed.\u201d (1 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s notes, </em>393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">It was said, by Washington, J., in <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Johns </em>(1 <em>Wash. C. C. R., </em>372), that circumstantial evidence is\u2019sufficient, and is often more persuasive than the positive evidence of a witness who may be mistaken, whereas a concatenation and a fitness of many circumstances, made out by different witnesses,- can seldom be mistaken or fail to elicit the truth.\u201d It was said, by Livingston, J., that \u201c the rule, even in a capital case, is, that should the circumstances be sufficient to convince the mind and' remove every rational doubt-, the jury is bound to place as much reliance on such circumstances as on direct and positive proof, for facts and circumstances- cannot- lie.\u201d <em>(Jacobson\u2019s case, </em>2 <em>C. H. Rec., </em>143; 1 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, </em>308.) Burnett says: \u201c <em>Circumstances are. inflexible froofs\u2019\u2019 (Burn. Com. L. Scotland, </em>523.) Paley says: \u201cCircumstances cannot lie.\u201d <em>(Prin. Mor. &amp; Pol. Phil., book </em>6, <em>ch. </em>9.) Burke, the distinguished statesman and orator, has said that \u201c when circumstantial proof is in its greatest perfection, that is, when it is most abundant in circumstances, it is much superior to positive proof.\u201d <em>(2.Burke\u2019s Works, </em>624.) Paley has declared, and with more caution, that \u201ca concurrence of well authenticated circumstances ' composes a stronger ground of assurance than positive testimony, unconfirmed by circumstances, usually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>affords.\u201d <em>(Prin. Mor. &amp; Pol. Phil., book </em>6, <em>ch. </em>9.) It was said, by Baron Legge, upon the trial of Mary Blandy for murder, that where \u201c a violent presumption necessarily arises from the circumstances, they are more convincing and satisfactory than any other kind of evidence, because facts cannot lie.\u201d (28 <em>State Trials, </em>1187.) Mr. Justice Buller stated to the jury, in his charge in the trial of John Donellan for murder, that \u201c a presumption which necessarily arises from circumstances is very often more convincing and satisfactory than any other kind of evidence, because it is not within the reach and compass of human abilities to invent a train of circumstances which shall be so connected together as to amount to a proof of guilt without affording opportunities of contradicting a great part if not all of those circumstances.\u201d ( <em>Gurney's report of </em>trial.) The opinions of judges of similar import might be multiplied to almost any extent, but the character and force of circumstantial evidence is so well defined and recognized by all the elementary writers upon evidence that it becomes unnecessary to pursue it. Starkie, in speaking of circumstantial evidence, says: \u201c It is, in its own nature capable of producing the highest degree of moral certainty.\u201d (3 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>479, 480.) The nature and character of circumstantial evidence are as well elucidated and described by Wills, in his admirable book on circumstantial evidence, as in any author which has fallen under my observation. He maintains that circumstantial evidence is capable of producing an equal degree of moral certainty.with direct evidence; and Burrill, in his most excellent treatise on circumstantial evidence, maintains the same claim for it In short, there is not a writer of any respectability upon the principles of evidence but what admits that circumstantial evidence has the inherent capacity to produce moral certainty in its results. It is a principle of circumstantial evidence that it is never permitted to rise to the dignity of proof until it does produce moral certainty. It is correctly said by Mills that a presumption which neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sarily arises from circumstances cannot admit of dispute and requires no corroboration. He \u00e1dds: \u201cIf evidence be so strong as necessarily to produce certainty and conviction, it matters not by <em>what kind </em>of evidence the effect is produced, and the intensity of the proof must be precisely the same whether the evidence be direct or circumstantial. It is not,\u201d he adds, \u201c intended to deny that circumstantial evidence affords a safe and satisfactory ground of assurance and belief; nor that, in many individual instances, it may be superior in proving power to other individual cases of proof by direct evidence.\u201d ( <em>Wills Cir. Ev., </em>29, 45.) It was said by Lord Erskine, with the strictest philosophical truth, in the <em>Banbury Peerage case, </em>that \u201cproof is nothing more than a presumption of the highest order.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>48.) It is equally so, 'whether the evidence be direct or circumstantial. If a witness swears directly to a fact, as a general rule, we regard the fact as proved, because we presume the witness has told the truth; yet it is but a presumption after all. Having considered thus far the nature and character of circumstantial evidence, let us inquire whether it has not sufficient proving power to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>in a charge of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Lord Hale has often been referred to as authority against the rule, and in some instances has been followed as authority, denying the admissibility and competency of such evidence to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>in such a case. Lord Hale said: \u201c I would never convict any person of murder or manslaughter unless the fact were proved to be done, or at least the dead body found, for the sake of two cases,\u201d which he states, of wrong convictions, where the body was \"not produced or found and identified. (2 <em>Hale, </em>290; 2 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Now the only reason assigned by Lord Hale against the competency of this species of evidence, if it can be regarded an opinion against its competency, was that, in two instances, convictions had been had upon circumstantial evidence to establish the <em>corpus delicti, </em>when it turned out afterward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that the persons ^were innocent.. This is no argument for rejecting this species of evidence, for the same accusation can be brought against the proof of the guilt of the prisoner by circumstantial evidence, where the <em>corpus delicti </em>has been clearly established by direct evidence, and the same charge can be brought' against direct evidence, as we have shown. This remark of Lord Hale,- although it has been often quoted by judges, and has found its way into the elementary books upon evidence and of publicists upon criminal law, yet it has not. been generally regarded as authority, but at most as merely advisory, and.'the rule as stated by him is now generally repudiated as unsound. It is stated by Burrill, in his valuable <em>Treatise on Circumstantial Evidence, </em>that \u2019 \u201c the death may be inferred from such strong and unequivocal circumstances as renders it morally; certain, and leaves no ground for reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Burr. Cir. Ev., </em>680.) It is said by Wills, in his most estimable <em>.Essay on Circumstantial Evidence, </em>that it is a fundamental and inflexible rule of legal procedure, and'of universal obligation, to require satisfactory proof of the' <em>corpus delicti, </em>either by direct evidence or by cogent and irresistible grounds of presumption. <em>(Wills Cir. Ev., </em>156, 178.) He says again <em>(p. </em>185), - after quoting the remark of Lord Hale, \u201c that to require the discovery of the body, in all cases, would be unreasonable,. and lead to absurdity and injustice, and is, .indeed, frequently rendered impossible by the act of the offender himself. The \u2022 fact of death, therefore,\u201d he adds, \u201c may. be. inferred from such strong, and unequivocal circumstances of presumption as render it morally certain and leave no ground of reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>163-185, <em>3d Lond.ed.) </em>Greenleaf adopts the rule of Wills. He says that even in the case of .homicide, \u2022 though ordinarily there ought to be the testimony of persons who have seen and identified the body, yet. this is not indispensably necessary in cases, where .the ptoof of death is so strong and intense as to produce the full assurance of moral certainty* (3 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 30.)' He cites the. remark of' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Lord Hale <em>(id., 121, </em>\u00a7 131), andh'egards it as only advisory, and repudiates it as a rule. Starkie <em>(vol. </em>1, 511, <em>6th Am. </em>ed.) quotes , Lord Hale with approbation, and declares the rule, in unqualified terms, to be that the <em>corpus delicti </em>can only be proved by direct evidence of the fact, or by discovery and inspection of the dead body. He has, however, referred to the-,subject again- <em>(2 id., </em>513), and corrected himself in the employment of the following language: \u201c It has been laid down by Lord H\u00e1le, as a rule of prudence in cases of murder, that, to warrant a conviction, proof should be given of the death by evidence of the fact or the actual finding of the dead body.\u201d But he adds, \u201c although it be certain that no conviction ought to take place unless there is the most full and decisive evidence as to the death, yet it seems that actual proof of the finding and identifying of the body is not absolutely essential.\u201d And it is evident that to lay down a strict rule \u201c to that extent might be productive of the most horrible consequences.\u201d <em>(2 Stark. Ev., </em>513, <em>6th Am. ed.) </em>It is-stated in <em>Russell on Crimes, </em>that it has been holden as a rule that no person should be convicted of murder unless the body of the deceased has been found; and then, after quoting the language of Lord Hale, he adds: \u201c But this rule, it seems, must be taken with some qualifications; and circumstances may be sufficiently strong to show the fact of murder though the. body has never been found.\u201d (1 <em>Russ. on Cr., </em>567.) It is s\u00e1id by Chitty, in his <em>Criminal Law, </em>that \u201c It is said to be a good general rule that no man should be found guilty of murder unless the body of the deceased is found, because instances have arisen of persons being executed for murdering others who have afterward been found to be alive. But this rule must be taken rather as a caution than \u00e1s a maxim to be-universally observed, for it would be easy, in many instances, so to, conceal the body as to prevent it from being discovered.\u201d (1 <em>Chitty Cr. L., </em>738; <em>2 Arch. Cr. Pl., </em>208, <em>Waterman\u2019s ed.) </em>The following authorities will be found.fully to establish the rule that where the discovery of. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the body cannot be had, the <em>corpus delicti </em>may be proved by circumstantial evidence, where the facts and circumstances are so strong as to render it morally certain and leave no ground for reasonable doubt. <em>(Whart. Am. L. of Homicide, </em>316, 317; <em>Burr. Cir. Ev., </em>678-680, 70-117; 3 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill's Notes, part </em>1, 470-472, 562-564, <em>new ed; Whart. Am. Cr. L., 284-286; 2 Arch. Cr. Pl. and Pr., </em>134, 135, <em>Waterman's ed.; Barb. Cr. L., </em>455, <em>2d ed; United States </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>1 <em>Wash. C. C.

R., </em>27; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 <em>Cush., </em>296; <em>Wills Cir. Ev., </em>185, 195.) In the cases of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert (supra), </em>Justice Story, having this rule of Lord Hale pressed upon him, said: \u201c The proposition cannot be admitted as correct, in point of common reason or of law, unless courts of justice are to establish a positive rule to secure persons from punishment who may be guilty of the most flagitious crimes. In the case of murders committed on the high seas the body is rarely, if ever found, and a more complete encouragement and protection for the worst offences of this sort could not be invented than a rule of this strictness. It would amount to universal condonation of all murders committed on the high seas.\u201d I assume, therefore, that the <em>corpus delicti, </em>as well as the guilt of the prisoner, may be proved by circumstantial evidence. It is undoubtedly true, as a general rule, that the dead body ought to be found and identified; but, like all other general rules, it has its exceptions. It becomes important, then, to inquire what are the exceptions to this general rule. There is no particular class of cases that can be said in law to form an exception. The application of the familiar and well settled rule in regard to allowing circumstantial evidence to prove a fact, is the only one that can be recognized in such a case; that rule is that circumstantial evidence can never be resorted to except where direct evidence is unattainable. <em>(Wills Cir. Ev., </em>47.) Starkie says, circumstantial evidence ought in no case to be relied on where direct or positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>evidence which might have been brought by the prosecutor is willfully withheld. (1 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>515; <em>Wills Cir. Ev., </em>47.) It is not, then, allowed to prevail to the conviction of an offender simply because it is politic, but because it is in its own nature capable of producing the highest degree of moral certainty in its application. ( 1 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>494, 495.) The mistaken policy which led some of the writers on the civil and common law to modify their rules of evidence according to proof incident to particular crimes, and to adopt the execrable maxim that the more atrocious was the offence the slighter was the proof necessary, has no place in the wise common law principles of evidence as administered in England and this country. ( <em>Wills Cir. Ev., </em>157, 178.) That no consideration of supposed expediency is permitted to supersede the immutable obligations of justice is a wholesome maxim of our common law rules of evidence. <em>(Id., </em>173.) Many of the continental codes of Europe prescribe imperative formulae descriptive of the kind and of the amount of evidence necessary to constitute legal proof. <em>(Id., </em>211, 236.) But this doctrine is wholly repudiated by the common law principles of evidence. It does not attempt to fix with arithmetical exactness a common standard of proof, which shall influence with unvarying intensity and affect the minds of all men alike. <em>(Id., </em>236.) The common law principle of evidence regards such rules not merely as harmless and superfluous, but as positively pernicious and dangerous to the cause of truth; and while they operate as snares for the conscience of the judge, they are unnecessary for the protection of the innocent, and effective only for the impunity of the guilty. <em>(Id., </em>236, 237.) In strict accordance with these principles, Mr. Starkie, in discussing the principles of circumstantial evidence, says: \u201c What circumstances will amount to proof can never be matter of general definition. The legal test is the sufficiency of the evidence to satisfy the understanding and conscience of the jury. On the one hand, absolute metaphysical and demonstrative certainty is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>essential to proof by circumstances. It is sufficient if they produce moral certainty to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt.\u201d (1 <em>Stark. Ev., </em>514; . 3 <em>id., </em>514; 1 <em>Cow. &amp; Hill's Notes, </em>308.) Greenleaf says it is obvious that upon this point no precise rule can be laid down, except, that the evidence ought to, be strong and cogent. (3 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>32, \u00a7 30.) The doctrine is affirmed, by Wills in the strongest terms. <em>(Wills Cir. Ev., </em>21, 26, 36, 41, 42.) In the case at bar there was no direct evidence of the <em>corpus delicti,, </em>and as it was most evident that none could be: adduced in the case, I am of opinion, for the reasons above stated, that I was right in saying to the jury, that the <em>corpus delicti </em>might be proved by-circumstantial evidence, when the evidence is so strong and intense as to produce the full certainty .of death, or, in other words, that the death might be inferred from such strong and -unequivocal circumstances- as render it morally certain and leave no ground for reasonable doubt. I cautioned the jury that, before .they could find this issue against the prisoner they must be satisfied from the evidence in the case that it was established by presumptive evidence of the most cogent and irresistible kind; that it was established by circumstances proved, so strong and intense as to produce the. full certainty of death.. Under this charge the jury responded in a-verdict of. guilty. ;It was an. impartial verdict upon the evidence, in the case, and accorded with my own convictions of the case, and entertaining the most deliberate opinion that no principle of law was violated upon the trial, and that no injustice, was done the prisoner in the verdict of the jury, I am of opinion that a new trial should be denied. ,. - \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<author id=\"b460-5\">Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aki\">. The only question here presented is as to the sufficiency .of circumstantial evidence, to establish the criminal act charged in the indictment. It is stated as a rule, by some elementary writers of high authority upon questions of evidence, that however strong or numerous the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>stances may be to establish a fact that a murder has been committed, they avail nothing unless the death, be first distinctly proved by inspection of the body. (4 <em>Bl. Com., </em>359; <em>Stark. Ev., 3d ed., </em>509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This.rule originated with' Sir Matthew Hale, who said he would never convict any person of murder or manslaughter unless the fact were proved to be done, or at least the body found dead, for the sake of two cases. (2 <em>Hale\u2019s P. C., </em>290.) I have examined those cases, and although there is much in them calculated to induce courts to caution jurors to consider with the greatest care and scrutiny the evidence submitted for their consideration, to keep in mind the legal presumption of innocence and give to the accused the benefit of every reas'onable doubt, y\u00e9t I am not satisfied that they warrant a court in declaring that they will not carry into execution the verdict of a jury founded upon evidence, to the admissibility of which there is no possible objection, and which comes fully up to the legal test of proof in every other case and upon every other question that can arise, however highly penal the Consequences may be. In one of the cases referred to by Lord Hale, two things occurred out of the ordinary course of legal proceedings, without which a conviction would not have ensued. It was the well known case of an uncle charged with murdering his niece; he was admonished, by the justices before whom he was examined, to find out' the child by the next assizes; not being able to comply with judicial admonition he feared the consequence, and to avoid it brought another child like her in person and years, having appareled her like the true child. The deception was discovered, and upon the presumption arising from the child\u2019s- absence and the fraudulent substitution, he was convicted and executed. It was afterwards discovered that the missing child was living,</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The melancholy result in that case -may well be attributed to the extraordinary demeanor of the justices and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>accused, and not to any defect in the rule of evidence adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The other is a case, given by Lord Hale, of a man being convicted of the murder of another. The latter had been a long time missing, and was supposed to have been murdered by the accused and consumed by him to ashes in an oven. The accused was convicted and executed, and the latter returned within a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It is enough to say of this case, that under the rule now sought to be enforced by the prosecution, properly administered and the accused reasonably well defended, no such conviction could at this age be had. That there have been other cases of conviction where the party supposed to be murdered was, at the time of the conviction,' alive, is undoubtedly true.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">We are therefore called upon, on account ot there having been once, perhaps in a century, such an instance, to hold that no conviction can be had unless the act of killing be proved by the evidence of one or more who saw it or the dead body be found. Should this be done, we should, for the same reason, where the dead body is found, hold that the crime of killing and the discovery of the author could not be established by circumstantial evidence. The danger in the latter case is fully equal, if not greater, than in the former, and in the latter case a two-fold evil would be almost necessarily the\" result, viz., \u201cthe escape of the guilty and the punishment of the innocent.\u201d Past experience has shown that very many instances have occurred in which honest witnesses have testified positively to a fact which subsequent developments have shown not to have existed. Verdicts have been the result of evidence given by peijured witnesses. In either case, we do not know whether the witness speaks the truth, but presume, from the reasonable-' ness of his statement, his deportment upon the stand, and the fact that he is not contradicted, or in any respect impeached, that he has testified truly, and act accordingly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Although circumstantial evidence may technically, in some respects be regarded as inferior or secondary in its character, it is so only when it appears that direct evidence is withheld, and then only for the purpose of avoiding the suspicion that would otherwise rest upon it from the mere circumstance that attainable, direct evidence is withheld. It has therefore sometimes been held that direct evidence should first be produced; both are certainly more conclusive than either. Nevertheless, such evidence is not in any sense inferior to direct evidence; many able jurists have held that a combination of circumstances, so connected with each other as to form a chain of evidentiary facts, is more convincing and less liable to suspicion than what is ordinarily termed direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">To secure safety in the administration of justice, care is taken, in proportion as the controversy rises in importance, to guard against mistakes and injustice. In criminal trials, the interest at stake being greater, the law has justly thrown around the accused guards against erroneous conclusions to be drawn from evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, which renders it necessary that a higher degree of certainty should be arrived at than in civil cases. No possible objection can be sustained to the admissibility of circumstantial evidence; no one, upon judicial authority, doubts its competency when a death has occurred, to prove not only that the person was killed without authority of law, but to identify the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Our limited intelligence alone, without the aid of wisdom derived from the experience of those \u2022\u25a0by whom rules of evidence have been devised,\" affords abundant proof that no rules of evidence adapted to the wants of society by the human mind are infallible; differences of opinion are entertained as to whether direct or circumstantial evidence is the least liable to error. A learned commentator says, with great truth, that \u201c each have their peculiar advantages and characteristic dangers \u201d; to reject either under all circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>stances as insufficient, would result in the clearest injustice. If fallible minds should reject all evidence not infallible, there would be an end to the administration of justice, civil or criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Necessity-has forced upon us rules of evidence, and the protection of civil life is the highest object of our penal laws, and that, to a great extent, is accomplished by a dread of punishment; and notwithstanding. the consequences to the accused' are incalculably serious, yet if the <em>corpus delicti </em>be established by circumstances which come up to the best of proof, so strong and intense as to convince the understanding and consciences of a jury of the full certainty of death, though the dead body be not found, I am unable to discover upon what principle of justice a court can refuse to pronounce judgment upon the verdict. (3 <em>Greenl. on Ev., </em>32, \u00a7 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Mr. Wills, in his valuable treatise upon <em>Circumstantial Evidence, </em>says, that to require the production of the dead body in all cases would be unreasonable, and lead to absurdity and injustice ; and that the death may be inferred from such strong and unquestionable circumstances of presumption as render it reasonably certain, and leave no ground for reasonable doubt. ( <em>Wills on Cir. Ev., </em>2, 203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Were it not so, says Bentham, a murderer, to secure himself with impunity, would have no more, to do but to consume or decompose the body by fire, by lime, or by any other known chemical menstrua, or to sink it in an unfathomable part of the sea. (3 <em>Benth. Jud. Ev., </em>243.) Justice Story, in the case of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert and others </em>(2 <em>Sumn., </em>19, 27), said of the rule contended for by the counsel for the prisoner, \u201c It certainly cannot be admitted as correct, in point of common reason or of law, unless courts of justice are to establish a positive rule to screen persons from punishment who maybe guilty of the most flagitious crimes. In c, ses upon the high seas, the body is rarely if ever found, ai l a more complete encouragement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and protection for the worst of offences could not he invented than a rule of this strictness. It would amount to a universal. condonation of all murders committed upon the high seas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The defendant\u2019s child, at the time of his trial, had been missing over eleven years, under circumstances that fully justified the inference that he had put it to death, and sunk its body and that of its mother, in Cayuga lake. Its clothes with those of its mother, were pawned by him in Chicago, soon after the child and mother were missing, under the assumed name of James H. Revilee ; he then said they had died on Illinois river, south of Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The party to whom they were pawned, not hearing from him, opened the trunk containing the clothes, and found in it cards inscribed, James H. Eulloff, and on a separate paper, these words, \u201c Oh, that dreadful hour \u201d ; also a lock of hair labeled either Harriet\u2019s or Mary\u2019s hair, the witness thought Harriet\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The strong force of circumstances against him pressed him to the proof of his assertion that his child had died in Illinois, or that it was seen after the time it was <em>missing; </em>he made no effort to do either, but reposed himself entirely upon the inability of the prosecution to produce the dead body of his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">I see no ground for interfering with the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b465-9\">Balcom, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK7\">(Dissenting.) The defendant was convicted of the murder of his infant daughter, at a Circuit Court, held in the county of Tioga, in October, 1856. He now moves for a new trial upon, a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">It is claimed on the part of the defendant that the judge who presided on the trial erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the defendant could not be convicted of murder, for the reason that there was no direct evidence of the death or murder of his infant daughter; and.in charging that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>jury might infer, presume and find, without direct proof, the death and murder, of the infant daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The proof shows that the defendant\u2019s infant daughter and its mother disappeared very mysteriously from the defendant\u2019s residence, in Tompkins county, in June, 1845, and that neither of them has since been found or heard of, although the most diligent search and inquiry have been made for that purpose by the people of Tompkins county and the relatives of the absent daughter and mother, on the mother\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The defendant\u2019s conduct, before and at the time the daughter and its mother disappeared from his house, and subsequently thereto, was such as to create a very strong suspicion that they are both dead and that he murdered them ; and from such conduct, and other facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the case, the jury have found him guilty of the crime of murdering his daughter, for which only he was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The evidence is such that it is barely possible, though highly improbable, that the defendant\u2019s daughter is still alive. It is, however, so strong against the defendant on every point which it was necessary for the people to establish to show him guilty, that if a conviction for murder should be allowed in any case without certain evidence that the person supposed to be murdered is dead, we ought not to disturb the finding of the jury that he is guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Should a conviction for murder be permitted in any case without direct and certain evidence that the person is dead whom it is supposed has been murdered, is the only question presented for our consideration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">It is settled, both upon principle and authority, that the body of the murdered person need not always be found to authorize a conviction of the accused. Proof that the prisoner threw a person overboard from a vessel at sea, under such circumstances that it would be impossible for him to escape drowning, has been held sufficient evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>death of the person so thrown overboard to warrant the conviction of the prisoner without finding the dead body. So proof that the prisoner had cast a person into a blazing furnace, from which he could not escape, the heat thereof being sufficient to entirely consume the body, would render it unnecessary for the prosecutor to give evidence of the finding of the body of the person thus destroyed. The evidence in such cases being direct and certain that the absent or missing person is dead, establishes the basis of the <em>corpus delicti; </em>and then whether the throwing of the person into the-sea or casting him into a blazing furnace was murder or manslaughter, or done in self-defence, may be inferred from circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The rule laid down by Lord Hale is, that he \u201c would never convict any person of murder or manslaughter unless the fact be proved to be done, or at least the body found dead,\u201d and judges have seldom violated this rule without committing judicial murder. It is not to be denied that innocent persons have been convicted of murder when the bodies of the murdered persons were <em>found; </em>but this fact should admonish us against relaxing Lord Hale\u2019s rule, instead of inducing us to sustain a conviction where, conceding that all the witnesses whose testimony is relied upon to establish the death of the absent person supposed to be murdered have told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and still it be possible that such person is living. I cannot concur in establishing the doctrine that human life may be taken for an alleged murder when the conclusion that a murder has been committed is drawn from the sudden and unaccountable disappearance and long continued absence of the person supposed to be murdered, or from other circumstances, which may be all true and yet no homicide have been committed by any person. \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The evidence that the person whom it is alleged has been murdered is dead must be certain, and it must be such as to leave no room for the existence of any doubt whatever that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>such person is dead, before a conviction for the murder of such person can safely be permitted. It will not do to presume from circumstances that an absent person is dead, and then build the further presumption upon it that such person has been murdered. Persons accused of murder must be proved to be guilty, by certain and reliable evidence, before they can be lawfully convicted. \u201c The case must be such as to exclude to a moral certainty every other hypothesis but that of the guilt of the party accused.\u201d The case does not do this when there is the least uncertainty as to whether the person alleged to be murdered is dead. It is infinitely better for society that guilty persons should sometimes escape deserved punishment than for courts to establish a precedent that may be used to deprive innocent persons of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">I cannot concur in sustaining the verdict in this case, because the evidence is such that it is possible that the defendant\u2019s daughter is yet living. That-it is extremely improbable that she is living will not do. . Th\u00e9 evidence must be certain that she is dead before the defendant can be lawfully convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I.think the judge should have instructed the jury to acquit the defendant, and that for his refusal to do so the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted to the defendant, to be had at the Tioga Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
