Crane </em>was called and sworn as a witness for the prosecution, and testified as follows: I am of the firm of Crane &amp; Struthers; we are importers of lace goods and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>embroideries; we do business at No. 177 Broadway; on the morning of January fifth a burglary was committed at our store; I found that our whole premises, consisting of three lofts, were all in disorder, and a large amount of goods stolen; they consisted of jaconet collars, infants\u2019 robes, infants\u2019 waists, embroidered habit shirts, needlework trimmings, black lace veils, blonde lace edgings, also some colored goods, and the whole valued at from $6000 to $7000 ; another firm occupy part of the premises; sometimes their porter gets to the store before ours, and in that case he opens the door; I cannot say which porter opened the door that morning; we recovered part of the stolen property, and have about $2500 worth of it now in our possession; we recovered a portion of all the goods stolen; it was on January eighteenth that I saw those goods in two black \u25a0 trunks and a black bag; I immediately recognized them by our private mark; I saw them at Mr. Samuel Emberson\u2019s house, in Eighth-avenue; he was present when I saw them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-5\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>The private marks were on the goods when I saw them at Emberson\u2019s; the name of the firm did not occur on the tickets; I have not the letter or a copy of the letter which I wrote to Mr. Emberson; I remember the contents of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\"><em>Samuel Emberson </em>was next called and sworn as a witness for the prosecution, and testified as follows, viz.: I do business at No. 285 Eighth-avenue; I am a dealer in lace goods and embroideries; I know Wills and Conley; they did business last January at No. 333 Broadway, corner of Worth-street ; they occupied three rooms; two rooms on a line, as you enter, and one at the back of the office; I was in their office on January tenth, in the afternoon; I saw Wills and Conley there; Wills beckoned me to come into the private office; I went in and he locked the door; he asked me if I would buy goods that were \u201cpulled\u201d or \u201cdrawn;\u201d I asked him what he meant by \u201cpulled\u201d or \u201cdrawn;\u201d he said he would be plain with me, he meant goods that were stolen; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>I said I was surprised at him, and asked him if he thought I would buy stolen goods; then I asked him what kind of goods they were; he pulled a memorandum from his vest pocket and told me what they were; he read a description of the goods: blonde laces, infants\u2019 robes, infants\u2019 waists, black lace veils, and brown and blue goods; he asked me if I saw the <em>Herald </em>of Sunday; I told him no; he told me to go home and read the <em>Herald </em>of Sunday; I saw an advertisement. there relating to stolen goods; I saw Wills and Conley the next morning; I would now know a man called Wilson, but I did not know him then; I first saw Mm at the Tombs; I saw Wills and Conley, the morning after I had seen the <em>Herald, </em>at their office; Wills asked me if I had seen the <em>Herald; </em>I said I had; I asked him for a sample of those goods; he asked me if I would buy them ; I told him there would be no harm in looking at a sample; he asked me if I had any business down town; I told him yes; he said if I would come in at twelve o\u2019clock he would show me samples of the goods; I told Mm I was going to auction ; I returned to Wills a little after eleven o\u2019clock; I saw Wills and Conley; I asked again to see samples of the goods; he sent Conley after them; he told Conley to be careful that any one was not watching; he was gone about fifteen minutes; he then came in with samples buttoned up inside of his coat; he went into a private room and left them there; Wills and I went in and examined them; he locked the door; they consisted of veils, chemisettes, waists and blonde laces; they had no marks on them; he wanted me to give an offer for them; I told him I did not like to buy goods in that way; I insisted on seeing the whole lot of goods; he said there was $6000 or $7000 worth of them ; he said he would not let G-od Almighty see them ; he said if I bought them I would make money from them, for I could buy the whole lot for from $2000 to $3000 ; I persisted in seeing the whole lot of goods, for I would not buy a pig in a sack; he then said he would let me see them the next day, and I made the appoint-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>meat to meet him: I saw Wills the next morning, at the office; I do not remember if Conley was there; he could not let me see the goods, but appointed Monday following for the day when I could see them, as he had not yet made his arrangements, I appointed to meet him on Monday, and I went to him ; he made an appointment with me at noon on that day to go and see the goods; he said there was a warrant out for him and Conley, but it was not of much importance, and would be settled in an hour; he said he was going to get bail; I returned at noon, but found they were locked up in the Tombs; I saw them the next day at the Tombs; I asked them if I could do anything for them; I asked Wills if he could let me see those goods ; he said he would be out on bail that day, and he would show them to me; I left them then, and saw them next morning in the Tombs again; there was one person in to see them when I first went there; when he came out I went in; I told Wills to give me an order to see the goods; he told me I ought not to allude to the affair, even to my wife; he asked me why I had spoken to any one outside about it; he alluded to Wilson; I replied that if Wilson did not know anything, he could not tell anything about it from what I said; I insisted on getting the order from Mr. Wills; he gave me au order to see them ; this paper now shown to me is the order; it reads, \u201c This is the personsigned, \u201c Charles Wills; \u201d I showed the order to Wilson; it was not directed to anybody; I came out of the prison when I got the order; I had a conversation with Wilson outside the prison; I saw Wilson again that morning; I understand Wilson keeps the \u201c Shades,\u201d in Greene-street; I'went to Leonard-street with Wilson, afterwards to the Court of Sessions, and afterwards to the Williamsburgh ferry; I went alone and saw Wills going on board the boat and beckoning me to come on; we went to Williamsburgh ; he shook his head to prevent my speaking to him; I saw Wills talk to another man on the boat; I asked him afterwards who the man was and he said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>he was a horse doctor; I went to Lee-avenue, near Ross-street; I there saw a woman in the basement; Wills asked her for a light; we proceeded up stairs, and he took me into the parlor; he opened a door at the head of the stairs and brought out two trunks and a black bag; I helped to haul the trunks into the parlor: they were locked, and he told me that Wilson would be there with the keys in a few minutes; I waited for him; in about ten or fifteen minutes Wilson came ; I first saw Wilson when I was waiting to go into the Tombs to see Wills' and Conley; I asked Wilson then if he was a friend of Wills and Conley; he said he was, and asked me if I was; I replied that I knew Wills and was anxious to get them both out of the Tombs, as I was buying a large lot of goods of them; he said I might not be alarmed, as the goods were all right; he said if I could get an order from Wills that I was the right person he could sell them to me as well as they could ; he said he had the keys of them in his pocket; he then went in to see the prisoners ; when he came out he told me to go in and get the order from Wills, and he would wait; I went in and had the conversation with Wills that I testified to above; I showed Wilson the order Wills gave me, and he made an appointment to meet me; I afterwards saw him in Leonard-street and accompanied him to the Court of Sessions, when he appointed to go with me and see the goods; he told me to go to the Peck-slip ferry; when I went there I saw Wills as I stated, and \u25a0went with him to the house; when Wilson came he unlocked the trunks, and said if I would buy the goods he would bring them to the ferry, but would not take them across; Wills took a piece of paper and made a memorandum of the goods while I counted them over; Wilson laid on the floor and watched me to see if I counted straight; I never saw the memorandum since; I had a memorandum of the goods which had been stolen from Mr. Crane.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-5\"><em>Question. </em>From whom did you receive the memorandum ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>.

The counsel for the prisoners replied, that they proposed showing, by way of contradicting Samuel Emberson, that in this conversation Wills made use of this language to Emberson: \u201cI would not give three cents to settle the matter; I wish to have the case fully investigated;\u201d or to that purport.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The district attorney objected to proof of the last mentioned facts, as stated \"by the counsel for the prisoners, and the court excluded the proposed proof, and refused to allow it; and to the decision of the court in that behalf the counsel for the prisoners excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\"><em>John Pincus </em>was next called as a witness for the prisoners (Wills and Conley), and being duly sworn, testified as follows : I am a commission merchant, at 88 Cedar-street, in this city; I have been in business for five years; I have known Wills and Conley for about two years; I have been in their place of business; I was there in January last; it was on the tenth or eleventh of January, between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the morning; I saw a bundle of samples lying on the top of the iron safe; the safe stood opposite me as I entered; Wills showed them to me, on the counter; they were in a box, in a brown paper; there were collars, veils, ladies\u2019 chemises, laces and other goods; I passed no value upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>Question. </em>Was anything said by Wills as to what the property was doing there ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">This question was objected to by the district attorney, and excluded by the court; and to the decision of the court in that behalf the counsel for the prisoners excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">After the examination of several other witnesses on the part of the prisoners, Wills and Conley,</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\"><em>John Sedgwick </em>was called as a witness in their behalf, and testified as follows, viz.: I am assistant district attorney of this county; I drew the indictment in this case; I got the description of the property set out in the indictment from Mr. Crane; I cannot specify any source from which T obtained it; I think prior to the making of the affidavit on which the prisoners were arrested, I had a list of the articles stolen from Mr. Crane, given me by himself; I think the description of the property in the indictment was taken from that list.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The prisoners\u2019 counsel offered to show, as a circumstance discrediting Samuel Emberson, that for four terms or more preceding their trial, the prisoners had been ready, and had moved the court to bring on the trial of the indictment, and that the delay was owing to the prosecutionand that at the last term of the court, the recorder stated that he considered it a hard case, and that if it came before him again \" on a similar application, or under similar circumstances, he would feel bound to interfere for their relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The district attorney objected to the offered proof of the facts last mentioned, and the court refused to allow any proof thereof; and to the decision of the court in that behalf the counsel for the prisoners excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">After the evidence closed, the counsel for the prisoners renewed the motion to the court, heretofore made on behalf of the defendant William Conley, namely, for an order that he be discharged from the indictment, on the grounds herein already stated, and upon the additional ground that the case for the prosecution having closed, and the testimony disclosing nothing further against that defendant, the court could pass upon the motion with the whole case before it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">This motion was renewed, on behalf of each of the prisoners, separately and distinctly, and was overruled by the court in' relation to both and each of them ; and to the decision of the court in that behalf the counsel for the prisoners excepted, on behalf of both and each of the prisoners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">The case haying been summed up to the jury, the counsel for the. prisoners requested the court to instruct the jury upon, the following propositions, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">1. If the jury believe that the defendants first bought or in any way received the last mentioned property <em>(i. e., </em>the property described in the indictment), in Williamsburgh, Kings county, and that after that they brought into and exposed for sale, in the county of New-York, the last mentioned pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>perty, or any part of it, they cannot be convicted under the present indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">2. That the testimony of Samuel Emberson as to Wills sending Conley out for the patterns or specimens, and what then passed, is not sufficient, of itself or by itself, to justify the conviction of Conley.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">The court refused so to charge, and to such refusal the counsel for the prisoners excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">The jury found both the defendants guilty, and they were, sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for four years and eight months. A writ of error was then sued out in their behalf.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-9\"><em>John Graham,, </em>for the prisoners.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-10\">I. The question to the witness Emberson, as to the person from whom he received the memorandum of the goods stolen from Crane &amp; Struthers, was improperly allowed by the court to be put by the prosecuting counsel. This was a memorandum which Emberson alleged he had with him when examining certain property, which he swore Wills showed him at Williamsburgh. The evidence related to a transaction in the absence of the accused. With reference to them it was <em>res inter alios acta. </em>Besides, it was allowing the witness to support his testimony in a way in which the guiltiest person , could always make evidence in his favor. All that a guilty person has to do do, within this ruling, to screen himself from suspicion, when his interference with the property of another is criminal, is to treat with the owner, and profess to act under and for him, and the end is gained. If called as a witness to fasten guilt upon another who may be innocent, this fact is to corroborate his evidence and place it above all question. In other words, a witness may show that he is not <em>particeps criminis </em>by evidence which is not available to the party accused, and thus manufacture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>himself his own corroboration. The position of the witness will be fully appreciated, when it is considered that he was not only making out a case against the accused, but, in so doing, was destroying what, without his explanations, was a conclusive case against himself. The evidence was certainly not <em>germon </em>to the issue. That was as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. The witness had not been assailed at this time by any evidence calculated to impeach the motive of his conduct. The necessity of supporting him was felt, and was anticipated; which was beyond all rules or reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-5\">II. The principle of the last point is applicable to the other exceptions where questions were allowed by the court, still further exhibiting the connection of the witness with Mr. Crane, one of the prosecutors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">III. The court below erred in refusing to order that William Conley, one of the plaintiffs in error, be discharged from the indictment at the close of the case for the prosecution, in the first instance. All the evidence against Conley was given by Emberson. The motion was made in pursuance of <em>2 R. S. </em>(735, \u00a7 21.) It will be observed that the statute does not refer merely to a case in which there is no evidence to put a party on his defence; but cases where, though there may be some, there is not sufficient evidence for that purpose. The order of discharge can be made by the court without the interference of the jury. If Conley was entitled to his discharge the error in not ordering it affected both him and Wills. He could have been a witness for the latter, and in that way have materially aided his defence. Believing all Emberson swore to, and supposing it to place Wills\u2019 guilt beyond all doubt, still it showed no participation on the part of Conley. On the contrary, Wills never permitted him to be present at a single interview between himself and Emberson. Where a combination or conspiracy is charged, evidence, which should have been allowed as to any conspirator, if disallowed, will form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>a good ground of exception as to all. <em>(Barthelemy </em>v. <em>The People, 2 Hill, </em>248, 253, 259.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">IY. The court below erred in refusing to dismiss the case or to direct an acquittal. In the indictment it was alleged that the accused received and had. As receiving and having are, within the view of the prosecution, as will be hereafter seen, separate offences (2 <em>R. S., </em>726, \u00a7 43), unless the copulative \u201c and\u201d makes \u201chaving\u201d synonymous with \u201creceiving,\u201d each count of the indictment would be bad for embracing two offences. The mode of connecting or associating the words show that the pleader meant to charge the receiving to be the offence. If the indictment had said \u201c -received or had,\u201d it might have been different, but still liable to the objection of two offences in one count. When the prosecution rested, there was no evidence to show that the identity of any property which Emberson swore he saw at the loan office was that of the prosecutors, beyond Wills\u2019 admission that it was a part of the stolen property, made in the absence of Conley. Certainly as to Conley this was not the least evidence; and as to Wills, as the identity of the property was a part of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>his simple admission would not prove it as to him. (<em>The People </em>v. <em>Hennessy, </em>15 <em>Wend., </em>147; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Badgley, </em>16 <em>id., </em>53.) If the having the property is made an offence, it does not warrant the presumption that the receiving took place where the parties had the property. If this is not so, why should the statute use the words, \u201c received or had?\u201d (2 <em>R. S., </em>726, \u00a7 43.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">V. The court below erred in excluding the questions to the witness Maeder. <em>(Mezzara's case, 2 City Hall Recorder, </em>113; <em>Atwood\u2019s case, </em>4 <em>id., </em>91; <em>Robetaille\u2019s cases, </em>5 <em>id., </em>171, 173; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>4 <em>Wash. C. C. R., </em>729; <em>Mitchum </em>v. <em>The State, </em>11 <em>Geo. R., </em>615; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>1 <em>Carr. &amp; Payne, </em>67; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Crutchley, </em>5 <em>id., </em>133; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>5 <em>id., </em>590; <em>Hayslep </em>v. <em>Gymer, </em>1 <em>Adolph. &amp; El., </em>162.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>VI. The court below erred in excluding the question to the witness Maeder, as to whether the defendant Wills made the remark to Samuel Emberson, at the close of the conversation with him, as there inquired after. The court manifestly deemed the evidence proposed incompetent, and refused to allow proof of the fact, from this or any other witness. The attention of Emberson had been properly called to the matter; and the decision of the court can only be sustained upon the ground that the attempt was to contradict as to purely collateral matter. <em>(Lawrence </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>5 <em>Wend., </em>301; 2 <em>Phil. Ev., </em>726, <em>Cow. &amp; Hill's ed., </em>1843; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>157.) For correct instances of collateral matter, see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(5 <em>Wend., </em>301), <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(7 <em>id., </em>57). In determining whether the question excluded affected collateral matter only, the court is to decide upon the legal effect of what Emberson had sworn to. In saying that Wills was loitering around his place of business, trying to speak with him, and in denying that Wills made use of the language suggested, did he not virtually swear that Wills all along admitted his guilt? Was not this the impression he must have conveyed to the jury? Was it not vital to the defence to show that, on this occasion, Wills indulged in a manner and language directly inconsistent with what Emberson had sworn he indulged in, when he placed Wills alone with himself in his (W.\u2019s) office, and other places, when and where he could make him speak and act as his (E.\u2019s) feelings might induce him to swear he did ? This is* as strong a case as <em>Patchin </em>v. <em>Astor Mutual Insurance Company </em>(3 <em>Kern., </em>268). . Had the question excluded been put and answered, it would not only have impeached the feature of Emberson\u2019s testimony specifically aimed at, but it would have affected, more or less, his entire evidence in chief. Another view, establishing the error of the court below, is, that Emberson\u2019s evidence in this particular, 'if false, must have been conceived and manufactured in a spirit of hostility\u2014unfriendliness. The rule on this point is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>whatever tends to prove the unfriendly feelings of the witness towards the party against whom he is testifying, is competent. <em>(Starks </em>v. <em>The People, </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>108; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Harris, 2 Seld., </em>345.) Another view is this: If the testimony of Emberson, in the particular adverted to, is false, it would be material within the rule regulating indictments for perjury. \u201c Every question on cross-examination which goes to the credit of the witness is material. <em>(Reg. </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>1 <em>Carr. &amp; Marsh, </em>655.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">VII. The court below erred in excluding the question to the witness Pincus. The object of this evidence was to show that Wills was endeavoring to sell the property in pursuance of instructions, and that he gave an account of the manner in which he became possessed of it, tallying with what Maeder had partially sworn to, and would have fully sworn to if allowed by the court. It disproved .secrecy\u2014concealment on the part of Wills\u2014and established amere business connection with the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">VIII. The offer to show that the plaintiffs in error had endeavored to force on their trial was improperly overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">IX. The court below improperly overruled the motion for the discharge of Conley, at the close of the evidence on both sides. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">X. The court below erred in refusing to charge that if the property embraced in the indictment, or any part of it, was received feloniously in another county, and subsequently brought into this county by the defendants, no conviction could take place under the indictment; and in .charging that, under such circumstances, a conviction could take place. This request went to the jurisdiction of.the court. <em>2 Revised Statutes (p. </em>697, \u00a7 1) defines the jurisdiction of the several courts of this state over crimes. For the more efficacious distribution of government, the principal civil division of the state is into counties. (1 <em>id., </em>83, \u00a7 1.) The judicial arrangements of these counties, as are the other branches of their economy, ar\u00e9 carefully prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>statute, and it is through them the criminal laws of the state are applied and enforced. It may be observed, as a general rule, that offences against public law, although the property of the people of the whole state, are nevertheless to be tried and punished by the courts of the counties within whose limits they occur or are committed; in other words, jurisdiction is local. This was so at. common law. (1 <em>Trials per </em>Pais, 125.) Moreover, at common law, the jury came from the \u201c neighborhood, or place near at hand, or neighbor place where the question (rose) about (which) the fact is (was) moved <em>(id., </em>115): that is, jurors were summoned from the place, where they may have the better and more certain knowledge of the fact.\u201d <em>(Id.) Visne </em>or <em>venue </em>was used in a twofold sense: First. In reference to the jurisdiction of the court; Second. In reference to the place from which the jury were to come. (2 <em>Bouv. L. Dic., </em>\u201c <em>Venue,\u201d </em>\u201c<em>Visne.\u201d) </em>Our statutes proceed upon the principle of the locality of jurisdiction. The only difference is that, under the statutes, a county is a greater extent of territory than the <em>vicinetum </em>of the old law, and juries now are summoned <em>de corpore comi~ tatus. (The People </em>v. <em>Hulse, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>309 ; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>The People, </em>3 <em>Seld., </em>295 ; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Allan, </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>76.) Courts of General Sessions are local courts, in the strictest sense of that term; and as they are of statutory creation, can exercise no powers not clearly conferred or given. Their jurisdiction is conferred at 2 <em>Revised Statutes (p. </em>208, 209, \u00a7 5). By the first subdivision, they are \u201c <em>to inquire of all crimes and. misdemeanors committed or triable in such county.\u201d </em>Triable is used in contradistinction to committed, and means crimes which, although actually committed in one county, are constructively committed in every county through which the proceeds of the crime are carried. (2 <em>id., </em>727, \u00a7 50.) By the second subdivision, these courts are \u201c to hear, determine and punish \u201d all such crimes as do not produce death to the offender, or imprisonment in the state prison for life. The jurisdiction of the New-York General.Sessions (the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>below) has been since extended to crimes causing these consequences. <em>(Laws of </em>1855, 613, \u00a7 1.) If having stolen property in one county, when it was actually received in another, is a distinct offence, the indictment should have alleged that offence specifically. It becomes a statutory offence, and should have been alleged, as all statutory offences are required to be, substantially in the terms of the statute. If the property in question was feloniously received in Kings county, and then brought into this county, the offence here was having it here, and for that the plaintiffs in error should have been indicted. That was the offence triable in the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-5\">XI. The court below erred in refusing to charge the jury that a particular part of Emberson\u2019s evidence was not sufficient, of itself .or by itself, to justify the conviction of Conley ; and in charging the jury that it was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">XII. If the judgment is reversed as to either of the plaintiffs in error, it must be as to both. <em>(2 R. S., </em>736, \u00a7 21; <em>Grah. Pr., </em>960, <em>2d ed.) </em>This seems to be the rule where the reversal takes place on bill of exceptions. <em>(Story </em>v. <em>The N. Y. and Harlem R. R. Co., </em>2 <em>Seld., </em>85.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>A.

The court properly admitted the two specific facts, that Emberson, the witness, received a memorandum of missing goods from the owner, and at a time prior to buying the goods of defendants, because these connected Emberson as the agent of the complainants, and were links to show that his dealings with defendants were not those of a guilty accomplice. A jury are entitled to know at the outset what agency, guilty or innocent, a witness has. (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>382.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-9\">II. The same maybe said of the next exception. (6 <em>Metc., </em>221.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>III. The only construction which can be given to the statute making it the duty of a judge to order a discharge from the record of one defendant against whom there is insufficient evidence is, that the matter is in the discretion of the court, to which no exception lies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">IV. There was jurisdiction in the county of New-York, the evidence of Emberson being that the transaction originated in New-York, where the goods first were seen. They were next in Williamsburgh, and again in New-York. Now, the offence is not the selling to the witness, but the receiving and having before. If, therefore, the jury believed that th\u00e9 goods seen primarily in New-York were stolen goods, the crime then and there attached, however afterward, in pursuance of a proposed sale, they were, on prisoners\u2019 security, moved about.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-6\">V. The point raised on Maeder\u2019s evidence is already <em>res adjudicates </em>in this court, in the case of <em>Rando, </em>and the law is for the prosecution. <em>(MS., dec. at Feb. Gen. Term)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-7\">VI. The court properly excluded the naked declarations of Wills in the course of a conversation about which the prosecution did not offer evidence. They were inadmissible in any aspect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-8\">VII. The naked declarations of Wills were properly excluded, under law of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(3 <em>Hill, </em>194). It was emphatically a declaration of innocence in advance of a charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-9\">VIII. The court properly refused to interfere with the province of the jury, and instruct it whether evidence was or was not sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b500-10\"><em>By the Court, </em>Mitchell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">The plaintiffs in error were indicted and found guilty of feloniously receiving and having, in the city of New-Yo.ik, certain goods knowing that they were stolen. Crane, the owner of the goods, proved that they were stolen, and that he found them afterwards at the house of S. Emberson, the principal witness in the cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>This .alone might lead to the impression that Emberson was an accomplice in the stealing; it might be, however, that he had been employed by Crane to discover and obtain the property. It was proper, therefore, to prove how he became connected with the business, and Emberson was therefore properly allowed to testify that he had, when he went to Wills\u2019 office or store, a memorandum of the goods and that he had procured it from Mr. Crane one or two days before he went to Williamsburgh for the goods, and that when he bought the goods of the prisoners he paid them $2000, which money he got in a check from Mr. Crane. Crane also testified that he had written a letter to Emberson. This evidence shows that Emberson, instead of being the accomplice of the prisoners, was the agent of the owner of the goods, aiding him to recover them. His testimony, for this reason, is admissible without corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">A motion was made to the court to discharge Conley, on the assumption that there was no proof against him. It is too clear for dispute, that there was evidence to j ustify the jury in convicting Wills. Wills and Conley were in the same store, at the corner of Broadway and Worth-street, consisting of two rooms in a line, and a back or private office. Both were there on the tenth of January, when Emberson was there, and on the eleventh. The first day Wills took Emberson into the back office and asked him if he would buy stolen goods. It does not appear that Wills took Emberson to the back office on the second day, and it does appear that Emberson saw Conley as well as Wills at the store on that day, on two occasions; first, as he was going down town, and afterwards, on his return, at eleven, A. M., and it would seem that Conley was present at all the conversation on this day, when Wills asked Emberson if he would buy, and said he would show samples of them; the witness, speaking of his return to the store a little after eleven o\u2019clock, says: \u201c I saw Wills and Conley ; I asked again to see samples of the goods; he\u201d (Wills) \u201csent Conley after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>them ; he told Conley to be careful that any one was not watching; he\u201d (Conley) \u201cwas gone about fifteen minutes; he then came in with samples buttoned up inside of his coat; he\u201d (Conley) \u201cwent into a private room, and left them there; Wills and I went in and examined them ; he locked the door.\u201d Emberson, on cross-examination, said \u201cthat when Wills sent Conley for the samples, he told him to be careful if Pincus was watching him.\u201d The locking of the door, the direction to Conley to be careful that any one was not watching; to be careful if Pincus was watching him, although acts of Wills, were done, the first in the presence of Conley, and the others in speaking to him, and showed to him that the transaction was one that needed concealment, and was probably criminal. His acting under such orders, and his concealing the samples by buttoning them inside of his coat, and taking them into the private office, were strong evidence that he knew the business of his employer, and that the goods were to be concealed, and that he was to be careful that he was not watched, because they had been stolen. Secrecy and\" concealment have always been evidences of consciousness of guilt. In addition to this, Conley, when searched, had on him this memorandum, which corresponded in general description with the stolen goods, although one of them contained some articles in addition ; and Pincus, in his testimony for the defence, speaks (as Emberson did in substance, for the prosecution) of the store as \u201ctheir place of business,\u201d after saying he had known Wills and Conley for about two years. The motion to discharge Conley was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">A motion to dismiss the case, on the ground that it did not appear that either of the prisoners bought or received any of the property within the city of New York, was also properly overruled. The samples were received by Wills here from Conley, after Conley had been absent but fifteen minutes to get them ; that was evidence that he did not get them from Williamsburgh, but within the county of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>York; and although the bulk of the articles was then in Williamsburgh, it was very probable that all were received here, and the bulk removed there for concealment, until the contrary should be proved. In this city was the prisoners\u2019 store, where they transacted their business in form, in loaning money on goods pledged. The house in Williamsburgh was only a place, apparently, for storing and concealing the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">On behalf of the prisoners, a witness was allowed to testify that he was at Wills\u2019 store about the middle of the second week in January, when a man came in with samples of goods, consisting of bosoms, embroidered collars, and dark or black veils and babies\u2019 waists, and said he wanted to raise two thousand dollars on them. The court refused to allow him to answer the question, \u201cDid he say anything as to the manner in which he became possessed of the property; and if so, what did he say?\u201d In the case of .Eando, this court at the February term, by a majority vote, held that a very similar question could not be put. It may well be that where the question is whether, at the time when goods were received, the receiver knew that they were stolen, and the inquiry is merely as to his knowledge, and all that is then done in acts may be proved, that all that is then said, which could have influenced his opinion, may also be proved. But it is deemed most proper -not to treat this as an open question here, and to leave it to a higher court to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The prisoners offered to .prove that, in a conversation between Wills and S. Emberson on the Eighth-avenue, Wills had said to Emberson that he, Wills, would not give three cents to settle the matter; that he wished to have the case fully investigated. This was offered, not as evidence admissible of itself, but to impeach and contradict Emberson. The declarations of Wills were not evidence of themselves in his behalf; Emberson\u2019s testimony, that Wills had not said so, was brought out by the prisoners themselves on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>cross-examination by them. A party cannot cross-examine a witness as to such matter, and then impeach by contradicting him. The original question was probably inadmissible ; if admissible at all, it could be only as a mode of impeaching the witness by collateral matter; and in such case, the party bringing out the first answer must abide by it. If the question had been as to what Emberson had said, and the thing said was a contradiction of'his previous testimony, the rule would be different: as if he had been asked if he had not said that Conley was not in the store when he went there, or that Wills had told him that he had loaned money on the goods, instead of saying, as Emberson testified in his direct examination, that they had been \u201cpulled\u201d or \u201c drawn;\u201d then another witness might be called to show that Conley had said so, not with a view to contradict the cross-examination, but to contradict his testimony on the direct examination, the cross-examination being necessary only to give the witness an opportunity to explain the inconsistency between his testimony under oath and his prior out-door remarks; and, except for this reason, any other person being competent to testify to the contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The question, \u201c Was anything said by Wills as to what the property was doing at the store, 333 Broadway?\u201d was properly excluded. It was not the proper mode of showing that he exposed the goods publicly, as is now suggested to have been the object of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The judge was requested to charge the jury, that if they believed that the defendant first bought or in any way received the goods in Kings county, and afterwards brought them into New-York, and there exposed them for sale, they could not be convicted under this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The statute is, that the receiver of stolen goods \u201cmay be indicted, tried and convicted where he received or had such property, notwithstanding such theft was committed in another county.\u201d (2 <em>R. S., </em>726, \u00a7 43.) The revisers\u2019 note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to this section is: \u201c <em>New. </em>In analogy to the rule which allows a prosecution for theft in any county where the stolen goods shall be carried. There is a similar English statute.\u201d (3 <em>R. S., </em>844, 845, <em>2d </em>ed.) The English statute is, that the receiver may be prosecuted. \u201c in any county or place in which he shall have, or shall have had, any such property in his possession\u201d <em>(2 Russ. on Cr., </em>238), not using the word \u201c received\u201d as our statute does. This shows that the natural meaning of our statute is its true meaning, and that it was intended to allow the trial in any county where the prisoner either received the property at first, or at any time after-wards had it. The words, \u201c or had,\u201d are unmeaning without this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
