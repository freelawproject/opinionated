The appeal involves the legal effect of respondent Joe J. Correia\u2019s (Correia) preemptory right, set out in a lease, to purchase real property owned by respondent Norene Stokes (Stokes). Stokes was lessor. All parties have agreed appellant\u2019s complaint presented issues of law only, and that a motion for summary judgment was the appropriate vehicle for resolution of the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Plaintiff and appellant, Norman Rollins (Rollins), filed a complaint for declaratory relief naming respondents, Stokes and Correia, as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The complaint essentially prayed that respondent Correia should be declared to have no right to acquire ownership of the leased property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The lower court ruled that Correia\u2019s \u201coption\u201d under the lease between himself and Stokes was prior in time and superior to the rights of appellant to purchase (under the terms of a later option to purchase given by Stokes to appellant Rollins). In this connection the trial court made detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Among the findings and conclusions the court found and concluded that appellant was granted a valid option by Stokes but that it was subject to the prior rights of Correia. The court further found that at all relevant times appellant had full knowledge of the terms of the Correia lease including the so-called option provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The facts in this case are taken from decl\u00e1rations and various documents filed with the court. The lease in question was of farm property in Tulare County and was entered into on January 1, 1975. The term ended on December 31, 1977. The critical clause in the lease provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u201cOption: Should Lessors intend to sell the said real property during the term hereof, or any lawful extension hereof, they will first notify Lessee of any offer for the purchase of said property, and Lessee shall thereafter have the option for a period of 15 days within which to purchase the same upon the same terms and conditions as Lessor is willing to sell to any other persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The following facts are set out in appellant\u2019s declaration. For a long period of time appellant Rollins, a licensed real estate broker whose principal business was buying and selling real estate for his own account, was advertising that he was interested in buying property. Stokes contacted appellant, who looked at the Stokes property in question. Stokes at that time showed appellant the Correia lease and Stokes read the lease. The two of them then discussed the \u201coption\u201d provision set out in the lease. Appellant asked Stokes if she knew Correia had a right to purchase the property if she offered it for sale and Stokes said she did. Appellant then stated \u201cI am not interested in bidding against your tenant and we\u2019ll have to overcome that problem before I would purchase the property and that I was not interested in the property unless I could get around the lease.\u201d Appellant and Stokes then discussed the possibility of an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The next day, February 9th, appellant and Stokes signed an \u201cOption To Purchase.\u201d The option described the subject property and provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201c... a Purchase Price Of $36,000.00 (Thirty six thousand Dollars), upon the following Terms And Conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201c$18,000. cash down payment including the above $1,000. 18,000. by a note, secured by a deed of trust on the subject property, executed by Rollins in favor of Stokes. Note to be payable in annual installments of $1500. or more per year plus interest at 7-1/2% per annum on deferred balances. The first payment of principal &amp; interest shall be due one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>year from the recording of deed. Deed of trust shall not encumber the northwest 208\u2019 x 208\u2019 of the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201c1. This option shall not be exercised prior to Jan. 5, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201c2. All closing costs are to be charged according to normal Tulare County customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201c3. Optionor is aware that optionee is a licensed real estate broker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We note that the option could only be exercised after the lease had expired on December 31, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Appellant gave Stokes a $1,000 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In her declaration, Stokes agreed that prior to signing the option to purchase, she told appellant that Correia had an option to purchase and that she did not believe appellant \u201ccould set the date ahead,\u201d and she \u201cwould have to tell Mr. Correia about it.\u201d This angered appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">On February 11, 1977, Stokes and appellant signed a \u201cMemorandum of Option\u201d for recording purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">About five days later, appellant\u2019s attorney received a letter from Stokes\u2019 attorney stating in essence that respondent Correia had to be offered the property on the same terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">According to the proof of service, on March 4, 1977, Stokes caused to be served a copy of the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d and the following notice on respondent Correia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">\u201cJoe J. Correia, 6739 Ave. 290, Visalia, California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">\u201cYou are hereby notified that I have had an offer to purchase the property now under lease to you under the Farm Lease dated January 1, 1975 as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">\u201cFor a total price of $36,000.00 payable $1,000.00 down payment at this time, the further sum of $17,000.00 cash not later than February 9, 1978, at which time I would give you a deed to the property and you would execute a note for the remaining $18,000.00 payable in install<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ments of $1500.00 or more per year together with interest at the rate of 7-1/2% on unpaid balances.

Mr. Correia\u2019s desire to exercise his option to purchase as communicated to you in our telephone conversation of March 7, 1977.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">On March 14, 1977, Stokes\u2019 attorney wrote to appellant\u2019s attorney that Correia desired to exercise his option to purchase the property owned by Stokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On March 18th, Stokes\u2019 attorney received a $1,000 check from Correia\u2019s attorney. (This was the 14th day after notice by Stokes to Correia.) According to Stokes\u2019 attorney\u2019s declaration, the attorney also received a letter from Correia\u2019s attorney indicating that the payment represented the initial payment under an option to purchase the property \u201cto be executed by [Stokes] and [Correia] upon the exact terms as set forth in the Option to Purchase dated February 9, 1977, and signed by [appellant].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On March 24, 1977, Stokes\u2019 attorney acknowledged receipt of the $1,000 check. Subsequently (apparently on or after March 31, 1977, the 27th day after the notice) Stokes\u2019 attorney received an \u201cOption To Purchase\u201d signed by Correia dated February 9, 1977. That document was practically identical to appellant\u2019s option to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Shortly after January 3, 1978, Stokes\u2019 attorney received a letter and check for $17,000 from Correia\u2019s attorney, which was the balance of the $18,000 down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On February 6, 1978, appellant notified Stokes that he was exercising his option to purchase Stokes\u2019 property pursuant to the February 9, 1977 written option.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The issues raised by appellant are first, whether the granting of the option to appellant triggered respondent Correia\u2019s preemptory right to purchase, and second, whether respondent Correia failed to exercise his preemptory right according to the applicable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Appellant argues that Correia\u2019s preemptory right was only operative with respect to a <em>sale </em>during the lease term. Appellant interprets the clause in the lease to mean that the intended sale must be during the term of the lease. Further, the <em>intent to sell </em>which may be formulated during the lease does not trigger Correia\u2019s preemptory rights. Appellant hypothesizes that if Stokes had telephoned him the day after the lease expired and offered to sell the property, Correia should not be able to argue that Stokes had formulated the intent to sell during the lease term and that, therefore, he was entitled to notice and a preemptory right to purchase. Appellant also urges there was no intended sale during the lease term as appellant\u2019s option did not permit him to purchase the property until after the expiration of the lease term. Thus, again Correia\u2019s preemptory rights never came into being.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Appellant also relies on cases which hold that an option is not a sale of real property (see, e.g., <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Christeson </em>(1917) 174 Cal. 712, 716 [164 P. 395]), so here the grant of the option to appellant did not constitute a sale of any interest in the property. Thus there is \u201cagain no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>basis for holding that the pre-emptive [sic] purchase rights set forth in the lease became operative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Respondents filed a joint brief. They argue that the formulation of an intent to sell during the lease period triggered Correia\u2019s option to purchase; that Correia had a preemptory right to purchase and the decision to sell is critical, not the actual sale. Furthermore, respondents argue Stokes agreed to sell to appellant during the lease term as the option with appellant created a unilateral contract binding on Stokes, and when appellant decided to exercise the option a bilateral contract was created. <em>(Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>BBTC Company </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 494 [113 Cal.Rptr. 705, 521 P.2d 1097].) Also, appellant\u2019s exercise or acceptance of the option related back to the giving of the option which was within the lease term. Thus under any of these theories Correia\u2019s preemptory right came into being.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Respondents also contend that appellant intended to circumvent the object of the parties to the lease which was to give Correia an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Neither party points to any extrinsic evidence to aid in interpreting the written instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">As a result, we apply the general rule restated in <em>Davies Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Pine Mountain Club, Inc. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 18, 23 [113 Cal.Rptr. 784]: \u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a written instrument where no conflicting extrinsic evidence is received, an appellate court is not bound by the trial court\u2019s ruling but must give the writing its own independent interpretation.\u201d (See also 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) \u00a7\u00a7 257-260, pp. 4248-4251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">In <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Enzler </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 872, 876 [132 Cal.Rptr. 553], the court aptly described an option contract:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">\u201cIt is well established that an option is not a sale of property, but rather a sale of a right to purchase. The option becomes a contract of sale binding on both parties only on acceptance of the option by the optionee. This does not mean, however, that a new contract is in fact made by and at the time of the acceptance. On the contrary, the contract has already been made as far as the optionor is concerned, but is merely subject to conditions which are removed by acceptance [citations omitted].\u201d (See also <em>Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>BBTC Company, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 494, 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>On the other hand, a preemptive right gives the holder the first right to buy when and if the owner later wants to sell. If the holder does not buy, the owner of the property may sell to anyone. Conversely, an option gives the holder a power to compel a sale regardless of whether the owner then wants to sell. <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Reisner </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 161, 166 [331 P.2d 17]; <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Lemmens </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 167, 171 [40 Cal.Rptr. 803] [the preemptive right is \u201cactivated\u201d when the owner has elected to sell]; see also 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) \u00a7 131, pp. 127-128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">At the outset, there does not seem to be any dispute by the parties that the lease granted respondent Correia a preemptive right. Although the term \u201coption\u201d was used in the subject clause, the label does not control. (See 1A Corbin; Contracts (1963) \u00a7 261 A, pp. 483-491.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">It may also be noted that the lessee Correia\u2019s first right of refusal or preemptive right was part of the consideration for his covenants under the lease. (See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Reisner, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d 161, 165-166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">What then triggered Correia\u2019s preemptive right to purchase? The intent of the parties was that once a third party made an offer to Stokes that she was willing to accept, Stokes was required to notify Correia, whereupon Correia\u2019s preemptive right ripened into an option to purchase the property according to the terms and conditions of the third party\u2019s offer. The lease provision makes this clear as Correia had 15 days within which to purchase the property upon the same terms and conditions that Stokes was willing to sell to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Accordingly, when Stokes manifested her intent to sell the property by entering into the option contract with appellant and subsequently notified Correia, the preemptive right was activated. As stated in Corbin:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u201cAn owner of land may receive 50 offers to buy it every single day, but if he does not care to sell the land, those 50 offers are not legally operative to give the holder of the right of first refusal the power to buy. It is the owner\u2019s selection of a particular offer as one he might be willing to accept, and his manifestation of that willingness by communicating the particular offer to the holder of the right which gives the holder a present power of buying the land on the terms of that offer.\u201d (1A Corbin, Contracts (1980 Pocket Supp.) \u00a7 261, p. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Such an interpretation is consistent with the conduct of the respondents, which is persuasive evidence in determining the meaning of written instruments. <em>(Davies Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Pine Mountain Club, Inc., supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d at p. 26; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) \u00a7 527, p. 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Within a month after Stokes signed appellant\u2019s option contract, Stokes notified Correia pursuant to the lease so that Correia could make his election. Correia then communicated to Stokes his desire to exercise his preemptive right. Significantly respondents proceeded under the preemptive clause of the lease even though appellant\u2019s option could only be exercised after the lease had expired. It is evident from respondents\u2019 conduct that they treated appellant\u2019s option contract, regardless of the postlease exercise clause, as equivalent to an \u201coffer for the purchase\u201d of the subject property so as to trigger Stokes\u2019 lease obligations and Correia\u2019s preemptive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We note that we do not have the type of situation suggested by appellant wherein Stokes, the lessor, merely entertained a subjective intent to sell the property (to no one in particular) and then after the lease expired, contacted a prospective buyer. If this were such a case, Correia would be hardpressed to assert his preemptive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Rather, the parties to the lease contemplated some objective manifestation of Stokes\u2019 intent to sell the property based on a third party\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">As an additional grounds to uphold the judgment, we look to option contract theory. From the lessor\u2019s or optionor\u2019s point of view (i.e,, Stokes), there was a contract to sell the property during the lease term. <em>(Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>BBTC Company, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 494, 503-504.) When Stokes signed appellant\u2019s \u201coption to purchase\u201d she was contractually bound to sell the property to appellant if appellant exercised that option. Not only was there a contract to sell but once appellant exercised his option, the right to acquire the property related back to the time of the giving of the option <em>(Seeburg </em>v. <em>El Royale Corp. </em>(1942) 54 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [128 P.2d 362]; <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Enzler, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.2d 872, 876), which in this case was during the term of the lease. On either of these two grounds Stokes, for purposes of activating the preemptive right, sold the property during the lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Thus the trial court was correct in ruling that although appellant may have had a valid option contract, his rights were subject to those of Correia. Simply stated, Correia\u2019s preemptive right was triggered during the lease term when we look to the theories of option and preemptive rights and the conduct of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Appellant next argues Correia failed to exercise his preemptory right according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The \u201coption\u201d clause in the lease did not specify a method for the exercise of the preemptive right. In this case we find it appropriate to analogize to the exercise of an option contract.  Hence, when the provisions of an option contract prescribe the particular manner in which the option is to be exercised, they must be strictly followed. <em>(Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>BBTC Company, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 494, 498.) Nevertheless, when the option contract merely suggests but does not positively require a particular means of communicating the exercise of the option, another method of communication is not precluded. (Ib<em>id; </em>see also <em>Erich </em>v. <em>Granoff </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 920, 929 [167 Cal.Rptr. 538].)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The evidence reveals that Correia on two occasions notified Stokes\u2019 attorney that he intended to exercise his preemptive right to purchase the subject property. First, on March 9th or 10th Stokes attorney received a letter from Correia\u2019s attorney expressing Correia\u2019s desire to exercise his right. Second, on March 18th (the 14th day after Correia\u2019s receipt of the notice), Correia sent Stokes a $1,000 check representing the initial payment under an option to purchase to be executed by Stokes and Correia upon the exact terms as appellant\u2019s February 9 option.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Thus Correia validly exercised his preemptive right by way of his attorney\u2019s two letters and payment of $1,000, all of which were done within the 15 days specified in the lease clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Additionally, we hold that Stokes waived any defective performance in terms of Correia\u2019s compliance with the 15-day notice which required Correia to \"... evidence [his] matching [appellant\u2019s] offer within 15 days by delivering to [Stokes] a check and [his] written agreement to purchase on [those] terms.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We have already pointed out that Stokes\u2019 attorney received Correia\u2019s $1,000 check before the 15th day after Stokes\u2019 notice to Correia concerning appellant\u2019s option. It has also been pointed out that Stokes did not receive Correia\u2019s written option agreement until after the 15th day. Nevertheless, we find Correia acted in a timely manner. His documentation was in substantial compliance with his right and the demand of Stokes. Furthermore, Stokes was satisfied.  Although acceptance must be in the terms of the option agreement, an optionor can waive one or more of the terms. <em>(Riverside Fence Co. </em>v. <em>Novak </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 656, 660 [78 Cal.Rptr. 536].) If an optionor does not specify the alleged defects in the tender by the optionee, then a waiver results. <em>(Layton </em>v. <em>West </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 508, 512 [76 Cal.Rptr. 507].) The reason for this rule is that an optionee should be able to remedy any defects in his tender and prevent the optionor from remaining silent at the time of the tender and later surprise the optionee with hidden objections. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This court believes the same rules should apply to the exercise of a preemptive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">So although Correia did not deliver his matching offer within the 15-day period provided for in the notice, he substantially complied and Stokes waived any defective tender. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Nonetheless, appellant seizes on the language that Correia had 15 days within which to \u201cpurchase\u201d arguing that Correia had to purchase the property and not merely procure an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Read literally, appellant is correct. However, as we have stated, the intent of that clause was to grant Correia a preemptive right to enter into an agreement with Stokes on the same terms and conditions of an acceptable third-party offer. In this case the third party\u2019s offer was an option contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Further, appellant\u2019s literal interpretation is without merit because it would frustrate Correia\u2019s preemptory right to purchase. For instance, by using an option contract, appellant could prevent a \u201cpurchase\u201d from taking place within 15 days. The reason, of course, is that the option <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>under appellant\u2019s option contract could not be exercised until well after the 15th day from Correia\u2019s receipt of the notice. Despite Stokes\u2019 intent to sell the property during the lease term, appellant\u2019s use of an option contract with a delayed exercise clause was designed effectively to foreclose Correia from exercising his preemptive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Such a result is inconsistent with the intent and the conduct of the parties to the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Respondent Stokes is satisfied with respondent Correia\u2019s performance. Appellant should not be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Franson, Acting P. J., and Hanson (P.
