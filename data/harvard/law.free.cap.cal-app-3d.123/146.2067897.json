They further maintain that the condemner\u2019s offer of compensation was unreasonable, that their demand was reasonable, and therefore that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Declarations upon which the motion was submitted reveal these facts. Rose Highsmith owned a two-thirds interest in a 30,000 square foot parcel of property on East Fourteenth Street in San Leandro, Alameda County. Her sister-in-law, Palmira T. Armanino, owned the other one-third interest as trustee of the Dominic C. Armanino Trust. Dominic, the brother of Rose, was trustor and a beneficiary of the trust created in 1973; he had also been the developer and manager of the subject property since its acquisition in 1952. A 2-story, steel and brick building measuring 1 920 square feet had been constructed on the property and the building was leased to the Red Barn, a fast-food restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The City of San Leandro, desiring to acquire the parcel for public street purposes, contracted in early 1978 with the State of California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) for an appraisal of the property. Relying on the CalTrans appraised value of $160,000, which included $24,900 for the leasehold interest, the city offered appellants $160,000 for acquisition of the property. Appellants refused the offer and hired Richard Laurence, certified public accountant (CPA), to appraise the property and to assist in negotiations with the city. No progress was made, and in April 1978 appellants hired Attorney Melvin C. Kerwin to represent them in the eminent domain proceeding. Their contract with Kerwin provided for payment to him of 40 percent of any amount in excess of $200,000, recovered by judgment, as fees for his legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In April 1978, the city filed its proceeding and thereafter deposited with the State Treasurer the sum of $160,000 as probable compensation. The city employed John D. Andrews, M.A.I., for a second appraisal, and in July 1978 he placed a value of $250,000 on the property. In November 1978, the city retained Attorney Michael R. Nave as associate counsel in charge of litigation. In discussions with the city attorney, Nave learned that the city \u201cverbally increased its offer to defendants to the sum of $250,000\u201d at an unspecified time after Andrews\u2019 appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Trial was set for June 11, 1979. The parties do not agree when this date was set, but it was confirmed in appellants\u2019 conference statement dated May 18, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In early May, Nave was aware that the trial date was fast approaching and instituted discovery proceedings. On May 11, 1979 (31 days before the June 11 trial date and before taking depositions), he filed the city\u2019s section 1250.410 offer of $250,000 and served it on appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Dominic Armanino was deposed by Nave on May 14, 1979 (28 days before June 11), at which time Dominic expressed his opinion that his property had a value of $550,000, based on $10 per square foot for the land and $250,000 for improvements. Nave concluded that Dominic\u2019s opinion was without factual support and failed to take depreciation into account. He therefore \u201cdid not believe that it was advisable to increase the City\u2019s final offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Attorney Kerwin states that settlement was attempted at the pretrial conference on May 17, 1979, when $550,000 was reiterated \u201cas defendants\u2019 demand.\u201d He also states that on May 18, 1979, defendants \u201cserved and filed\u201d their settlement conference statement and that it recited the offer of $250,000 and the demand of $550,000. The statement also recited the separate issue of compensation to the lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">On May 21, 1979, the city\u2019s appraiser, Andrews, was deposed, and he again stated a fair market value of $250,000. The condemn\u00e9es\u2019 appraiser, Fox, was also deposed on that date, and he opined a value of between $275,000 and $324,000. Attorney Nave \u201cdid not recommend an increase in the City\u2019s offer, because he viewed Fox\u2019s appraisal as not significantly greater than Andrews\u2019, because he thought it was lacking in proper foundation, and because trial was only 21 days away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">On May 24, 1979, the settlement conference was held. Kerwin states that the offer and demand of $250,000 and $550,000 were reiterated, that no settlement was reached, and that trial was set for June 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>On May 29, 1979, the condemnees\u2019 CPA, Richard Laurence, was deposed. His methodology strengthened Attorney Nave\u2019s conviction that the condemnees\u2019 valuation testimony was unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The cause was set for trial June 11. Because no court was available that day, the trial was continued to August 13, 1979. No further discovery was undertaken during this two-month interval.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On July 27, 1979 (17 days before the continued trial date), the condemnees prepared a \u201cFinal Demand for Compensation,\u201d asking $450,000. The document was filed July 30, 1979 (14 days before trial). Nave felt that it was inadvisable to increase the city\u2019s offer in view of the fact \u201cthat this demand was $126,000 higher than the high range of Mr. Fox\u2019s deposition testimony, and there was no indication that defendants had fired Mr. Fox.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Apparently there were no further offers or demands before commencement of the jury trial on August 13, 1979, which resulted in an award of $410,000, plus interest, as compensation to appellants for the taking of their property. Attorney\u2019s fees (40 percent of the excess over $200,000) amounted to $84,000, plus interest of $5,880.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The interlocutory judgment of condemnation was entered on September 26, 1979, and on October 22, appellants moved for litigation expenses pursuant to section 1250.410. The motion, submitted on declarations, memoranda of points and authorities, and argument, was denied. Appellants filed timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">When ruling on a motion for litigation expenses under section 1250.410, the trial court is not required to make express findings. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Sunshine Canyon, Inc. </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 599, 604-605 [156 Cal.Rptr. 552]; cf. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>C. F. Bolster Co. </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 906, 916-918 [146 Cal.Rptr. 789].) The trial court herein did not make findings. It may have denied appellants\u2019 motion because it found (1) appellants\u2019 final demand was not timely; (2) respondent\u2019s offer was reasonable; or (3) ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>pellants\u2019 demand was unreasonable. The trial court resolved one or more of these issues adversely to appellants. on the basis of declarations.  \u201c[I]n the consideration of an appeal from an order made upon affidavits [or declarations] involving the decision of a question of fact, an appellate court is bound by the same rule that controls it where oral testimony is presented for review. If there is any conflict in the affidavits, those in favor of the prevailing party must be taken as true, and the facts stated therein must be considered as established.\u201d <em>(Fuller </em>v. <em>Lindenbaum </em>(1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 227, 230 [84 P.2d 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\n<em>Timely Filing and Service of Demand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Appellants contend that respondent was apprised of their demand for $550,000 as just compensation when Dominic Armanino, one of the owners, gave his opinion of the value in his deposition on May 14, 1979, when that figure was set forth in appellants\u2019 pretrial statement for the conference on May 17, and again when that figure was used as the demand in their settlement conference statement \u201cserved and filed\u201d on May 18. They acknowledge that these three events occurred within thirty days of June 11, the date trial was originally set. They urge, however, that the 30-day period should be measured from August 13, the actual trial date, even though that date had been set because of court congestion on June 11. Appellants concede that they did not file a separate, formal demand 30 days before either trial date. They explain that their \u201cFinal Demand for Compensation\u201d of $450,000 filed on July 30, 1979, does not go \u201cto the question of whether appellants are entitled to the recovery of litigation expenses, but [to] the amount of litigation expenses to be awarded\u201d under section 1250.410, subdivision (b). In essence, appellants allege that they \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the notice requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Attorney\u2019s fees can be recovered only if such recovery is specifically authorized by statute or by agreement of the parties. (\u00a7 1021.)  A prevailing plaintiff (property owner) in an inverse condemnation proceeding is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, appraisers\u2019 fees and engineering fees actually incurred, in addition to costs, as a matter of right. (\u00a7 1036.) The property owner in an eminent domain proceeding, however, can recover such litigation expenses only by meeting the requirements set forth in section 1250.410.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Section 1250.410, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cAt least 30 days prior to the date of trial, the plaintiff <em>shall </em>file with the court and serve on the defendant its final offer of compensation in the proceeding and the defendant <em>shall </em>file and serve on the plaintiff his final demand for compensation in the proceeding. Service shall be in the manner prescribed by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 2.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in the statute means that the 30-day period is mandatory. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 14; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Callahan Brothers </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 541, 543-544 [138 Cal.Rptr. 239];<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see <em>Lake County Sanitation Dist. </em>v. <em>Schultz </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 658, 668-669 [149 Cal.Rptr. 717]; Condemnation Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar Supp. 1981) Pretrial Offer and Demand, \u00a7 9.14A, p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellants, citing <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Patton Mission Properties </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 204 [152 Cal.Rptr. 485], maintain that the 30-day notice must be measured from the actual trial date rather than the original trial date. <em>Patton </em>does not support appellants\u2019 position. In that case, the court, at defendant property owner\u2019s request during the mandatory settlement conference in December 1976, continued the trial from January 31 to August 15, 1977. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 213, fn. 6.) The condemner had served and filed an offer more than 30 days prior to the first trial date, and appellants made their first demand on July 15, 31 days before the actual trial date. The court held that \u201cappellants\u2019 demands were unreasonable in the light of their failure to communicate them to respondent in the face of respondent\u2019s previous offers.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The original trial date is the proper one for measuring the 30-day notice. To hold otherwise would encourage procrastination in making an offer or demand and would delay meaningful negotiations. \u201c[The] purpose [of the statute] is to encourage early settlement so trial can be avoided\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Callahan Brothers, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d at p. 543), and the statute imposes upon \u201cboth parties to the litigation the duty to act reasonably in an effort to settle the disputes.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Patton Mission </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Properties, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d at p. 213, italics omitted.) To allow either party to gamble on a delay in the trial court would not serve the purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"> Appellants failed to make their demand within the 30-day time limit which determines entitlement to litigation expenses (see <em>Lake County Sanitation Dist. </em>v. <em>Schultz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. 669), and thus the trial court properly denied their motion for such expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We further hold that a recital of the demand and offer in a settlement conference statement, or in any other document, is not an adequate substitute for the formal demand and offer contemplated by section 1250.410 unless the parties have stipulated to a less formal exchange. The Legislature did not direct the parties to \u201capprise\u201d each other or \u201ccommunicate\u201d with each other about an offer or demand. It mandated that a \u201cfinal offer of compensation\u201d and a \u201cfinal demand for compensation\u201d shall be served on the opposing party and filed with the court in the manner prescribed for service of a notice of motion.  Thus, even if the actual trial date were the measuring date, appellants failed to file a demand meeting the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Offer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We have concluded that appellants failed to file a timely demand which precluded an award of litigation expenses and that the court properly denied their motion for that reason. Since we are unable to determine the basis for the court\u2019s denial of the motion, however, we have reviewed the offer and demand on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">In denying the motion the trial court implicitly found (1) that respondent\u2019s offer was reasonable, and/or (2) that appellants\u2019 demand was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>unreasonable, both \u201cviewed in the light of the evidence admitted and the compensation awarded in the proceeding, ...\u201d (\u00a7 1250.410, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u201cReasonableness of the final offer and demand presents factual issues which depend not only upon the percentage of difference in the monetary amounts of the offer and demand but also on the good faith, care and accuracy in the determination of those amounts, all of which are matters to be evaluated by the fact finder.\u201d <em>(Coachella Valley County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Dreyfuss, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 958, citing <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Societa Di Unione E Beneficenza Italiana, supra, </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 14, 23 [150 Cal.Rptr. 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Respondent\u2019s Offer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Since respondent\u2019s highest and final offer was $160,000 lower than the $410,000 compensation awarded and was only 61 percent of that figure, if mathematical considerations alone were to be considered it would be arguable that as a matter of law the offer was unreasonable. (See, e.g., <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>State Pub. Works Bd. </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 33, 39 [153 Cal.Rptr. 156], Weiner, J., dis., stating, \u201cIn every case where the ratio of offer to verdict was less than 80 percent, the offer was held to be unreasonable.\u201d) As we have just stated, however, the trial court was required to consider other factors including good faith, and care and accuracy in arriving at the final offer. <em>(Schultz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. 667; see also <em>Patton, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d at pp. 209-212, and cases discussed therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u201cWhere the reasonableness of an offer by a condemning agency has been factually determined by the trial judge, the determination must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. The measure of reasonableness is, in the first instance, a factual matter for the trial court [citation]. Conflicts in the evidence are for the trial court. As a factual determination supported by the evidence, the trial court\u2019s finding of reasonableness, along with the judgment, is entitled to a broad presumption of validity on appeal [citations].\u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 36-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We look to Attorney Nave\u2019s declaration for substantial evidence in support of a finding of reasonableness. Nave is a specialist in condemnation law. Over the past 12 years he had represented about 25 public agencies, and in so doing he had acquired about 200 parcels of improved and unimproved real property in urban and rural areas of California. He had studied and become familiar with many aspects of real estate appraisal techniques and construction estimating. After he assumed control of the case for respondent, he reviewed the work of the city appraiser, John D. Andrews, M.A.I., upon whose suggestion the offer of $250,000 was made. Nave with Andrews inspected all the comparable sales in the San Leandro area on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Nave stated that in preparing his appraisal Andrews employed each of the three commonly accepted valuation approaches\u2014comparable sales [\u201cmarket data\u201d], income [\u201cCapitalization\u201d or \u201ccap\u201d], and reproduction less depreciation [\u201ccost\u201d] (see Condemnation Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar 1973) \u00a7 4.25, p. 57 (hereinafter cited as CEB), from which the quoted terms in brackets are taken).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Nave stated that since Andrews found no sales of fast-food restaurants in the vicinity of the subject parcel (i.e., comparable to the Red Barn property in issue), he investigat\u00e9d sales and leases of fast-food restaurants as far away as Sacramento in order to discover building costs, lease rates and rates of return, to aid him in using the three valuation approaches. Additionally, Andrews investigated and discussed the performance history of the Red Barn with representatives of the parent company, and he inspected the Red Barn, measuring and photographing the interior and exterior of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The above constitutes substantial evidence in support of a finding that respondent\u2019s offer of $250,000 made on May 11, 1979, was reasonable, as it appears to have been determined with good faith, care and accuracy. (See <em>Turner, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Respondent\u2019s alleged refusal to reevaluate its offer must also be taken into account in determining whether, ultimately, its final offer of the same amount was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Nave declared in detail the reasons for respondent\u2019s position of standing firm on its offer. It appeared at Dominic\u2019s deposition on May 14, 1979, that the condemnees\u2019 opinion of a fair market value of $550,000 was \u201cpremised upon a square foot cost of $10.00 for 30,000 square feet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and $250,000.00 for the cost of reproducing the restaurant building. Not only were both figures without factual support, but Mr. Armanino did not depreciate the 13 year old building.\u201d Nave attached to his declaration copies of pages of the deposition supporting this allegation. This evidence provided substantial support for a determination that the condemner acted in good faith when it refused to increase its offer after Dominic\u2019s demand. (Turner, <em>supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at pp. 37-38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Nave\u2019s declaration also detailed his reasons for standing firm after deposing C. Warren Fox (appellants\u2019 real estate appraiser) and Richard Laurence (their CPA). As to Fox\u2019s testimony, Nave stated that Fox \u201ctestified that he never inspected the interior of the Red Bam restaurant; that an appraiser whose name he could not recall gave him 4 sales in the vicinity; that he did not confirm these sales; that he had no other sales other than the 4; that he had not employed an income approach; that his range of value for the subject was $275,000.00 to $324,000.00; that the contractor he consulted for reproduction costs did not know the size of the Red Barn building because Mr. Fox had not seen the plans for the building.\u201d This too was supported by copies of pages of Fox\u2019s deposition, attached to the Nave declaration as exhibit B. Nave declined to increase respondent\u2019s offer at this point because (1) trial was to occur in 21 days (the original trial date of June 11); (2) Fox had done nothing but rely on unconfirmed sales; and (3) Fox\u2019s range of value was not significantly greater than the valuation set by respondent\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Nave stated that the Laurence deposition confirmed his belief that appellants\u2019 demand was without proper foundation. Laurence\u2019s deposition revealed \u201cthat he was computing on lost rental income rather than using an income stream to value the subject property. Knowing that lost rental income is not compensable in a condemnation action [Nave] prepared a Motion in Limine to prevent his testimony. This motion was granted when filed at the beginning of trial on August 13, 1979.... The fatal defect in Mr. Laurence\u2019s deposition testimony did not give me any basis to recommend an increase in the City\u2019s offer.\u201d (See generally CEB \u00a7 4.44 et seq. on the income approach to valuation of fair market value.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Respondent concedes that the condemner may be penalized for ignoring the opinion of the condemnees\u2019 experts (see <em>Schultz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at pp. 667-668); but Nave\u2019s declaration supports the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that this did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In sum, although mathematically respondent\u2019s final offer appears to have been unreasonably low in light of the verdict, Nave\u2019s declaration supports a finding that the offer was made in good faith and was arrived at with care and accuracy. Accordingly, substantial evidence supported a finding of reasonableness, and this finding alone supports the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\n<em>Unreasonableness of Appellants\u2019 Demand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Denial of the motion might also have been predicated upon a finding that appellants\u2019 demand was unreasonable. The evidence on this point was in conflict.  Where the evidence is uncontradicted, the question of reasonableness of offer and demand is one of law. Where, however, the evidence is in conflict, the question is one of fact for the trial court. <em>(Schultz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at pp. 666-667.)  A review of Nave\u2019s declaration, <em>ante, </em>reveals clear evidence that appellants\u2019 demand was not based upon proper factual foundation and legal theory, and that it was therefore unreasonable. Appellants presented evidence to the contrary. But, in light of the Nave declaration it cannot be said as a matter of law that appellants\u2019 demand was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Appellants failed to comply with the statutory requirement that they make a timely demand. Further, substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that respondent\u2019s offer was reasonable. Therefore, whether appellants\u2019 demand was reasonable or not, their motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Scott, Acting P. J., and Feinberg, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.

[H] (b) If the court, on motion of the defendant made within 30 days after entry of judgment, finds that the offer of the plaintiff was unreasonable and that the demand of the defendant was reasonable viewed in the light of the evidence admitted and the compensation awarded in the proceeding, the costs allowed pursuant to Section 1268.710 shall include the defendant\u2019s litigation expenses. In determining the amount of such litigation expenses, the court shall consider any written revised or superseded offers and demands filed and served prior to or during trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The pretrial conference was held on May 17, 1979.

Although appellant argues that the parties were each aware of the position of the other, we find no evidence, in the record that the parties had stipulated to a waiver of the mandatory time periods.
