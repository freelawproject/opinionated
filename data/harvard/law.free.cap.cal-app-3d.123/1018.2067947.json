The municipal court granted the motion; the superior court, on Graham\u2019s petition, granted mandamus, in effect reversing the municipal court, and the People\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">At the outset, we recognize that, given the close official relationship, fiscally and otherwise, which obtains between county boards and district attorneys, it is plainly undesirable for a supervisor to oppose the local district attorney in a criminal case. We acknowledge, too, that while a criminal defendant has in general the right to be represented by counsel of his choice (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crovedi </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 199, 206 [53 Cal.Rptr. 284, 417 P.2d 868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reaves </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 852, 855 [117 Cal.Rptr. 163]), that right is not absolute <em>(Yorn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 669, 674 [153 Cal.Rptr. 295]) and it must yield on occasion to other, greater interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>The People, and amicus district attorney\u2019s association, argue that this is one of those limited instances. They cite, inter alia, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 180 [115 Cal.Rptr. 235, 524 P.2d 363], where our Supreme Court announced as a judicially declared rule of criminal procedure, that \u201ca city attorney with prosecutorial responsibilities may not defend ... persons accused of crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 186-187; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Wolfe) </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 714, 719 [138 Cal.Rptr. 235].) They cite as well in support of the contention that at least the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d forbidden by <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180, exists in the case at bench, those provisions of Government Code sections 25300, 25303 and 25203, which give the Solano board certain authority and control over the district attorney, mostly of a limited fiscal nature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, finally, it is argued that Davis\u2019 representation of Graham violates the prohibition against \u201cincompatible offices\u201d found in Government Code section 1126, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>One factor in the instant case distinguishes it from <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180, <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Wolfe), supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.3d 714, and other cited authority.  A county district attorney prosecuting a criminal action within a county, acts as a <em>state </em>officer, exercising ultimately powers which may not be abridged by a county board of supervisors. <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 653, 657 [83 Cal.Rptr. 41]; <em>In re Brindle </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 660, 674 [154 Cal.Rptr. 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Accordingly, any conflict in Davis\u2019 representation of Graham is abstract rather than actual. We are of course aware that instances of attempts by county boards to control criminal prosecutions are not uncommon, even though they have met with little ultimate success. Thus, it has been held that a county board may not order that a private law firm be employed as assistant counsel with the district attorney in the prosecution of a criminal case. <em>(County of Modoc </em>v. <em>Spencer </em>(1894) 103 Cal. 498, 501 [37 P. 483]; see also <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1918) 37 Cal.App. 523, 531 [174 P. 935]; <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Woody </em>(1917) 33 Cal.App. 554, 556 [165 P. 973].) Nor, it has been held, has a county board the authority to transfer control of investigatory personnel from the district attorney to the county sheriff. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 228, 241-242 [138 Cal.Rptr. 101].)  Indeed, as said in <em>Hicks, supra, </em>a county board has <em>no </em>inherent powers, since it is a mere creature of the state, but \u201ccan exercise only those powers expressly granted it by Constitution or statutes and those necessarily implied therefrom. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 1; <em>People </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 384, 388-389 . ..; <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>262 Cal.App.3d 148, 155 ....)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Seen in this context, therefore, the relationship between Davis and Graham presents neither actual nor potential conflict of interest. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the validity of appellant\u2019s contention that, even in the absence of real or apparent conflict, the relationship of Davis and Graham may raise issues of public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. It is a political fact, and one well known to the public, that a positive relationship between a county board and the district attorney\u2019s office can be critical to the proper functioning of the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2014as, for example, where discretionary allocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>public funds is involved. Also, from the prosecutor\u2019s standpoint it is both awkward and unfair that he should be regularly pitted against an adversary who has the power, if not the right, to exact financial retribution against his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">For these reasons we agree with appellant, and with the Attorney General, that unless <em>compelling </em>reasons to the contrary are advanced, the common law, statutes and practical sense alike argue against permitting a county supervisor who is an attorney to represent criminal defendants in cases prosecuted by the county district attorney. (62 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 512 (1979); Gov. Code, \u00a7 1126, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Carlucci </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 249, 258 [152 Cal.Rptr. 439, 590 P.2d 15]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180, 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We conclude, however, that the case at bench presents such compelling reasons. Not only was Mr. Davis retained rather than appointed, he was retained before his accession to the board, and the relationship which had developed up until then was a close one, based upon four months\u2019 duration. And finally, a key factor influencing our decision is that Mr. Davis\u2019 representation of Graham while on the county board appears to be an isolated incident rather than a persistent practice. <em>(Sparks </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 533, 537 [119 Cal.Rptr. 441].) Only if he were consistently representing criminal defendants within the county would Davis in our view be required to decide, as a matter of both public policy and professional ethics, whether to eschew such representation or resign from the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Racanelli, P. J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Government Code section 25303 provides: \u201cThe board of supervisors shall supervise the official conduct of all county officers, and officers of all districts and other subdivisions of the county, and particularly insofar as the functions and duties of such county officers and officers of all districts and subdivisions of the county relate to the assessing, collecting, safekeeping, management, or disbursement of public funds. It shall see that they faithfully perform their duties, direct prosecutions for delinquencies, and when necessary, require them to renew their official bond, make reports and present their books and accounts for inspection. [1\u00cd] This section shall not be construed to affect the independent and constitutionally and statutorily designated investigative and prosecutorial functions of the sheriff and district attorney of a county.
