Simmons, who died on January 9, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Appellant assigns various errors to the court\u2019s findings of fact on the cause of Mr. Simmons\u2019 death and asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her the right to trial by a jury. Since the jury trial issue is dispositive of the case, we d\u00f3 not reach the merits of the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">On April 5, 1978, appellant filed an at-issue memorandum in which she stated that she was not requesting a jury trial. A few days later, respondent filed its at-issue memorandum requesting a jury trial. In her trial setting conference statement dated August 16, 1978. appellant again waived a jury by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the question, \u201cIs a jury demanded and by whom?\u201d The trial setting conference order dated August 21, 1978, recited that a jury had been demanded by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">On October 23, 1978, the day set for trial, respondent filed its written waiver of trial by jury. In the department assigned for trial, appellant\u2019s counsel requested a jury and argued that there were no grounds for denial of such relief. He pointed out that the matter had been calendared as a jury trial, that he had deposited jury fees two weeks previously, and that respondent would not be prejudiced. He explained that a young associate had been directed to request a jury at the trial setting conference but had failed to do so in reliance on respondent\u2019s request and that he had omitted filing a motion for relief from waiver because of a prior order against motions 20 days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Respondent, citing <em>March </em>v. <em>Pettis </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 473 [136 Cal.Rptr. 3], argued , that \u201ca change of mind\u201d was not a sufficient ground for relieving appellant of her two previous jury waivers. The court agreed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and denied appellant\u2019s request for a jury. Neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>court nor respondent\u2019s counsel voiced any inconvenience or prejudice that might flow from granting appellant\u2019s request for a jury. Appellant properly noted an exception to the court\u2019s denial (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 646), and the subsequent five-day court trial resulted in a judgment for respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cTrial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all .... In a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16.) The methods by which a party may waive a trial by jury are set out in Code of Civil Procedure section 631.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are concerned here with the application of subdivisions 2 and 4 of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Subdivision 2 provides that a jury trial may be waived by \u201cwritten consent filed with the clerk or judge.\u201d A negative response in an at-issue memorandum to the question of whether a jury trial was demanded constitutes \u201can express waiver of the right\u201d under this subdivision. <em>(Bishop </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 821, 823 [161 Cal.Rptr. 884], quoting <em>March </em>v. <em>Pettis, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.3d at p. 477.) Similarly, a negative response to whether a jury trial is demanded in the trial setting conference statement constitutes an express waiver of the right to a jury trial under the statute. Thus, appellant expressly waived her right to a jury not once, but twice\u2014in the at-issue memorandum and in the trial setting conference statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s waivers were not irrevocable. (See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Union Pac. R.R. Corp. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 893, 897 [130 Cal.Rptr. 23, 549 P.2d 855]; <em>Byram </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 648, 650 [141 Cal.Rptr. 604].) The statutory pattern of section 631 \u201ccontemplates an alternating process of waiver in which the onus of demand for jury and deposit of jury fees may briefly oscillate back and forth be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>tween the parties until final waiver by the last party permitted to assert the right, subject always to trial court discretion to relieve from waiver for just cause.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Union Pac. R.R. Corp., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Subdivision 4 of section 631 allows for reinstatement of the right to a jury and is designed as a safeguard against a party\u2019s inadvertent waiver in reliance on an opposing party\u2019s demand. It states in pertinent part: \u201c.. . provided further, that in any superior court action if a jury is demanded by either party in the memorandum to set cause for trial and such party thereafter by announcement or by operation of law waives a trial by jury, then in said event any and all adverse party or parties shall be given 10 days\u2019 written notice by the clerk of the court of such waiver, whereupon, notwithstanding any rule of the court to the contrary, such adverse party or parties shall have not exceeding five days immediately following the receipt of such notice of such waiver, within which to file and serve a demand for a trial by jury and deposit advance jury fees for the first day\u2019s trial whenever such deposit is required by rule of court, and if it is impossible for the clerk of the court to give such 10 days\u2019 notice by reason of the trial date, or if for any cause said notice is not given, the trial of said action shall be continued by the court for a sufficient length of time to enable the giving of such notice by the clerk of the court to such adverse party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We can infer from the skimpy record in the case before us that respondent failed to deposit jury fees 14 days before trial, which operated as a waiver under subdivision 5 of section 631. We can also infer that the court clerk failed to send to appellant (the adverse party) the 10 days\u2019 notice required by subdivision 4 when a party originally demanding a jury subsequently waives the right \u201cby announcement or by operation of law.\u201d If appellant had been given the required notice, she would then have had the statutory right within five days after receipt \u201cto file and serve a demand for a trial by jury and deposit advance jury fees.\u201d The court clerk understandably missed the signals. Although respondent \u201cindicated\u201d to appellant about two weeks before trial that it might be waiving a jury, it made no such \u201cannouncement\u201d to the court until the morning of trial. Appellant, informally notified of the possible waiver and not waiting for the clerk\u2019s notice of the waiver by operation of law, deposited the jury fees with no accompanying demand for jury. The clerk either did not note the source of the fees or incorrectly concluded that the notice was not required when fees were paid-\u2014irrespective of the paying party.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Subdivision 4 of section 631 is clear. If the party demanding a jury subsequently waives the right, the clerk must give 10 days\u2019 notice of the waiver to all adverse parties. Payment of fees by an adverse party does not relieve the clerk of this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The judgment must be reversed for lack of compliance with the statutory mandate under the reasoning of <em>Heim </em>v. <em>Houston </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 770 [131 Cal.Rptr. 755], which we find persuasive and applicable to the case at bench. In <em>Heim, </em>the court held that \u201c[s]ince the 10 days\u2019 notice was not given by the clerk, subdivision 4 required the court to continue the trial for a sufficient time for the notice to be given and to afford [appellant] 5 days in which to demand a jury and deposit advance jury fees. The court\u2019s summary denial of [appellant\u2019s] request for a jury trial, where the requirements of the subdivision had not been met, constituted an erroneous denial of [appellant\u2019s] right to a jury trial and a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal of the judgment. [Citation.] [Appellant\u2019s] participation in the trial after her request for a jury had been denied does not preclude her from asserting error in the ruling on appeal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 774; see also <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Roe </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 686, 688 [125 Cal.Rptr. 157].)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Reversal of the judgment is also dictated under cases which focus on the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion rather than on the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">On the morning of trial, appellant\u2019s counsel failed to assert, or even to mention, the right to a five-day continuance under subdivision 4. Instead, appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that relief from the previous waivers was within the discretion of the trial court and made the arguments previously mentioned. The court, without consideration of the statutory scheme for reinstatement of the right to a jury, \u201cexercised its discretion\u201d and denied appellant\u2019s request for a jury. On appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel argues only that the trial court abused its discretion. We agree that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The facts of this case fall squarely within the holding of <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 821. Neither the court nor respondent articulated any prejudice or inconvenience to the parties or to the court in granting appellant relief from her prior waivers. Jury fees had previously been paid, and the record does not reflect that the matter had been transferred to a nonjury calendar or that a jury had been dismissed. \u201cThe denial of a jury trial after waiver where no prejudice is</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>shown to the other party or to the court is prejudicial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 825; <em>Byram </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.3d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Respondent relies on <em>March </em>v. <em>Pettis, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.3d 473, for the proposition that a \u201cchange of mind\u201d is insufficient reason for relief from waiver of a jury. The court, in <em>March </em>v. <em>Pettis, </em>pointed out that \u201ca court is entitled to consider many factors, including the possibility of delay in rescheduling the trial for a jury, lack of funds, timeliness of request and prejudice to all litigants.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 480.) Acknowledging that the constitutional guarantee dictated that any doubts should be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial, the court nevertheless held that \u201crelief will be denied where the only reason for the demand appears to be the party\u2019s change of mind or where a demand for a jury is being used as a \u2018pretext to obtain continuances and thus trifle with justice.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court went on to say that a court \u201cdoes not abuse its discretion where any reasonable factors supporting denial can be found,\u201d and then found that denial of a jury was not an abuse of discretion because of the disadvantage to three defendants who neither desired nor requested a jury. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In the case before us, appellant had deposited the jury fees and was ready to proceed, the respondent expressed no disadvantage, and the court did not articulate any inconvenience to it or find that appellant was \u201ctrifling with justice.\u201d The trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant a jury trial. .</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Scott, Acting P. J., and Feinberg, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 23, 1981, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 18, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\">From its questions, the court\u2019s skepticism about appellant\u2019s good faith reliance on respondent\u2019s jury request is apparent. Appellant, not relying on respondent\u2019s prior request, initially waived a jury. The representation by appellant\u2019s counsel that a young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>associate had mistakenly failed to request a jury at the trial setting conference is belied by the trial setting conference statement. Having been typed, it was obviously prepared before the conference and indicated a jury waiver. Counsel\u2019s excuse for failure to file a motion to correct the jury-waiver \u201cerror\u201d was also suspect. He pointed to an order against any motions 20 days before trial, but failed to note that the order of August 21, 1978, merely provided that \u201cno <em>discovery </em>motions will be heard ... later than 20 days prior to trial.\u201d The trial court, however, did not articulate any of its concerns as a reason for denying appellant\u2019s request for a jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, ail statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
