Cigarettes were missing and the safe, which should have included the money from previous shifts, was empty. The total amount missing, including the cigarettes, was over $2,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Suspecting an \u201cinside job,\u201d the head security officer for Thrifty Oil Company arranged for several employees, including appellant, to be given a lie detector test by a private polygraph examiner hired by the company. During the examination, appellant confessed to committing the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Appellant contends his confession should have been suppressed on the ground that the private polygraph examiner did not warn appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. This argument has no merit. The private consultant had no connection with the police, and the examination was conducted for the private purposes of appellant\u2019s employer. There was no duty to give a <em>Miranda </em>warning. <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 526-528 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mangiefico </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1041, 1049 [102 Cal.Rptr. 449].) The <em>Eric J. </em>case is very similar on its facts. The appellant, an employee at a skating rink, was questioned by the manager of the rink, concerning stolen skates he was attempting to sell. (25 Cal.3d at p. 526.) The court held that absent some complicity on the part of law enforcement officials with the interrogation, no <em>Miranda </em>warning was required. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. <em>527-528.)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Appellant contends that on the facts of this case the police were sufficiently involved with the polygraph examination to render it inadmissible. (See <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 97, 100-102 [73 Cal.Rptr. 575, 447 P.2d 967].) This argument is not supported by the record. The trial court\u2019s implied finding of lack of complicity is supported by substantial evidence and must be upheld on appeal. <em>(In re Eric J., supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d at p. 527.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mangiefico, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.3d at page 1049, the court stated,  \u201cIn determining whether a private investigator should be required to give the <em>Miranda </em>warning the inquiry is directed to whether the investigator is acting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>an agent of law enforcement officials or is primarily engaged in enforcing the law. If he is, then <em>Miranda </em>comes into play. We have already concluded that Berdan was not an agent of the local law enforcement officers and that he was not primarily engaged in law enforcement.\u201d So, here, the record shows the examination was not conducted primarily for law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In this case the investigating police officer, William Whittaker, testified that the head security officer for Thrifty Oil Company, Miguel Valentine, contacted Whittaker by phone about 11:30 the morning of the burglary and stated that he had concluded there was a possibility that an employee was involved, that it was \u201can inside type job.\u201d Valentine stated that he was going to schedule several employees for a polygraph examination and he asked Officer Whittaker \u201cif that would be okay,\u201d to which Whittaker responded \u201c[y]es.\u201d We construe this to mean that Valentine merely wanted to make sure that his own investigation would not interfere with the police investigation. The fact that Valentine checked first with the police is not sufficient police involvement to render the statement inadmissible. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 370, 376, 379 [46 Cal.Rptr. 775, 406 P.2d 55], a statement made by the defendant to a television news reporter was held \u201cin no way the result of police interrogation\u201d although the reporter, prior to the interview, sought and \u201cobtained permission from the officer exercising custody\u201d over defendant. Officer Whittaker did not suggest any questions to be asked. He did not participate in any way in the interview or with setting it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">At the time of his conversation with Valentine, Officer Whittaker asked Valentine to \u201ckeep me informed as to what occurred.\u201d This does not compel the conclusion that Valentine acted as an agent for the police. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mangiefico, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1046-1047.) Valentine was still the instigator and was acting primarily for the employer\u2019s private purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The judgment (order granting probation) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The interest of an employer in questioning its own employees is distinct from the interest of a store security guard in questioning a shoplifting suspect. Thus this case would not be controlled by <em>In re Deborah C</em><em> </em>(Cal.App.) currently pending in the state Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
