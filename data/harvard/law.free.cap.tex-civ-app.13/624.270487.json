A judgment in justice court, wherein A. J. and F. M. Long were plaintiffs and defendant and F. M. Taylor were defendants, which was an action for the \u201ctrial of the right of property\u201d wherein this defendant was claimant of the property (cattle) levied on by virtue of an execution against said F. M. Taylor, and wherein said A. J. and F. M. Long recovered judgment for the cattle. (2.) The plaintiffs\u2019 offer to prove by J. F. Eidson that witness had a conversation with F. M. Taylor at Taylor\u2019s house a short time before the alleged purchase of the Seitz horses by defendant, in which conversation said Taylor admitted to witness that he had been \u201cfiguring\u201d with Marshall Seitz, to buy the horses in controversy, and witness informed said Taylor that the Seitz Bros, owed John Seitz nothing on the M. K. Seitz- notes, and that there was no doubt in witness\u2019 mind that said horses were the property of Marshall Seitz and would be levied on by the creditors of Seitz Bros.; when said Taylor then asked witness if anyone else but John Seitz and witness knew of the facts, and that if he could get hold of the horses he could make a good thing out of it. All this testimony was stricken out on objection of defendant, to which ruling the plaintiffs excepted. Appellants had alleged conspiracy between F. M. Taylor and E. P. Taylor on the one side, and M. Seitz on the other to defraud the creditors of Seitz Bros. Under cross-examination of defendant E. P. Taylor, appellants, at time of offering the rejected testimony, had in support of this allegation of conspiracy shown that at the time of the pretended trade for the notes E. P. and F. M. Taylor and M. Seitz were present, and at time the lease to the pasture was written said parties were again present and acting together, and this testimony considered in the light of the rejected testimony tended to prove that there was a conspiracy as alleged; if so, the declarations and admissions and acts of each and all the conspirators were admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">An assignee of a mortgage, in possession under unforeclosed mortgages, only has a lien subject to the equity of redemption by mortgagor; and creditors of mortgagor who obtain liens on the property conveyed by levies made subsequent to the possession of assignee under prior mortgages, are subrogated by their subsequent levies to all the rights of redemption of mortgagor, and in an action for the \u201ctrial of the right of property\u201d between said assignee and said creditors, where the judgment of the court is that assignee retain possession for the purpose of foreclosing his mortgage on the property, the court should, by its judgment, protect the liens of said creditors and give them a foreclosure, subject to that of assignee.

The power of attorney shows on its face and recites that it was executed in the State of Ohio, and the presumption is that the subscribing witnesses resided there at its execution and that they still continue to reside there, until the contrary appears, and under this presumption secondary evidence is admissible to prove the execution of an instrument, as it raises the presumption that the subscribing witnesses are beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Abbott\u2019s Trial Ev., 391, sec. 4; Savage v. D\u2019Wolf, 1 Blatch., 343.

This is a statutory action for the trial of the right of possession of 87 head of horses. Valid attachments and executions in favor of appellants and against the firm of Seitz Bros, were levied on the horses, and appellee instituted this proceeding alleging that he was in actual and rightful possession of the horses as a mortgagee when they were seized by the sheriff. Appellants alleged that the mortgage under which appellee claimed was void for want of sufficient description, and also that it was a fraudulent device to defraud creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">There was a non-jury trial, resulting in a judgment for appellee. No conclusions of fact and law were filed by the trial judge. The evidence, however, warrants, and, in support of the judgment, we find, that when the sheriff seized the horses they were in the actual possession of appellee; that appellee held them under a mortgage executed by Seitz Bros.; and that the execution of the mortgage and the other writing disclosed by the record were not in fraud of the creditors of said Seitz Bros.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">2. The description of the animals covered by the mortgage is as follows: \u201cAlso all of the horse stock of every kind whatsoever, branded and unbranded, that are now owned and held by us in Nolan and adjoining counties of the State of Texas, and to include all of the increase of and from said horses of whatsoever class that may hereafter arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>from said horses.\u201d This is a sufficient description; it includes all horses belonging to the mortgagors in Nolan County and the counties adjoining Nolan, and therefore was not void for uncertainty of description. Articles 4562, 4563 and 4564 of the Revised Statutes, invoked by appellants, apply to sales, not to mortgages.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ARG\">Decided May 27, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">3. It was shown that the two subscribing witnesses to the power of attorney from John Seitz to Marshall Seitz resided in the State of Ohio. Therefore the court did not err in permitting the plaintiff to read said power of attorney as evidence after proving its execution by Marshall Seitz. Craddock v. Merrill, \u00a12 Texas, 495; 1 Greenl., Ev., sec. 572. Besides, it was shown that John Seitz afterward ratified what Marshall Seitz had done under the power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">4. The court below ruled correctly in excluding the j udgment in favor of A. J. and F. M. Long against F. M. Taylor, and other evidence offered for the purpose of showing that F. M. Taylor had transferred property to appellee to defraud his creditors. The evidence had no relation to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">5. The judgment provides that \u201cthe several plaintiffs in execution and attachments levied on the said horses take nothing by such levies and said horses be and they are hereby discharged from any and all liens by reason of the levy of said attachment and executions thereon and said claimant retain possession of said horses until his mortgage lien is discharged and that plaintiffs take nothing,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Appellants contend, and we think correctly, that the court committed error in adjudging their attachment and execution liens to be ineffectual and discharged. The attachment and execution levies were valid as against Seitz Bros., who owned the property subject to the mortgage under which appellee held it; and while, under article 2296 of the Revised Statutes, appellee was entitled to remain in possession until his claim was satisfied, still, appellants should not have been cut off from their right to have Seitz Bros.\u2019 equity of redemption sold under their attachment and execution liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">6. The judgment will therefore be reformed so as to permit appellee to retain possession of the horses until the mortgage executed by Seitz Bros, to J. H. Beal, trustee, is discharged, but allowing appellants to proceed to sell the property subject to said mortgage as though the levies thereon had been made in the manner directed by article 2296 of the Revised Statutes (1879); and the costs of this appeal will be taxed against appellee. In all other respects the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">\n<em>Reformed and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
