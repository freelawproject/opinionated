Moore, 85 Texas, 346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">The j udgment of the court is contrary to, and not supported by the evidence, for this: The locations and surveys under which defendant claims title were made subsequent to the extension of the grant to Chambers, and before the time allowed by the registration law to file deeds and other evidence of title in the office of the county clerk for registration had expired; patent on the Goucher certificate was not issued until after the grant to Chambers had been deposited in the land office, and no patent has ever issued on the Dunn certificate; the State was on notice of the prior grant to Chambers and could not have been an innocent purchaser; and the grant was deposited in the land office before the purchase of the lots by Lamar, under whom defendant claims title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-9\">Under the civil and statute law in force and effect at the time of the revolution, there was no such legal or equitable status as innocent purchaser of real estate.

Especially was this true where the elder title was by grant from the sovereign. Colonization. Law of Coa. and Texas, 1823, art. 22; Paschal\u2019s Digest, art. 532. And thus the law remained and continu\u00e9d in force in Texas until after the condemnation proceedings, 1839, except as modified by the registration laws enacted by the Congress of the Republic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">The registration law of 1836 did not change the civil law, or statute law of Mexico and Coahuila and Texas, in respect to innocent purchasers of real estate in cases where prior valid grants from the government were involved; for grants from the sovereign were neither embraced within the language nor meaning of the statute (King v. Elson, 30 Texas, 254; Franklin v. Kesler, 25 Texas, 138; Evitt v. Roth, 61 Texas, 86; Railway v. Locke, 74 Texas, 398); and the joint resolution, or act, of December 14, 1831, requiring protocols to be deposited in the land office, was not addressed to owners of land, imposed no duties upon them, and made no reference to innocent purchasers, or subsequent purchasers of any kind; it was addressed to, and intended for, those who _ extended titles, and who were in lawful possession of archives, and imposed upon them the duty of depositing original title papers in the land office; the persons legally and rightfully in possession of such title papers were officers of the former government. And it cannot be deduced from the resolution, by any recognized canon of construction, that it was the intention of Congress to change the rule of law then in force in respect to titles to real estate. Acts of Congress, 1831, pp. 44-45; King v. Elson, 30 Texas, 254. There was no law in Texas making it the duty of owners of land to deposit the protocols of their titles in the land office until the act of October 20, 1866, was enacted. Acts of 1866, p. 5; Rev. Stats., art. 2322; King v. Elson, supra. Such being the state of the law at the time the Republic purchased the land, it cannot claim protection as an innocent purchaser within the meaning and intent of the registration laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">Chambers had the right, both at law and in equity, to rely upon the legal presumption that the officers of the government, those in possession of the protocol of his title, would discharge the duties imposed upon them by the resolution of December 14, 1831, and deposit it in the land office; and the failure of the officer having possession and custody of the protocol to deposit it in the land office within the time prescribed by law, will not, and can not, work a forfeiture of his title to the land in controversy. Throckmorton v. Price, 28 Texas, 605; Franklin v. Kesler, 25 Texas, 138; Evitt v. Roth, 61 Texas, 86; Byrne v. Fagan, 16 Texas, 398-9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">Purchasers under condemnation proceedings were not purchasers within the meaning and intent of the registration law of 1836; the maxim caveat emptor applied to the purchaser at such sales; and the Republic of Texas only acquired such title by its purchase as those had who were parties to the proceedings, and whose title was condemned therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>An examination of the cases will show that, in every case where purchasers at judicial sales have been held to be innocent purchasers, and to come within the protection of the registration laws, it has been so held because of the fact that at the time of the levy of the writ, and of fixing the lien, either the execution creditor, or the purchaser, had no notice of the prior conveyance; in either event the purchaser was protected, and protected because of the lien; in other words \u2014 they were protected either as lien creditors, or as purchasers who were subrogated to the rights of the lien creditor. Grace v. Wade, 45 Texas, 524; Ayers v. Duprey, 25 Texas, 605; Wallace v. Campbell, 54 Texas, 91; Bradley v. Love, 60 Texas, 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-4\">The Republic had no title to the land which it could convey to the locators; the locations were made under such circumstances that the locators took no title, as against the prior grant to Chambers; they could not claim the protection of the registration laws; then the Republic re-purchases from the locators, and by virtue of such a transaction it is contended that the Republic is an innocent purchaser, and that plaintiffs in error holding under a prior valid grant from the. sovereign, must be postponed in favor of those holding under it. In our humble judgment such is not the law. Ellis v. Singletary, 45 Texas, 41; 1 Story\u2019s Equity, 420.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">Only a purchaser of the legal title can claim protection as an innocent purchaser. (York v. McNutt, 16 Texas, 16, and authorities cited.) At the time of the condemnation proceedings no patent had issued to the locators of the certificates. Their title was, at most, an equitable one; the legal title remains in the government until patents issue. Hence the Republic was not, and could not have been, an innocent purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">The Republic of Texas, being a mere continuation, or successor, of the former government; grants from the government being official acts; and all grants emanating from the government of Coahuila and Texas being recognized and respected by the Republic, and protected by its laws, organic and statutory, it was charged with notice of the grant to Chambers; and a vendor with notice of a prior title who sells to one without notice, and then re-purchases, takes no title; all equities reattach as soon as the property comes back into his hands.

It is clear from the facts that this title paper of Chambers was not deposited in the land office until after the land had been condemned and sold to the Republic under the proceedings authorized and required by the law of January 14th, 1839, nor was such title then recorded in the county where the land was situated. The effect of the various laws of the Republic, in existence at the time the government acquired its title under the condemnation proceedings, relating to the deposit in the land office of then existing titles and registering titles in the county where the land was situated, was to relieve subsequent locators and purchasers without notice for value of the effect of such previous titles which were not so deposited or recorded as required by law. Guilbeau v. Mays, 15 Texas, 411. The title condemned and acquired by the Republic was that of the apparent owners as shown by the record and the evidences of title then apparently existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Under the facts as shown, we are authorized to indulge in the assumption that the government, in acquiring the title by condemnation, and when the land was paid for through its officers, did not have notice of the existence of the Chambers grant, and it is clear that the Republic paid value for the land. Under these circumstances was the government entitled to the protection granted to an innocent purchaser? Ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>it is true that a government can not be a purchaser without notice of a grant which it had previously issued, but this rule can not apply in this case, for here the previous grant was not issued by the Republic, the government that acquired the subsequent title, but was issued by another government.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AXM\">Decided April 8, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The general rule is, that where a government condemns land for State purposes, it acquires not only the easement and use, but also the absolute title and fee to the property. Mills, Eminent Domain (2nd edition) sec. 50. Another rule to be observed in determining the effect of the title of the Republic is, that if it appears from the statute that authorizes the condemnation the purpose was to acquire title it will be so construed and held to embrace the condemnation of title as well as easement. It is clear from a reading of the Act of the Congress of the Republic that authorized the condemnation that the purpose was to permanently acquire the title to the property and lands condemned. If the Republic was authorized to become a purchaser of real estate, and was not as a matter of law charged with a notice of title previously issued by another government, it, or an individual who, for value, purchased from one in whom rested the apparent title, without notice of the existence of a previous unrecorded grant, the evidence of which was not on file in the land office or in the' county where it was required to be registered, would be protected. This rule of protection will also extend to a purchaser who acquired the apparent title under execution sale without notice of the unrecorded previous grant. The government, by the condemnation proceedings against those who were then the apparent owners of the land, became the purchaser thereof for value and apparently without notice of the existence of the Chambers title. This being true we do not see why the principles announced would not apply to its title and it be accorded the same protection as would be extended in case of other bona fide purchasers. Holding as we do that the government was an innocent purchaser of the land practically settles and disposes of the case. The protection extended to the government would follow any subsequent title it passed to its vendees.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
