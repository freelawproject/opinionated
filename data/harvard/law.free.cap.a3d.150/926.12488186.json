We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts follow. The charges against the defendant stem from events occurring on July 26, 2010, at the New Hampshire State Prison where the defendant and the victim were then incarcerated. The defendant was a member of a prison gang known as the Brotherhood of White Warriors (BOWW), and had been ordered by Frankie Philbrook, a high-ranking member of BOWW, to assault the victim because Philbrook believed the victim was a \"rat\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the victim had provided incriminating information about Philbrook to authorities). The relevant indictments allege that the defendant assaulted the victim by striking him in the head, and that he, acting in concert with another inmate, caused the victim's death by repeatedly striking him in the head and face. The defendant admitted to striking the victim once in the head, but denied striking him repeatedly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before trial, the State moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to admit expert testimony relating to BOWW's existence, organizational structure, membership process, and culture, as well as evidence of the defendant's affiliation with the organization. The defendant filed a partial objection, which stated that he had \"no objection to disclosure to the jury of his membership in BOWW,\" but argued that the \"[a]dmission of evidence regarding BOWW['s] organizational structure, membership process, and culture\" would violate New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403. (Quotation omitted.) After a hearing, the trial court granted the State's motion, in part. In its ruling, the trial court permitted the State to present expert testimony relating to BOWW's organizational structure and culture to \"establish a motive for the inexplicable attack on [the victim],\" and to explain \"how fear of gang retaliation would affect the testimony of witnesses, and tend to make them less cooperative with law enforcement.\" However, the ruling prohibited the expert from testifying \"to evidence a jury could readily understand,\" including evidence that BOWW believed the victim \"ratted\" on a gang member, that BOWW ordered the attack, and that the defendant held the position of \"lieutenant\" within the organization. The trial court explained that this evidence \"would be admissible if obtained from a percipient witness,\" but that it was \"not expert testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, the State's expert testified that BOWW's members, all white males, formed the gang in 2005 to protect themselves from other gangs at the prison. He explained that BOWW maintains a paramilitary ranking structure, that its members generally share a common \"white supremacy\" ideology, and that its motto is \"God forgives and BOWW don't.\" According to the expert, members must abide by certain rules including following orders under the chain of command, and not \"ratting.\" He explained that a member's failure to follow the rules results in a \"violation\" and that possible consequences for violations include \"a punch in the ribs,\" being \"punch[ed]\" by \"a couple [of] guys,\" or being \"thrown out\" of BOWW. He also\n   explained that there are varying levels of violations, and that a BOWW member who \"rats\" would \"most likely be kicked out of the gang, assaulted, or really anything.\" Additionally, the State's expert testified that gang-related cases in the prison are generally difficult to investigate because people are typically reluctant to cooperate with investigators, and because victims of gang-related assaults do not usually report the incident to prison authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also at trial, the defendant presented the testimony of an inmate who corroborated the defendant's description of events by testifying that the defendant did not repeatedly strike the victim. On cross-examination, the State elicited testimony, over the defendant's relevance objection, that the inmate had been assaulted by another inmate several months before testifying at the defendant's trial. The inmate admitted that his attacker had a BOWW tattoo, and that, during the assault, his attacker said, \"You want to tell on [the victim].\" He agreed that the assault occurred shortly before a hearing in another criminal case in which the State planned to call him as a witness. That case did not involve the defendant, but was related to the July 26, 2010 attack on the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found the defendant guilty on all charges, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    II. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to properly limit the introduction of evidence relating to BOWW. Specifically, he asserts that the following evidence was inadmissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 : (1) \"BOWW crimes [in] which [the defendant] played no role\"; (2) BOWW's organizational rules; and (3) BOWW's retaliation against witnesses. He contends that, because such evidence was admitted, he \"was tried, in significant part, on evidence of a prison gang's wide-ranging criminal conduct which was not fairly attributable to [him] and which unfairly prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a threshold matter, the State argues that the defendant waived his argument related to evidence of BOWW's organizational rules. We disagree. Contrary to the State's contention, defense counsel did not limit the scope of his objection at the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   hearing. Rather, when asked whether the admission of expert testimony to explain witnesses' reluctance to testify was \"the one ruling [he took] the most issue with,\" defense counsel stated, \"that's about as much of an objection as I'm going to make\n   <em>\n    beyond ... what's in my pleading\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, although the defendant focused primarily upon a single argument at the hearing, he did not concede the remaining arguments raised in his objection.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Milliken v.

A jury could infer from this testimony that BOWW was likely to respond with violence to the defendant's failure to follow orders and to the inmates' \"ratting.\" This inference limited the prejudicial impact of the expert's testimony that BOWW members generally share a common white supremacy ideology and that BOWW generally responds to rule violations with violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Addison (Capital Murder)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048796\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/165/381/#p467\">\n    165 N.H. at 473-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%201\">\n    87 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming trial court's decision to display video of defendant committing armed robbery, in part, because jury had heard evidence that he participated in the robbery through the testimony of other witnesses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    B. Inmate's Testimony about Separate Assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant also challenges the trial court's ruling admitting evidence of the pretrial assault on an inmate witness by another inmate with a BOWW tattoo. The defendant argues that the trial court should have excluded the inmate's testimony relating to the pretrial assault pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403. He appears to acknowledge that the testimony was relevant to the credibility of the inmate. He argues, however, that the evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. He claims that he was unfairly prejudiced because the inmate's testimony \"allowed for the possible inference by the jury that [he] was involved in the attack.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Evidence of the pretrial assault was probative of the inmate's credibility because it evidenced his motive to deny the defendant's involvement in the acts underlying the second degree murder charge.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    State v.

The inmate did not testify that the defendant was still a member of BOWW or that he was involved in the attack. Rather, at the defendant's request, the State elicited testimony that the attack occurred just before a hearing that did not involve the defendant. Additionally, the defendant later offered testimony that he had severed his connection with BOWW in the year leading up to his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Given these circumstances, we conclude that the record supports the trial court's determination that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it admitted the inmate's testimony about the pretrial assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, any issues raised in the defendant's notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
