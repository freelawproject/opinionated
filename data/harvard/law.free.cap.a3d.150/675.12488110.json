On June 17, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for permission to file a motion to vacate the new judgment, which was denied on June 18, 2015.

The Appellate Court dismissed the defendant's appeal on January 13, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   apparently determining that, because no automatic appellate stay was triggered on the denial of that motion, no appellate stay prevented the law day from passing on August 4, 2015, such that title had vested irrevocably\n   in the plaintiff and the defendant's appeal was therefore moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff sought reconsideration of the judgment of dismissal. The Appellate Court dismissed the motion for reconsideration on January 29, 2016. On March 9, 2016, we granted the defendant's petition for certification based on the following question: \"Did the Appellate Court properly dismiss the appeal in this matter as moot?\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Knudsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20926\">\n    320 Conn. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.3d%20458\">\n    133 A.3d 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the present case, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to open the judgment on June 8, 2015, and extended the law day to August 4, 2015. On June 26, 2015, the defendant filed an appeal to the Appellate Court, which was within twenty days of the trial court's June 8, 2015 decision. The defendant's appeal was filed prior to the law day and title never passed to the plaintiff. Moreover, the defendant's appeal was timely because it was filed within the applicable twenty day appeal period. See Practice Book \u00a7 63-1(a). The Appellate Court apparently characterized this appeal as one taken from the judgment denying the defendant's June 17, 2015 motion which, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11(g), did not give rise to an automatic stay. However, this appeal was filed within the twenty day appeal period for both the order denying the defendant's June 17, 2015 motion and the June 8, 2015 judgment that set\n   a new law date. The June 8, 2015 judgment triggered an automatic stay because it was an appealable final judgment, and the defendant's filing of this appeal within twenty days of that judgment continued the stay \"until the final determination of [this appeal].\" Practice Book \u00a7 61-11(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both parties have argued that the Appellate Court's order of dismissal should be reversed and that the case should be remanded to that court for further proceedings. We agree. An \"automatic\" appellate stay of proceedings to enforce the judgment went into effect on June 8, 2015, when the trial court rendered a new judgment of strict foreclosure setting a law date of August 4, 2015. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-11(a). Because the defendant appealed within twenty days of that judgment, the automatic stay was in effect on August 4, 2015, and will continue in effect until the \"final determination of the [appeal].\" Practice Book \u00a7 61-11(a). Since the appellate stay prevented title from vesting in the plaintiff by operation of law when the defendant failed to exercise her right of redemption on August 4, 2015, the case should not have been dismissed by the Appellate Court as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    We note that Knudsen's name has changed during the pendency of this action.
