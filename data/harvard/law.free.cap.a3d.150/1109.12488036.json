We conclude that no immunity from suit arises under such circumstances. Consequently, a decision concluding that the savings statute permits a statutory cause of action subject to a jurisdictional time limitation to proceed cannot be the subject of an interlocutory appeal authorized\n   under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682753\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/27/#p31\">\n    191 Conn. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20566\">\n    463 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-555,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a wrongful death action was timely filed in the name of the estate of Benny A. Gillotti against the defendant, Danbury Hospital. The defendant moved to dismiss that action on the ground that an estate is not a legal entity with the capacity to sue. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Doherty, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the motion and rendered judgment dismissing the action. See\n   <em>\n    Gillotti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Danbury Hospital\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. CV-13-6011628-S (July 15, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Months later, the plaintiff, Anna Marie Gillotti Blakely, commenced the present wrongful death action in her capacity as the administratrix of Gillotti's estate. The defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiff's action was time barred because (a) it had been filed after the two year time limitation for commencing a wrongful death action under \u00a7 52-555 had lapsed, and (b) the savings statute does not apply to an action that has been dismissed due to an attorney's ignorance of the law. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Roraback, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the motion for summary judgment. In a subsequent articulation, the court explained that it had concluded that the mistake of law at issue was a \"matter of form\" that could \"properly be viewed as mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect of a nature to permit resort to the protections of [the savings statute].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant appealed from the denial of its motion for summary judgment, challenging the trial court's conclusion that the savings statute applied under these circumstances. Recognizing that its appeal prior to the trial court's adjudication on the merits of the plaintiff's wrongful death claim was interlocutory, the defendant invoked the second prong of the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   as authority for its appeal. After a hearing, the Appellate Court issued an order dismissing the appeal for lack of a final judgment. This court thereafter granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal seeking to challenge that determination.\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Danbury Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20905\">\n    316 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20471\">\n    111 A.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant claims that its appeal falls within the exception to the final judgment rule under the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   test because the appeal seeks to vindicate a legal right, or at least a colorable claim to a legal right, to freedom from suit. Specifically, the defendant contends that the lapse of a jurisdictional statute of limitations like the one in \u00a7 52-555 gives rise\n   to such a right. In support of this proposition, the defendant relies on a statement to this effect in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Travelers Cos.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343748\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/800/#p815\">\n    299 Conn. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 815,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20852\">\n    12 A.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). In response, the plaintiff characterizes the statement in\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   as dicta, and asserts that the jurisdictional nature of the time limitation in \u00a7 52-555 is irrelevant in any event because the time limitation in the savings statute, which is not jurisdictional, controls. In support of this proposition, the plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Isaac\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mount Sinai Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"563478\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/210/721/#p731\">\n    210 Conn. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731-32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20A.2d%20116\">\n    557 A.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), which\n   concluded that the wrongful death statute should be read as if the savings statute is incorporated, such that the time limitation of the latter modifies the former.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the characterization of the effect of a jurisdictional statute of limitations in\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   is not accurate for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It is well settled that \"[t]he subject matter jurisdiction of our appellate courts is limited by statute to appeals from final judgments .... [However], the courts may deem interlocutory orders or rulings to have the attributes of a final judgment if they fit within either of the two prongs of the test set forth in [\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Radzik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Children's Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20313\">\n    317 Conn. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20A.3d%20526\">\n    118 A.3d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   test, on which the defendant relies in the present case, permits an appeal if the decision \"so concludes the rights of the\n   parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682753\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/27/#p31\">\n    191 Conn. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20566\">\n    463 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That prong \"focuses on the nature of the right involved. It requires the parties seeking to appeal to establish that the trial court's order threatens the preservation of a right already secured to them and that that right will be irretrievably lost and the [parties] irreparably harmed unless they may immediately appeal. ... One must make at least a colorable claim that some recognized statutory or constitutional right is at risk. ... In other words, the [appellant] must do more than show that the trial court's decision threatens him with irreparable harm.
