The\n   plaintiff, Cody B. Heisinger, appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the trial court's rendering of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Ward Frank Cleary and Ann Heisinger Dillon, after the plaintiff failed to produce an expert witness on standard of care in his action alleging that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by overvaluing an estate asset. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that an expert was required and that, on the undisputed facts, the court instead should have rendered summary judgment, as to liability, in his favor. We agree that an expert witness was unnecessary but conclude, nevertheless, that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in the defendants' favor because the undisputed facts demonstrated conclusively that they could not be held liable for any errors allegedly committed by the professionals they had selected and retained. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the appeal. The plaintiff is the son of Frank B. Heisinger (decedent), who died testate on November 9, 2007. The plaintiff is the decedent's sole heir and the only beneficiary of a trust established under the decedent's will. Pursuant to the terms of that will, the defendants are coexecutors of the decedent's estate. Dillon is the decedent's sister, and Cleary is an attorney with the law firm of Curtis, Brinckerhoff &amp; Barrett, P.C., which serves as counsel for the estate and for many\n   years had provided various legal services to the decedent and his family members. In addition to an extensive enumerated list of specific powers, the decedent's will, which was executed on November 21, 2005, granted the defendants, as the estate's executors, \"all powers conferred on executors and trustees under the Connecticut Fiduciar[y] Powers Act [General Statutes \u00a7 45a-233 et seq. ], as amended, as the same exists on ... the date of the execution of [the] [w]ill and all powers conferred upon executors ... wherever [they] may act.\" Among the specific powers enumerated in the will was \"to employ attorneys, accountants and other persons for services or advice.\"\n   Prior to the events in question, Dillon had no prior experience acting as a fiduciary. Following the decedent's death, she met with Cleary, who informed her that the estate's most valuable asset was shares of stock in the F.A. Bartlett Tree Expert Company (Bartlett), a closely held corporation established by the decedent's grandfather, and that the stock needed to be valued, for estate tax purposes, as of the date of the decedent's death. Neither Cleary nor Dillon possessed any training or expertise in the valuation of corporate stock. Approximately five years prior to the decedent's death, a trial court adjudicating the dissolution of the decedent's marriage, relying on an appraisal that valued the Bartlett stock as of September 30, 2001,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   had found that the stock was worth \"approximately $2,120,000.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   About\n   two months before the decedent's death, the Bartlett stock had been valued, for business purposes and with the decedent's awareness, by Management Planning, Inc. (Management), at $4,071,600. Pursuant to Cleary's recommendation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and with Dillon's agreement, the estate hired Management for the purpose of valuing the stock as of the date of the decedent's death. Management has more than seventy years of experience in preparing valuations of corporate stock for the purposes of, inter alia, estate tax return preparation. In deposition testimony, the plaintiff agreed that the defendants had a responsibility to get a date of death appraisal from a qualified appraisal firm and that Management was such a firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2008, Management provided the defendants with an appraisal report that concluded that the value of the Bartlett stock as of November 9, 2007, was $4,862,820.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The increase in the value of the stock from its previous valuation was attributed to new information regarding the earnings of Bartlett in the third quarter of 2007. The July, 2008 appraisal report was signed by three members of Management's professional staff\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and contained a certification that it was prepared in conformity with various professional standards for appraisers. That same month, Cleary provided a complete copy of the appraisal report to the plaintiff. In November, 2008, Cleary sent draft copies of tax documents using the Management valuation to an attorney who represented\n   the plaintiff at that time. In early 2009, the\n   defendants filed state and federal tax returns for the estate using the Management valuation. From 2008 through 2011, neither the plaintiff nor any of the three attorneys who represented him during this period ever informed either of the defendants that they believed that the Bartlett stock had been overvalued, provided the defendants with an alternative appraisal, or requested that an additional appraisal be conducted. In 2011, the estate satisfied its Connecticut tax liability after its counsel negotiated a substantial reduction in that liability on the basis that the estate possessed insufficient liquid assets to pay the entire amount due. For similar reasons, the estate's payment of federal taxes was deferred until 2013, when the estate sold some of the stock back to Bartlett at the per share price included in Management's July, 2008 appraisal report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August, 2012, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendants alleging \"maladministration\" of the estate. In the operative complaint, the plaintiff averred that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties as executors of the decedent's estate by \"grossly overvaluing\" the Bartlett stock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the complaint, Management's valuation of $4,862,820 as of the date of the decedent's death was approximately $3 million too high,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which in turn had resulted in an excessive assessment of estate taxes. More specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by failing: to cause a correct assessment and payment of estate taxes; to\n   supervise properly the work of others; and to amend the purportedly erroneous estate tax returns in a timely fashion. It averred further that, because of the illiquidity of the estate's assets, the plaintiff had been exposed to the potential for personal liability for the taxes. As to the standard of care, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had a duty to manage the decedent's estate \"with the care and skill of a prudent business person in the management of his or her own business affairs,\" knowing that the stock was closely held and unmarketable, and constituted a large percentage of the estate's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In answering the plaintiff's complaint, the defendants denied that they had breached their fiduciary duties. Additionally, they each advanced a number of special defenses, including that of reasonable reliance. Specifically, the defendants averred that they had engaged Management, a reputable company experienced in valuing corporate stock, for purposes of valuing the Bartlett stock, and that they reasonably had relied on the appraisal provided by Management when they filed the estate's federal and state tax returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January, 2015, after substantial discovery had taken place, both defendants moved for summary judgment arguing, inter alia, that the plaintiff had failed to produce an expert who would testify as to the relevant standard of care for a fiduciary acting under the particular circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   They contended further that the\n   plaintiff had produced no evidence that either of the defendants, by relying on the Management appraisal report, had committed an act constituting a breach of fiduciary duties, which, in the defendants' view, necessarily contemplates acts of fraud, self-dealing, conflict of interest or something similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff objected to the defendants' motions and responded with his own motion for partial summary judgment, requesting that the court render judgment in his favor as to both defendants' liability. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that expert testimony was unnecessary to prove a claim of breach of fiduciary duty and that breaches of fiduciary duty are not limited to instances of intentional wrongdoing, but rather, can include more passive behaviors such as \"benign neglect,\" \"simple neglect\" or \" 'blind ... unreasonable reliance.' \" In the plaintiff's view, a jury could conclude, without the assistance of an expert, that the 2001 appraisal of the Bartlett stock in connection with the decedent's divorce proceedings, which employed a larger discount rate and resulted in a substantially lower valuation, should have raised a \"red flag\" for the defendants once they received the higher valuation from Management in 2008, and that their failure to seek an additional valuation, given the existence of this \"red flag\" and their general familiarity with Bartlett, was a breach of their fiduciary duties. Moreover, the plaintiff claimed, the defendants should have sought to amend the estate's tax returns on the basis of this knowledge, because the estate possessed insufficient liquid assets to pay the taxes calculated pursuant to the Management valuation, and the defendants subsequently were able to obtain a reduction in the estate's state tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 16, 2015, the trial court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court disagreed with the defendants that claims of breach of fiduciary duty necessarily were limited to instances of\n   intentional wrongdoing such as fraud, self-dealing or conflict of interest, and, therefore, it denied summary judgment on this basis. It agreed, however, that expert testimony was required to establish the applicable standard of care and to assist the jury in evaluating the defendants' actions, namely, their acceptance and use of Management's appraisal report in light of the facts and circumstances known to them at the time, in view of that standard. Specifically, in the court's estimation, expert testimony was necessary to help the jury understand stock valuation concepts, the requirements and procedures of taxing authorities, and the types of decision-making necessary in the administration of a size-able estate and trust. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff's failure to produce such expert testimony was fatal to his claims and, therefore, rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his initial brief to this court, the plaintiff claimed that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants because expert testimony was unnecessary and the undisputed facts showed, instead, that the plaintiff\n   was entitled to summary judgment. Specifically, he contended that a lay standard of care applied to his claims and that a jury was capable of comprehending the particular breaches alleged. Moreover, according to the plaintiff, the undisputed facts showed definitively that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by accepting and continuing to rely on the Management valuation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, both defendants contended that there is no evidence in the record showing that they committed any breach of fiduciary duty, regardless of whether they are correct that that cause of action contemplates fraud, self-dealing, conflict of interest or other similar behavior, or instead, whether something less egregious like blind neglect would suffice. Cleary argued additionally that the trial court correctly determined that expert testimony on the applicable standard of care was necessary because the issues in this case were beyond the comprehension of a lay juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following oral argument before this court, we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the following question: \"Does General Statutes \u00a7 45a-234 (19) provide the applicable standard of care for the fiduciary defendants under the facts of this case and, if so, how does it impact the resolution of the motion for summary judgment on appeal?\" In response, the plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the statute cannot aid the defendants because they did not meet the standard of care recited therein. The defendants, for their part, agreed that the statutory standard applies and contended that, on the undisputed evidence, it shields them from liability, making summary judgment in their favor proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We agree with the plaintiff that he was not required to produce an expert on standard of care, nor was he required to prove that the defendants had a conflict of interest or had engaged in fraud, self-dealing, or other\n   similar behavior. This is because, given the particular allegations of breach of fiduciary duty at issue in this case, the requisite standard of care applicable to the defendants is supplied by \u00a7 45a-234 (19), and further, that standard is akin to an ordinary negligence standard that a lay jury is competent to apply without the assistance of an expert. We conclude, nevertheless, that summary judgment in favor of the defendants remains proper\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the undisputed evidence\n   established, as a matter of law, that the defendants are immune from liability pursuant to \u00a7 45a-234 (19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The standard of review of a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment is well established. [W]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

The applicable standard, therefore, contemplates the actions of an ordinary person, and not those of a professional with a specialized skill set.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is consistent with the fact that, to serve as an executor or administrator, a person need not necessarily possess any special skills or expertise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-290 (a) and\n   45a-303 c) (1) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co. of New York\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"802335\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/74/625/#p626\">\n    74 Conn. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.%20609\">\n    51 A. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1902) (Probate Court cannot reject chosen executor unless selected individual is within class of persons excluded by statute or common law);\n   <em>\n    Smith's Appeal from Probate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"490542\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/61/420/#p426\">\n    61 Conn. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.%20273\">\n    24 A. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1892) (under common law, \"all persons might be appointed as executors who were mentally capable of executing the duties of the trust, or, as it is otherwise stated, who were capable of making a will, or were not specially disqualified\"; accordingly, lack of experience in business affairs is not disqualifying circumstance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that expert testimony is not necessary to assist a jury in its determination of whether a fiduciary has exercised due care in the circumstances contemplated by \u00a7 45a-234 (19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, to determine whether a fiduciary has exercised \"due care\" in selecting and retaining a professional to assist in fulfilling the responsibilities associated with a trust or an estate, a jury need not possess an informed understanding of the technical aspects of the work product or services provided by that professional. In fact, the necessity of hiring an expert typically will arise from the fiduciary\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ing\n   </em>\n   such an understanding. Rather, the jury is charged with determining whether a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances of the fiduciary, knowing only what he or she knew or should have known at the relevant times, would have appreciated that the selection and retention of the professional at issue\n   could cause harm to the trust or estate. When, as here, the fiduciary possesses no expertise in regard to the task that the professional was hired to perform, he or she should not be held liable under \u00a7 45a-234 (19) unless there was a deficiency in the professional's qualifications or integrity that would be obvious to an ordinary person, existing at the time the professional was selected and retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary against the defendants all stem from their use, for estate tax return purposes, of the purportedly erroneous valuation of the Bartlett stock that had been prepared by Management and, therefore, fall squarely within the purview of \u00a7 45a-234 (19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants, therefore, cannot be held liable for any damages flowing from the\n   alleged overvaluation unless they failed to exercise due care in selecting and retaining Management. More specifically, the plaintiff needed to show that there were deficiencies with Management's qualifications or integrity that no reasonable person, having ordinary knowledge, would have disregarded. Because this was a determination that could be made without the assistance of an expert, the trial court improperly granted summary judgment for the defendants on the basis that the plaintiff had not produced an expert on standard of care. We conclude, however, on the undisputed facts, that a fair and reasonable jury could not have found that the defendants failed to exercise the care that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under all of the attendant circumstances. Consequently, the trial court's rendering of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was proper nevertheless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Internal Revenue Service requires, and the parties do not dispute, that for estate tax purposes, the value of property owned by a decedent is to be determined at the time of his or her death. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202031\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.2031-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2031-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Unquestionably, therefore, the defendants were required to seek an updated valuation of the estate's Bartlett stock from a professional appraiser that was experienced in valuing closely held stock for estate tax purposes. In selecting and retaining Management, which by all appearances is a well regarded company with extensive experience in performing that very function, to conduct the date of death valuation, the defendants most assuredly exercised due care. Indeed, Management only recently had valued the Bartlett stock for the company's business purposes, with no apparent objection to the results from the decedent. In fact, the plaintiff conceded, during discovery, that the defendants were required to obtain a current valuation of Bartlett and that Management possessed the requisite qualifications to undertake that valuation. There have never been any allegations that the professionals in Management's employ, who produced the valuation at issue, lack integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff now contends, in his supplemental brief, that the defendants did not truly \"select\" Management because, instead of independently choosing their own appraiser, they used Management, the same company that Bartlett recently had hired to conduct a similar appraisal. He claims alternatively that the defendants did not exercise \"due care\" in selecting Management because they did not also consult with the appraiser who had valued the decedent's stock in connection with\n   his divorce proceedings in 2001. We disagree with each of these contentions. An interpretation of the statutory language that would disallow the selection of a professional on the basis advanced by the plaintiff, which is wholly unrelated to the professional's qualifications or integrity, would be absurd. Similarly, requiring a fiduciary to hire a particular, additional professional, when there is no indication that the chosen professional is deficient in any way, would be an unduly restrictive construction of the statutory standard of due care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff also contends that, once the defendants received Management's appraisal report, certain \"red flags\" should have alerted them that the valuation contained in the report was erroneous and required them to amend the estate's federal\n   estate tax return. We disagree. Section 45a-234 (19) absolves a fiduciary of responsibility for issues that arise regarding a professional's work if that professional was selected and retained with due care. Once that standard is met, the fiduciary has no further responsibility to second-guess the work provided by the professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We conclude, in sum, that the undisputed evidence shows that the defendants exercised due care in selecting and retaining Management as their appraiser. Accordingly, \u00a7 45a-234 (19) shields the defendants from liability for any damages resulting from the allegedly improper valuation in Management's July, 2008 appraisal report. Summary judgment in their favor therefore was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The plaintiff claims additionally that the trial court improperly refused to recognize a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client and work product privileges, thereby shielding certain documents from being disclosed to him during discovery.

We decline, therefore, to address the plaintiff's additional claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The appraisal as of September 30, 2001, was commissioned by the decedent's former wife. The resulting appraisal report provides that the analysis therein was conducted only for the purpose of valuing the marital estate in connection with the dissolution proceedings. It provides further that the report \"should not be used for any other purpose\" and that the opinion as to value \"would most likely be different if another valuation date were used.\" In a section discussing assumptions and limiting conditions, the report reiterates that \"[t]he various estimates of value presented [herein] apply to this valuation only and may not be used out of the context presented herein.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    To account for the stock's lack of marketability, the appraisers who conducted the 2001 valuation applied a discount rate of 60 percent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In his deposition, Cleary testified that he was aware that Management had worked on the earlier appraisal for Bartlett and that he \"knew that [Management] was good ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    To account for the stock's lack of marketability, Management's appraisers applied a discount rate of 35 percent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The most highly ranked individual who signed the report was a senior vice president of Management who possessed a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, had more than one decade of experience in valuation, and had appeared as an expert witness in the United States Tax Court and in other proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The operative complaint contains allegations that arguably can be read to assert additional causes of action, such as professional negligence in regard to Cleary.

The court denied the July, 2013 motion on the basis of an appraisal report, submitted by the plaintiff on December 2, 2013, that included a preliminary opinion as to the value of the Bartlett stock on November 9, 2007. An updated version of that report, dated December 15, 2014, set the stock's value at $1,935,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Prior to producing the aforementioned reports well after litigation had commenced, the plaintiff did not provide to the defendants any other alternative valuation of the Bartlett stock as of the date of the decedent's death.

We disagree that this case involves the type of circumstances under which we have held that the burden shifts to a fiduciary to prove fair dealing, because there are no allegations that the defendants personally have benefited in any way from the complained of actions.

The statute contains no prohibitions or extra requirements in this regard, and we will not read any into it.

The plaintiff has claimed throughout the proceedings that a lay, prudent person standard applied, thereby obviating the need for expert testimony as to the standard of care, and that he properly could prevail on allegations akin to negligence. Specifically, he challenged the defendants' conduct in supervising the work of Management and obtaining an assessment of taxes on the basis of Management's valuation, claiming that they failed to act prudently as the circumstances required. Accordingly, it is difficult to conceive of how the plaintiff would have conducted discovery differently had he proceeded explicitly pursuant to \u00a7 45a-234 (19). In any event, it was the plaintiff's responsibility to identify the statutory provision that clearly governed his claims, and he cannot avoid its application by neglecting to do so, nor can he be heard to complain of any resulting unfairness. Additionally, the defendants, to date, consistently have denied the plaintiff's allegation that Management overvalued the Bartlett stock. It cannot be said, therefore, that \u00a7 45a-234 (19) is being applied as a special defense.
