The scope of this rule, allowing collateral and belated attacks on the sentence and excluding waiver as a bar to relief, is narrow. We hold that the procedural error alleged in the present case does not come within the narrow meaning of Rule 4-345(a) and therefore is not a cognizable claim under that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The trial, verdict, sentence, and direct appeal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roderick Colvin was tried in 1989 before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on numerous charges in connection with the murder of Charles Reese and the attempted murder of Jeanette Coleman. We have no need to summarize all of what occurred at trial. Relevant to this appeal is what took place in the courtroom after the jury completed its deliberations. At that time, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   THE CLERK: Members of the Jury, have you agreed upon a verdict?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE JURY: Yes, we have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE CLERK: Who shall speak for you? Madam Forelady, please stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: I think that the Forewoman has asked that Juror Number 3 speak for the Jury. Any objection Counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [DEFENSE]: No, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [STATE]: No, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE CLERK: Juror Number 3, please stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: You selected your own foreperson I see.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE CLERK: How say you as to Charles Reese under first degree murder, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE CLERK: Felony murder, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE CLERK: As to Jeannette Coleman, assault with intent to murder, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE CLERK: As to Charles Reese, robbery with a deadly weapon, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE CLERK: As to the handgun charge, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE CLERK: Possession of a handgun, not guilty or guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defense counsel then asked the clerk to poll the jury.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE CLERK: Juror Number 1, please stand. You heard the verdict. Is your verdict the same?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   JUROR NO. 1: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The clerk repeated this question with each of the other jurors who had not yet spoken. All those polled responded, \"Yes\" or \"Same.\" The clerk did not ask the foreperson, Juror Number 3, who had just announced the verdict for the jury, if her verdict was the same. The clerk then hearkened the verdicts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE CLERK: As to first degree murder not guilty, as to felony murder guilty, assault with intent to murder guilty, robbery deadly weapon guilty, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence guilty, possession of a handgun guilty and so say you all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The jury, including the foreperson, responded, \"Yes.\" The court then dismissed the jury. At no time during or immediately following the taking of the verdict did defense counsel\n   object to the process. Nor did defense counsel object after the jury was dismissed, seek a new trial, or complain at sentencing about the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The jury convicted Colvin of felony murder, assault with intent to commit murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and the two handgun offenses. For those crimes the court sentenced him to imprisonment for life plus an additional 20 years. Colvin noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Colvin did not challenge the method of jury polling employed by the circuit court nor did he argue that it rendered his sentence illegal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Colvin's convictions in an unreported opinion, and this Court denied Colvin's petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Colvin\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El v.

Colvin was denied postconviction relief in December 2000, and his application for leave to appeal was denied in 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    The motion to strike illegal sentence\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In September 2013, Colvin filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a). He argued, evidently for the first time, that the verdicts supporting his convictions were not unanimous, as required by Maryland Rule 4-327(a), because the jury foreperson was not polled individually after she announced the jury's verdicts. Based on the premise that the verdicts did not reflect juror unanimity, Colvin argued that the sentence in its entirety was a nullity entitling him to have it vacated as substantively illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The circuit court denied the motion. The court ruled as a preliminary matter that the alleged defect in the polling process was not a cognizable claim under Rule 4-345(a). Even so, the court considered and denied the motion on its merits. The court reasoned that the foreperson of a jury, when delivering the jury's verdict, is also announcing the foreperson's own verdict; consequently, polling of the foreperson individually is not necessary to ensure jury unanimity. The court therefore concluded that, because Colvin's claim of conviction\n   on less than a unanimous jury had no merit, his challenge to the legality of the sentence failed at its premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Colvin noted a direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Colvin v.

Over the dissent of one judge who would have held that Colvin's claim was not cognizable in a Rule 4-345(a) proceeding, the Court of Special Appeals determined that the claim was cognizable but failed on its merits. The Court of Special Appeals recognized that the sentence would be illegal \"if the polling procedure was, in fact, defective in a manner that rendered the verdict non-final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031372\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/131/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031372\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/131/\">\n    at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031372\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/131/\">\n    126 A.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This argument flows from Colvin's initial premise, which is that the procedure by which the verdict was returned does not reflect juror unanimity because the courtroom clerk did not include\n   the foreperson in the clerk's polling of the jury. Colvin argues that, without individual polling of the foreperson, the record does not ensure a unanimous jury. The State disagrees with those contentions and argues in turn that Colvin's claim does not fall within the narrow definition of an illegal sentence because he does not allege any substantive error such that no sentence should have been imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We agree with the State that Colvin's claim is not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). Colvin correctly foregoes any claim that the sentence is illegal, as that term is defined for purposes of the Rule. That is to say, Colvin does not argue that \"there either has been no conviction warranting any sentence for the particular offense or the sentence is not a permitted one for the conviction upon which it was imposed and, for either reason, is intrinsically and substantively unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861015\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/460/#p466\">\n    397 Md. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861015\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/460/#p466\">\n    918 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He argues, in essence, that an alleged flaw in the\n   <em>\n    procedure\n   </em>\n   by which the guilty verdict was received and finalized renders the sentence illegal. Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Colvin does not complain that the foreperson misstated the verdict of the jury. Nor could he, given that all twelve jurors were hearkened to the verdict and agreed to it as announced by the foreperson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Yet, that allegation, even if true, does not make a substantive allegation of a lack of juror unanimity without more: the additional lack of a proper hearkening of the jury to the verdict. The alleged lack of unanimity of the verdict is the lynchpin of Colvin's argument that the verdict, as rendered, is unconstitutional and therefore a \"nullity\" upon which no legal sentence can be imposed. Without that lynchpin, the fragile structure of Colvin's allegation of an illegal sentence collapses of its own weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under Maryland law, procedural challenges to a verdict ought be done by contemporaneous objection and, if not corrected, presented through the direct appeal process. Such claims do not come within the purview of Rule 4-345(a).

This result avoids suborning the important purpose of Rule 4-345(a) and heeds our extensive precedent on this matter, the important concepts of finality and judicial economy. An alleged procedural error in\n   the taking of the verdict must be preserved by contemporaneous objection and, if not cured at the time, be raised on direct appeal, not through Rule 4-345(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT TO DISMISS THE APPEAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We also considered in\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"560019\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/389/127/#p133\">\n     389 Md. at 134-37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"560019\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/389/127/#p133\">\n     883 A.2d 916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , a narrow exception that permits review, by way of a Rule 4-345(a) motion, of certain constitutionally based claims of sentencing error in capital cases.
