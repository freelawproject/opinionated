At issue in this appeal is the gloss providing that the phrase \"offensive or disorderly conduct\" in \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) means \"conduct that is grossly offensive, under contemporary community standards, to a person who actually overhears it or sees it.\" Id., at 818,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant, William Andriulaitis, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial to the court, of disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2). On appeal, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in conduct that was \"offensive or disorderly\" under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , and that the court improperly failed to consider the\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   gloss in its deliberations because it did not reference the gloss when explaining the evidentiary and factual bases for its guilty verdict. The court, however, is presumed to have applied the proper legal standard in arriving at its legal conclusions, and the defendant has not identified any basis in the record to rebut that presumption. In any case, the defendant's argument that his conviction should be reversed simply because the court did not reference the\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   gloss when announcing its verdict misapprehends this\n   court's standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence claims. Our review, by long-standing precedent, focuses on whether, in light of the entire evidentiary record together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, a rational fact finder could find that the state proved all of the necessary elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that the evidence adduced at trial meets this standard and, accordingly, affirm the defendant's conviction.\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The defendant lived at 61 Curtiss Road in Terryville with his wife, Tracy Andriulaitis, and their daughter, Kalie Andriulaitis. The defendant had physically abused Kalie on a consistent basis while she was growing up, and their relationship was strained. In the fall of 2012, Kalie moved some of her belongings out of 61 Curtiss Road in order to attend college at the University of Rhode Island. In early 2013, prior to the start of Kalie's second semester as a freshman, the defendant informed Kalie that her mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer approximately five years earlier, had slipped into a coma. Kalie returned from college and visited her mother in the hospital every day, and slept at 61 Curtiss Road every night, for about a week. On February 9, 2013, her mother died. The evening her mother died, the defendant physically assaulted Kalie and her grandfather in the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following day, Kalie, fearing for her safety, obtained a police escort to accompany her to 61 Curtiss Road to collect her belongings. Officer Michael Smegielski of the Plymouth Police Department met Kalie, as well as a few of Kalie's friends and family members, at 61 Curtiss Road. At that time, the defendant was present inside the residence with his mother and Mary Wysocki, a woman with whom the defendant had a long-standing close, personal relationship. Officer Smegielski arrived with Kalie and knocked on the front door, at which point the defendant instructed his mother and Wysocki \"to stay in [an upstairs bedroom] and lock the door.\" When no one answered the front door, Kalie, using a key she had obtained from inside a vehicle in the garage, partially opened a door to the residence that was inside the garage, but did not enter because she saw the defendant inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officer Smegielski, whose testimony the court credited at trial, testified that he called out to the defendant,\n   intending to speak with him prior to Kalie entering the residence in order to avoid a confrontation. Officer Smegielski further testified that the defendant appeared from a room in the hallway and approached the door. According to Officer Smegielski, he was \"angry\" and was \"shouting profanities,\" including \"F*** you. She doesn't live here. I don't want her here.\" Officer Smegielski further testified that, at that point, he instructed Kalie to close the door, not to enter the home, and to \"reconvene [with him] outside the garage [to] figure out what's going on.\" As a result of the defendant's conduct, Kalie never entered into 61 Curtiss Road and never retrieved her belongings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant was charged in a substitute long form information with disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two\n   counts of criminal lockout in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-214. Following a trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court found the defendant guilty of disorderly conduct and not guilty on the two counts of criminal lockout. The court imposed a sentence of three months imprisonment, execution suspended, and one year of probation. The court explained its reasoning for finding the defendant guilty of disorderly conduct, in relevant part, as follows: \"[A] key piece of evidence in my mind was the testimony of ... Wysocki quoting the defendant as saying before Kalie came up to the house, the\n   defendant said stay in the room and lock the door. This to me reveals that the defendant knew, intended and/ or planned a confrontation. From that point, the accounts of the incident varied from witness to witness, but I credit [Officer Smegielski's] version of the incident ....\" The court found that \"[b]ased on [Officer Smegielski's] testimony, primarily, what followed once Kalie came to the door was a tirade from the defendant, a tirade of profanities and untruths such as Kalie does not live here. All of this, including the defendant's comments to ... Wysocki, reveals the defendant's intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm in engaging in offensive or disorderly conduct.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant claims that \"the court did not find-and the evidence would not support a finding-that the defendant's conduct was 'grossly offensive, under contemporary community standards, to a person who actually overhear[d] it or [saw] it,' \" as required under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325748\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/795/\">\n    228 Conn. at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the defendant does not explain the precise nature of this claim, we interpret it, as the state does, as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence introduced at trial. We discern two primary arguments from the defendant's briefs. First, the defendant appears to argue that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction because, in explaining its reasoning for finding him guilty of disorderly conduct, the court did not expressly find that his conduct was \"offensive or disorderly\" under the\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   standard, namely, that it was grossly offensive under contemporary community standards. Therefore, the defendant maintains, the court improperly failed to consider the\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   gloss in reaching its verdict. Second, the defendant argues that the evidence admitted at trial is insufficient to support a finding that his conduct was grossly offensive under contemporary\n   community standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree\n   with both arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the [finder of fact] if there is sufficient evidence to support the [finder of fact's] verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038664\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/345/#p347\">\n    102 Conn.App. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%20413\">\n    925 A.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956113,3956165,3955879\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/917/\">\n    284 Conn. 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20938\">\n    931 A.2d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by reviewing the individual components of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) as defined by the court in\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   .

First, with respect to the mens rea language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) -\"with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof\"-the court interpreted it to mean that the defendant's \"\n   <em>\n    predominant\n   </em>\n   intent [must be] to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 810,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, as to the language in subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) -\"by offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person\"-the court held that \"offensive or disorderly conduct\" means \"conduct that is grossly offensive, under contemporary community standards, to a person who actually overhears it or sees it.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 818,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court heard evidence that, immediately before confronting Kalie and Officer Smegielski, the defendant instructed his mother and Wysocki to stay in an upstairs bedroom and lock the door, suggesting, as the court found, that the defendant intended or planned to enter into a confrontation. Officer Smegielski testified that when he and Kalie opened the door to 61 Curtiss Road, the defendant \"came from the room\" in a hallway, was \"angry\" and uncooperative, was \"shouting profanities,\" and at one point shouted: \"F*** you. She doesn't live here. I don't want her here.\" Given this\n   testimony, the court reasonably could have inferred not only that the defendant used profane and vulgar\n   language in his encounter with Kalie and Officer Smegielski, but also that he shouted a multitude of profanities at them and was untruthful about whether Kalie still lived there. The court also could have inferred from this evidence, as well as the evidence of the defendant's statements to his mother and Wysocki immediately before the incident, that the defendant was shouting the profanities in an angry and visibly threatening manner for the purpose of deterring Kalie from entering the residence to collect her personal belongings, an activity the defendant concedes Kalie had a lawful right to do. Indeed, the defendant's conduct prompted Officer Smegielski to instruct Kalie to remove herself from the situation, rather than attempt to press the matter, further demonstrating that the defendant's demeanor was manifestly aggressive. The cumulative force of this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the conviction, provides a sufficient basis for a reasonable fact finder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to, and did, impede Kalie's ability to engage in the admittedly lawful activity of retrieving her personal belongings, and that he accomplished this result through conduct that is grossly offensive under contemporary community standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indrisano\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325748\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/795/\">\n    228 Conn. at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20986\">\n    640 A.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, we need not decide whether the defendant's language portended physical violence or amounted to fighting words because the defendant's conduct consisted of more than mere speech. In addition to shouting profanities and that he did not want Kalie to enter the residence, the defendant stood in the entrance hallway near the door, and, through that conduct, prevented Kalie from engaging in the admittedly lawful activity of entering 61 Curtiss Road to retrieve her personal possessions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   fighting words limitation, therefore, is not implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ...

First, those cases primarily concerned other elements of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2), rather than the \"offensive or disorderly conduct\" element. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Scott\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 728-30,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=851%20A.2d%20353\">\n     851 A.2d 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Mann\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 347,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%20413\">\n     925 A.2d 413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, to the extent the courts in those cases implicitly held that the conduct at issue was offensive or disorderly under the\n    <em>\n     Indrisano\n    </em>\n    standard, they are of little help in the present case, which involves behavior very different in kind. The defendant in\n    <em>\n     Scott\n    </em>\n    , while protesting outside of a Planned Parenthood facility, yelled at people entering the facility with a bullhorn and stopped and chased passing cars, causing one car to nearly hit him.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Scott\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 725-26,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=851%20A.2d%20353\">\n     851 A.2d 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
