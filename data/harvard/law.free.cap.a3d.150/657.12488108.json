He has two half siblings, born in 2012, who have a different father. Shortly after Daniel's birth, the Department of Children and Families (department) became involved with the family, and the department continued to be involved throughout a period of time extending to and after the birth of Daniel's half siblings, because of substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental health issues. On September 27, 2012, the court granted the petitioner's motion for an order of temporary custody for all three children, which led to an adjudication of neglect and Daniel's commitment to the care and custody of the petitioner. Daniel was returned to his mother's care on January 24, 2013, under an order\n   of protective supervision. On September 17, 2013, the petitioner invoked a ninety-six hour hold on Daniel after being informed by a representative of the Family Based Recovery program that Daniel's mother was in a drug induced condition. The ninety-six hour hold was followed by a court order of temporary custody. The respondent was incarcerated at this time, and thus was not a potential resource for Daniel's care. The petitioner moved that the order of protective custody be modified to an order of commitment, which the court granted on October 8, 2013. Daniel has remained in the care and custody of the petitioner since that date.\" Id., at 324-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201260\">\n    135 A.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On December 26, 2013, the petitioner filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Daniel's mother and the respondent, as well as the parental rights of the father of the half siblings. The termination of parental rights trial was held on February 3, 4 and 5, and June 24 and 25, 2015. The respondent was represented by counsel throughout the entire trial, and the respondent testified at trial. Several witnesses testified at trial, and multiple exhibits were admitted into evidence in this fully contested case.\" Id., at 325,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201260\">\n    135 A.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did not canvass the respondent prior to trial or at any time prior to the rendering of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court filed the memorandum of decision terminating the respondent's parental rights approximately two weeks after publication of our decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R\n   </em>\n   . The respondent then appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   required reversal of the trial\n   court's judgment because he did not receive a canvass before trial.

This certified appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    In\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   mandated reversal in the present case. Specifically, the petitioner claims that our holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   was limited and that nothing this court said in that case requires a reversal in cases in which the trial concluded prior to the announcement of the canvass rule. The petitioner also claims that, even if the canvass rule applies in the present case, automatic reversal would be inappropriate and reversal should be considered on a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, the respondent claims that the Appellate Court properly reversed the trial court's judgment because the canvass rule applies retroactively to trials concluded after\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   and the failure to provide the canvass in the present case required automatic reversal. In support of this conclusion, the respondent claims that the general rule is that judicial decisions apply retroactively and our decision to reverse the judgment in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   is a retroactive application of the canvass rule. Additionally, the respondent claims that the failure to provide the canvass requires reversal because the basis for reversal is the failure to provide the canvass, not \"the way in which the case is ultimately tried.\" Because we conclude that the exercise of our supervisory authority in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   is not applicable to the present case, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We begin with a review of the principles regarding our supervisory authority. \"It is well settled that [a]ppellate courts possess an inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice .... Supervisory powers are exercised to direct trial courts to adopt judicial procedures that will address matters that are of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole .... Under our supervisory authority, we have adopted rules intended to guide the lower courts in the administration of justice ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20726\">\n    311 Conn. 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20A.3d%20862\">\n    91 A.3d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Our \"supervisory authority is not a form of free-floating justice, untethered to legal principle .... Rather, the rule invoking our use of supervisory power is one that, as a matter of policy, is relevant to the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole, most typically in that it lends itself to the adoption of a procedural rule that will guide lower courts in the administration of justice in all aspects of the [adjudicatory] process ....

In considering the contours of the canvass requirement, we recognized\n   the petitioner's concerns that such a canvass could impact trial strategy and the attorney-client relationship. Id., at 793-94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, we utilized our rule-making power under our supervisory authority to articulate a rule that would apply in every case, not just cases in which the parent submits to a trial on the papers in the manner that the respondent had in that case. Id., at 794,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If this rule making alone had been the extent of the exercise of our supervisory authority in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , it would not have required a finding of extraordinary circumstances because the rule applies prospectively. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20823\">\n    313 Conn. at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20361\">\n    100 A.3d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We did, however, find exceptional circumstances in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , namely, the fact the respondent submitted herself to a summary procedure without any assurance that she understood the risks of such a course of action.\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. at 772-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, we expanded the scope of the exercise of our supervisory authority enough to apply the canvass rule in that case and grant relief to the respondent in that case. Our application of the canvass rule to the facts of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   was based on a careful evaluation of the particular facts and balancing of equities in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Having considered the holding and the rationale of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the rule is not applicable in the present case. Our decision to expand the scope of our supervisory authority in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   to apply the canvass rule and grant relief was predicated upon the extraordinary circumstances in that case and should not be construed to reach all other termination of parental rights cases in which the trial has concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Such an automatic expansion of the scope of the exercise of our rule-making power to reach all other cases in which the trial has already concluded would disturb the countervailing interests of the party or parties against whom the rule would be imposed without proper consideration of the countervailing interests of those parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This is not to say that there are no circumstances in which we would apply the canvass rule to a case in which the trial has concluded. Indeed, in view of our analysis in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , if there is a case that presents the same essential procedural history-namely, a case where the respondent submitted himself or herself to a summary procedure without any assurance that he or she understood the risks of such a course of action, the trial concluded before we announced our decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , and the respondent timely appealed-we would apply the canvass rule to that case in order to grant relief on the basis of the precedential value of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R\n   </em>\n   . This, however, would apply only to cases in which the trial has concluded and the respondent's right of appeal has not been exhausted or waived. In such a case, the rationale and holding of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , consistent with the principles underlying the exercise of our supervisory authority, would require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The conclusion reached by the Appellate Court illustrates the flaw in the respondent's claim that the canvass rule should apply in the present case because we granted relief in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R\n   </em>\n   . This was a fully contested trial. The respondent, through counsel, cross-examined each of the five witnesses presented by the petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the respondent's counsel\n   cross-examined one of the mother's witnesses and the mother herself.\n   The testimony of the respondent himself reveals that he fully grasped the nature and consequence of the proceedings. The respondent testified that he knew that the petitioner was asking the court to terminate his parental rights. The respondent testified that he \"would do anything in [his] power\" to maintain his relationship with Daniel. The respondent explained that he rescheduled his cancer surgery because he \"thought [testifying] was a lot more important.\" Although it would have been preferable as a matter of policy for the respondent in the present case to have received a canvass before trial, the fact that he did not receive it in the present case is not the kind of extraordinary circumstance that would have warranted relief. See\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the interpretation of the exercise of supervisory authority in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   urged by the respondent and adopted by the Appellate Court does not remedy any apparent injustice for the respondent but rather works an injustice upon the petitioner and Daniel in the form of unnecessary delay and wasted resources.
