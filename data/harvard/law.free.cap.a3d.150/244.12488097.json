On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the prosecutor violated his constitutional and statutory right to remain silent, and his constitutional due process right to a fair trial as the result of improper comments made during closing arguments, (2) the trial court improperly permitted a police officer to testify as an expert witness about body language and other indicators of untruthfulness, (3) the trial court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence postmortem photographs of the victim, and (4) the trial court violated the defendant's statutory right to present a defense by excluding evidence relevant to the defendant's theory of self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Sometime in April or May, 2012, the victim, Anthony Pesapane, began living with the defendant and the defendant's family in a first floor unit of a multifamily house in New Haven, an arrangement designed to help the defendant pay rent. The victim regularly attended a local clinic to receive daily methadone treatments, and would often drive the defendant and his wife, Marta Matejkowska, to the clinic for their treatments as well. The last time the victim ever attended the clinic, however, was on June 4, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Later that day, while in the victim's bedroom, the defendant fatally stabbed the victim twenty-one times. One wound was 3.5 inches deep in the victim's chest and punctured his heart. After the victim died, the defendant cleaned the room with bleach, discarded the knife into the Quinnipiac River, and rolled the victim's body up into a rug. The defendant then obtained a U-Haul truck and placed the body and other bloodstained items in the rear compartment of the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 11, 2012, the police conducted a motor vehicle stop of the U-Haul in Woodbridge, and found Matejkowska in the driver seat and the defendant in the passenger seat. The police then opened the back of the truck, where they found the\n   victim's body. After the body was discovered, the defendant gave two statements to the police, one written and one videotaped.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 20, 2014, in a long form information, the defendant was charged with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and tampering with physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 53a-155 (a). During his jury trial, the defendant claimed he acted in self-defense, but he did not testify. Ultimately, the defendant was acquitted of murder but convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and of tampering with physical evidence. The defendant received a total effective sentence of twenty-three years of incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PROSECUTORIAL IMPROPRIETY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant first claims that the prosecutor deprived him of his constitutional and statutory right to remain silent as well as his due process right to a fair trial by committing various acts of impropriety during closing argument to the jury. In particular, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly (1) commented on the defendant's failure to testify, (2) shifted and misstated the burden of proof with respect to self-defense, and (3) argued facts not in evidence. The state argues that the prosecutor's comments were not improper. Alternatively, the state contends that even if one or more of the prosecutor's comments were improper, none of them deprived the defendant of a fair trial. We disagree with the defendant that the prosecutor's comments were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the defendant's claim, we set forth the applicable standard of review and the law governing prosecutorial impropriety. Although the defendant did not preserve his claim of prosecutorial\n   impropriety by objecting to the alleged improprieties at trial, \"[o]nce prosecutorial impropriety has been alleged ... it is unnecessary for a defendant to seek to prevail under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), and it is unnecessary for an appellate court to review the defendant's claim under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fauci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951023\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/23/#p33\">\n    282 Conn. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20A.2d%20978\">\n    917 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). \"In analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process. ...

We conclude that the comments in question were not of such a character that the jury naturally and necessarily would construe them to be comments on the defendant's election not to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During closing argument, the prosecutor directed the jury's attention to what he argued were the material pieces of evidence that the jury should consider when determining the defendant's guilt. The prosecutor stated: \"What are some things you should look at? The two statements are probably the two most important things that give light to what happened here. In this courtroom there is one person [who] can tell you exactly what happened, to be truthful, and sit and ask questions, and that's [the defendant]. The only other person that we know is [the victim] and, unfortunately,\n   he's not here, or we wouldn't be here. So, who has something to lose when they start telling the story about why they got caught with a body in the back of a truck? You have to come up with some explanation when the police are banging on that door, saying, tell me what's going on back here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor again returned to the subject of the defendant's statements to the police, imploring the jury to \"[t]ake a look at the statements; those are the two closest things that we're going to get to in terms of what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The physical evidence speaks for itself. Does it line up with what we know? And what do we know? We know the story one person told. And the judge talks to you about credibility in terms of what you use to determine. Does somebody have a stake in what they're telling the police? Does somebody have a stake when they sit in that chair and testify for you? Who has the most to lose here? So, what does he say? Does his story in the statements make sense? When you're trying to recall a story about what actually happened, most of the time, you're going to get the facts straight because that's the truth you're testifying-you're recalling an event based on memory. But when you start trying to deceive somebody, those little details start falling away from what actually happened.\" The defendant did not object to these comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"It is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant's failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. ... Our legislature has given statutory recognition to this right by virtue of its enactment of ... \u00a7 54-84. In determining whether a prosecutor's comments have encroached upon a defendant's right to remain silent, we ask: Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment\n   on the failure of the accused to testify? ... Further, in applying this test, we must look to the context in which the statement was made in order to determine the manifest intention which prompted it and its natural and necessary impact upon the jury. ...

He asserts that the improper remarks attempted to inextricably link the defendant's credibility and viability of his self-defense claim to his failure to take the witness stand, as most clearly illustrated by his comment that the defendant was the \"one person\" who \"can tell [the jury] exactly what happened\" because \"[t]he only other person\" was the victim. The state argues that, if the comments are viewed in their full context, the prosecutor was stating to the jury that it\n   needed to assess carefully the credibility of the two statements that the defendant provided to police because the only two people who had firsthand knowledge of what occurred on the day the victim was killed were the defendant and the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, we conclude that although, in isolation, the statements relied on by the defendant could be construed as referring to the defendant's decision not to\n   testify, if the statements are put into the context of the entire trial and closing argument, the prosecutor's remarks refer to the evidence of the defendant's two statements to the police. Two of the challenged statements made by the prosecutor-\"[i]n this courtroom there is one person [who] can tell you exactly what happened, to be truthful, and sit and ask questions, and that's [the defendant], and \"[t]he only other person that we know is [the victim] and, unfortunately, he's not here, or we wouldn't be here\"-are immediately preceded and followed by language referring to the defendant's out-of-court statements, i.e., his statements to the police. Moreover, \"[i]n this courtroom\" arguably describes the current location of the \"one person,\" that is, the defendant, who is able to \"tell [the jury],\" that is, via his statements to the police, which were admitted at trial, what had happened on the day of the victim's death. To parse the sentence even further by examining what the prosecutor intended when he said, \"\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   tell you exactly what happened,\" instead of, more accurately, \"\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   tell you exactly what happened,\" would be to scrutinize each of the prosecutor's individual words in a vacuum, precisely what this court should not do. (Emphasis added.) See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felix R.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%201\">\n    319 Conn. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.3d%20871\">\n    124 A.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We necessarily allow the prosecutor generous latitude in closing argument, lest every inaccurate verb tense be deemed impropriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The challenged comment that is most equivocal in its meaning is the prosecutor's question, \"Does somebody\n   have a stake when they sit in that chair and testify for you?\" It is unclear whether the prosecutor was referring to the stake that any witness has when he or she sits in the witness chair and testifies at trial, the stake that the defendant specifically has when he sits in the witness chair and testifies at trial, or the stake that the defendant specifically has when he sits in a chair at the police station and gives his version of events, as presented to the jurors at trial. We conclude that this segment of the closing argument was, at worst, sufficiently ambiguous that it clearly was not \"manifestly intended to be, [nor] was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parrott\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653200\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/276/#p292\">\n    262 Conn. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20A.2d%20705\">\n    811 A.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, we conclude that the challenged statements do not constitute improper comments by the prosecutor on the defendant's failure to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Alleged Misstatement of Burden of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant next contends that the prosecutor misled the jury by misstating\n   the burden of proof regarding\n   self-defense. More specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly used the language \"probable\" and \"possible\" instead of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The state responds by arguing that the prosecutor's language was not improper because it was made in reference to a subsidiary finding by the jury, not a finding on one or more elements of self-defense. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During the state's direct examination of James R. Gill, the state's chief medical examiner, the prosecutor asked if the victim's wounds were consistent with the victim having been lying down at the time he was stabbed, to which Gill replied: \"Certainly, if he's [lying] down prone ... on his back, it would be a matter of having that surface of the body where the stab wound was to be able to be reachable or exposed to the knife.\" Subsequently, during cross-examination, the defendant's counsel engaged Gill in the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Q. Dr. Gill, from your examination of the body of [the victim], who started the fight?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"A. I have no idea if there even was a fight. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Q. And you don't know where [the victim] was standing in relation to the person who stabbed him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A. Yeah, I don't know if he was standing, sitting, lying down; that's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Q. Actually, it could be-as long as the-the arm could reach to the spot where the stab wound went in, it could be in any position, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"A. It could be from behind, reaching around, yeah, a variety of positions, yeah.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After this line of questioning, the defendant and his counsel performed demonstrations in the courtroom in\n   which they modeled several positions that the defendant and the victim may have been in when the altercation began and the victim sustained various injuries. The defendant's counsel then followed up the presentations by asking Gill if each demonstration was consistent with the wounds of the victim as contained in the autopsy findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, during closing argument, the prosecutor referenced these enactments and stated: \"You saw the defendant and his attorney provide demonstrations here in the courtroom; seemed pretty creative. Is it\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   ? Yes, it's\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   . But what is more\n   <em>\n    probable\n   </em>\n   in light of the injuries?\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We turn then to the authorities relevant to this claim. The defense of self-defense is codified in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, which provides in relevant part: \"(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical\n   force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose; except that deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or\n   about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Under our Penal Code, self-defense ... is a defense ... rather than an affirmative defense. ... Consequently, a defendant has no burden of persuasion for a claim of self-defense; he has only a burden of production. That is, he merely is required to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant presenting his claim of self-defense to the jury. ... Once the defendant has done so, it becomes the state's burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. ... The state may defeat a defendant's claim of self-defense involving deadly physical force by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, any of the following: (1) the defendant did not reasonably believe that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm; or (2) the defendant knew that he could avoid the necessity of using deadly physical force with complete safety by retreating ....\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146133\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/734/#p747\">\n    292 Conn. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20679\">\n    974 A.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although, in a criminal prosecution, a material fact must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, \"[t]his does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt ... because this court has held that a jury's factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. ... [I]t is a function of the jury to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. ... Because [t]he only kind of inference recognized by the law is a reasonable one ... any such inference cannot be based on possibilities, surmise or conjecture. ...

We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The prosecutor's remark-\"Yes, it's possible. But what is more probable\"-explicitly refers to the courtroom demonstrations that the defendant and his counsel engaged in during the trial. Those demonstrations attempted to show the different positions that the victim may have been in in relation to the defendant at the time the altercation began and escalated, in an effort to cast doubt on the state's theory that the victim was lying down when the dispute started. The only two elements of self-defense that the state must disprove \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" are (1) that the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm, and (2) that the defendant did not know that he could avoid the necessity of using deadly physical force with complete safety by retreating. Therefore, although evidence offered to prove how the victim was positioned when the dispute began is certainly useful information for the jury to consider, it is not an element of self-defense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19. Accordingly, as a subordinate conclusion of the jury, the conclusion need only be reasonable, but cannot be based on\n   \" 'possibilities, surmise or conjecture.' \"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Niemeyer\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"357798\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/510/#p518\">\n    258 Conn. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=782%20A.2d%20658\">\n    782 A.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the prosecutor characterized the defendant's demonstrations to the jury as providing only a\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   version of the events in question, he referenced\n   the proper \"reasonable\" versus merely \"possible\" standard assigned to subsidiary findings. We conclude, therefore, that the prosecutor did not commit impropriety by using the \"possible\" versus \"probable\" language during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Relatedly, the defendant also claims in this section of his brief that the prosecutor improperly communicated to the jury during closing argument the state's theory that the defendant initially stabbed the victim while the victim was sleeping. More specifically, the defendant argues that this theory was unsupported by the evidence. The state responds that this theory constituted a reasonable inference drawn from both the testimony of Gill and the physical evidence of the victim's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[T]he line between permissible inference and impermissible speculation is not always easy to discern. When we infer, we derive a conclusion from proven facts because such considerations as experience, or history, or science have demonstrated that there is a likely correlation between those facts and the conclusion. ... But if the correlation between the facts and the conclusion is slight, or if a different conclusion is more closely correlated with the facts than the chosen conclusion, the inference is less reasonable. At some point, the link between the facts and the conclusion becomes so tenuous that we call it speculation.

On redirect, the state again followed up on this theory, asking Gill \"if a person was prone, face\n   down, and a right-handed person approached the person that's prone up toward the head area, and the person would be lower, wouldn't that also be consistent with the type of wounds that were received on the-the left side of the neck and shoulder,\" and whether \"[i]t would be easier for a shorter person to reach a taller person at that-at that level,\" to both of which Gill answered in the affirmative. Given this testimony and the one-sided nature of the victim's injuries, and especially in light of the generous latitude we afford prosecutors during closing arguments, it was reasonable for the prosecutor to ask the jury to infer that the victim was first attacked when he was asleep. We conclude that this did not constitute impropriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Alleged Interjection of Facts not in Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the defendant contends that the prosecutor committed an impropriety during closing argument when he interjected facts that were not in evidence. Specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly brought in \"facts\" that were based on assumptions about professional fighters in general, drug addicts in general, and the defendant and the victim in particular. The state responds that these comments constituted an appropriate use of a rhetorical device designed to appeal to the jury's common sense. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor, in an effort to cast doubt on the defendant's\n   self-defense claim and, more specifically, on the statements that the defendant made to the police regarding the nature and length of the struggle he had with the victim, stated the following: \"Professional fighters don't even fight all out for an hour, and they're trained. It's not like either one of these people was trained in anything; drug addicts, they don't\n   eat right, they're using drugs. Are they going to be physically capable of fighting all out for an hour? That's-that's for you to decide. But it's really, kind of, making a huge stretch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our law is well settled that \"[the prosecutor's] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. ... That is not to say, however, that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. ... The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. ...

The use of juxtaposition, wherein one places a person, concept, or idea parallel to another to highlight the contrast between the two and compare them, as a rhetorical device to make a point in closing argument, is not prohibited. In this case, the prosecutor used the device in appealing to the jury's common sense that, because even professional fighters lack the stamina to fight continuously for an hour, the defendant's version of events simply was incredible.

To hold otherwise would be to put the prosecutor in the prohibited \"rhetorical straitjacket,\" which we decline to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, we conclude that none of the challenged comments by the prosecutor was improper. Accordingly, the defendant was not deprived of his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY BY DETECTIVE WUCHEK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claim that \"[t]he trial court erred in permitting\n   [Michael Wuchek, a detective with the New Haven Police Department] to testify as an expert witness to body language and other indicators of untruthfulness during police interviews, thereby invading the credibility determinations and fact-finding province of the jury.\" In response, the state argues that (1) the defendant's claim is unpreserved, (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting this testimony because Wuchek did not opine on the defendant's credibility, and (3) the defendant's failure to\n   object to other similar evidence rendered Wuchek's testimony cumulative, thus rendering any error in permitting his testimony harmless. We conclude that to the extent the defendant claims on appeal that Wuchek's testimony is not a proper topic for expert testimony because it is inherently unreliable, this claim was not properly preserved at trial, and to the extent that the defendant claims that the testimony invaded the jury's exclusive function as trier of fact to assess the defendant's credibility, the trial court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During its case-in-chief, the state presented the testimony of Joseph Pettola, a detective with the New Haven Police Department. Pettola, who participated in the videotaped interview of the defendant along with Wuchek, described the defendant's demeanor during that meeting as \"kind of on the nervous side.\" He further testified, without objection, that the defendant \"wouldn't look Detective Wuchek in our eye-in the eye, in our eyes, which is an indicator of, you know, if you're telling the truth or not, and doing many, many-hundreds of interviews in my career.\" The prosecutor then engaged in the following exchange with Pettola:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"Q. All right. Were you also sort of paying attention to things like body language and things of that nature as [the defendant's] answering questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"A. Of course.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"Q. All right. What are you looking for when you're doing interviews and you're in that role, you're just observing somebody?

After the videotape concluded, the state asked Wuchek if he \"[pays] any particular attention to such things like body language\" during his police interviews, to which Wuchek answered in the affirmative. When the state asked him to elaborate on why he does that, the defendant objected on the ground of relevance, without further elucidation, which the trial court overruled. Wuchek then replied that \"[b]ody language helps [him] gauge the truthfulness of people's answers,\" to which the defendant again objected, stating: \"The jury has seen a videotape of the entire interview. The witness' interpretation of my client's credibility is-is taking on the jury's job.\" The trial court disagreed and again overruled the objection. Wuchek continued: \"Through interview and interrogation courses, we've learned\n   that-I learned that people who are interviewed, sometimes, when they are untruthful they'll cover their mouth, they'll-they'll hunch down. Other indicators just help us get a feel for that person.\" The prosecutor went on to ask for other indicators of untruthfulness, to which Wuchek cited various behaviors such as repeating interview questions, taking long pauses, and looking down or away from the interviewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In a final exchange relevant to this claim, the prosecutor asked Wuchek if, during the course of his interview\n   with the defendant, he had at his disposal bank records, phone records, evidence from the U-Haul scene, and/ or evidence from the rental unit scene. Wuchek stated, \"No, I don't think so.\" The following colloquy then took place between the prosecutor, Wuchek, the defendant's counsel, and the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: All right. So, how does ... a lack of information such as being able to do those things affect your interview in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Well, I want to have as many facts as I-as I can to the case, both background and facts of the physical evidence so that I can gauge that person-gauge that person's truthfulness.

I didn't hear anything about his courses at the police academy or anything that he did in order to prepare himself to determine somebody's truthfulness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"The Court: All right. Do you want to get into more of a foundation on that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Judge, I believe the officer's testified he's conducted over thousands of interviews, and he just testified that through courses in interrogations and interviews, he's had training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"The Court: All right.

Go ahead.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As a threshold matter, we first address the state's initial argument that the defendant's evidentiary claim was not preserved at trial and, thus, is unreviewable by this court on appeal. \"[T]he standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ...

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Leniart\n   </em>\n   , we held that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding expert testimony that was \"narrowly tailored to provide only general information related to [jailhouse] informant testimony and its unreliability\";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leniart\n   </em>\n   , supra, 224 ; because the expert \"offered no testimony regarding any of the particular informants in this case, either with respect to their status as informants, how they had obtained their information, or their potential reliability as witnesses.\" Id., 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Similarly, in the present case, the trial court record reveals that Wuchek was never asked for, nor did he offer, his opinion as to either the credibility of this particular defendant, the truthfulness of this particular defendant's statements, or whether the defendant exhibited any behaviors characteristic of untruthful behavior. Although Wuchek did testify generally as to various behaviors concerning eye contact, posture, and speaking patterns that, on the basis of his training and experience, he opined are characteristic of people who are being untruthful, Wuchek, unlike the expert in\n   <em>\n    Favoccia\n   </em>\n   , did not directly comment on whether this particular witness exhibited any of those discussed behaviors. The jury remained free to assess independently, untainted by expert testimony, whether the defendant actually engaged in such behaviors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling the defendant's objection to Wuchek's testimony on the ground that it invaded the province of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, we conclude that to the extent the defendant is now claiming that body language and other behavioral indicators of untruthfulness are not proper subjects for expert testimony because they are inherently unreliable, this claim was not properly preserved at trial. To the extent that the defendant is claiming that Wuchek's testimony invaded the jury's exclusive function as trier of fact to assess the defendant's credibility, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making this evidentiary ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   ADMISSION OF POSTMORTEM PHOTOGRAPHS OF VICTIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly admitted postmortem photographs of\n   the victim's corpse in advanced decomposition. The defendant argues that the limited evidentiary value of the photographs was outweighed by their prejudicial effect because the photographs improperly inflamed the emotions of the jury. In response, the state argues that the defendant has failed to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the subject photographs. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   During the state's case-in-chief, Matthew Greenstein, a state police trooper responsible for collecting evidence at the scene where the victim's body was found, identified five photographs that depicted various items as they appeared in the back of the U-Haul truck. The defendant objected to the admission of one of the photographs that depicted the victim's body partially rolled in the rug amid other items in the back of the truck, and the trial court excused the jurors. The defendant conceded that the photograph was relevant, but argued that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect because it portrayed a decaying head that would be shocking to the jury. Moreover, he contended that the state had already established that there was a body found in the back of the U-Haul and that the body was that of the victim. The state argued that the photograph was relevant to the case, as the manner in which the victim's body was discovered was relevant both to the charge of tampering with physical evidence as well as to the defendant's state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The trial court examined the photograph and overruled the defendant's objection, noting that the photograph was part of the history of the case and relevant to both counts, and that it was not inflammatory because it merely depicted the left arm of a person, presumably the victim, with the top of the body being \"dark; this\n   court cannot even make out what that entails.\" Ultimately, the trial court concluded that the photograph was \"not so prejudicial that it cannot be seen [by] the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The defendant next objected to autopsy photographs of the victim that the state sought to admit during its direct examination of Gill, the chief medical examiner. After the jury was excused from the courtroom, the defendant again asserted that the probative value of the photographs was very small compared to the prejudicial effect they would have on the jury, as the\n   photographs contained shocking depictions of \"a body that's been decaying and skin has slipped off and the skin is discolored.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also argued that although the photographs may better show the jury the specific locations of stab wounds on the victim's body, the same information was already presented to the jury through other means, specifically, the medical examiner's report, a diagram with markings representing the locations of the stab wounds on the body, and the testimony of Gill. In contrast, the state argued that it had selected the fewest number of photographs from the autopsy that it believed would sufficiently convey the full examination, and that the photographs were necessary to aid the jurors in \"[listen]ing to the testimony of [Gill], putting together the written version along with a visual aspect in order for them to gasp the totality of what the examination included.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The trial court, which had previously examined the photographs in chambers, overruled the defendant's objection, citing the state's heavy burden to prove every element of the two count information beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant's self-defense theory of the case on which the jury was to be instructed in the\n   future. More specifically, the trial court stated that \"it's very relevant for this jury to see ... the number of stab wounds, the location of the stab wounds because that gets into the subjective, objective thoughts of the defendant and his claim of self-defense. So, that's relevant. ... I understand that the photos are not the easiest to see. The record will reflect that I have seen the photos in chambers. So, I am going to allow them in. I find that they would be an aid to this jury and they are relevant evidence, so I will allow them in.\" Accordingly, the trial court engaged in a weighing of the probative value of these photographs against their prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As previously mentioned, our standard of review for evidentiary rulings is well established. \"The trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. ... The exercise of such discretion is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bunting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160054\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/60/665/#p670\">\n    60 Conn.App. 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=760%20A.2d%20989\">\n    760 A.2d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). \"[S]ound discretion has long meant a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by the reason and conscience of the judge to a just result.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689243\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/1/#p8\">\n    195 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%20570\">\n    485 A.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).

As previously recounted, the trial court heard a lengthy offer of proof and arguments from the parties before balancing the probative value of the photographs against the risk of unfair prejudice. With respect to the photograph showing what appeared to be the victim's body in a rug in the back of the U-Haul truck, the trial court had difficulty even finding anything inflammatory about the image because it was difficult for the viewer to make out any details\n   concerning the appearance of the victim's body. With respect to the autopsy examination photographs, we have previously held that \"[a]utopsy photographs depicting the wounds of victims are independently relevant because they may show the character, location and course of the [weapon],\" and that it is not an abuse of discretion to admit them when they are presented \"to prove intent and causation, to help explain the autopsy procedure, [and] to assist the medical examiner in describing his observations ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5486113\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/88/404/#p428\">\n    88 Conn.App. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=870%20A.2d%208\">\n    870 A.2d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3150886,3149681,3152022,3151311\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/917/\">\n    275 Conn. 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=883%20A.2d%201250\">\n    883 A.2d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). On the basis of our review of the record, including the photographs in question, therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the photographs into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   EXCLUSION OF PROFFERED SELF-DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly excluded evidence relevant to his state of mind and self-defense claim, thereby violating his right to present a defense. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court should have allowed the jury to hear evidence of his prior experience as a witness to a fatal knife fight many years earlier because it was relevant to support his subjective belief that he needed to use deadly physical force against the victim pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19. In response, the state argues that the trial court acted well within its discretion in concluding that the proffered evidence lacked a sufficient nexus to the defendant's altercation with the victim in this case. We agree with the state that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   During his case-in-chief, the defendant, as support for his self-defense claim, sought to admit evidence of\n   a fatal knife fight that he had witnessed fourteen years earlier. Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant offered the testimony of private investigator Deborah Curtis, who did not witness the altercation but had investigated\n   the fatal stabbing back in 2000. Curtis testified that the defendant, who was fourteen years old at the time of the incident, was at home with his mother and stepfather when his mother's former boyfriend arrived at the home with a knife and began fighting with his stepfather. After a struggle in which his stepfather was repeatedly stabbed, his stepfather ultimately wrestled the knife away and fatally stabbed the former boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Before the defendant could finish his questioning of Curtis, however, both the state and the trial court interjected. The state proceeded to object to the admission of the evidence on relevance grounds, citing its remoteness in time from the events of the present case, and the lack of correlation between the proffered evidence and the alleged events of the present case. In response, the defendant argued that \"the fact that he witnessed two of his stepfathers in a knife fight and one of them died is a subjective aspect of this-of his psyche and what he was anticipating the threat to be when [the victim] came at him with a knife.\" The defendant also informed the trial court that he intended to call to the witness stand Sergio Estrada, the defendant's stepfather and one of the two individuals involved in the knife fight in 2000, as part of his offer of proof. Specifically, the defendant's counsel stated that he intended \"to have [the defendant's] stepfather, who survived, testify; he's going to show scars on his hand where the knife severed almost all of his fingers off, scars on his back where he was stabbed on the back, and we're going to hear about how bloody this confrontation was, how the family was at risk, and how the individual who came into the house with a knife was intoxicated.\" This proffer\n   did not include any indication that Estrada could testify to what precisely the defendant saw during the altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The trial court ultimately sustained the state's relevancy objection to the offer of proof, without hearing Estrada testify. It ruled that the offer of proof was not relevant to what the jury had to decide, stating that it \"thought [the trial court] was going to hear an offer of proof concerning that [the victim] was somehow involved in a prior altercation or this defendant heard about [the victim] being involved in a stabbing incident and was fearful,\" and that the defendant was \"basically saying then that if somebody's charged with a violent assault, like we are here, which ended up in a murder, and they're pleading self-defense ... that every episode that he or she was exposed to that has no bearing whatsoever on the deceased in the case on trial ... the jury should hear ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. \"As we recently observed, [a] defendant's right to present a defense does not include a right to present evidence that properly is excluded under the rules of evidence. ...
