The defendant was convicted, following his guilty pleas made pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), attempt to commit kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and sexual assault in the fourth\n   degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (2). On appeal, the defendant, raising a number of constitutional and nonconstitutional issues, claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defendant's appellate claims, however, challenge the validity of his conviction rather than his sentence or the sentencing\n   proceeding. We conclude, therefore, that the court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion. On August 29, 2007, the defendant appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Miano, J.\n   </em>\n   , to enter guilty pleas to the charges pending against him. The defendant intended to plead guilty pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine. The prosecutor recited the factual bases underlying the charges against the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the plea canvass, a question arose regarding\n   whether the defendant wanted to plead guilty pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine or enter a \"straight guilty plea to all three of the charges ....\" After further discussion, the court accepted the guilty pleas pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine. On October 17, 2007, Judge Miano sentenced the defendant to fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after time served,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and twenty years probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 22, 2011, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. That motion was denied on November 10, 2011. On September 3, 2014, the defendant filed another motion to vacate or correct an illegal sentence or, in the alternative, for a writ of error coram nobis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant requested that the court vacate or correct the plea disposition and his sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, in the alternative, issue a writ of error coram nobis. He argued that as a result of the new interpretation of our kidnapping statutes as set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/\">\n    287 Conn. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the state and the court had committed\n   \"numerous constitutional errors\" resulting in his sentences\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   being void or subject to correction. On November 20, 2014, the state filed a response to the defendant's motion arguing, inter alia, that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Alexander, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision dismissing the defendant's motion. With respect to the Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 claim, the court noted that the defendant's arguments essentially challenged the validity of his conviction, and therefore it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. As to the petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the court observed that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petition had been filed untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, the defendant presents a variety of claims, including that the dismissal of his motion to correct an illegal sentence deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, that his conviction for kidnapping constituted plain error and that the court abused its discretion and misapplied Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. The state counters that the court properly dismissed the defendant's motion because it challenged his convictions and not his sentence or the sentencing proceeding. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the outset, we note that the defendant's claims pertain to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court, and therefore present a question of law subject to the plenary standard of review.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Koslik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065376\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/116/693/#p697\">\n    116 Conn.App. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20275\">\n    977 A.2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147608,4146425,4148204\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/930/\">\n    293 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20916\">\n    980 A.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bozelko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20750\">\n    154 Conn.App. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%20262\">\n    108 A.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20709\">\n    152 Conn.App. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201258\">\n    99 A.3d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The Superior Court is a constitutional court of general jurisdiction.

Distilled to their essence, however, they share a common denominator; that is, the defendant should not have been convicted of the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree and attempt to commit kidnapping in the first degree under our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/\">\n    287 Conn. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Brescia\n   </em>\n   , the defendant attacks his conviction, and not his sentence or sentencing proceeding, and the trial court, therefore, properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. Simply stated, a motion to correct an illegal sentence is not the proper procedural path for the defendant in this case to contest the validity of his guilty pleas following the change to our kidnapping laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \"Under\n    <em>\n     North Carolina\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Alford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     400 U.S. 25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     91 S.Ct. 160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     27 L.Ed.2d 162\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1970), a criminal defendant is not required to admit his guilt ... but consents to being punished as if he were guilty to avoid the risk of proceeding to trial. ...
