The defendant Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association (association),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the decision of the\n   Workers' Compensation Review Board (board) affirming the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Eighth District (commissioner)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   granting motions joined by the plaintiff Carmel Graham\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendants F.D. Rich Housing Corporation (F.D. Rich) and The Hartford Insurance Group (The Hartford)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to reinstate the association as a party to proceedings brought pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 et seq. On appeal, the association claims that the commissioner improperly reinstated it to the proceedings because: (1) in the absence of a timely appeal to the board, the order dismissing the claim against the association was a final decision entitled to res judicata effect pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-300\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 31-301(a) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the motions to reinstate the association did not satisfy the standards necessary to open an award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-315.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the commissioner\n   properly reinstated the association as a party to the underlying proceedings because the commissioner's broad case management authority under General Statutes \u00a7 31-298,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which extends to cases on the asbestos docket involving the apportionment of liability under General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   permitted him to render a dismissal that was provisional, rather than final, in nature. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In 2006, the plaintiff's decedent, John Graham (decedent); see footnote 4 of this opinion;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   filed several notices of claim on form 30C with the commission, alleging that he had sustained a lung injury from exposure to asbestos while working for several different employers, including F.D. Rich. The commission assigned the decedent's claims to its asbestos docket for adjudication, after which several informal and preformal hearings took place. After the decedent died in 2008, the plaintiff, his widow, filed a claim for dependent benefits in 2009 that was joined with the original claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance), one of F.D. Rich's workers' compensation insurance carriers, became insolvent, and its liability transferred statutorily to the association. See footnote 1 of this opinion. On January 26, 2011, the commissioner conducted a formal hearing that was attended by numerous attorneys representing the decedent's various employers and their respective workers' compensation carriers, along with the association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commissioner stated that the purpose of the formal hearing was to \"clear the room of who doesn't need to be here and then we will get to the meat of the case at the next session.\" At that hearing, six of the employers, along with the association, moved to dismiss the claims against them for lack of exposure. With no objection from the plaintiff, the commissioner issued a \"revised finding and decision\" on June 9, 2011, which granted these motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 29, 2012, the commissioner conducted another formal hearing. At that hearing, five of the decedent's other employers and their respective insurers\n   moved to dismiss the claims against them, three of which were granted with the plaintiff's consent. The commissioner then advised counsel for the association, who was present at the hearing as a courtesy to the commission, that: \"I think we need to bring [the association] back in, and ... you will be on the notice for the next hearing.\" At that hearing, counsel for The Hartford stated that he had reviewed the record and questioned whether the decedent had any claim arising from a very brief period of employment in the first quarter of 1977, during which The Hartford insured F.D. Rich. Counsel for The Hartford stated that his reading of the record \"[involved the association again] as a potential party [defendant] and indeed ... potentially a lead [defendant] under [\u00a7 31-299b ].\" He asked whether the plaintiff would need further participation from The Hartford, observing that, \"if I drop out, then all the more reason for [the association] to become [involved again].\" After some additional discussion, counsel for The Hartford agreed to file a motion to dismiss to which the plaintiff could respond after reviewing the record. The commissioner advised counsel for the association that an official request to cite the association back into the proceedings would be forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, on February 6, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion asking that the association be \"cited back into this claim as a [defendant],\" in which she contended that the order dismissing it was \"interlocutory and provisional and ... not an adjudication on the merits of the [plaintiff's] claims or [the association's] defenses.\" The plaintiff stated that The Hartford had filed a motion to dismiss for lack of causative exposure that, if successful, would have \"implicated\" the association under \u00a7 31-299b because the \"next carrier on the risk would [have been] an insolvent carrier,\" namely, Reliance. On February 14, 2013, The Hartford filed a similar motion, joined by F.D. Rich, seeking to reinstate the association to the proceedings in light of The Hartford's pending\n   motion to dismiss. The association opposed these motions. On January 29, 2014, the commissioner heard arguments from the parties on these motions at a formal hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 4, 2014, the commissioner granted the motions by the plaintiff and The Hartford to reinstate the association as a party to the case, rejecting the association's argument that the order dismissing it from the case was a \"binding judgment and that, absent an appeal [to the board] within [twenty] days, it can only be undone by application of [\u00a7] 31-315.\" Specifically, the commissioner rejected the association's reliance on res judicata principles, observing that the record contained no evidence,\n   findings, or formal stipulations that the association \"had no liability to the [plaintiff].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He emphasized that, in \"asbestos cases there are often so many potential [defendants] that the administrative preference for 'culling the herd' prior to a formal hearing is understandable. However, until the date of last exposure has been determined-and with it the identity of the party against whom an award would be made under [\u00a7] 31-299b-agreements to let out certain parties must be viewed as interlocutory.\" The commissioner further observed that bringing the association back into the case would not prejudice it or any other party because no exhibits had yet been admitted, the association reserved its right to recall the only witness who had testified, namely, the plaintiff, and the association \"will be granted reasonable time to prepare for [the] continuation of the formal hearing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The association appealed from the commissioner's decision to the board. Acknowledging that, \"over the years, certain procedural customs and conventions have evolved [that] are unique to the management of the asbestos docket,\" the board concluded that the governing statutes \"provide the framework for assessing the merits of a claim,\" and that a \"close reading\" of \u00a7 31-299b\"indicates quite clearly that the legislature intended that the apportionment of liability among the various [defendants] in these claims can\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   occur after the conclusion of litigation on the merits of the underlying claim.\" (Emphasis in original.) The board, therefore, agreed with the commissioner's conclusion that, \"until the date of last exposure has been determined-and with it the identity of the party against whom an award would be made under [\u00a7] 31-299b-agreements to let out certain parties must be viewed as interlocutory.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) To this end, the board concluded that it did not matter whether the hearing at which the association's motion to dismiss was granted was \"formal\" or \"informal,\" insofar as the \"actual language\" of \u00a7 31-299b contemplates apportionment only after the adjudication on the merits of the underlying claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The board determined that the record demonstrated that the underlying merits of the plaintiff's claim, including compensability, had not yet been adjudicated at the time of the order dismissing the association. The board further observed that \"[t]o allow a party to escape liability prematurely because of a procedural irregularity, thereby potentially thwarting an injured claimant's ability to collect an\n   award of benefits, not only does violence to the plain meaning of the statute but also clearly runs counter to the remedial nature and humanitarian\n   purpose of the [act].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the board affirmed the commissioner's decision granting the motions to reinstate the association as a party to this case. This appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the association claims that, under \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-301(a), the failure, by the plaintiff and The Hartford, to appeal to the board rendered the commissioner's dismissal a final judgment. The association argues that the board's decision allowing it to be reinstated as a party \"circumvented\" \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-301(a), even assuming that \u00a7 31-299b does not allow for dismissals of claims against apportionment respondents prior to a formal adjudication as a matter of law. The association contends that the board's characterization of the previous proceedings as having \" 'merely excus [ed] [the association] by agreement' is a wild mischaracterization,\" insofar as there was a formal hearing at which all parties had the opportunity to participate. The association further contends that the plaintiff's decision not to challenge its motion to dismiss was in effect a \"[surrender] of [the] claim against\" it, and that the board's decision has the effect of creating \"different tiers of formal proceedings ....\" Addressing an issue not reached by the board; see footnote 15 of this opinion; the association also argues that the commissioner improperly invoked \u00a7 31-315, which governs motions to open or modify awards, to support his decision to cite the association back into the case. Specifically, the association posits that \u00a7 31-315 does not support the commissioner's decision to reinstate it as a party\n   because no conditions of fact changed between its dismissal and reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, the plaintiff contends, inter alia, that \"[t]he fluidity with which [defendants] are cited into and dismissed from asbestos disease claims is properly within the procedural discretion of the commissioners,\" and is consistent with the remedial purpose of the act, which is to provide a simple and efficient procedure that effectuates \"the sole remedy for employees and their dependents for work-related injuries and death.\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"102150\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/245/66/#p71\">\n    245 Conn. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20A.2d%20938\">\n    712 A.2d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). The plaintiff also relies on \u00a7 31-298, which provides that the commissioner is not bound by \"ordinary common law or statutory rules of evidence or procedure,\" to argue that a motion to dismiss before the commission is not identical, for purposes of finality, to a motion to dismiss filed in the Superior Court. To this end, the plaintiff relies on the customary deference afforded to the board's construction of the act, and argues that principles of res judicata do not apply because the merits of the claims were never litigated, and that the dismissal was \"merely administratively permitted\" to facilitate the management of a factually complex occupational disease claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff, The Hartford, and F.D. Rich emphasize that the association was not prejudiced by the \"provisional dismissal\" insofar as the association, through counsel, reserved the right to participate or object if brought back into the case, did in fact participate throughout, and had suffered no due process deprivation because no evidence on the merits has been admitted other than the plaintiff's testimony establishing her dependency, which the association has reserved its right to cross-examine. In contrast, the plaintiff argues\n   that \"[s]trict adherence to purported rules of procedure in this complex asbestos workers' compensation claim would certainly result in surprise and injustice\" for her,\n   because she would be left with no \u00a7 31-299b carrier if the association were not reinstated and The Hartford's motion to dismiss were ultimately granted. We agree with the plaintiff, The Hartford, and F.D. Rich and conclude that the board properly determined that the initial dismissal was provisional, thus permitting the commissioner to reinstate the association as a party to the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"As a threshold matter, we set forth the [well established] standard of review applicable to workers' compensation appeals. ... The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... [Moreover, it] is well established that [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers' compensation statutes by the commissioner and ... board. ... Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. ... We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency's interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute ... has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency's time-tested interpretation ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Furthermore, [i]t is well established that, in resolving issues of statutory construction under the act, we are mindful that the act indisputably is a remedial statute that should be construed generously to accomplish\n   its purpose. ... The humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers' compensation. ... Accordingly, [i]n construing workers' compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act. ...

The parties agree that the nature of occupational disease claims often renders them factually complex because they may implicate numerous employers and their insurers, particularly at the outset of a claim brought by a claimant with a lengthy work history, when the periods of exposure have yet to be determined. For example, this case required\n   the decedent, who had a thirty year career as a carpenter, to send notices of claim to twenty-nine employers, some of whom had multiple insurance carriers.

We further conclude that the board properly deemed the order dismissing the association in this case to be provisional, rather than a final award subject to \u00a7 31-315, despite the lapse of the appeal period set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-301 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, consistent with the fact that the compensability of the decedent's illness had yet to be determined, the commissioner did not characterize the order dismissing the association in a manner suggesting its finality, such as by calling it \"an award\" or noting that the dismissal was \"with prejudice.\" See\n   <em>\n    Pietraroia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Northeast Utilities\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116765\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/254/60/#p71\">\n    254 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   69 and n.11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20845\">\n    756 A.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering propriety of dismissal \" 'with prejudice' \" as result of claimant's failure to appear, and emphasizing that such dismissal meant\n   \"with finality-without the ability in the [claimant] to revive it\"). Further, as the board noted, although the plaintiff, The Hartford, and F.D. Rich did not object to the association's initial motion to dismiss, neither did they at any time stipulate specifically to a lack of liability on its part on the record. This, coupled with the fact that compensability of the claim had not yet been determined for purposes of the first step under the \u00a7 31-299b apportionment process, strongly suggests that the dismissal of the association was not entitled to administrative finality with the effect of res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Marone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104134\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/1/#p12\">\n    244 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20A.2d%20725\">\n    707 A.2d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (noting that res judicata depends on lack of need for further action by court to determine matter); see also\n   <em>\n    Coldwell Banker Manning Realty, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146473\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/582/#p594\">\n    293 Conn. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20819\">\n    980 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (grievance committee dismissal of arbitration request was not \" 'mutual, final and definite' \" award for purposes of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 [a] ). Given the sheer multiplicity of respondents in the typical asbestos case, the commissioner must have the discretion under \u00a7 31-298 to, as the commissioner in this case put it, \"clear the room\" or \"[cull] the herd,\" with the flexibility of reinstating parties or insurers to\n   the proceedings should the date of last exposure be different than anticipated. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the provisional nature of the order dismissing the association and the permissibility of reinstating the association as a party to the proceedings are both demonstrated by the fact that the record reveals no prejudice to the association from the commissioner's order granting the motions to reinstate it as a party. Out of an apparent abundance of caution, the association's attorney has prudently attended all proceedings before the commission, and there has been no fact finding yet with respect to the compensability of, and liability for, the benefits due to the plaintiff. Moreover, as was discussed at oral argument before this court, the record does not reveal any problems with respect to the loss of evidence occasioned by the association's dismissal. Finally, to the extent that any evidence has been admitted, that evidence consists of the plaintiff's very brief testimony to establish her entitlement to dependent benefits under the act; the commissioner granted the association the opportunity to recall her for cross-examination should it desire to do so.
