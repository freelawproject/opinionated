Attorney Barry Butler represented the petitioner in the criminal matter. On December 16, 2005, the trial court (\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez, J\n   </em>\n   .) imposed a total effective sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-five years to serve, followed by thirty-five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The petitioner appealed from the judgment of conviction, which was affirmed by the Appellate Court.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063795\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/581/#p583\">\n    115 Conn.App. 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%2072\">\n    974 A.2d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146604,4147829,4146551\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/916/\">\n    293 Conn. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20492\">\n    979 A.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The petitioner filed his first habeas corpus petition, Docket No. CV-07-4001687, in which he was represented by Attorney Joseph Visone. On October 25, 2010, after trial, the court (\n   <em>\n    T. Santos, J\n   </em>\n   .) denied the habeas petition. A subsequent appeal of the habeas court's decision was dismissed by the Appellate Court on March 27, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   See\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6783104,6783161,6783134\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/903/\">\n    134 Conn.App. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20A.3d%201253\">\n    38 A.3d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). This petition followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 11, 2012, the petitioner brought this petition. In his one count amended petition dated April 30, 2014, the petitioner asserts that his prior habeas counsel was ineffective in failing to establish Attorney\n   Butler's deficient performance in that Attorney Butler:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. Failed to adequately discuss with the petitioner the state's evidence and to advise him on the applicable law so as to allow him to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision to try his case before a jury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. Failed to adequately investigate the case, potential witnesses and potential defenses to the state's DNA evidence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. Failed to seek an independent evaluation of the DNA evidence obtained by the state, to determine whether exculpatory evidence could be obtained;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. Failed to prepare and present pretrial motions directed to obtain and preserve potentially exculpatory DNA evidence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5. Failed to properly prepare and argue a motion to suppress the state's DNA evidence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6. Failed to adequately prepare for trial, including cross-examination of witnesses, rebutting the state's DNA evidence and arguing third party culpability as to the petitioner's cousin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The petitioner argues that these several claimed deficiencies are of such magnitude as to render his representation by Attorney Butler constitutionally deficient. For the following reasons, the several claims fail, and the court denies the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The entirety of the petition surrounds the DNA evidence presented to the court during the motion to suppress and to the jury during the underlying criminal\n   trial. Accordingly, the court's focus will be on facts found by this court relative to recovered DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 19, 2006, at a hearing on the petitioner's motion to suppress before the trial court (\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez, J\n   </em>\n   .), Dr. Michael Bourke, lead criminalist at the Connecticut State Forensic Science Laboratory, testified to the proper procedures for the acceptance of potential DNA evidence from an outside agency, as well as the proper procedures for the preservation, testing, analysis and comparison of DNA samples in his facility. The doctor also testified to state and federal regulations and protocols designed to maintain the integrity of both the nationwide computerized DNA database, known as \"CODIS\" (Combining DNA Index) in general and the State Laboratory in particular. Comparing the testimony provided by Dr. Bourke to the subsequent trial testimony of State Laboratory employees, this court finds nothing in the evidence to suggest that there were any improprieties in the processing and analysis of the DNA evidence submitted to the State Laboratory in the petitioner's underlying criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Karen Lamy, a criminalist at the Connecticut State Forensic Science Laboratory's forensic biology section, testified at the petitioner's criminal trial. Ms. Lamy testified to the submission of the sexual assault evidence collection kit to the laboratory, her examination of vaginal smears collected from the victim by medical personnel, and her identification of spermatozoa and red blood cells on the smear. The evidence collected from the smear was submitted by Ms. Lamy for DNA analysis. Ms. Lamy later received buccal swabs from the petitioner and the victim's boyfriend that were submitted for DNA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Christine Roy, a forensic science examiner for the Connecticut State Forensic Science Laboratory, testified at the petitioner's criminal trial. Ms. Roy examined\n   the results of the vaginal smear and buccal swabs submitted to her section by Ms. Lamy for the presence of physiological\n   fluids and DNA testing. Ms. Roy obtained DNA profiles from the vaginal smear. Ms. Roy also examined known DNA profiles of the petitioner and the victim's boyfriend from buccal swabs submitted by law enforcement, as well as a known DNA profile of the victim from the sexual assault evidence collection kit. Ms. Lamy testified that after a DNA extraction process and subsequent analysis, all of the petitioner's DNA profile was identified as being present in the DNA mixture of spermatozoa obtained from the vaginal swab contained in the sexual assault collection kit taken from the victim of the sexual assault for which the petitioner stood trial. Ms. Lamy further testified that the expected frequency of individuals who could be a contributor to the DNA profile from the sperm-rich fraction of the vaginal smear is approximately one in six hundred fifty thousand in the African-American population. The affidavit in support of the search and seizure warrant that authorized the taking of a buccal swab DNA sample from the petitioner identifies him as \"Black.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Lamy further testified that Dwayne White, the petitioner's cousin, was eliminated as a contributor to the DNA profile of spermatozoa taken from the vaginal smear contained in the sexual assault collection kit obtained from the victim after the sexual assault for which the petitioner stood trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the petitioner's trial on his previous habeas petition, much the same evidence was presented to the trial court. Attorney Visone's examination of the several witnesses called was thorough and well within the range of competent representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During the instant habeas trial, the petitioner submitted a number of exhibits as well the testimony of himself\n   and criminal trial counsel. The petitioner and respondent submitted into evidence portions of the trial transcript from the underlying criminal trial and motion to suppress. The respondent also submitted into evidence the 2010 habeas trial transcript and memorandum of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Attorney Butler testified to his representation of the petitioner at the underlying criminal trial in 2006. He further testified to his experience as a criminal defense attorney for the past twenty-eight years, including as a trial attorney in private practice, a part A public defender, and a public defender in the office's Capital Defense and Trial Services Unit (hereinafter capital unit). Attorney Butler testified to extensive experience in the trial of serious felony offenses, including sexual assault and murder. Prior to representing the petitioner in the underlying trial, Attorney Butler represented approximately forty other clients accused of similar crimes. During the course of his experience as a criminal defense attorney, Attorney Butler became very familiar with the use of DNA evidence in criminal prosecutions, including its collection, preservation and analysis. In addition to formal training, Attorney Butler, using the resources of the capital unit, availed himself of the increased access to experts and emerging technologies in the area of DNA forensics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Regarding his representation of the petitioner, Attorney Butler testified credibly that he familiarized himself with the entirety of the state's case against the petitioner, including the potential introduction of DNA evidence implicating his client. He testified to meeting several times with the petitioner during the course of the prosecution, reviewing the allegations and the anticipated evidence to be introduced against him at trial, including DNA evidence. The court finds, based on his testimony, that Attorney Butler took great pains to make the petitioner aware of the strength of the state's\n   evidence against\n   him, especially as it related to any potential defense strategies. The court finds that, despite compelling evidence identifying the petitioner as a contributor to DNA contained within a sample of biological material collected in relation to the sexual assault, the petitioner insisted on a defense strategy of mistaken identity, i.e., that the victim misidentified the petitioner as the perpetrator of the sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court further credits Attorney Butler's testimony of his extensive preparation for the trial of the underlying criminal matter, including the filing and litigation of a motion to suppress the results of a DNA sample taken from the petitioner based on a lack of probable cause to seize the buccal sample, the pretrial investigation and interview of the state's expert witness, and the exploration of third party culpability as a potential defense. As testified to at the habeas trial, a third party culpability defense directed to the petitioner's cousin would have been unavailing, as the cousin was excluded as a contributor of DNA to the sample of biological material connected to the sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Attorney Butler testified to his strategic reasoning in not seeking an independent evaluation of the DNA analysis performed by the employees at the State Police Forensic Science Laboratory. Based on his training and specific experience and familiarity with the state's potential trial witnesses, a decision was made to interview and cross-examine these witnesses at trial, rather than to create additional evidence potentially damaging to the defense by hiring an outside consultant. There is no evidence to support a contention that an outside DNA evaluation would have successfully challenged the conclusions of the state's expert witnesses. The trial record makes clear that the petitioner, through Attorney Butler, did indeed mount a defense, though unsuccessful, to contest the inculpatory effect of the state's DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The petitioner testified that the sole basis of the current petition is his belief that Attorney Visone's representation was ineffective in that he failed to establish the several claimed deficiencies in Attorney Butler's representation only as it relates to issues surrounding DNA evidence at the criminal trial. Contrary to the assertions in the petition, the petitioner testified on redirect examination that, after meeting with Attorney Visone, he was in agreement with the claims presented in the amended petition filed by counsel in the prior habeas matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The petitioner's testimony at the habeas trial was loose, equivocal, contradictory and unconvincing. He testified alternatively that he never discussed the state's potential DNA evidence with Attorney Butler, but that he was made aware \"through [his] attorneys\" that the state intended to offer DNA evidence against him at trial. He further testified that he \"only saw [his attorney] once\" prior to trial, that Attorney Butler \"never came to see [him] in jail,\" and that he met with Attorney Butler three to four times. It is clear from the petitioner's testimony that Attorney Butler did indeed discuss with him at prison visits the nature and elements of the offenses against him, the anticipated evidence to be presented, including DNA, potential defenses to the charges, the motion to suppress, and whether the petitioner would decide to take the case to trial.
