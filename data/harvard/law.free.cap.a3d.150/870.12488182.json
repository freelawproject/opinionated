Bar Counsel charged Mahone with violating the Maryland Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MLRPC\"), Maryland Rules governing attorney trust accounts, and a statutory provision regarding misuse of trust\n   money.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Bar Counsel alleged that Mahone violated the following provisions: (1) MLRPC 1.1 (Competence);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) MLRPC 1.4 (Communication);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d) (Safekeeping Property);\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) MLRPC 8.1(b) (Bar\n   Admission\n   and Disciplinary Matters);\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct);\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Maryland Rule 16.606.1 (Attorney Trust Account Record-Keeping);\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5)\n   Maryland Rule 16-607\n   (Commingling of Funds);\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6) Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited\n   Transactions);\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (7) Maryland\n   Code (1957, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\"BP\") (Misuse of Trust Money).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We transmitted the matter to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and designated the Honorable Cynthia Callahan (\"the hearing judge\") to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Following a one-day hearing, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which she found by clear and convincing evidence that Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1, MLRPC 8.1(b), MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d); Maryland Rules 16.606.1, 16-607, 16-609; and BP \u00a7 10-306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THE HEARING JUDGE'S FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mahone was admitted to the Maryland Bar in May 1980. The AGC's investigation of Mahone was triggered when Sandy Spring Bank notified the AGC that an overdraft of his attorney trust account had occurred. The hearing judge made the following findings of fact by clear and convincing evidence:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2014, an overdraft in the amount of $86.48 occurred in Mahone's attorney trust account. On March 10, 2014, Bar Counsel sent Mahone a letter requesting an explanation of the overdraft and client ledgers, monthly bank statements, deposit slips, and canceled checks from November 2013 to March 2014. The letter requested a response within 10 days. Mahone responded on March 31, 2014, but did not provide the requested client ledgers or deposit slips. His response was also 10 days late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bar Counsel sent Mahone follow-up letters requesting the client ledgers and deposit slips on April 10, 2014, November 18, 2014, and December 10, 2014. Despite these repeated requests, Mahone never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Due to Mahone's failure to provide the requested information, Bar Counsel subpoenaed Sandy Spring Bank for Mahone's attorney trust account records for November 2013 to December 2014. A forensic investigator for the AGC, Charles E. Miller, IV, analyzed Mahone's attorney trust account records. Miller created a transaction summary and client ledger summary from these records, which indicated: (1) negative balances in nine client trust accounts; (2) earned attorney's fees deposited into nine client trust accounts; (3) remaining\n   balances in five client trust accounts; (4) 11 electronic transfers, including several checks Mahone made out to himself; and (5) a $1,500 cash withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 9, 2015, Bar Counsel provided Mahone with Miller's summaries and requested additional information related to the transactions in the summaries by April 24, 2015. Although Mahone was granted a 14-day extension, Bar Counsel did not receive a response. Bar Counsel then requested a response by May 18, 2015. Mahone responded by letter on May 20, 2015, stating that he would provide the requested information by June 1, 2015. Mahone finally responded to Bar Counsel's request on August 16, 2015, but failed to provide a satisfactory explanation or any of the requested supporting documentation. Mahone later sent Bar Counsel a supplemental response, but none of the information he provided addressed Bar Counsel's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Bar Counsel deposed Mahone. During his deposition, Mahone admitted that he failed to create and maintain proper records, failed to create records associated with electronic transactions, and commingled funds. Mahone also answered questions related to four transactions in Miller's summaries. Miller updated his summaries to reflect this new information, and the summaries were received into evidence. The summaries demonstrated the following by clear and convincing evidence:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Mahone caused negative balances in the following client matters:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Mahone deposited earned attorney's fees into his attorney trust account in the following matters:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Mahone improperly maintained funds in his attorney trust account belonging to clients, third parties, and sometimes himself in the following matters:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Mahone failed to maintain records associated with the following electronic funds transfers from his attorney trust account:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   5. Mahone failed to maintain any records associated with the following transactions and cannot identify whose money was withdrawn from the attorney trust account:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   6. On September 9, 2014, Mahone made a $100 personal donation to his church from his attorney trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    THE HEARING JUDGE'S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). The hearing judge also found that Mahone violated Maryland Rules 16-606.1, 16-607, and 16-609, and BP \u00a7 10-306.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.1: Competence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MLRPC 1.1 requires attorneys to represent their clients with the necessary legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1 when \"he failed to competently handle client and third party funds deposited into his trust account.\" In addition, the hearing judge found that Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1 when \"he failed to create and maintain records of the deposits and withdrawals of client and third party funds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 8.1: Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   MLRPC 8.1 imposes an obligation on Maryland attorneys to fully cooperate with disciplinary investigations. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated MLRPC 8.1(b) by failing to timely and completely respond to Bar Counsel's letters requesting additional information on March 10, 2014, April 10, 2014, and November 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 8.4: Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   MLRPC 8.4 defines professional misconduct for attorneys. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d). He violated MLRPC 8.4(a) by breaching other rules of professional conduct. Mahone violated 8.4(c) \"when he created negative balances in his trust account for individual client matters and when he over-drafted his account.\" Lastly, the hearing judge concluded that Mahone's conduct, taken as a whole, harms the reputation of the legal profession in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 16-606.1: Attorney Trust Account Record-Keeping\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Maryland Rule 16-606.1 requires attorneys to create and maintain records reflecting the status and activity of attorney trust accounts. The hearing judge found that although Mahone did not act with \"malice or for personal gain,\" he violated this Rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Mahone] did not create and maintain records for the receipt [or] disbursement of funds [for] clients or [ ] third persons. He was unable to identify which client matters\n   were associated with numerous transactions. [Mahone] admits that he failed to perform monthly reconciliations of his trust account. He was unable to reconcile many of the individual client ledgers or account for the balance of the funds maintained in his account at any given time. [Mahone] failed to create or maintain any records associated with the electronic transfers from his account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 16-607: Commingling of Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Maryland Rule 16-607 prohibits attorneys from depositing personal funds into an attorney trust account. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated Rule 16-607 by \"routinely [leaving] his own funds in his trust account as a 'buffer' \" and depositing earned attorney's fees into the trust account. Additionally, the hearing judge found that none of the exceptions in Rule 16-607 b-which provides situations in which an attorney may commingle personal funds with the clients'-applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 16-609: Prohibited Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under Maryland Rule 16-609, attorneys are prohibited from using funds within a trust account for any unauthorized purpose, withdrawing cash from a trust account, and creating a negative balance within a trust account. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated Rule 16-609 by using trust funds for unauthorized purposes, withdrawing $1,500 in cash from his trust account, and creating negative balances in accounts belonging to Juarez, Leppo, Mahmood, Rice, and \"Unknown.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    BP \u00a7 10-306: Misuse of Trust Money\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   BP \u00a7 10-306 prohibits attorneys from using trust money for any unauthorized purpose. The hearing judge found that Mahone violated BP \u00a7 10-306 for the same reasons he violated MLRPC 8.4(c) and Rule 16-609.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Att'y\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grievance\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comm'n v.

By contrast, this Court reviews the hearing judge's conclusions of law without deference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739468\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/351/#p368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Exceptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both parties are permitted to file \"(1) exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge [and] (2) recommendations concerning the appropriate disposition ....\" Md. Rule 16-758(b). If neither party files any exceptions, \"the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\" Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). Mahone takes exception to multiple conclusions in the hearing judge's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bar Counsel has filed no exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, Mahone excepts to the hearing judge's finding that he \"failed to respond\" to Bar Counsel's letters sent on April 10, 2014, November 18, 2014, and December 10, 2014. Mahone argues that because he did not willfully fail to respond to these inquires, the hearing judge's finding is incorrect. He asserts that he did not receive these letters because he had changed office locations. Similarly, Mahone excepts to the hearing judge's finding that he \"failed to provide information, documentation, or explanation sufficient to account for the negative account balances, earned fee deposits, remaining balances,\n   electronic transfers, unidentified transfers, and cash withdrawals for any of the accounts in question.\" Mahone contends that he provided \"information covering the substance of the requests.\" Therefore, he argues, this finding is inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mahone also takes exception to the hearing judge's findings that he created negative account balances, deposited earned attorney's fees into his attorney trust account, improperly maintained client and third party funds in his trust account, and failed to maintain records identifying whose money was withdrawn from the trust account. Mahone argues that these findings are erroneous, in part or in full, and unsupported by the record evidence. Specifically, he asserts that Bar Counsel has not presented evidence definitively establishing negative account balances and the commingling of funds within the trust account. Furthermore, Mahone argues that Bar Counsel did not prove that he failed to maintain proper bank records. He contends that the fact that he did not provide sufficient records to Bar Counsel does not mean that he did not maintain them. Mahone also excepts to any conclusions of law based on these factual findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lastly, Mahone takes exception to the hearing judge's conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(c). He argues that Bar Counsel has not presented any evidence that he acted with dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Rather, Mahone contends, this case only involves negligence. He points out that the hearing judge did not find that he acted with any intent to deceive or that he made any misrepresentations. Moreover, Bar Counsel presented no evidence that any client was deprived of any funds. Mahone asserts that his commingling of client and personal funds was due to his failure to move earned fees into his own account, and not any fraud or dishonesty on his part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We overrule Mahone's exceptions to the hearing judge's findings of fact. Bar Counsel submitted sufficient evidence that Mahone failed to respond to letters requesting information related to the disciplinary investigation. Although Mahone's failure to respond may not have been willful, the hearing judge only found that he did not respond-she made no factual determination as to willfulness. In the Conclusions of Law, on the other hand, the hearing judge found a violation of MLRPC 8.1(b) based in part on Mahone's failure to respond to Bar Counsel's November 18, 2014 letter. We agree that Bar Counsel did not present sufficient evidence that Mahone\n   <strong>\n    knowingly\n   </strong>\n   failed to respond to the November 18, 2014 letter, as required by the 8.1(b). But the hearing judge's conclusion that Mahone violated MLRPC 8.1(b) was also based on letters Bar Counsel sent on March 10, 2014 and April 10, 2014. Mahone provided an incomplete response to Bar Counsel's March 10, 2014 letter and completely failed to respond to the April 10, 2014 letter. Bar Counsel's November 18, 2014 letter reminded Mahone that he had not responded to the April letter and once again requested additional information. \"Bar Counsel's persistence will not absolve an attorney of the responsibility to make a reasonably prompt reply.\"\n   <em>\n    Att'y\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grievance Comm'n v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740414\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p719\">\n    405 Md. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740414\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p719\">\n    955 A.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Therefore, we overrule Mahone's exception on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We also overrule Mahone's exception to the hearing judge's finding that he failed to maintain records reflecting the activity of his attorney trust account. At oral argument and through his supplemental briefings, Mahone admitted that he failed to maintain the required records concerning these accounts. As to Bar Counsel's requests for additional documentation, Mahone explained that \"he could not produce what he admittedly failed to maintain.\" There is also sufficient evidence that Mahone created negative account balances, deposited earned attorney's fees into his attorney trust account, and commingled attorney, client, and third party funds. Therefore, we overrule Mahone's exceptions to these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Lastly, we sustain Mahone's exception to the hearing judge's conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(c). As discussed below, we find that Bar Counsel has not presented clear and convincing evidence that Mahone intended to deceive a client or third party. Additionally, we find that he has not made any false statement or misrepresentation in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We agree with the hearing judge's conclusion that Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1, MLRPC 8.1(b), MLRPC 8.4(a) and (d); Maryland Rules 16.606.1, 16-607, 16-609; and BP \u00a7 10-306. We do not find, however, that Mahone violated MLRPC 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mahone violated MLRPC 1.1 and Rule 16-606.1 when he failed to maintain records for his attorney trust account. He violated Rule 16-607 when he commingled his personal funds with client funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   When Mahone used trust account funds for an unauthorized purpose, withdrew cash from the account, and created negative balances within multiple client accounts, Mahone violated Rule 16-609 and BP \u00a7 10-306. Additionally, Mahone's failure to respond to Bar Counsel's requests for information completely and in a timely manner constitute a violation of MLRPC 8.1(b). Taken together, these violations result in a breach of MLRPC 8.4(a). Lastly, Mahone's overall mismanagement of client funds constitutes conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although Mahone's conduct clearly violated the provisions described above, he did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c), which prohibits attorneys from engaging in \"conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" Fraud is statutorily defined as \"conduct that is fraudulent under the substantive or procedural law of [Maryland] and\n   <strong>\n    has a purpose to deceive\n   </strong>\n   .\" MLRPC 1.0(e) (emphasis added). \"This does not include merely negligent misrepresentation or negligent failure to apprise another of relevant information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740414\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. 5. The MLRPC do not define dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, we use the ordinary meanings of these words.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Educ. v.

In doing so, \"it is helpful to consult their dictionary definitions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713127\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/428/1/#p28\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Black's\n   </em>\n   \") defines \"deceit\" as \"[t]he act of intentionally leading someone to believe something that is not true\" or \"an act designed to deceive or trick.\"\n   <em>\n    Deceit\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Applying these definitions to this case, we conclude that Mahone did not engage in conduct involving fraud or deceit. There is no evidence that Mahone acted with a purpose to deceive in failing to maintain his trust account records or in failing to timely and completely respond to Bar Counsel. Furthermore, Bar Counsel has not presented any evidence suggesting that Mahone intentionally led Bar Counsel or any third party to believe something that was not true. In fact, the hearing judge found that Mahone acted \"without malice or personal gain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the other two terms,\n   <em>\n    Black's\n   </em>\n   defines \"dishonesty\" as \"behavior that deceives or cheats people\" or \"untruthfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Dishonesty\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary.

Instead, we imposed the sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to re-apply after 30 days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682906,3719763\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/69/1040/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As mitigating factors, we considered that Bell did not have the intent to defraud his clients, had attended a training on proper record-keeping, and had corrected his trust account overdrafts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 562,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682906,3719763\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/69/1040/\">\n    69 A.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   illustrates that lack of intent to defraud and corrective action can mitigate trust account mismanagement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    DiCicco\n   </em>\n   , we imposed an indefinite suspension with a right to re-apply after 90 days on an attorney who failed to maintain client funds in a separate trust account, frequently caused his trust account to have a negative balance,\n   and used his trust account as his personal bank account. In rejecting Bar Counsel's recommendation for disbarment, we \"consider[ed] the absence of fraudulent intent and the lack of evidence that any client suffered financial loss resulting from Respondent's misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    DiCicco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191185\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/369/662/#p684\">\n    369 Md. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191185\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/369/662/#p684\">\n    802 A.2d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, it is appropriate for us to consider Mahone's intent, whether his clients suffered financial loss, and any corrective action he has taken in determining his sanction. Here, there is no evidence that any of Mahone's clients suffered financial loss or that Mahone intended to defraud them, and he has hired an accountant to help him manage his financial affairs-all mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Arguing in favor of disbarment, Bar Counsel emphasizes that Mahone has violated the MLRPC on three previous occasions. Although this history does constitute an aggravating factor, we do not agree that these prior violations were severe enough to warrant Mahone's disbarment in this case. In 1997, Mahone was sanctioned with an indefinite suspension for MLRPC violations related to withholding taxes. In 2007, Mahone was reprimanded for failing\n   to respond to Bar Counsel's lawful requests for information. In 2012, Mahone was reprimanded for failing to safe-keep third party funds. Mahone's last indefinite suspension was almost 20 years ago. Additionally, his last two reprimands were both entered by consent order, which shows he cooperated with Bar Counsel and took responsibility for his conduct in these matters. We find that these prior violations are outweighed by the lack of any intent to deceive or dishonesty in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   That said, Mahone's prior sanction and reprimands are still factors we must consider when fashioning a sanction. Mahone requests that we impose indefinite suspension with the right to re-apply after a term this Court deems appropriate. But given his disciplinary history-three different disciplinary actions, two of which involved the mishandling of money-we find that a more severe sanction is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Att'y\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grievance Comm'n v.

This Court's action in indefinitely suspending Mahone represents the fourth occasion on which he has been sanctioned for misconduct. Although Mahone's indefinite suspension occurred in 1997, and may arguably be considered remote, the repetitive nature of Mahone's misconduct clearly raises the issue of the need to protect the public and deter Mahone and other lawyers from similar misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In discussing Mahone's prior disciplinary record, the Majority theorizes that, at least with regard to his two reprimands, Mahone took responsibility for his actions and cooperated with Bar Counsel by entering a joint petition for reprimand in each case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 48-49,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20A.3d%20881\">\n    150 A.3d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is one interpretation. Another explanation for the joint petitions and agreed-upon reprimands is that Mahone, recognizing that he had been the subject of an indefinite suspension in 1997, simply sought to make the best arrangement possible to\n   minimize the sanction imposed in his last two attorney grievance cases. Certainly, that he engaged in further misconduct after his 2007 reprimand, and was again reprimanded in 2012, undermines any conclusion that Mahone has benefited from his earlier indefinite suspension. Overall, the continuum of attorney grievance cases demonstrates that Mahone was not deterred by his prior encounters with Bar Counsel. And, the frequency of his misconduct indicates that he would pose a threat to future clients. Given his track record, and the nature of the misconduct in this case-namely, his mismanagement of his attorney trust account and his failure to comply with Bar Counsel's investigation, which is essentially the same misconduct that Mahone has previously engaged in-disbarment is the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Judge McDonald has authorized me to state that he joins in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Effective July 1, 2016, the Maryland Rules were revised. The MLRPC were renamed the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MARPC\") and renumbered. Rules Order (June 6, 2016). The revised rules are now numbered as follows: MARPC 19-301.1 (Competence); MARPC 19-301.4 (Communication); MARPC 19-301.15 (Safekeeping Property); MARPC 19-308.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and MARPC 19-308.4 (Misconduct). The Maryland Rules regarding attorney trust accounts were also renumbered. The revised rules are now numbered as follows: Rule 19-407 (Attorney Trust Account Record-Keeping); Rule 19-408 (Commingling of Funds); and Rule 19-410 (Prohibited Transactions). We will refer to the MLRPC and the previous numbering of the Maryland Rules regarding attorney trust accounts because the misconduct at issue occurred before these changes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     Rule 1.1.
