R.C. 2929.15(B). However, the Legislature has chosen not to include the same R.C. 2929.15(B) options in the juvenile justice system. Chapter 2952. pertaining to juveniles does not contain options for juvenile offenders similar to those provided for adult offenders under R.C. 2929.15(B) when a juvenile violates conditions of community control.

By Judgment Entry filed August 30, 2016, the Juvenile Court sentenced J.A. to 90-days in the MJAC, with credit for 87 days served.

R.C. 2152.02(E) (3). The juvenile court can commit the juvenile to the MJAC for the violation. R.C. 2152.19(A) (3). However, the question in the case at bar is, whether time spent in confinement at MJAC that was ordered in\n   the disposition for the violation of the prior court order in case number 2016 JCR 01450 is to be credited toward the minimum DYS commitment in the case upon which the court order that has been violated was issued, case number 2013 JCR 02758.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In\n   <em>\n    In re: [S.D.]\n   </em>\n   this Court observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   In her fourth assignment of error, appellant urges the court should have credited her with time served at the Attention Center and Multi County Residential Treatment Center towards the balance of her commitment. R.C. 2151.355 requires the court to state in its order of commitment the total number of days that the child has been held in detention in connection with the complaint upon which the order of commitment is based. The State argues appellant did receive 51 days credit for the time she spent in detention between October 5, when she entered a plea of true to the arson charge, until November 19, 1999, when she was released. Appellant, however, asked for time served between May 13, 2000 and February 15, 2001.\n   <em>\n    The State's response is that appellant had pled true to a charge of violation of a prior court order in April of 2000, and it was a result of this charge that she received the disposition placing her back into detention. We find the State's argument is flawed. Appellant's plea of true to the charge of violation of a prior court order stemmed from the conditions of probation placed upon her for the original arson charge. The new charge of violation of a prior court order is a condition of probation, not a separate criminal offense bringing with it a separate sentence\n   </em>\n   . Had the State brought a complaint for contempt of court for violation of the prior court order, that may be considered a new charge, but upon this record, it appears the only criminal charge against appellant was the original charge of arson. We find the trial court erred in not giving appellant credit for time served after she pled true to the charge of violating a prior order. Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   5th Dist.
