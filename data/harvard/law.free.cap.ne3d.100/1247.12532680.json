GALLAGHER, P.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} In this consolidated appeal, defendant-appellant James Davner appeals from (1) the judgment of conviction (Appeal No. 104745) and (2) the trial court's denial of his postsentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas (Appeal No. 105144), after he pled guilty to one count of felonious assault, one count of abduction and one count of gross sexual imposition. Davner contends that his guilty pleas were induced by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel and were not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made. He also contends\n   that his aggregate six-year, ten-month sentence was not clearly and convincingly supported by the record. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment, vacate Davner's guilty pleas and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 18, 2015, K.H. filed a complaint in the Lyndhurst Municipal Court alleging that Davner had sexually assaulted her. K.H. alleged that she and her boyfriend had been drinking with Davner the evening of November 21, 2015, and that while she was in the bathroom, intoxicated and vomiting, Davner raped her. Davner originally told police that he had never had any sexual contact with K.H. After DNA test results came back indicating that his semen was found on K.H., Davner admitted having to sex with K.H. but claimed that it was consensual. With the exception of an OVI and several minor traffic offenses, Davner had no prior criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Davner retained attorney Daniel Margolis (\"Margolis\") to represent him. Davner testified that when he first learned of the sexual assault allegations against him, he researched criminal defense attorneys on the internet. He gave his wife, Laurel, attorney Margolis' name and number and asked her to call him \"if anything were to happen.\" Davner testified that he selected Margolis because \"[h]e had very good reviews on his website.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Davner was arrested at his home on December 18, 2015. After Davner was arrested, Laurel contacted Margolis. She paid him $1,000 to represent Davner in the municipal court proceedings and to get a bond set. Laurel testified that she gave Margolis the telephone numbers for K.H.'s boyfriend and the boyfriend's mother and showed him several social media postings K.H. and K.H.'s boyfriend had made that Laurel contended contradicted with what they alleged had occurred. Laurel testified that Margolis told her that he would hire an investigator. Davner was thereafter released on bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 4, 2016, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Davner on two counts of rape, one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification and two counts of gross sexual imposition arising out of Davner's alleged sexual assault of K.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 11, 2016, Davner met with Margolis at his office and signed a fee agreement, agreeing to pay Margolis an additional $20,000 to represent him on the \"pretrial portions of the criminal charge.\" Under the terms of the fee agreement, Margolis would receive an additional $1,000 per day if the case went to trial. Davner paid Margolis $2,000 and Davner's parents paid the $18,000 balance. Davner testified that Margolis told him he would hire an investigator and asked Davner to email him a statement detailing what had occurred on the night of the alleged assault. Davner prepared a statement and emailed it to Margolis a few days later. On January 20, 2016, Davner was arraigned, his bond was continued, and he was placed on court-supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Davner claimed that the meeting he had with Margolis in January 2016 was the only time he \"really met with\" Margolis to discuss his case. He stated that his only other interactions with Margolis were a couple of email messages forwarding discovery materials, brief text messages and telephone calls and a couple minutes conversing with Margolis before and after pretrial conferences. Davner testified that he called Margolis \"maybe once a week\" to get an update regarding \"what's going on,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"what he's doing with the case\" but that he rarely got a call back. He testified that when he did so, it would be \"very brief,\" i.e., that Margolis would simply say, \"[n]othing is going on,\" \"waiting for discovery\" or \"I'll see you at the next pretrial.\" Davner testified that he repeatedly told Margolis that he was innocent and that he wanted to go to trial and did not want to plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 20, 2016, Margolis submitted a written demand for discovery pursuant to Crim.R. 16 to the state. On January 25, 2016, the state provided initial responses to Davner's discovery request and filed its own written demand for discovery. The state filed supplemental discovery responses on April 14, 2016 and May 13, 2016. From January 28, 2016 to May 18, 2016, the trial court conducted eight pretrial conferences. Trial was originally set for April 25, 2016 but was continued to May 24, 2016 \"to complete discovery.\" Margolis never responded to the state's discovery request, never filed any motions, never interviewed any witnesses and never hired an investigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Davner appeared for each of the eight pretrials held in the case. He testified that, at each of the pretrial conferences, Margolis would greet Davner, let him know he was there, then go into the back for an hour or two while Davner waited in the waiting room. When he returned, Margolis would generally say something to the effect of \"this was routine\" or \"still waiting for discovery\" or if something had been received in discovery, what it was. He stated that Margolis forwarded him certain discovery materials, including the police report, a recording of the 911 call and the victim's medical records, but that Margolis never reviewed them with Davner. Davner testified that when he would ask Margolis how the discovery materials impacted his case, he \"never really got a direct answer on anything.\" He testified that Margolis would simply respond, \"it's a coin flip\" or \"it's up in the air.\" When Davner asked Margolis if he could come talk to him about the case, Margolis responded that there was nothing to discuss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Margolis disputed Davner's characterization of their interactions. He denied that he told the Davners he would hire an investigator and stated that there were no witnesses who would have been helpful to Davner to interview. He testified that, whenever he received any discovery materials from the state, he provided copies to Davner, if permitted, or read them to him and \"explain[ed] what was going on.\" He testified that he had \"face-to-face\" meetings with Davner at each of the pretrial conferences, emailed Davner multiple times and regularly communicated with Davner by phone and text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that there were multiple pretrial conference and continuances due to difficulties in getting medical records from the state and that he did not respond to the state's discovery request for \"tactical reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Margolis denied that Davner demanded that the case go to trial. He testified that Davner's \"frequent demand\" was for the case to be dismissed, but that \"abated somewhat as the case dragged on.\" He stated that \"[w]e didn't go to trial because [Davner] didn't want to go to trial.\" Margolis testified that if the case were to have been tried, Davner would have had\n   to pay him another $7,000 under the fee agreement and that \"never even came up * * * because of the overwhelming weight of the evidence against Mr. Davner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In May 2016, Davner took a polygraph test in the hopes of convincing the prosecutor to drop the charges against him. On May 11, 2016, Margolis said he would forward the results to the prosecutor. At the May 18, 2016 pretrial-the last pretrial scheduled before the May 24, 2016 trial date-the prosecutor did not appear. The following day, Davner texted Margolis and asked whether he had heard from the prosecutor. Margolis responded that he had not and would let Davner know when he heard from him. In the week following the May 18, 2016 pretrial conference, the state issued ten trial subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Margolis did not meet with Davner in preparation for trial. He did not file any motions in limine, submit a witness or exhibit list or otherwise prepare to try the case on May 24. On the afternoon of May 23, Davner texted Margolis and asked him whether he should still appear in court the following morning since Margolis had not heard back from the prosecutor. He also inquired about the ten subpoenas that were listed on the docket. Margolis stated that he was \"[s]till waiting on the prosecutor\" and told Davner to listen to the 911 tape again. Margolis stated that \"t]he jury will hear this. It will probably be the first thing they hear\" and indicated that it was \"problematic.\" The two men exchanged several telephone calls that evening. With respect to whether the trial was going forward, Davner testified that Margolis told him, \"Just be there and we'll see what goes on with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Davner testified that when he appeared for trial the following morning, he expected that nothing would happen and that everything would be pushed back, as it had in the past, because the prosecutor had not appeared at the last pretrial conference. Davner testified that had he been aware that the case was going to trial, he would have worn a suit and would have brought his family members with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state made no plea offers until the morning of trial. Nevertheless, Margolis testified that he did not prepare for trial because he believed Davner would enter a plea: \"There was not going to be a trial so I didn't do anything to prepare.\" He could not recall when he first talked to Davner about a possible plea but claimed that it was \"certainly * * * before April 25.\" He testified that he also spoke with Davner about a possible plea on May 17, 2016, advising him that \"the evidence was very strong against him\" and that \"he was looking at a high risk/high reward kind of situation\" if the case went to trial. Margolis stated that he and the prosecutor \"had been talking about a plea bargain for some time, and Mr. Davner knew that and approved of that.\" He testified that if there had been no plea agreement, he planned to request a reasonable continuance to adequately prepare for trial. There is nothing in the record that indicates that he communicated this plan to Davner. Davner denied having previously discussed any possible pleas with Margolis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Although trial was scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. on May 24, 2016, Margolis did not arrive at the courthouse until 9:44 a.m. He testified that \"[i]t's not uncommon and it's regrettable, but it did happen.\" After he spoke with the prosecutor, Margolis handed Davner an index card on which he had jotted down two plea offers he received from the state. The index card listed the offense levels, tier levels and the titles of the offenses that were \"on the table.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Margolis testified that he\n   \"presented [Davner] with his options,\" explained the charges, the \"import and pros and cons of each of those options,\" \"the difference between Tier I and Tier III\" and the \"possible sentences that were applicable to each option\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then left him alone to decide what to do. He further testified that he told Davner that \"given the weight of the evidence I thought * * * he should strongly consider a plea\" but that, \"at the end of the day,\" it was Davner's decision and \"I do what my client requests in terms of making that decision.\" Davner testified that he received the plea offers at \"about 11:00 a.m.\" and was given approximately 20 or 30 minutes to decide what to do. Margolis testified that he came back to Davner with the two plea offers by 9:50 or 9:55 a.m. and that Davner had \"much more\" than 30 minutes, i.e., perhaps an hour-and-a-half or more, to make a decision. Margolis did not ask for a continuance to allow Davner additional time to consider the plea offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Davner denied that Margolis explained the offenses to which he would be pleading guilty. Davner testified that Margolis told him that he had to decide between the two plea offers because if he went to trial he would lose and would go to prison for a long time, i.e., \"like 8 to 10 years.\" Davner indicated that when Margolis handed him the index card, he explained that if Davner accepted one of the plea offers, he would, \"most likely,\" get probation or, under the \"worst-case scenario,\" would get a two- or three-year sentence and be out on judicial release in six months. Davner testified that it was his understanding that he would receive the same sentence under either plea option. Margolis denied telling Davner that he would \"most likely\" receive probation if he accepted one of the plea offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} After Margolis left Davner alone to consider the plea offers, Davner called his mother, his wife and his employer. He called his employer to find out if he could keep his job if he went to prison for six months. He called his mother, Daniela Davner, and told her he needed to pick from two plea options and asked for her advice as to what he should do. Daniela testified Davner was \"very upset\" and that he could only talk for a few minutes because \"he had to pick right then.\" Daniela suggested he consult with another attorney. Davner testified that when Margolis came back to see what he had decided, he asked if he could get another attorney. Margolis said that \"it would not help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Davner then called his wife, Laurel. He testified that he asked her to conduct a \"Google\" search to determine the meaning of felonious assault, abduction and gross sexual imposition and the difference between a Tier I and Tier III sex offender. Laurel testified that she received a \"frantic call\" from Davner, asking her to \"Google\" two potential plea offers he had just received because he did not understand what the offenses were, what it meant to register as a sex offender or what impact accepting one of the plea offers would have on his job or degree. She indicated that Davner was \"very stressed,\" \"confused\" and \"frustrated with his attorney.\" Before she could conduct the research he requested, Davner told her that he had to get off the phone. Laurel was not able to give him any advice as to what she thought he should do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At 10:22 a.m. Margolis texted Davner \"[t]he deals are not changing.\" At 11:13 a.m., Davner replied, \"Just 10 more min and I'll have [an] answer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Davner testified that while he was on the phone with Laurel, Margolis came back and told him \"the prosecutor is ready\" and \"[t]hey want an answer.\" Davner stated that he asked Margolis how much time he could have to decide and that he replied that Davner needed to \"make a decision now.\" Davner told Margolis which of the plea options he had selected and communicated his selection to the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Under the terms of the plea agreement, Davner would plead guilty to an amended count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), an amended count of abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(1) (removing the sexual motivation specification), one count of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1) and the remaining counts would be nolled. It was also agreed that the counts did not merge for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Davner testified that he decided which plea offer to accept based on the length of time he would have to register as a sex offender, i.e., under one plea offer he would have had to register as a sex offender once a year for 15 years, under the other plea offer, he would have had to register every 90 days for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} At 11:28 a.m., Davner texted Margolis and asked if he could \"ask about me going less often to CSR [court-supervised release]?\" Margolis responded, \"Yes.\" Davner testified that he inquired about CSR because he thought that he would be sentenced to probation. At 12:24 p.m. Margolis texted Davner, \"Come into the courtroom.\" Davner turned off his phone and went into the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} After the state and Margolis set forth the terms of the plea agreement on the record, the trial judge proceeded with the plea colloquy. In response to the trial judge's preliminary questions, Davner indicated that he was a citizen, had a driver's license, was 30 years old, had a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, could read and write, was not under the influence of any drugs, alcohol or medication and understood what was happening in court that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The trial judge advised Davner of his constitutional rights and confirmed that he understood the rights he would be waiving by entering his guilty pleas. The trial judge identified each of the offenses to which Davner would be pleading guilty, outlined the penalties he faced on each count, including the maximum prison sentence for each offense, and confirmed that Davner understood the potential penalties associated with each count. With respect to the potential sentences Davner could receive, the trial judge indicated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Now, in advising you of the possible penalties under Count 1 as it's amended, you are looking at a potential prison sentence where there's a presumption in favor of prison of anywhere from two to eight years; do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. In Count 3 as it's amended to a felony of the third degree, you are looking at a potential maximum prison sentence of anywhere from 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, up to 36 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: And Count 4, a felony of the fourth degree, anywhere from 6 to 18 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: And that you are agreeing that for purposes of merger, that none of these counts will merge for purposes\n   of sentencing. So what that means is that you will be sentenced on each count and your maximum potential prison sentence could be 12-and-a-half years, if you received a maximum sentence and it was run consecutive. So your sentence on each of these counts based on an agreement that they do not merge, your maximum consecutive sentence could be 12-and-a-half years in prison; do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. But just for clarification, the Court could also run his sentences concurrent-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: -if he is sentenced to prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: That's correct. But I advised him of the maximum potential sentence that he could face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: So that's why I'm telling him 12-and-a-half years, but there is a minimum sentence which would be two years. Okay. So do you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: * * * [N]one of these charges that you're pleading guilty to as they've been amended are mandatory prison time; just Count 1, as I have already explained is a presumption in favor of prison. So you could also be placed under a community control sentence for up to five years, but if you violate the terms of the sentence, you could receive a more restrictive sentence, including prison time; do you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Davner confirmed that no threats or promises had been made to him to induce him to change his pleas other than what had been stated on the record, he stated that he understood that there was no promise of a particular sentence and he indicated that he was satisfied with the services rendered by his trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial judge found that Davner had been informed of his constitutional rights, that he understood \"the nature of the charges, the effect of a plea and the maximum penalties which may be imposed\" and that his guilty pleas would be made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Davner entered his guilty pleas to one count of felonious assault, one count of abduction and one count of gross sexual imposition pursuant to the plea agreement, and the remaining counts were nolled. The trial judge accepted his guilty pleas and referred the matter for a presentence investigation report. A sentencing hearing was scheduled for the following month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Davner, Margolis, the victim's boyfriend and the state spoke at the June 20, 2016 sentencing hearing. After considering those statements and reviewing the PSI, the letters submitted by Davner's wife and parents and a report from Davner's therapist, the trial court sentenced Davner to six years on the felonious assault count, three years on the abduction count and ten months on the gross sexual imposition count. The sentences on the felonious assault and abduction counts were to run concurrently to one another but consecutive to the sentence imposed on the gross sexual imposition count, resulting in an aggregate prison sentence of six years and ten months. The trial court properly advised Davner of postrelease control, ordered payment of court costs and classified Davner as a Tier I sex offender. On June 23, 2016, the trial court entered its sentencing journal entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On July 19, 2016, Davner filed (1) a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and (2) a direct appeal of the judgment of conviction. On August 1, 2016, this court\n   remanded the matter for consideration of Davner's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, Davner argued that his guilty pleas were invalid because he did not enter them knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily or with the effective assistance of counsel. He claimed that Margolis had pressured him into entering guilty pleas because he was not prepared to try the case and that his guilty pleas were based on misinformation regarding his likely sentence and eligibility for judicial release. The state opposed the motion, arguing that Davner could not demonstrate manifest injustice. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion (the \"evidentiary hearing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Davner, Laurel, Daniela and Margolis testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} On October 11, 2016, after consideration of Davner's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, the state's brief in opposition, the evidence and arguments presented at the evidentiary hearing and the post-hearing briefs, the trial court denied Davner's motion. The trial court did not explain its reasoning in denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Davner appealed the trial court's order denying his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. In this consolidated appeal, he raises the following assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant's sentence is clearly and convincingly not supported by the record and is contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In his first assignment of error, Davner contends that his guilty pleas were induced by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel and were not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made, resulting in manifest injustice. He argues that the trial court should have permitted him to withdraw his guilty pleas because Margolis was \"totally unprepared for trial\" and failed to \"fully and properly advise [Davner] regarding the consequences of his plea.\" Specifically, Davner contends that Margolis misled Davner regarding the sentence he would receive if he pled guilty and gave him inaccurate or incomplete information regarding judicial release. He also contends that Margolis failed to properly explain each plea option and the ramifications of his agreement, as a condition of Davner's pleas, that the counts to which he pled guilty would not merge for purposes of sentencing. Davner asserts that the trial court's denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas was arbitrary and contrary to the facts developed at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 36} A motion to withdraw a guilty plea is governed by Crim.R. 32.1. Crim.R. 32.1 provides: \"A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" Accordingly, a defendant who seeks to withdraw a guilty plea after sentence has been imposed must demonstrate \"manifest injustice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Two of the three offenses to which Davner pled guilty-felonious assault and abduction-were amended counts not part of the original indictment.

There is nothing in the transcript from the plea hearing that indicates that the trial court, Margolis, the state (or anyone else) explained the nature of the charges to Davner before he entered his guilty pleas or specifically informed Davner that his guilty pleas operate as \"a complete admission\" of his guilt.

Margolis advised the court that he had \"gone over\" with Davner \"his constitutional rights that he would be waiving by entering a plea\" and the sex offender registration obligations and also advised the court that he believed that Davner's plea would be \"knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made,\" but he did not mention anything about having explained to Davner what the state would have had to prove to convict him of the offenses to which he would be pleading guilty.

Furthermore, the record reflects that Davner entered his guilty pleas with full knowledge of the potential sentences he could receive. The trial court informed Davner of the potential sentencing range on each of the counts to which he was pleading guilty and further explained that, based on his agreement that the counts would not merge for sentencing, he could receive a potential maximum aggregate sentence of 12 and a half years-if he were to receive a maximum sentence on each offense and the sentences were to be run consecutively. Davner indicated that he understood this. Further, in reviewing the potential sentencing range associated with the felonious assault count, the trial court advised Davner that there was a \"presumption of prison\" as to that count.

Here, there is evidence in the record to support Davner's claim that Margolis failed to provide him with complete, accurate legal advice regarding his eligibility for judicial release before he entered his guilty pleas.

Davner presented credible evidence establishing a reasonable probability that but for counsel's incomplete advisements regarding judicial release he would not have entered his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    Counsel's Lack of Preparation for Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Davner also argues that he was coerced into accepting one of the plea deals offered by the state due to his counsel's failure to prepare for trial. In this case, although no plea offers had yet been extended, Margolis admitted that he was not prepared to try the case on the scheduled trial date and had not asked for a continuance. Where, as here, counsel has admitted that he is not prepared for trial, courts have upheld claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

While Margolis stated that he would have asked for a continuance if Davner had rejected the state's plea offers, such that his lack of preparation would not have prejudiced Davner, there was no guarantee that the trial court would have granted a continuance. The trial court had already continued the trial date once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Following a thorough review of the record, considering the unique facts and totality of the circumstances in this case, including: the limited time frame in which Davner was given to consider the state's plea offers; the incomplete information Davner received from counsel regarding judicial release; Davner's demonstrated\n   lack of a full and complete understanding, prior to the plea hearing, of the offenses to which he would be pleading guilty and the consequences of his guilty pleas; the limited information Davner received regarding the nature of the offenses and the effect of his guilty pleas at the plea hearing; counsel's admission that he was not prepared to try the case if Davner rejected the state's plea offers and Davner's testimony that, but for this confluence of events, he would not have entered his guilty pleas, we conclude that (1) Davner did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter his guilty pleas, (2) withdrawal of his guilty pleas is necessary to correct manifest injustice and (3) the trial court, therefore, abused its discretion in denying Davner's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Davner's first assignment of error is sustained. We reverse the trial court's judgment, vacate his guilty pleas and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Based on our resolution of Davner's first assignment of error, his second assignment of error is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Judgment reversed; case remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   MARY J.

An exhibit listing the texts that were exchanged between Margolis and Davner was introduced into evidence. The exhibit shows that more than 160 texts were exchanged between December 28, 2015 and May 24, 2016, when Davner entered his guilty pleas. However, most of these exchanges were brief and involved logistics or scheduling issues. No call log or phone records were introduced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Although the index card was admitted as an exhibit at the hearing, it was not included in the record forwarded to this court on appeal.

Davner did not raise this issue below. Rather, he argued that the trial court should grant his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas \"to correct manifest injustice.\" An issue not raised in the trial court forfeits all but plain error. Further, a party is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he or she invited or induced.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

As this court has previously held, a trial court's failure to advise a defendant of his or her appellate rights at sentencing renders the sentence voidable, not void.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Gum\n    </em>\n    , 8th Dist.

Where the trial court fails to advise a defendant of his appellate rights at sentencing, the remedy is to have the trial court reenter the judgment of conviction against the defendant, thereby reinstating the time within which the defendant may file a notice of appeal pursuant to App.R. 4(A).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Gum\n    </em>\n    , 8th Dist.

Following his sentencing, Davner retained appellate counsel who timely filed a notice of appeal. The trial court's failure to advise Davner of his appellate rights at sentencing is, therefore, harmless error.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
