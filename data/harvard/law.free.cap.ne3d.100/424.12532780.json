Upon review of the complaint, it is evident that this case was filed more than 90 days prior to the next election and thus should not proceed pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.08. Therefore, it is ordered by the court that this case is converted to a standard original action and shall proceed pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.04. Respondents shall file a response to the complaint within 21 days.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
