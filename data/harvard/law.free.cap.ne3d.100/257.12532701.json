INDIANA SUPREME COURT DISCIPLINARY COMMISSION, Relator,\n  <br/>\n  v.\n  <br/>\n  Lisa M. LARA, Respondent.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  Supreme Court Case No. 18S-MS-112\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Indiana.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Filed June 29, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  Published Order\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-6\">\n  On February 21, 2018, the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission (\"the Commission\") filed a \"Verified Petition to Enjoin the Unauthorized Practice of Law\" pursuant to Indiana Admission and Discipline Rule 24. The Verified Petition alleges that Lisa M. Lara, who is not a licensed attorney, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by offering and providing legal services to Indiana residents in matters of immigration, business, and family law, and preparing \"legal documents such as affidavits, powers of attorney, answers, eviction notices, leases, business registrations, quit claim deeds and automobile sales contracts.\" The Verified Petition asks that Respondent be permanently\n  enjoined from such conduct pursuant to Admission and Discipline Rule 24.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  On March 28, 2018, we ordered Respondent to file a verified return in response to the Commission's Verified Petition on or before April 18, 2018. The Clerk served our order on Respondent the same day, along with a file-marked copy of the Verified Petition, via certified mail to Respondent at her office address, 500 North Nappanee Street, Suite 6B, Elkhart, Indiana 46514. The signed certified-mail receipt shows that Respondent received the Verified Petition and order on April 11, 2018. The Commission also personally served a copy of its Verified Petition and the order on Respondent at her office address on April 16, 2018. Respondent has not filed a return.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  On June 12, 2018, the Commission filed a \"Motion for Ruling on Verified Petition to Enjoin the Unauthorized Practice of Law\" requesting the Court to rule in its favor and permanently enjoin Respondent from the unauthorized practice of law. Because Respondent received actual notice of the proceeding and has chosen not to file a verified return, we accept the Verified Petition's allegations as true.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Accordingly, we find the Respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and GRANT the Commission's Verified Petition. Respondent, Lisa M. Lara, is hereby PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from offering to provide and/or providing legal advice or legal services to others unless and until she obtains a license to practice law in Indiana. This restriction shall not preclude Respondent from seeking employment from, or being employed by, a lawyer or law firm as a non-lawyer assistant, so long as, while doing so, she abides by the terms of this permanent injunction and does not contravene the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct or Guideline 9 for the Use of Non-Lawyer Assistants.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-10\">\n   All Justices concur.\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
