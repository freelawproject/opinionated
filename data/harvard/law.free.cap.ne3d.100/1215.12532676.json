Carter (\"Carter\"), appeals his guilty verdict and sentence, and asks this court to reverse his conviction and remand to the trial court for a new trial. After a review of the record, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Carter was found guilty of one count of rape, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) ; three counts of kidnapping, first-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) ; and two counts of gross sexual imposition, fourth-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). He was sentenced to a total of eight years imprisonment and required to register as a tier three sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} B.C., the daughter of Carter, accused Carter of kidnapping, rape, and forcing her to have unwanted sexual conduct with him. B.C. testified that her father, Carter, began making sexual advances towards her when she was in the seventh grade. B.C. recalled one moment when she and Carter were lying next to each other watching movies. Carter told B.C. that he was cold and requested that she move closer to him. When B.C. moved closer to him, she felt Carter's pelvis poking her. Carter continued to push his pelvis closer to B.C., and his actions made B.C. feel confused and as if she could not get up and walk away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Once Carter moved out of the family home, as a result of divorce from B.C.'s mother, B.C. would see Carter at his sister's house. One occasion when B.C. was visiting Carter at Carter's sister's house, B.C. awoke to Carter hugging her around the waist. Carter also began pushing his pelvis against B.C. and groping her chest. Then Carter used his hand to rub B.C.'s vagina. B.C. testified that Carter rubbed the inside and outside of her vagina with his fingers. B.C. felt as if she could not get up and walk away from Carter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Another incident took place at Carter's sister's new home where B.C. and Carter were sleeping on the floor. B.C. awoke to Carter rubbing her breasts. Carter then told B.C. that he loved her. The next morning Carter told B.C. that they needed to stop having sexual contact, but he continued. B.C. did not feel as if she\n   could get away from Carter while he was touching her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} B.C. also visited Carter at Carter's father's home. During a visit, B.C. woke to Carter holding her around the waist while pushing his pelvis against her. B.C. tried to move away from him, but Carter pulled her closer. Carter began groping B.C.'s breast and then pulled her pants down. Carter got out of the bed, and B.C. heard him open a plastic wrapper. Carter then came back to the bed and laid down behind B.C. B.C. felt Carter touch her vagina both inside and out, but was unsure of what he was touching her with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} B.C. sent her mother, S.C., a text message detailing the events of Carter touching her. S.C. went to the police, and B.C. was first interviewed by Lauren Hennessey (\"Hennessey\"), a social service worker with the Department of Children and Family Services. During her testimony, the state asked her, \"When you met with [the victim], what types of information is it important for you to learn for you to make the referrals that you are tasked with making?\" (Tr. 323.) Hennessey responded by stating, \"So we make referrals typically, you know, when there's credible, consistent disclosures, which hers was. And, you know, she was seeking-the family was seeking medical-not medical, mental health treatment as well because of what had happened.\" (Tr. 323.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} B.C.'s case was referred to Julie Loyke (\"Loyke\"), a certified pediatric nurse practitioner who performs non-acute sexual abuse examinations for the Cleveland Care Clinic. Loyke testified as to her experiences practicing as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (\"SANE\"). Loyke described her conversation with B.C., and the procedures used to interview and examine B.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the end of the trial, Carter was found guilty and sentenced to eight in prison. Carter filed this timely appeal arguing six assignments of error for our review, however, assignment of error three is dispositive of the case, so we need not address the other five.

Hennessey's role was important in determining what type of subsequent treatment was necessary for B.C. We find that Hennessey's role was pertinent to medical treatment or diagnosis, and thus her testimony falls clearly within the exception to the hearsay rule under Evid.R. 803(4).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The state asked Loyke,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [T]hrough that specialized training and through that years of experience in all of those patients, have you learned things about sexual assault, child sexual assault victims in particular that you would not have suspected prior to your experience and training?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Tr. 354.)

In the absence of substantial medical evidence of sexual abuse or corroborating evidence, this case hinged on issues of credibility. While B.C. testified and was subject to cross-examination, Loyke's testimony was significant, it bolstered the credibility of B.C.'s testimony, and was not merely cumulative to other evidence. Moreover, the SANE nurse's testimony that she \"believed\" B.C.'s disclosure is particularly troublesome because it was made in direct reference to the fact that B.C.'s \"head-to-toe\" medical examination results were \"normal\" and did not reveal any physical injuries or clear signs of sexual abuse. Therefore, the admission of Loyke's testimony concerning the credibility of B.C.'s disclosure was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
