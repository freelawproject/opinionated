Acting on information provided by a confidential informant, the Boston police apprehended, searched, and arrested the juvenile, D.M., on firearm-related charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before a pretrial suppression hearing in the Juvenile Court, the juvenile sought an order requiring the Commonwealth to disclose the identity of its informant and other related information. The Commonwealth asserted that it was privileged not to disclose the information, see <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Bonnett</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361846\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/827/#p846\">472 Mass. 827</extracted-citation>, 846-847, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation> (2015), because disclosure would jeopardize the informant's safety. It averred that the informant was not a percipient witness to the juvenile's arrest, and that the juvenile had not met his burden of demonstrating that disclosure was required. After a hearing, the judge allowed the juvenile's motion. The judge determined that the Commonwealth properly had asserted an informant privilege, and that the juvenile adequately had challenged the assertion of the privilege on the ground that it interfered with his right to present a defense. See <em>id</em>. at 846, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation>.

The Commonwealth thereafter filed a G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition in the county court, seeking reversal of the interlocutory ruling and arguing that the judge erred in allowing the juvenile's motion.

The privilege may be raised where \"the Commonwealth otherwise would be required to provide an informant's identity to a defendant as part of its discovery obligations.\" <em>Bonnett</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361846\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/827/#p846\">472 Mass. at 846</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation>.

The determination whether the information may remain confidential occurs in a two-stage process. See <em>Bonnett</em>, <em>supra</em>. At the preliminary stage, the trial judge first evaluates whether the Commonwealth properly invoked the privilege. <em>Id</em>. at 846-847, <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation> (privilege may be asserted \"only where disclosure would endanger the informant or otherwise impede law enforcement efforts\"). According to the judge's findings in this case, when the juvenile was apprehended, he was in the company of another person. Both the juvenile and the other person were identified as being involved with gang activity. The other person had a \"long history of convictions,\" as well as a pending firearm case. The Commonwealth alleged that disclosure of the identity of the informant would endanger that person. On these facts, the judge was warranted in concluding that the Commonwealth properly invoked its privilege. <em>Bonnett</em>, <em>supra</em> at 845, <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-11\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"1006\" href=\"#p1006\" id=\"p1006\">**1006</a>The preliminary stage of the analysis has a second part, however. As to that part, as well as at the second stage, the judge's analysis was flawed: the judge failed to evaluate the juvenile's need for disclosure in the context of a preliminary hearing, as opposed to at the trial itself. See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Amral</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886418\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/511/#p518\">407 Mass. 511</extracted-citation>, 518, <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20N.E.2d%201189\">554 N.E.2d 1189</extracted-citation> (1990). With respect to the second part of the preliminary stage, a defendant is required to request that the Commonwealth's privilege be set aside, because it \"interferes with a fair defence.\" <em>Bonnett</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361846\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/827/#p846\">472 Mass. at 847</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation>, quoting <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"350\" href=\"#p350\" id=\"p350\">*350</a><em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292131\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/365/534/#p544\">365 Mass. 534</extracted-citation>, 544, <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20N.E.2d%20571\">313 N.E.2d 571</extracted-citation> (1974), <em>S</em>.<em>C</em>., <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030224\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/372/185/\">372 Mass. 185</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20N.E.2d%20212\">361 N.E.2d 212</extracted-citation> (1977). We have characterized a defendant's obligation at this juncture as \"relatively undemanding,\" <em>Bonnett</em>, <em>supra</em>, but it does require the defendant to articulate a basis sufficient for the judge to \"assess the materiality and relevancy of the disclosure to the defense, if that relevancy is not apparent from the nature of the case.\" <em>Id</em>., quoting <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Kelsey</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274467\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/315/#p323\">464 Mass. 315</extracted-citation>, 323, <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20N.E.2d%201134\">982 N.E.2d 1134</extracted-citation> (2013). Although the judge concluded that the juvenile had satisfied that standard, he failed to recognize that the standards of disclosure are more demanding where, as here, the disclosure is sought for pretrial purposes. See <em>Hernandez</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861580\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/272/#p274\">421 Mass. at 275</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=656%20N.E.2d%201237\">656 N.E.2d 1237</extracted-citation> ; <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Lugo</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885102\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/565/#p574\">406 Mass. 565</extracted-citation>, 574, <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20N.E.2d%201263\">548 N.E.2d 1263</extracted-citation> (1990).</p><p id=\"p-12\">Likewise, at the second stage of the analysis, it was the judge's obligation to determine whether the \"informant's identity and concomitant information are sufficiently 'relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused' \" to require disclosure (citation omitted). <em>Bonnett</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361846\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/827/#p846\">472 Mass. at 847</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201064\">37 N.E.3d 1064</extracted-citation>.

Because the judge's analysis conflated the two standards, and in light of the two important but distinct public policies at issue, the analytical error should not stand. See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Shaughessy</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665022\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/346/#p355\">455 Mass. 346</extracted-citation>, 355, <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=916%20N.E.2d%20980\">916 N.E.2d 980</extracted-citation> (2009).
