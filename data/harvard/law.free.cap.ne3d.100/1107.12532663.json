For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 7, 2014, the Summit County Grand Jury indicted Carter on the following six counts: (I) aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), a special felony, with firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145 and R.C. 2941.146 ; (II) murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), a special felony, with firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145 and R.C. 2941.146 ; (III) felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a second-degree felony, with firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145 and R.C. 2941.146 ; (IV) felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a second-degree felony, with firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145 and R.C. 2941.146 ; (V) having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), a third-degree felony; and (VI) tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), a third-degree felony. The indictment arose from a \"drive-by\" shooting that killed 18-year-old Donald Carter, Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"the victim\") on the night of June 11, 2014. Carter pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in the indictment and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At trial, 21 witnesses testified on behalf of the State. At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Carter made a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, which the trial court summarily denied. The defense then rested without calling any witnesses. The jury deliberated and ultimately found Carter not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of the five remaining offenses and specifications thereto. The trial court subsequently sentenced Carter according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 11, 2015, Carter filed a motion for delayed appeal, which this Court granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27717 (Mar. 31, 2015). Carter's appellate counsel thereafter filed a brief in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

Carter's appellate counsel also moved to withdraw as counsel of record. This Court then issued a magistrate's order affording Carter an opportunity to raise arguments after review of the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. Carter subsequently filed a motion seeking appointment of new appellate counsel, as well as a motion to dismiss his counsel's\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief, wherein he\n   raised arguments that he wished to pursue on direct appeal. After reviewing the trial record, this Court determined that there was at least one arguable issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Carter\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

First, Tracy W., the mother of the victim's best friend, Dana W., testified that she was hosting a birthday party for her adult nephew on the night in question. Tracy W. testified that while she was in the backyard of a neighboring building preparing to cut the birthday cake, her son, Dana W., daughter, Taresa W., niece, Dominique W., and the victim were all hanging out on the stoop area of her apartment building on the corner of Marcy Street and Cole Avenue. Tracy W. testified that as she was about to cut the cake, she heard several gunshots. She stated that upon hearing the gunshots, she \"looked and [she] seen a red truck go by and [she] seen the shots coming from the truck.\" She then testified that she immediately called 9-1-1 after observing that the victim had been shot. Tracy W. stated that when the police arrived at the scene, she informed them that Nathaniel Carter, Jr. was the shooter. Tracy W. proceeded to identify Carter in court as the person who shot and killed the victim on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Second, Taresa Lynn W. testified that on the night in question, she was sitting in front of her mother's building on Cole Avenue with her brother, Dana W., her cousin, Dominique W., and the victim. Taresa W. also testified that she was aware that Dana W. and Carter had a contentious relationship, including a violent confrontation that occurred just two days prior to the day in question. She further testified that at some point while the four of them were conversing, Sheldon C., one of Carter's \"really good friends,\" drove down the street and looked at them. According to Taresa W.'s trial testimony, Dana W. then stated, \"I bet you any amount of money [Sheldon C. is] about to call [Carter] and tell him I'm out here.\" She testified that approximately 15-20 minutes later, she saw a red truck driving down the street in their direction. Taresa W. testified that she was fearful and began to run around the apartment building, at which time she heard gunshots. She testified that \"[w]hen I turned as I was running around trying to look and see, that's when I see [Carter] ride by shooting.\" Taresa W. subsequently identified Carter in court as the shooter on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Third, Theresa T. testified that she was visiting with family at her daughter's house on Andrus Street on the night\n   in question. Evidence presented at trial demonstrated that the crime scene is located just down the street and is visible from the front of Theresa T.'s daughter's house. Theresa T. testified that at some point that evening, she saw Dana W., who was standing on Cole Avenue near Marcy Street, fall to the ground and begin crawling. Theresa T. also testified that she then saw bullets ricochet on the sidewalk near Dana W.'s foot or ankle. Theresa T. testified that as she was in the process of moving her family members to safety, she saw a red SUV turn off of Cole Avenue onto Andrus Street and drive right past her location. Theresa T. testified that as the red SUV drove by, the driver \"did a mean mug at us,\" which she clarified was a mean and threatening expression. Theresa T. subsequently identified Carter in court as the man driving the red SUV who made the \"mean expression\" at her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Lastly, Cheryl D., Theresa T.'s sister, testified that she was staying at her niece's house on the corner of Andrus Street and Cole Avenue on the night in question. Cheryl D. testified that she did not know Dana W. or the victim. Cheryl D. further testified that she was sitting on the front porch of her niece's house with her sister that evening while \"[t]he kids were outside playing in the front yard.\" She stated that from her vantage point, she could see the corner of Marcy Street and Cole Avenue \"very well.\" She testified that at some point that evening she \"heard gunshots. About six of them went off, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop[.]\" Cheryl D. explained that she recognized the sounds as gunfire and immediately ordered the children to \"[g]et in the house and lay on the floor.\" She testified that when she looked up, she saw a red truck turn right onto Andrus Street and drive past her. Cheryl D. testified that the driver of the red truck \"turned around and looked at me and him and me made direct contact. I turned around and I said, 'That's the shooter,' like that.\" Cheryl D. stated that the driver \"had a real mean look on his face. He looked me straight in my eyes. He was real mean and, you know, had a real mean frown on his face and-and I looked. I said, 'That's the shooter.' \" Cheryl D. explained that she concluded that the man in the red truck was the shooter \" '[c]ause of the expression on his face and at the time that he made the turn [onto Andrus Street] the shots stopped. They stopped. And everything came to a stop, and he was the only thing moving at that time.\" She then identified Carter in court as the driver of the red truck on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the State, we determine that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Carter was the individual who committed the charged offenses on the night in question. This evidence, if believed, demonstrates that while he was driving a red vehicle, Carter committed a \"drive-by\" shooting, which killed the victim on the night of June 11, 2014. Accordingly, we conclude that the State met its burden of production at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Turning to his manifest weight argument, Carter contends that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because Dana W. and members of Dana W.'s family provided biased and unreliable testimony on the State's behalf. However, this Court has routinely held that \"[c]redibility determinations are primarily within the province of the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Just\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

Here, the jury reviewed all of the evidence and assessed the credibility of each witness. The jury apparently accepted the testimony of the State's witnesses which, if believed, supports the conclusion that Carter shot and killed the victim on the night in question. After reviewing the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way and committed a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Carter of the charged offenses, especially considering the fact that two disinterested witnesses, Theresa T. and Cheryl D., buttressed the W. family's testimony that Carter was the individual responsible for the fatal \"drive-by\" shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Carter's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Nathaniel Carter, Jr.'s constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial was violated when the trial date was unreasonably continued outside the statutory timeframe.

First, as discussed above, Carter does not argue that it was unreasonable for the trial court to continue his trial due to the trial court's unavailability. Nonetheless, a review of the record shows the trial court was scheduled to commence multiple trials which would conflict with Carter's September 15, 2014 trial date. Those cases included a four to six week capital case and a homicide case that had been pending longer than the present case. Second, while Carter asserts in his brief that \"[n]o motions were filed, and no motion for discovery was filed tolling the speedy trial time[,]\" such a claim is belied by the pretrial transcripts. Although a review of the record does not show when or if a motion for discovery was ever filed with the clerk of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, a review of the transcript from the July 16, 2014 pretrial conference reflects that Carter's trial counsel represented to the trial court that he had made a motion for discovery. Indeed, the prosecutor subsequently referenced the defense's discovery motion at the August 20, 2014 status conference wherein the speedy trial issue was discussed at length. Nonetheless, the record is devoid of any information as to what date the motion was made or when the State complied with the discovery request. Absent these dates, this Court is unable to fully analyze whether Carter was brought to trial within the timeframe set forth in R.C. 2945.71(C)(2) and R.C. 2945.71(E), as we cannot discern the tolling period applicable in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Therefore, we determine that Carter has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating actual prejudice from his trial counsel's failure to file a motion to dismiss on the basis of a speedy trial violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Carter's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    It was improper to allow the testimony of Lt.

Carter advances several arguments in support of this contention. Specifically, Carter asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective by not objecting to purportedly improper opinion testimony, by failing to impeach a State's witness, by failing to cross-examine some of the State's witnesses on the issue of the shooter's identity, and by failing to present evidence supporting an argument made during his opening statement.

Accordingly, we determine that Carter's second assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Turning to his third assignment of error, Carter contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to cross-examine Dana W. on his prior criminal convictions and his plea deal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the State in exchange for his testimony in the present case. Moreover, Carter argues that his trial counsel was ineffective by not cross-examining Tracy W., Taresa Lynn W., and Dominique W., or otherwise objecting to or seeking a curative instruction in response to their purportedly improper testimony. Specifically, Carter argues that his trial counsel should have objected when Tracy W. and Taresa Lynn W. identified him as the shooter, since neither witness testified to seeing him driving the red truck or firing a gun on the night in question. Moreover, Carter argues that much of the W. family's respective testimony was either hearsay or the product of leading questions from the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Several courts have held that \"decisions regarding cross-examination are within trial counsel's discretion and generally do not form the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While shedding light on Dana W.'s prior criminal history and plea deal with the State may have caused the jury to doubt his credibility, there was testimony from four other witnesses positively identifying Carter as the \"drive-by\" shooter who killed the victim on the night in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

Moreover, assuming without deciding that Tracy W.'s and Taresa Lynn W.'s testimony identifying Carter as the shooter was either improper or the product of improper questioning, we cannot ignore the fact that two disinterested witnesses, Theresa T. and Cheryl D., also identified Carter at trial as the \"drive-by\" shooter. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we conclude\n   that Carter has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Finally, Carter briefly argues that his trial counsel was ineffective by advancing a theory of the case during his opening statement without presenting an expert witness at trial to buttress that theory. Specifically, Carter argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for arguing during his opening statement that Dana W. was the individual responsible for shooting and killing the victim without further developing this theory either on cross-examination of the medical examiner or through direct examination of an expert witness. However, on this point, we note that Carter has only made a very general, undeveloped argument in his brief. As this Court has repeatedly recognized, \"[s]peculation regarding the prejudicial effects of counsel's performance will not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
