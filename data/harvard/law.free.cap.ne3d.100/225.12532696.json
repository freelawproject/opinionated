In recent decades, schools have turned to resource officers for help. These officers protect students and staff, offer mentorship-and, yes, help with discipline and criminal investigations. As their presence has grown, so too have questions of students' constitutional rights. Today we address for the\n   first time one of those questions: when are students entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings at school?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Here, in response to a bomb threat on a bathroom wall, thirteen-year-old B.A. was escorted from his bus and questioned in a vice-principal's office. Officers hovered over B.A. and encouraged him to confess, but no one gave him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that B.A. was in police custody and under police interrogation, so he should have been Mirandized. We therefore reverse his delinquency adjudications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Scribbled in pink marker in a Decatur Middle School boys' bathroom came the threat: \"I will Got A bomb in the school Monday 8th 2016 not A Joke.\" School Resource Officer Tutsie \"immediately went into investigative mode\" and soon narrowed the suspects to two students-including thirteen-year-old B.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next Monday, February 8, 2016, school resource officers and administrators walked through the school and found it safe. Then, when B.A.'s bus arrived, Vice-Principal Remaly and School Resource Officer Lyday removed B.A. from his bus and escorted him to Remaly's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.A. sat in front of Remaly's desk while Officer Lyday stood a few feet away. Early in B.A.'s interview, Officer Tutsie came in and took Officer Lyday's spot while Officer Lyday moved to sit at a conference table behind B.A. Around that same time, a third school resource officer-Officer Wheeler-came in and sat at the conference table. All three officers wore police uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vice-Principal Remaly led the interview, asking if B.A. knew why he was there. B.A. maintained that he did not. To see if B.A.'s handwriting matched the bomb threat, Officer Tutsie handed B.A. written sentences and told B.A. how to copy them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After B.A. copied the sentences, Remaly decided that the handwriting sample matched the threat and asked B.A. why he did it. Then Officer Lyday interrupted to say, \"Come on, man, just-just tell the truth.\" B.A. started crying, lowered his head, and said \"I don't know. I'm sorry.\" Remaly then ended the interview-which had lasted fifteen minutes-and called B.A.'s mother. When she arrived and asked B.A. what happened, he told her, \"I'm sorry mom, it was a joke\" and admitted that it was a dumb thing to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With these admissions, Remaly suspended B.A. from school, pending expulsion. He then turned B.A. over to the school resource officers, who arrested him and took him to the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State alleged that B.A. was delinquent for committing false reporting, a Level 6 felony if committed by an adult, and institutional criminal mischief, a Class A misdemeanor if committed by an adult. B.A. moved to suppress the evidence from his interview, arguing that he was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings since he was under custodial interrogation and that officers failed to secure waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights under Indiana's juvenile waiver statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2031-32-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 31-32-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). After a hearing, the juvenile court denied the motion and found B.A. delinquent on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.A. appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    B.A. v.

App. 2017). It held that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were not required because a school administrator questioned B.A. for an educational purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356866\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/73/720/#p730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We granted transfer, vacating the Court of Appeals opinion.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12357929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/77/173/#p176\">\n    77 N.E.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (Ind. 2017). But the underlying issue-whether B.A. was under custodial interrogation-is purely legal and entitled to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12353058\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/70/331/#p335\">\n    70 N.E.3d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (Ind. 2017). We thus first address whether B.A. was in police custody and then whether he was under police interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties agree that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings protect students at school but disagree whether B.A. was entitled to the warnings. The critical inquiry is whether he was under custodial interrogation. B.A. argues that he was in custody under the totality of the circumstances and that he was interrogated because police officers participated in his interview. The State responds that the officers' presence was noncoercive and that they did not directly question B.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We start by exploring how\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ties into modern schools' efforts to stay safe and crime-free. We then explain the tests for police custody and police interrogation in a school setting and apply them to the undisputed facts here. We conclude that because B.A. was under custodial interrogation yet not Mirandized, his incriminating statements should have been suppressed. The juvenile court therefore abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings protect students under custodial interrogation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The modern school setting.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our schools face the monumental task of shielding students from an array of dangers in order to provide safe learning environments. Partnering with school resource officers is a key part of that effort; sworn law enforcement officers protect nearly half of the country's public schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These officers wear many hats. They ensure school safety and mentor and educate students, but they also investigate crimes and make arrests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2020-26-18.2\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-26-18.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1, -3, -16-6(b) (2017). This means that school discipline sometimes falls under the watchful eye of the police.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Paul Holland,\n   <em>\n    Schooling\n   </em>\n   Miranda\n   <em>\n    : Policing Interrogation in the Twenty-First Century Schoolhouse\n   </em>\n   , 52 Loyola L. Rev. 39 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For students, the stakes of the disciplinary process are high. Students can be suspended and expelled, as B.A. was here.\n   <em>\n    B.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356866\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/73/720/#p730\">\n    73 N.E.3d at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But those educational consequences are just the tip of the iceberg since school police officers' involvement can also lead to criminal\n   charges. B.A., for example, was arrested and taken to the juvenile detention center at the end of his interview. Some students are sentenced to jail time.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    N.C. v.

And others are waived into adult court, where they face years-long sentences.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Norris v.

Though the Court did not decide whether J.D.B. was under custodial interrogation, the implication is unmistakable:\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings protect students when they are placed under custodial interrogation at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Courts have understandably grappled with the custodial interrogation test in schools. For example, the Colorado Supreme Court applied\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   and held that a seventh-grader was not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings at school because he was not in custody.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The Supreme Court of Kentucky similarly applied\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   , finding that a student was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings because he was under custodial interrogation, even in a school-discipline matter.\n   <em>\n    N.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094159\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/852/#p854\">\n    396 S.W.3d at 862-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were required when school police officers questioned a student at school.\n   <em>\n    In re R.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"163599\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/568/1/\">\n    568 Pa. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474657,163599\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/791/331/\">\n    791 A.2d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (2002). So, cases before and after\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   reveal the challenge of determining custodial interrogation (and thus whether\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are required) in schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   These cases also show that there is no \"educational purpose\" exception to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   like the one our Court of Appeals applied.\n   <em>\n    B.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356866\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/73/720/#p730\">\n    73 N.E.3d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather than using special caution, that exception would swallow the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rule, leaving less protection for students than for other suspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Also in keeping with special protections for juveniles, our legislature has crafted Indiana's juvenile waiver statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 31-32-5-1. When\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   applies to minor students, this statute does too.

First,\n   <em>\n    Miranda's\n   </em>\n   key exception-for public safety-will of course apply in schools in cases of imminent danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v.

So when police face the pressing need to secure the safety of students at school in light of present-day threats,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings may be bypassed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/#p655\">\n    467 U.S. at 657-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/#p655\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here though, as the parties agree, B.A.'s school was in no danger at the time of his interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   And second, none of this is to say that schools and their resource officers must avoid placing students under custodial interrogation. Students sometimes commit crimes that school resource officers will have to investigate, often by interviewing suspects. This proper role of resource officers may place students in custody. When it does, officers must give\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and follow Indiana's juvenile waiver statute before asking questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.G. v.
