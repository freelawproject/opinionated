In order to purchase the property, Seye and Kebe (collectively \"defendants\") executed a promissory note to Washtenaw Mortgage Company (\"Washtenaw Mortgage\") in the amount of $152,000. The loan was secured by a mortgage in which Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") acted as the nominee on behalf of the lender, Washtenaw Mortgage. Washtenaw Mortgage retained Pillar Title Agency, LTD (\"Pillar Title\") to serve as the title, escrow, and closing agent for the purchase transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 22, 2014, Central Mortgage filed a complaint in foreclosure alleging defendants were in default on a promissory note held by Central Mortgage and secured by a mortgage assigned to it by Washtenaw Mortgage. The complaint alleged a balance due in the amount of $137,512.53, plus interest from July 1, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 10, 2014, defendants filed an answer, counterclaim, and third-party complaint against Pillar Title and Stewart Title Company (\"Stewart Title\"). In the counterclaim, defendants alleged a cause of action for breach of contract against Central Mortgage, while defendants' third-party complaint alleged causes of action against Pillar Title and Stewart Title for breach of contract, negligence, and unjust enrichment. On November 6, 2014, Central Mortgage filed a reply to defendants' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 14, 2014, Central Mortgage filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint in foreclosure and for reformation of deed and mortgage, declaratory judgment, and equitable lien. By entry filed December 10, 2014, the trial court granted Central Mortgage's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On December 15, 2014, defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint. On February 17, 2015, Seye filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer and counterclaim, which the trial court subsequently granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 28, 2015, Central Mortgage filed a motion for summary judgment against defendants. On October 26, 2015, defendants filed a response in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. On November 2, 2015, Central Mortgage filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} By decision and entry filed March 29, 2016, the trial court granted Central Mortgage's motion for summary judgment against defendants and dismissed defendants' counterclaims. On April 20, 2016, the trial court filed a judgment entry and decree in foreclosure in favor of Central Mortgage. In its entry, the trial court found scrivener's error and mutual mistake and granted reformation of the mortgage to include the names of Kebe and Seye in the acknowledgement clause of the mortgage; the court's entry also included a determination there was no just reason for delay in entering judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On appeal, appellants set forth the following three assignments of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [I.] The Trial Court erred as a matter of law in finding two different versions of the Note do not create a factual issue under\n   <em>\n    Lackey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [II.] The Trial Court improperly found that the Plaintiff had satisfied all conditions precedent to foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [III.] The Trial Court erred in granting reformation of the mortgage to the Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At issue on appeal is the propriety of the trial court's decisions granting summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure in favor of Central Mortgage. In order to obtain summary judgment, a movant is\n   required to show that \"(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Specifically, appellants note that Central Mortgage, in its complaint for foreclosure and motion for summary judgment, presented a version of the promissory note that contained a blank indorsement on the signature page executed by the supervisor for Washtenaw Mortgage and authenticated as the business record of Central Mortgage by Natalie Kenny. Appellants argue they offered a competing version of the note (attached as exhibit No. 2 to their reply to Central Mortgage's motion for summary judgment) that contained no indorsement. Appellants maintain the existence of multiple versions of the note presents a genuine issue of material fact regarding Central Mortgage's entitlement to enforce the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In support, appellants cite this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    FV-I, Inc. v.

No. 13AP-983,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4944\">\n    2014-Ohio-4944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205768578\">\n    2014 WL 5768578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank N.A. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lackey\n   </em>\n   , this court found a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment where the plaintiff-appellee submitted two different versions of a promissory note in which \"each version of the Note * * * contain[ed] endorsements, but the endorsements [were] different between the two versions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Lackey,\n   </em>\n   the version of the note attached to the original complaint included \"an allonge bearing an undated endorsement from PNC Bank, National Association, as successor by merger to First Franklin (the original lender) to appellee,\" while the second version, filed as an amended exhibit to the original complaint, contained on the left side \"an undated endorsement from First Franklin to First Franklin Financial Corporation,\" and on the right side \"an undated endorsement from First Franklin Financial Corporation to appellee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. In\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23, this court found genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment where the appellee-bank submitted two different copies of the promissory note in which one of the copies did not include allonges and an indorsement (contained in the other copy), and which \"did not establish appellee as the holder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In response, Central Mortgage argues the only copies of the promissory\n   note that are part of the record in the instant action contain the same blank indorsement. Specifically, Central Mortgage contends the copies of the original note attached to both its amended complaint and affidavit are identical. Central Mortgage asserts that appellants have attempted to introduce copies of promissory notes filed in a 2008 foreclosure action against appellants and in a 2009 bankruptcy case involving Kebe. Central Mortgage maintains that copies of a promissory note introduced in a prior foreclosure action six years earlier or from a bankruptcy case five years earlier are immaterial to the issues of the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We begin with an overview of the summary judgment evidence. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Central Mortgage submitted the affidavit of its officer, Natalie Kenny, who averred she has \"personal knowledge of the operation of and the circumstances surrounding the maintenance and retrieval of business records in Central's record keeping systems.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 2.) According to the affidavit, Washtenaw Mortgage retained Pillar Title \"to serve as the title, escrow, and closing agent for the purchase transaction in the amount of $152,000.00 that [Washtenaw Mortgage] loaned to Mamadou Seye and Mohamad Kebe.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Kenny averred that Kebe executed a limited specific power of attorney on September 18, 2004, in which Kebe nominated and appointed Seye as his attorney-in-fact to perform certain actions with respect to the purchase and sale of the property on behalf of Kebe; the power of attorney was recorded in the Franklin County Recorder's Office on September 24, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The affidavit averred that Kebe and Seye applied for and received a loan in the amount of $152,000 through Washtenaw Mortgage's agent to purchase the real property located on Sowers Drive in Canal Winchester. The closing for the transaction occurred on September 20, 2004. Seye and Kebe executed and delivered to Washtenaw Mortgage a note, dated September 20, 2004, in the original amount of $152,000; Seye executed the note on behalf of Kebe as his attorney-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} According to Kenny, the note \"has been indorsed in blank by Washtenaw [Mortgage].\" Kenny further averred that \"[a]t the time of the filing of the Complaint * * * and continuously since, Central [Mortgage] had and has possession of the original Note.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As security for the promissory note, Seye and Kebe executed a mortgage, dated September 20, 2004, in favor of MERS \"solely as nominee for Washtenaw [Mortgage], its successors and assigns.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 12.) Seye executed the mortgage on behalf of Kebe as his attorney-in-fact. The mortgage was recorded in the Franklin County Recorder's Office on September 24, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Kenny averred that, by an assignment dated November 7, 2008, MERS, as nominee for Washtenaw Mortgage, \"assigned the Mortgage to Central Mortgage * * * its successors and assigns.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 13.) The assignment was recorded in the Franklin County Recorder's Office on December 12, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The affidavit further averred that \"payments have not been made as required under the terms of the Note and Mortgage,\" and that \"the account is due and owing for the August 1, 2011 payment with interest running from July 1, 2011.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 15.) Central Mortgage, by correspondence dated May 21, 2014, \"informed Kebe and Seye * * * that their loan was in default for failure to make payments due.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In appellants' reply to Central Mortgage's motion for summary judgment, appellants submitted the affidavit of a paralegal who averred she had \"searched the Franklin County Docket for various documents related to a 2008 foreclosure for Mamadou Seye.\" (Twyford Aff. at \u00b6 5.) Attached to appellants' motion was a copy of an affidavit of Janice Davis, vice-president of Central Mortgage, dated December 26, 2008, in which Davis averred that Seye and Kebe were in default for failure to pay monthly installments of principal and interest pursuant to the note. Appellants also attached a copy of a promissory note with no indorsement and bearing the signatures of Seye and Kebe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In addressing appellants' claim that there were competing versions of the promissory note, the trial court found that Central Mortgage's \"2008 foreclosure action is of little import in light of [appellants'] successive defaults.\" The trial court also cited Ohio law, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    Najar\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59, for the proposition that \"it is well-established that '[t]he mere fact that there [are] two different copies of the note in the record-one with indorsement and one without-does not mandate a finding that one of the notes was \"unauthentic\" or otherwise precludes summary judgment.' \" (Mar. 29, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based upon this court's de novo review, we find no error with the trial court's determination that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Central Mortgage was the holder of the note and assignee of the mortgage at the time it filed the amended complaint. The record on appeal indicates that both copies of the promissory note submitted by Central Mortgage with its amended complaint and its motion for summary judgment contain the same blank indorsement (i.e., endorsed by Washtenaw Mortgage in blank). Both copies of the note also contain the signatures of Kebe (by Seye as attorney-in-fact) and Seye. Kenny averred in the affidavit that the promissory note \"has been indorsed in blank by Washtenaw [Mortgage],\" and that Central Mortgage, \"[a]t the time of the filing of the Complaint * * * and continuously since * * * had and has possession of the original Note.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 11.) Kenny further averred that MERS, as nominee for Washtenaw Mortgage, assigned the mortgage to Central Mortgage, and that the assignment was recorded on December 12, 2008. Attached to Kenny's affidavit as exhibit E was a copy of the assignment from MERS to Central Mortgage. Also attached to the affidavit as exhibit C was a copy of the mortgage bearing the signatures of Kebe and Seye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In accordance with R.C. 1303.31(A), \"a 'person entitled to enforce' an instrument means any of the following persons: (1) the holder of the instrument, (2) a non-holder in possession of the instrument who has the rights of the holder, or (3) a person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to Section 1303.38 or division (D) of Section 1303.58 of the Revised Code.\"\n   <em>\n    United States Bank Natl.

Further, we find no error with the trial court's determination that materials submitted with respect to a previously dismissed 2008 foreclosure action (in which there was no judicial adjudication on the merits) were not germane to the issue whether Central Mortgage held the promissory note on December 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, as noted by the trial court, the mere fact there may be differing copies of a note (i.e., one with indorsement and one without) does not, standing alone, create a genuine issue of material fact as to the authenticity of one of the notes.\n   <em>\n    Najar\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y.

Specifically, asserting that any affidavit in support of summary judgment must have attached to it copies of all papers to which it refers, appellants argue that the affidavit of Kenny fails to contain specific business records to show when correspondence was mailed to Kebe and Seye regarding the notice of default. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Paragraph 6(C) of the promissory note provides for notice of default,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by other means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The affidavit of Kenny averred in part that, according to Central Mortgage's business records and Kenny's review of such records, \"correspondence dated May\n   21, 2014 was sent to Kebe and to Seye by First Class Mail, which correspondence informed Kebe and Seye * * * that their loan was in default for failure to make payments due,\" and that the \"[f]ailure to cure the default by June 20, 2014 would result in acceleration of their loan account.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 16.) Kenny further averred that \"correspondence dated July 2, 2014 was sent to Kebe and Seye,\" informing them \"that their loan account had been referred to counsel to begin foreclosure proceedings.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Attached to the affidavit was exhibit F, a copy of the May 21, 2014 notices of default addressed to Kebe and Seye, as well as exhibit G, a copy of the July 2, 2014 correspondence to Kebe and Seye informing them that \"[d]ue to the delinquency of the loan, the above captioned property has been referred to the following attorney to begin foreclosure proceedings.\" Also attached to the affidavit of Kenny was exhibit H, identified in the affidavit as \"business records showing the generation of correspondence to Kebe and Seye.\" (Kenny Aff. at \u00b6 20.)
