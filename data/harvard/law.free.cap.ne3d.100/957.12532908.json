Iske, appeals from a February 22, 2017 judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, issuing a decree of divorce and dividing assets of the parties. The parties concede, and we agree, that the trial court erred in considering Randy's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oppenheimer Funds to be both a separate asset and a marital asset. Thus we sustain the second assignment of error. We also agree that the trial court's order that the parties \"equalize[ ]\" retirement accounts, including Social Security, is ambiguous. (Feb. 22, 2017 Am. Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry at 22.) However, we construe that statement as dictating that Social Security accounts are not to be divided and should only be considered for the purposes of dividing plaintiff-appellee's, Cynthia S. Iske, State Teachers Retirement System (\"STRS\") pension. Hence we sustain in part and overrule in part Randy's third assignment of error. We find no merit in Randy's remaining two assignments of error and overrule them. Based on our disposition of the assignments of error, we reverse the decree of the trial court in part and direct that the trial court modify its decree to treat Randy's Oppenheimer Funds as a separate asset and enforce its decree in regard to retirement accounts with the understanding that Social Security accounts are not to be divided and may only be considered for the purposes of dividing a public pension. In all other respects, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 20, 2015, Cynthia filed a complaint for divorce against her husband, Randy. (Nov. 20, 2015 Compl.) The parties were able to resolve many of their differences by agreement and stipulation. Nearly a year later, on October 31, 2016, the trial court held a bench trial on unresolved issues. According to stipulations executed immediately prior to trial, the issues to be resolved by trial were the value of a family farm property in Iowa, the relative separate property interests of each party in the marital residence on Kul Circle, and the termination date of the marriage (which would affect the division of bank accounts and retirement accounts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Oct. 31, 2016 Pretrial Stip. at 4-5, filed Nov. 1, 2016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Three witnesses testified at the October trial; Cynthia, Randy, and their son, Nicholas Iske. (Tr., filed Apr. 25, 2017.) In addition to the live testimony, the parties submitted the deposition testimony of two stipulated experts on the likely value of the farmland owned jointly by the parties. (Van Zee Dep., filed Oct. 24, 2016; Smith Dep., filed Oct. 28, 2016.) We review the testimony of these witnesses as is relevant to the issues contested in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Cynthia testified first. She testified that she and Randy were married on June 24, 1995. (Tr. at 8.) She moved out of the marital residence on May 8, 2016 and rented an apartment. (Tr. at 12-13.) She testified that moving out and ending the marriage was entirely her decision and that there were no attempts at reconciliation. (Tr. at 17-19, 27.) She admitted that she and her husband had discussed counseling and that each party had offered to engage in counseling at one point in time. (Tr. at 28.) However, the offers took place at different times and, in each instance, when one of them was ready to engage in counseling, the other was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She testified that she was not seeing anyone else but had stopped socializing with her husband by fall 2015. (Tr. at 17, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On the topic of finances, she testified consistent with the pretrial stipulation that she had her own retirement that was funded from her own earnings. (Tr. at 26-27; Pretrial Stip. at 4.) Neither her testimony nor the stipulation expressly indicated whether she could expect to receive Social Security distributions in retirement. She testified that the Iowa farm property deed indicates that she and Randy owned it as joint tenants. (Tr. at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep., Ex. 6, filed Oct. 28, 2016.) In her testimony she agreed that although she owned a house on Maidens Larne Drive prior to the marriage, that Randy paid the mortgage on the property once they moved in together and that they both invested money in the house in the form of renovations. (Tr. at 23-24.) She therefore admitted that the $16,782.60 proceeds from the sale of the Maidens Larne house (which were used to buy their current marital residence on Kul Circle) were marital property. (Tr. at 24-25; Pl. Ex. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Randy confirmed that he and Cynthia were married on June 24, 1995. (Tr. at 38.) He testified that he considered his marriage over the day his wife told him it was, at the end of August 2015. (Tr. at 93.) He said that he offered to do counseling with her, but she told him she had already made up her mind that it was over. (Tr. at 93-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Randy testified that when he and Cynthia bought a house on Kul Circle, he took $22,731.38 from his premarital account with Oppenheimer Funds, and contributed that to the down payment. (Tr. at 42; Def. Ex. C.) He testified that after his wife moved out, he paid off the mortgage on the Kul Circle property. (Tr. at 70-72.) He testified that the money used to pay off the mortgage came entirely from his work earnings. (Tr. at 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} With respect to the Iowa property, Randy explained that his father had owned 320 acres of farmland in Iowa. (Tr. at 49.) His father divided it up into four parcels of approximately 80 acres and gave one parcel to Cynthia and Randy jointly and one parcel apiece to each of Randy's three brothers. (Tr. at 50.) The parties stipulated that if their 80 acres were sold, $30,000 would go to Randy's brother, Michael, because that brother had taken on the responsibility of working the farmland in order to satisfy certain loans originally obtained by Randy's father. (Tr. at 54.) Randy also testified that a sum of money would have to be paid to his mother to pay\n   her for the remainder of her life estate in the property. (Tr. at 53-54.) When one of Randy's other brothers, Alfred, sold his 80 acres, he was compelled to fund an annuity to pay his mother $700 per month for 10 years. (Tr. at 53-55.) Randy stated that if the property were sold, he would have to compensate his mother according to the same terms. (Tr. at 58.) In addition, he explained (and his son, Nicholas Iske, confirmed) that Randy agreed to pay his sister $50,000 from the proceeds of any sale as a matter of fairness, since she had been left out of the original gift of farmland. (Tr. at 63-64, 77-79.) Randy and Nicholas also testified that Cynthia was aware of this agreement and had not evinced disagreement with it. (Tr. at 61-62, 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The first expert to testify, by way of deposition, was John Van Zee, a real estate sales associate with Farmers National Company. (Van Zee Dep. at 7.) He testified that he did a market analysis with comparable sales in order to arrive at an appropriate price per acre per Corn Suitability Rating point (CSR1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Van Zee Dep., Ex. 1, filed Oct. 24, 2016. Comparable sales for a market analysis consisted of nearby recent actual sales of cropland, discounted where appropriate to avoid counting proceeds related to non-crop land or buildings. (Van Zee Dep. at 16-18; Van Zee Dep., Ex. 1 at 1.) Using this analysis, Van Zee calculated an average price of $100.52 per CSR1 point per acre. (Van Zee Dep., Ex. 1 at 1.) He multiplied this by the 71.1 tillable acres contained within Randy and Cynthia's property and the CSR1 rating for the land (65.1) to obtain a value of $465,278.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. To this he also added a figure for the 6.9 acres of timbered land included within the property at an estimated value of $2,000 per acre.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus his total forecasted market value for the land was $479,078.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The market value estimate did not include any value for buildings on the land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He testified that the estimate was not an appraisal (which would have also included an income and cost approach) but solely an opinion as to the likely market price the land would fetch. (Van Zee Dep. at 21; Van Zee Dep., Ex. 1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The second expert to testify by deposition was Ken Smith, an attorney who assists in farmland transactions and owns one-third interest in a 7,413-acre farming operation in Ukraine. (Smith Dep. at 5-6, 42, 50.) Smith also testified as a fact witness because he was one of the attorneys who was involved in the negotiation of Randy's mother's life estate and the sale of part of the original 320 acres by Randy's brother, Alfred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-30. Smith explained that the farm was transferred in four parcels to the four brothers due to debt trouble incurred by the parents but that the parents had intended to reserve a life estate for themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-14. Due to an error by another attorney however, the life estate was not properly reserved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14. Thus there was some litigation and negotiation after Randy's father died when the first brother sought to sell his 80 acres.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16. Smith confirmed that Randy's brother Michael had farmed the land and helped pay off the debt on the farm and that Michael had received payment from Alfred on the sale of Alfred's land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. Smith also confirmed that an annuity was created from Alfred's sale of his parcel in favor of Randy's mother in exchange for a quit-claim of her\n   interest in Alfred's 80 acres. (Smith Dep. at 41; Smith Dep., Exs. 4-5.) He opined that a similar claim would be made if Randy and Cynthia were to sell their parcel. (Smith Dep. at 41.) Smith also confirmed that some of the brothers have agreed to make a payout to their sister on sale of the land due to the fact that she was otherwise left out of the original land gift. (Smith Dep. at 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On the topic of estimated value, Smith testified that the Iske farm is worth $280,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40; Smith Dep., Ex. 7. He explained that it is a \"rolling\" farm, the contours and borders of which make it less valuable to potential mega farm purchasers. (Smith Dep. at 32-41.) Smith testified, moreover, that based on sales he had recently participated in, he thought prices had lately dropped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep., Ex. 7. But he could not recall any specifics of the sales that he had participated in that led him to believe prices had fallen in the area. (Smith Dep. at 54-56.) He was also not definite about whether his $280,000 figure took account of the life estate and other debts and agreements related to the property.\n   <em>\n    Compare Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep., Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Following closing briefs by the parties, the trial court, on January 6, 2017, issued a divorce decree and entry. (Jan. 6, 2017 Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry.) Randy moved for a new trial based on a number of alleged errors in the trial court's decision. (Feb. 3, 2017 Mot. for New Trial.) The trial court declined to grant a new trial, but, due to the presence of a number of clerical errors, the trial court issued an amended decree and entry on February 22, 2017. (Feb. 22, 2017 Am. Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry; Feb. 22, 2017 Decision &amp; Entry Denying Mot. for New Trial.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the amended decree the trial court made a number of rulings relevant to this appeal. It decided that the termination date of the marriage would be the date of the final hearing in the case. (Feb. 22, 2017 Am. Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry at 5-8.) It found that there was insufficient evidence from which to conclude that Randy's payoff of the Kul Circle mortgage was accomplished solely with his separate property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. It stated that the Oppenheimer Fund moneys were Randy's separate property but also not his separate property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 21. It listed all the retirement accounts (an unknown amount for Randy's accrued Social Security value, $8,778.34 for Cynthia's STRS accrued value, nothing for Cynthia's Social Security accrued value, and various accrued value account totals for the privately-held accounts) and then directed that, \"the plans shall be equalized between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. It found Van Zee's analysis more credible than Smith's and adopted his CSR1 valuation of $479,078.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The trial court also decided that Randy's brother (Michael) and his sister were due $30,000 and $50,000, respectively, from any proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19. Finally, the trial court concluded that Randy's mother had a life estate interest in the property similar to the interest recognized when Alfred sold his 80 acres and that, of the 10 years estimated for her life estate when Alfred sold his property, 53 months remained on the farm property owned by Randy and Cynthia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court found the obligation owed to Randy's mother to buy her interest in the property to be $700 per month for 53 months, or $37,100.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court calculated the remaining marital value of the Iowa farmland to be $361,978, and it ordered Randy to pay the sum of $180,989 to Cynthia within 18 months or on the sale of the property, whichever occurred first.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Randy now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

That is, because he paid off the mortgage after his wife moved out and he believed the marriage to be over (but before the final hearing) Randy argues that such portion of the home's value should be considered his separate property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206843620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Supreme Court of Ohio has instructed courts that the law for determining the duration of marriage for the purpose of asset division must stand the test of fairness on review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The choice of a date as of which assets available for equitable distribution should be identified and valued must be dictated largely by pragmatic considerations. The public policy giving rise to equitable distribution is at least in part an acknowledgment that marriage is a shared enterprise or joint undertaking. While marriage is literally a partnership, it is a partnership in which the contributions and equities of the partners do differ from individual case to individual case. Assets acquired by the joint efforts of the parties should be, on termination, eligible for distribution. But the precise date upon which any marriage irretrievably breaks down is extremely difficult to determine, and this court will avoid promulgating any unworkable rules with regard to this determination.

But, although Cynthia apparently worked for some time in a job (Nationwide Children's Hospital) in which she likely would have contributed to the Social Security system, we do not find in the record any evidence of her contributions to Social Security or some indication that is entitled to receive benefits at some future date.

That is, the trial court listed all the retirement accounts-an unknown amount for Randy's Social Security, $8,778.34 for Cynthia's STRS, nothing for Cynthia's Social Security, and various account totals for all the privately held accounts in each of their names.

Fourth Assignment of Error-Whether the Trial Court Erred in its Valuation of the Iowa Farm Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court made the factual finding that Van Zee's analysis was more credible than Smith's and adopted Van Zee's valuation of the Iowa farmland, subject to the court's factual findings concerning deductions necessary for debts or payments owed to Randy's brother, mother, and sister. (Feb. 22, 2017 Am. Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry at 16-20.) Randy argues that the trial court erred in not finding Smith more credible than Van Zee because Smith was familiar with the land in question and was not biased in favor of high values. (Randy's Brief at 32.) Randy argues that because Smith is an attorney who earns most of his income from practice and Ukrainian farm ownership, Smith has little incentive to inflate estimates, as opposed to Van Zee who earns his income from sales of Iowa farmland.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203432672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Randy also argues Van Zee did not take into account debts and payments to Randy's brother, mother, and sister that diminish the overall value of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-35. Randy argues the trial court's valuation was speculative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The parties stipulated that both Van Zee and Smith were experts. (Pretrial Stip. at 5.) Van Zee was transparent about the method of his valuation, stating that he determined the value of the land by calculating the average cost per acre per CSR1 point for five comparable nearby recent sales. (Van Zee Dep. at 16-18.) He provided detailed information about the recent sales including what was sold, for how much, when, and by what means.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Van Zee Dep., Ex. 1 at 1. He determined the value of the subject property by multiplying CSR1 score by tillable acres by average regional price per acre and added an estimated amount for each acre of timbered land to arrive at a value of $479,078.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. By contrast, Smith testified generally that the Iske farm was a \"rolling\" farm and not attractive to mega farm purchasers. (Smith Dep. at 32-41.) His opinion affidavit was based on the sales of two neighboring parcels, extrapolating that the price per acre should be only approximately 60 percent of what Van Zee had calculated. (Smith Dep., Ex. 7.) But Smith was unable to recall any specifics of the two sales which led him to opine on the price per acre. (Smith Dep. at 54-56.) Nor was he definite about whether or not his $280,000 valuation included the life estate and other debts related to the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41; Smith Dep., Ex. 7. Given this evidence, we cannot find that the trial court lost its way in determining the credibility of these two expert witnesses such that its finding was manifestly against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The trial court likewise did not err in crediting the parties' stipulation that $30,000 was owed to Randy's brother, Michael. (Tr. at 54.) Based on the consistent testimony of Randy and Nicholas, we do not find that the trial court erred in deducting from its value $50,000 to pay to Randy's sister. (Tr. at 61-64, 77-80.) Nor was it against the manifest weight of the evidence for the trial court to have concluded, based on the deposition testimony of Smith, corroborated by Randy's testimony and exhibits to Smith's deposition that Randy's mother had a life estate in Randy and Cynthia's 80 acres similar to that which was determined when Alfred sold his 80 acres. (Smith Dep., Exs. 3-4; Smith Dep. at 15-22, 41; Tr. at 58.) Although Randy argues on appeal that his mother's life estate could have changed in value, he testified at trial that, if the Iowa property were sold, he would be required to compensate his mother according to the same terms as his brother, Alfred. (Tr. at 58.) Based on the evidence before the trial court, it was not an abuse of discretion to have multiplied the months left in Randy's mother's ten-year, annuity-based life estate remainder, based on the sale of Alfred's land, by $700 per month and also to have deducted that from the overall value of Randy and Cynthia's farm property. (Feb. 22, 2017 Am. Decree, Decision, &amp; Entry at 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The trial court's findings regarding the Iowa property were supported by sufficient evidence. Its evidentiary findings were not against the manifest weight of the evidence before it. Once the trial court made its factual findings, it fairly adjudged how to divide the parties' assets and did not abuse its discretion under the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-20. We overrule Randy's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The trial court followed the law in finding that the parties' marriage ended on the date of the final hearing before it. It did not abuse its discretion in failing to find a de facto termination date for the marriage. As the finder of fact, the trial\n   court's valuation of the Iowa farm property, reliant on the testimony of one expert over the other, was within the court's discretion. Having determined the facts important to valuing the farmland for the purposes of dividing its value between the parties, the trial court fairly determined its value. We interpret the trial court's judgment to give it full effect such that Randy's Social Security assets may be used to offset the distribution from Cynthia's STRS pension. But the trial court's simultaneous consideration of a retirement account in Randy's name as both separate property and marital property must be reversed and remanded to the trial court for correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We therefore sustain Randy's second assignment of error, sustain in part and overrule in part his third assignment of error, overrule his first and fourth assignments of error, and remand the judgment for the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relation, for further consideration. On remand, we instruct the trial court to modify its decree to treat Randy's Oppenheimer Funds as a separate asset and to enforce its decree on retirement accounts with the understanding that Randy's Social Security account is not to be divided and should only be considered as may be relevant for purposes of dividing Cynthia's STRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   DORRIAN and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Because the parties share the same last name, for ease of reference we refer to them by first name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Van Zee admitted that, effective in January 2016, CSR1 was replaced by CSR2, which takes into account improvements in land production due to improved tilling, terracing, seed technology, herbicides, and other technology.
