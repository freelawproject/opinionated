For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arises out of business dealings between the parties. Defendant Safaryan is the sole shareholder and manager of defendant Land of Ararat, a corporation whose only asset is a small shopping center located at the intersection of Groveport, Watkins, and Lockbourne Roads in Franklin County (the \"Southfield Center\"). Appellant is a former minority shareholder in Land of Ararat, and through his own wholly-owned corporation, EMA Group Corp. (\"EMA\"), operated at various times a retail business known as Shop N Save in the Southfield Center. Appellant purchased 20 percent of Land of Ararat's stock in 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} EMA first opened Shop N Save in the Southfield Center in 2007, operating without a written lease. By 2009, the business was inactive although EMA maintained some property and equipment in the former store space. The evidence in the case generally establishes that the only other useful tenant in the Southfield Center\n   at the time was a small pharmacy occupying the storefront adjacent to the former Shop N Save, although Land of Ararat eventually leased an undeveloped area of the property to a cell phone tower operator for $700 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After closing the Shop N Save, appellant became dissatisfied with the return on his investment in Land of Ararat. In 2009, the parties negotiated two parallel transactions under which (1) appellant would sell his 20 percent stake in Land of Ararat to Safaryan, and (2) EMA and Land of Ararat would enter into a commercial lease with the intention of re-opening the Shop N Save store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant offered to sell his 20 percent interest in Land of Ararat for approximately $100,000, and Safaryan accepted; the figure was eventually adjusted to reflect the relative advantages to each party accruing from the impending storefront lease for a revived Shop N Save operation. The transaction closed on January 7, 2010, with a stated price of $95,000 paid in the form of a $10,000 deposit, $60,000 due the day after closing, and a $25,000 note due April 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Contemporaneously with the sale of appellant's shares, EMA and Land of Ararat entered into a five-year lease of \"approximately 7000-7500 square feet\" at 2950 Groveport Road in the Southfield Center at $2,000 per month with the first four months waived. (Comp., Ex. C at 1.) The named parties are EMA and Land of Ararat, and the signature block contains appellant's signature in his capacity as president of EMA. In a final paragraph appearing after the notarized acknowledgements of signature, Ettayem personally guaranteed EMA's lease payment obligations for the first six payable months of the lease, May through October 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} EMA's Shop N Save briefly reopened at the leased location and then closed again amid disputes over the condition of the premises. Some time later, the parties also disagreed over access to the now-vacant premises and removal of the Shop N Save store fixtures. Appellant then brought this action contesting both Land of Ararat's performance under the lease and Safaryan's conduct pertaining to the stock sale. The matter is now in its second incarnation pursuant to a refiled complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} EMA and appellant initially commenced the matter on December 10, 2013 with a complaint naming both as plaintiffs and stating claims for breach of lease contract, conversion of the store equipment, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and punitive damages. The first two claims were by EMA and arose out of the lease agreement, while the third and fourth claims were by appellant personally and arose out of appellant's sale of his minority interest in Land of Ararat. The fifth claim for punitive damages was derivative of the four substantive claims. The first and second claims were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by counsel for EMA on October 29, 2014. On October 30, 2014, appellant personally dismissed the remaining causes of action without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant, proceeding pro se, refiled a complaint restating the same five claims on October 30, 2015. EMA is not a named plaintiff and appellant now asserts all claims on his own behalf, including those arising out of the lease between EMA and Land of Ararat. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely, which the trial court denied by entry filed January 26, 2016. Appellees then filed an answer that included affirmative defenses addressing standing, timeliness, and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Discovery proceeded with an exchange of requests for admissions, interrogatories, and requests for production. Appellant appeared for a lengthy deposition\n   on July 15, 2016. The trial court granted appellant's motion to extend discovery on July 26, 2016. On August 29, 2016, appellees again moved to dismiss the first, second, and fourth causes of action for failure to state a claim, asserting that appellant was not the real party in interest for claims arising from the lease, and that the fraud claim based on the stock sale was not stated with sufficient particularity. The court did not immediately decide this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellees moved for summary judgment on October 11, 2016. This motion incorporated by reference their still-pending motion to dismiss. The evidence in support of summary judgment included appellant's deposition and the operative documents for the storefront lease and stock sale. Appellant then moved to again extend the discovery cutoff. He also sought additional time to respond to the summary judgment motion and requested a status conference. The trial court, by entry dated November 4, 2016, denied an extension of discovery but granted appellant until November 17, 2016 to file his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment. The court did not order a status conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees on all claims on January 5, 2017. The court found that the first two claims, which are based on the alleged breach of the lease and conversion of store equipment, failed because appellant, acting pro se, could not file claims on behalf of the corporate entity EMA, and were also time-barred because he had refiled them more than one year after the initial dismissal on October 29, 2014. The court further found with respect to the third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty that appellant had submitted no evidence to maintain a genuine issue of material fact regarding any breach by Safaryan of the fiduciary duty owed to appellant as a minority share holder. The court found the fourth claim for fraud was pleaded with insufficient particularity under Civ.R. 9(B), and there was no evidence to support even a sufficiently-pled claim for fraud. The court then granted judgment on the fifth cause of action for punitive damages, which was entirely derivative of the first four claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant appeals and assigns the following three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [I.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [II.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S FIRST, SECOND, AND FOURTH CAUSES OF ACTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [III.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN [IT] DENIED PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXTENED [sic] DISCOVERY, REQUEST FOR A HEARING AND CLEARED ITS DOCKET OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR A STATUS CONFERENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We begin with appellant's third assignment of error, which asserts the trial court erred when it denied his motion to extend discovery and request for a status conference. Appellant asserts he had multiple difficulties with discovery and needed to develop new evidence based on the content of Safaryan's deposition. The trial court granted only a short extension for appellant to reply to the pending motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Trial courts possess broad discretion over the discovery process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Appellate courts, therefore, generally review a trial court's decision regarding a discovery matter only for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Mauzy v. Kelly Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1746323\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/75/578/#p592\">\n    75 Ohio St.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20N.E.2d%201272\">\n    664 N.E.2d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ;\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

To the extent that appellant claimed at the eleventh hour appellees had not provided complete responses to his requests for documents, we note the record does not disclose any indication appellant had previously sought the assistance of the court to obtain timely cooperation from the defendants. Appellant has not particularized the necessary evidence that would have been uncovered by additional discovery time. Because the court's rulings were consistent with the fair and efficient administration of the case, and because appellant fails to articulate specific prejudice from the trial court's discovery ruling, we can find no abuse of discovery on the part of the trial court's oversight of the discovery process. We overrule appellant's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We next discuss appellant's first and second assignments of error together. These address the trial court's disposition of his five substantive claims via dismissal for failure to state a claim or via summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant's first claim asserted breach of the lease agreement. The trial court found he lacked standing to pursue this contract claim on behalf of EMA and the claim must be dismissed. The court also found that the claim was refiled outside the one-year grace period of the savings statute, and was time-barred. On these bases, the court dismissed the claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} When reviewing a judgment on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, an appellate court's standard of review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Perrysburg Twp. v.

The applicable statute of limitations is eight years, pursuant to R.C. 2305.06, governing contracts in writing. The alleged breach of contract occurred no earlier than January 2010. EMA dismissed its lease claim on October 29, 2014 and refiled it on October 30, 2015.

Appellant's arguments are summed up by the following statement: \"This does not prove that defendant 'Safaryan' has proven that Plaintiff 'Ettayem' was never induced, misrepresented to, and fraudulently omitted from * * * knowing the truth.\" (Memo. in Opp. at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The factual issues involve diversion of funds, concealment of past rents, and non-disclosure of the prospective cell tower lease. In opposition to summary judgment, appellant relied on his own deposition testimony, admissions by appellees, and answers to interrogatories. The deposition testimony at times covered matters of which appellant had no personal knowledge, especially regarding the actual and true lease rates and revenues for the Southgate Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 38} However, on our independent review, we find the record reveals Safaryan did not introduce sufficient unrebutted evidence to warrant summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim. While there remained no genuine issue of material fact with respect to certain allegations regarding concealment of rents and diversion of funds, appellant presented evidence that established a genuine issue of material\n   fact regarding non-disclosure of the impending cell tower lease, and a consequent loss to appellant resulting from the undervaluation of his shares in Land of Ararat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant testified that when he established his offer price for the sale of his shares in Land of Ararat, he relied on his own assessment of the property undertaken in 2004, and based his offer to sell his shares on his knowledge of the pharmacy rent, his projections of future rent paid by Shop N Save, and a capitalization rate (ten times income) of his own choosing. Appellant did not particularize the supposedly concealed rental payments from the pharmacy, nor does he have personal knowledge of them to the extent he discusses them in his deposition. Beyond his own suspicions, he introduced no independent evidence of concealment or diversion of corporate funds from Land of Ararat. With respect to the revenue from the cell phone tower, however, appellant provided specific facts based on personal knowledge and admissions by appellees. Appellant testified at his deposition that he was not informed by Safaryan or otherwise aware of the planned cell phone tower lease. Rent for this amounted to $700 per month to Land of Ararat. Appellant testified that, had he known of the cell phone tower project, he would have increased his view of the capitalized value of the shopping center by $84,000 and, therefore, increased the value of his 20 percent share by approximately $17,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In sum, the evidence is such that there remains a genuine issue of material fact regarding a breach of fiduciary duty by Safaryan in his role as majority shareholder based on the duty to fully and faithfully disclose potential future revenue from the cell phone tower for Land of Ararat. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on this portion of the breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The final substantive claim in the case was for fraud. The trial court dismissed appellant's fraud claim on the basis that he had not pleaded fraud with sufficient particularity. The court also found appellant had failed to produce evidence to maintain a genuine issue of material fact on this claim. We find the claim was, in fact, sufficiently pleaded and reverse for the evidentiary reasons set forth in the foregoing discussion of the breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The elements of a fraud claim are as follows: (1) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (2) that is material to the transaction at hand, (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it, (5) with justifiable reliance by the injured party upon the representation or concealment, and (6) resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\n   <em>\n    Burr v.

Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\" \"Typically, the requirement of particularity includes 'the time, place and content of the false representation, the fact misrepresented, and the nature of what was obtained or given as a consequence of the fraud.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carter-Jones Lumber Co. v.

The complaint further avers appellant was damaged by accepting a lesser price for his shares than he would have sought if fully informed. The time, manner, and content of these statements is sufficiently specified. The complaint sufficiently described the transaction at issue and the accompanying elements to satisfy the pleading requirements of Civ.R. 9(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 46} With the fraud claim sufficiently pled, we find the trial court additionally erred in finding that there was no evidence to support it as it relates to the cell phone tower. The above review of the evidence in connection with the breach of fiduciary duty claim demonstrates appellant's ability to maintain a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the existence of the fraud elements of non-disclosure, justifiable reliance, and proximate cause. The trial court's grant of summary judgment on the fraud claim must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Finally, we note the trial court's judgment on the fifth claim for punitive damages is entirely predicated on judgment for the defendants on the four substantive claims. With the revival of the breach of fiduciary duty and fraud claims, the grant of summary judgment on the punitive damages claim as to the cell phone tower must be reversed as well. Appellant's first and second assignments of error are sustained in part and overruled in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In sum, appellant's first and second assignments of error are sustained in part and overruled in part, and his third assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   LUPER SCHUSTER and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
