Selby, and plaintiff-appellee/cross-appellant, Law Offices of Russell A. Kelm (\"the Kelm firm\" or \"the firm\"), appeal from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas issued on November 30, 2015. Selby appeals the trial court's finding in favor of the Kelm firm on its claim for attorney fees. The Kelm firm appeals the trial court's award of attorney fees based on quantum meruit rather than a contingent fee. Because we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm its decision as to both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The parties in the underlying matter, the Kelm firm and a former client, Selby, challenge the trial court's resolution of their dispute over the payment and calculation of legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Selby retained the Kelm firm to represent him in an age discrimination claim against his former employer, Abbott Laboratories (\"Abbott\"), which had terminated Selby's employment as part of a reduction in force action on January 28, 2014. At the time Selby contacted the Kelm firm, Abbott had tendered an offer of 28 weeks of severance payable on regular pay days, which would be suspended if Selby were re-employed, in which event Selby would receive one-half of the remaining balance as a lump sum. The severance offer was dated January 28, 2014 and expired by its own terms on March 28, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 25, 2014, Selby signed a written contingency fee agreement with the Kelm firm, which provided in part for the firm to be compensated for one-third of any recovery from Abbott in excess of Abbott's January 28, 2014 severance offer, plus expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Kelm firm entered into negotiations with Abbott on Selby's behalf beginning in March 2014. The firm negotiated the extension of Abbott's initial severance offer to April 11, 2014. The parties failed to reach a settlement by April 11, and Abbott's initial severance offer expired on that date. The firm continued to negotiate with Abbott on Selby's behalf beyond the April 11 expiration date, but it also moved forward with drafting a complaint and sent it to Selby on May 1, 2014. Selby did not authorize filing the lawsuit, and negotiations with Abbott reached an impasse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} By mid-May 2014, Selby had found a new job, which effectively reduced his damages for lost wages to a claim for nine weeks pay, making a lawsuit financially unviable. The Kelm firm suggested negotiating for the $52,304.40 from the expired initial severance offer as a lump sum, regardless of Selby's employment status. Selby agreed, and the firm re-opened negotiations with Abbott. On July 11, 2014, Abbott sent a revised agreement offering a lump sum payment of the $52,304.40, without reference to Selby's employment status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Kelm firm initially sent Abbott's revised severance offer to an incorrect email address for Selby. On July 23, 2014, the firm emailed the July 11, 2014 offer to Selby at his correct email address,\n   advising that the statute of limitations on his age claim expired in a few days, and asking if he accepted the revised severance offer or wanted to proceed with a lawsuit. Selby responded by email on July 24, 2014, stating \"[n]o not yet.\" (Aug. 6, 2015 Resp. to Req. for Produc. at LORAK-238.) In fact, Selby signed the new agreement on July 24, and returned it directly to Abbott's legal counsel, without advising the Kelm firm that he had signed it or providing the firm with a copy of the signed document. Selby moved out of Ohio in August 2014 to take up his new job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Kelm firm followed up with another email to Selby on July 24, 2014. However, the record before the trial court indicates Selby did not respond to that email and did not communicate with the Kelm firm until November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On August 11, 2014, the Kelm firm billed Selby for a contingent fee and expenses of $11,246.82. On November 3, 2014, the firm sent Selby a ten-day demand letter via email for payment of the amount invoiced on August 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The firm claims that Selby failed to notify it of his new address, refused to communicate with it, and refused to pay any portion of the bill for services. The firm threatened to file suit to recover attorney fees and expenses and re-billed Selby for the full amount due for his services of $18,208.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On November 18, 2014, the Kelm firm filed a complaint against Selby, alleging he did not pay for legal services pursuant to the contingency agreement dated February 25, 2014. The Kelm firm alleged breach of contract and a right to recovery in quantum meruit and requested judgment against Selby for the sum of $18,208.36, plus interests and costs. On December 23, 2014, Selby filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} By journal entry dated May 5, 2015, the trial court granted Selby's motion to dismiss in part and deny in part. The trial court dismissed the first count of the complaint for breach of contract, having determined that Selby had effectively discharged the firm when he proceeded to complete settlement with Abbott without notice to the firm. The trial court relied on the holding of\n   <em>\n    Reid, Johnson, Downes, Andrachik &amp; Webster v. Lansberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726297\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/570/\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20N.E.2d%20431\">\n    629 N.E.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), to conclude that the Kelm firm, as a discharged attorney, was limited to a quantum meruit recovery. The trial court denied Selby's motion as to the second count of the complaint seeking recovery under quantum meruit. Additionally, the trial court struck the jury demand because quantum meruit is an equitable action, and there is not a right to jury trial on an equitable action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On August 6, 2015, Selby filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing he was entitled to summary judgment because the Kelm firm's quantum meruit claim failed as a matter of law. He asserted the Kelm firm was not entitled to attorney fees under the theory of quantum meruit because he had never discharged the firm, which represented him through the date he accepted Abbott's final severance offer, and therefore was bound by the contingency fee representation agreement. Selby contends the Kelm firm and he fulfilled the terms of the contingency fee agreement. He argues that the firm failed to recover more than the amount of Abbott's initial severance offer; consequently, the underlying contingency failed to occur, and the firm could not, as a matter of law, recover under quantum meruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On October 6, 2015, the trial court denied Selby's motion for summary judgment, finding that genuine questions\n   of material fact existed as to whether the Kelm firm had been discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The remaining claim of quantum meruit was tried to the bench on November 24, 2015. The trial court's decision issued on November 30, 2015 included comprehensive findings of facts and conclusions of law. Having reviewed all the evidence and considered the credibility of the witnesses and the factors appropriate under Ohio law, the trial court found in favor of the Kelm firm. The trial court found that the evidence showed that Selby \"was a sophisticated business man who understood the nature of the legal issues he was presenting to the Kelm firm, and who proceeded cautiously before making a legal fees agreement.\" (Nov. 30, 2015 Decision at \u00b6 22.) The trial court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   From the outset he understood that any number of lawyers might take his case, but he selected the Kelm firm. In doing so, Mr. Selby plainly understood the value their prior experience with employee terminations at Abbott brought to his case; their broad understanding of applicable law and a possible age discrimination claim; their immediate access to a statistics expert at OSU and their understanding of the potential value of such evidence in assisting Mr. Selby; and their apparent diligence and other value the firm brought to his engagement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20N.E.2d%20431\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court determined that Selby had benefited from the firm's representation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The original offer called for periodic payments, and more importantly a 50% reduction in benefits once Selby became reemployed; the final version gave him a lump sum and contained no reduction upon reemployment. Accordingly, Selby's argument that he owes the plaintiff law firm nothing because he only ended-up getting what he had in hand when he hired them is unavailing. The material terms of the final settlement changed even though the dollar amount of the $52,304 payment by Abbott remained roughly equivalent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} However, the trial court found that the Kelm firm ceased performing legal work for Selby on July 24, 2014, and thus was entitled to payment for legal services it sought on August 11, 2014. The trial court awarded the firm $11,246.82, the same amount it had sought on August 11, 2014, plus a $500 expense that had been overlooked. The trial court ordered the $231.75 in the firm's trust account belonging to Selby be credited to the amount owed. After that credit, the net damages awarded to the Kelm firm were $11,515.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Both Selby and the Kelm Firm present assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Selby presents the following three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that appellee was entitled to attorney fees under the doctrine of quantum meruit when the appellee failed to successfully meet the conditions of a written contingency fee agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that appellant constructively discharged appellee as his attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred in awarding attorney fees without evidence demonstrating that the attorney fees were reasonable under the Code of Professional Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Kelm Firm, as cross-appellant, presents a single assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The trial court erred in awarding $11,515.07 in attorney fees based on the parties' contingency agreement, rather than $21,458.75 under the theory of quantum meruit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standards of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Selby contends that the trial court's findings that he had discharged the Kelm law firm and that the firm was entitled to an award of attorney fees under the doctrine of quantum meruit, raise questions of law. But we find on review of the record and the parties' assignments of error that the trial court's findings must be reviewed according to standards involving mixed questions of fact and law. A question of law is subject to de novo review by this court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   We have held that \" 'no court has the authority, within its discretion, to commit an error of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.

Accordingly, acknowledging our review involves mixed questions of fact and law, we review the parties' assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Selby's First and Second Assignments of Error and the Kelm Firm's Sole Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 24} For ease of discussion, we review in tandem Selby's first two assignments of\n   error along with the Kelm firm's sole assignment of error, since they involve whether any fees should have been awarded and, if so, according to what legal theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Selby alleges the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that the Kelm firm was entitled to attorney fees under the doctrine of quantum meruit when the firm failed to successfully meet the conditions of a written contingency fee agreement. He argues the Kelm firm could only collect under the contingency fee agreement if the firm procured more than the $52,304.40 Abbott initially offered; otherwise, no fee was owed to the firm. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The trial court's decision details with particular specificity the actions the Kelm firm undertook in negotiating with Abbott on behalf of Selby both before and after Abbott's initial severance offer expired on April 11, 2014. The trial court summarized the situation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   47. A key factual dispute here is whether any fee is due the Kelm firm, because-as is not uncommon in such situations-the Kelm firm undertook the representation of Selby only after an offer letter was already in his hands from Abbott. The fees agreement used that as a floor. Thus, Joint Ex. 1 provided, \"you agree to pay us one-third (33 1/3%) of any recovery from Abbott in excess of your severance offer of seven months' pay, whether the recovery is a result of a settlement or of litigation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   48. As explained above, although the original severance offer was a continuing reference point in protracted discussions with [Abbot's legal counsel] after April 11, 2014, technically speaking the original offer had expired. Indeed, Mr. Selby appears to have seen it that way himself. Furthermore, in the final version of the settlement Abbott changed a material term in their original severance pay proposal. The original offer called for periodic payments, and more importantly a 50% reduction in benefits once Selby became reemployed; the final version gave him a lump sum and contained no reduction upon reemployment. Accordingly, Selby's argument that he owes the plaintiff law firm nothing because he only ended-up getting what he had in hand when he hired them is unavailing. The material terms of the final settlement changed even though the dollar amount of the $52,304 payment by Abbott remained roughly equivalent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Decision at \u00b6 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The trial court concluded that the evidence before it demonstrated the Kelm firm had performed legal services benefitting Selby by securing a revised severance offer from Abbott. The trial court found that, although the monetary amount of the final severance offer was the same as in Abbott's initial offer, the revised offer came without strings; that is, it was a lump sum payment rather than periodic payments, and there was no set off in the event Selby was re-employed. Consequently, the Kelm firm was entitled to fees as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial court found that Selby's conduct in late July 24, 2014 constructively terminated his attorney-client relationship with the Kelm firm. As a discharged attorney, the trial court determined the law allowed the firm to recover under the doctrine of quantum meruit. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the trial court's decision discuss the doctrine of quantum meruit and its applicability to the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   3. \"\n   <em>\n    Quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   is an equitable doctrine based upon the concept that a party should not be unjustly enriched at the expense of another.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. v.

The trial court made the factual determination that the Kelm firm's legal work for Selby ended on July 24, 2014. The trial court specifically noted that the firm's August 11, 2014 letter to Selby about a fee being owed \"essentially acknowledged that this attorney-client work had ended.\" (Decision at \u00b6 46.) The trial court found none of the firm's work on or after August 11, 2014 to be compensable. The trial court concluded that, had Selby paid the fee and expenses the Kelm firm sought on August 11, 2014, \"this lawsuit would have been unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Selby alleges the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that he had constructively discharged the Kelm firm as his attorney. He contends that he did not discharge the Kelm firm as his attorney and that the firm did not withdraw from representing him. Based on the record, however, we find that the trial court's conclusion that the attorney-client relationship ended in Selby's case is based on competent, credible evidence and is not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court in its decision recited a detailed chronology of the relationship between Selby and the Kelm firm and the course of communications between them. The trial court noted that Selby, on the same day he accepted signed Abbott's settlement offer, had responded \"[n]o not yet\" to the firm's email asking whether to proceed with filing the lawsuit. (Resp. to Req. for Produc. At LORAK-238.) Although the trial court acknowledged that Selby was under a good deal of stress at the time due to settling his affairs in Ohio, moving his family to Illinois and beginning his new job, it found that \"none of that justified his silence to his lawyer particularly about having accepted the settlement and releasing his potential claims.\" (Decision at \u00b6 45.) The trial court further found that, although Selby was busy with his new responsibilities between August and October 2014, it did not justify \"his protracted lack of communication with his lawyer, including his failure to advise the Kelm firm of his new mailing address in Illinois after he sold his home in Powell, Ohio.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. Based on the evidence before it, the trial court found that Selby's conduct constructively terminated his attorney-client relationship with the Kelm firm.

Hearsay decisions often require implicit determinations about facts (such as preliminary determinations of who said what in what circumstances) with the result that questions about whether to admit hearsay often are hybrid questions of fact and law.

The invoice dated August 11, 2014 was calculated using the contingency fee agreement for the amount of $11,246.82. The trial court, having reviewed all the evidence, considered the credibility of the witnesses and the factors appropriate for a case such as this one and awarded the Kelm firm attorney fees as damages in the amount of $11,515.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The trial court also acknowledged that a question had arisen at the close of the Kelm firm's case \"as to whether independent expert witness testimony was required to support [the firm's] legal fees claim.\" (Decision at \u00b6 7.) The trial court discussed the ordinary rule that an attorney's explanation of his fees, their reasonableness, and the attorney's experience and knowledge in a particular area of law \"may constitute sufficient evidence to support an award of fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7, citing\n   <em>\n    Odita\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.

The client received a settlement from Abbot which he accepted after receiving information about alternatives such as commencing and ADEA law suit.
