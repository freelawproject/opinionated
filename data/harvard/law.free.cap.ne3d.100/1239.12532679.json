We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The victim made plans with another individual to purchase marijuana. While they were parked in a driveway waiting for the seller, two teenagers wearing hooded sweatshirts attacked and robbed the pair. The victim was in the front, passenger side of the car. An unidentified teenager, the one who approached the driver side of the vehicle, was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and had \"poofy\" hair sticking out from underneath the donned hood. T.W. was described as wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, but also had \"poofy\" hair sticking out from under the hood. Although the other individual was also attacked in the robbery, our focus is on the victim and his identification of T.W. The other individual was unable to identify either assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} During the robbery, T.W. approached the victim and demanded his property. The victim's wallet and cash were stolen; however, the victim fought the assailant over a cell phone. The assailant struck the victim in the face with a gun and then punched him two more times, causing serious injury. Although it was dark out, the victim was able to see the assailant's face, relative age, race, gender, hairstyle, and color of clothing. The assailant was within an arm's length of the victim. After the victim refused to turn over his phone, the assailants both fled. The victim watched the assailants cut through the yard of a house on the same street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The police were immediately called and were provided the description of both assailants. Within minutes of receiving the call, a police officer drove to the relative location of the fleeing attackers. That officer observed two teenagers fitting the descriptions in front of a nearby house with several other people. The officer noted there was no other activity in the area, but the house was in the same direction as the fleeing assailants ran. The officer watched the teenager with the black sweatshirt enter the house and exit wearing a white T-shirt. The teenager with the gray, hooded sweatshirt remained outside. After backup arrived, both teenagers were detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Less than a half hour after the crime, the victim was brought to the area where the teenagers were detained for a show-up identification. The victim remained in the back of the squad car while the suspects were separately shown from a distance. The victim identified T.W. as one of the assailants but was unable to identify the other, and that teenager was immediately released. There was some hesitation on the victim's part, but he explained at the suppression hearing that he was concerned about the consequences of identifying the wrong person. The actual dialogue from the body-camera footage is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer: \"[Victim] is this the guy?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Victim: \"I'm pretty sure uh I don't, [sigh] I don't want to-?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer (interrupting): \"Hey-?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Victim: \"It's the grey hoodie and poofy hair that sticks out with me. I don't [sigh]-I hate to-\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer (interrupting): \"Hey, look-\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Victim: \"It's-if I would have to say, for, yeah-the gray hoodie and the hair was sticking out in front.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   T.W. was arrested based on the victim's show-up identification.

A witness is not required to have an extended period of time to view the suspect in order for the identification to be deemed reliable; the witness just needs an opportunity.

On this point, the trial court concluded that the police officer's interruptions of the victim during the identification detracted from the certainty of the witness's identification and that the witness's explanation for why he hesitated in identifying T.W. was incredible by \"what is so clearly shown during the actual identification.\" The first conclusion, however, impermissibly combines considerations\n   relating to the suggestive nature of the identification with the witness's reliability factors under\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   , and the second provides no factual basis to support the stated reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court considered factors that are to be considered in determining whether the procedure is unduly suggestive as weighing on the reliability of the witness. The manner in which the police officers conduct the show-up identification impacts the suggestiveness of the identification procedure, the first prong of analysis.

While they were sitting in the driveway, two individuals approached the car and demanded their property. The victim stated that there was an assailant on each side of the vehicle. The victim stated that the assailant on his side of the vehicle opened his door, took his money and wallet, and demanded his phone.
