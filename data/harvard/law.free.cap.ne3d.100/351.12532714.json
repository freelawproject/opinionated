L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n </summary>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  Kurbatzky has been indicted on several counts of medical assistance fraud by a provider, in violation of G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 40, and larceny over $250, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (1). At her arraignment on July 11, 2017, she pleaded not guilty. The case against her is currently pending in the Superior Court. On February 6, 2018, she filed, in the county court, a \"motion to appeal the ruling on July 11, 2017,\" in which she argued that, in the process of indicting her, the Commonwealth failed to comply with Mass. R. Crim. P. 5, as appearing in\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20Mass.%201505\">\n   442 Mass. 1505\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2004). The single justice treated the motion as a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and denied it without a hearing.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner has named two other purported petitioners in addition to herself-Natan Zalyapin and Harmony Home Health Care, LLC. Although Kurbatzky, who is not a lawyer, is free to represent herself, she may not represent another person or entity, including Harmony Home Health Care, LLC, of which she appears to be the owner.

Rule 2:21, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n    434 Mass. 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), although she is not challenging any interlocutory ruling of the trial court. In fact, she is not challenging any specific ruling at all, but rather the validity of the indictments themselves. Regardless whether rule 2:21 applies, however, she is not entitled to relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Her remedy as to the indictments is to seek their dismissal in the trial court. Indeed, just prior to filing\n   her G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, she did just this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case does not, in short, present a situation where extraordinary relief from this court is required, and the single justice did not err or abuse his discretion in denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The case was submitted on the papers filed, accompanied by a memorandum of law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    That motion has since been denied and is not the subject of, or relevant to, this appeal. We note, in any event, that Kurbatzky is not entitled, under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to interlocutory review of the denial of the motion to dismiss. We have said repeatedly that \"[t]he denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is not appealable until after trial, and we have indicated many times that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, may not be used to circumvent that rule.\"\n    <em>\n     Bateman\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817290\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1024/#p1024\">\n     449 Mass. 1024\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1024-1025,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20N.E.2d%20606\">\n     868 N.E.2d 606\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007), quoting\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734988,734975\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/1008/\">\n     437 Mass. 1008\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1009,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%20469\">\n     770 N.E.2d 469\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002).
