Because the trial court's ruling is not a final, appealable order, we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 4, 2015, plaintiff filed a personal injury action claiming that he had been seriously injured in an automobile accident that was alleged to have been negligently caused by defendant-appellee Justin Myers. During plaintiff's deposition, his counsel objected to questioning about who had referred plaintiff to his treating physician on the basis of attorney-client privilege. After contacting the court during the deposition, the parties were informed that the questions should be answered. However, the deposition was concluded without the disputed questions being answered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Plaintiff proceeded to file a motion in limine, seeking to preclude defendant's counsel from asking any questions or attempting to elicit any answers in this context, and asserting the information is protected by the attorney-client privilege. The trial court denied the motion. The trial court determined that the questioning asked \"about a fact\" as opposed to the details of a conversation between plaintiff and his attorney, and was not protected by the attorney-client privilege. The court further found that \"the answer is relevant to the issue of potential bias and credibility of the treating physician.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Plaintiff-appellant appealed the trial court's ruling, claiming the trial court erred in its determination regarding the attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} As an initial matter, we recognize that this appeal was taken from a ruling on a motion in limine.

Cleveland Clinic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280636\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/356/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280636\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/356/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20536\">\n    89 N.E.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21 (finding that an order that compels \"the production of privileged or protected materials certainly satisfies R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(a) because it would be impossible to later obtain a judgment denying the motion to compel disclosure if the party has already disclosed the materials.\"). In my view, both judgments ultimately lead to situations R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b) seeks to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In this case, the trial court's journal entry denying appellant's motion in limine clearly sets forth the court's position that the challenged question does not implicate the protections of attorney-client privilege, \"as it is asking about a fact, not the details of a conversation between plaintiff and his attorney.\" Given the language used in the trial court's entry, I believe it would be disingenuous to suggest that the court's denial of appellant's motion in limine was not a final determination on the issue. Thus, once the challenged question is posed at trial, and counsel's objection on grounds of privilege is inevitably overruled, appellant is going to be compelled to provide an answer that may disclose information that is alleged to be protected by attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Practically, this gives me pause, particularly where, as here, the privilege arguments that will be raised in the direct appeal following a trial will be identical to the arguments currently before this court. For this reason, I believe this court has the ability, at this time, to answer the issue raised on appeal: Did defense counsel's question regarding who referred appellant to his treating physician require appellant to disclose information that is protected by attorney-client privilege? Without additional information, we can determine whether the subject question addressed in the motion in limine requires a disclosure of fact or \"seeks discovery of confidential communications constituting [his] attorney's advice regarding the lawsuit\" as appellant suggests. Dismissal of this appeal merely delays review of this issue for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} With that said, however, I am bound to follow the precedent of this court. Accordingly, I concur with the majority's dismissal.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
