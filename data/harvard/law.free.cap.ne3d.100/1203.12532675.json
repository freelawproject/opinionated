Each of the counts also carried a repeat violent offender specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 30, 2015, Columbus Police Officer Kraig Gibson was dispatched to an address on Markison Avenue, Columbus, following a report of a female \"who had been severely assaulted.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 48.) The woman told Officer Gibson that a male had forced her to the rear of a location \"a few houses from where she was staying.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 54.) Officer Gibson \"called for a squad for her to be transported to the hospital because she had bad injuries, severely bad injuries.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 48.) Other officers arrived and \"went back and found the scene.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Columbus Police Officer Joshua Jarrell and his partner, Officer Sam Moore, responded to a dispatch in the early morning hours of January 30, 2015, arriving at Markison Avenue shortly after Officer Gibson. The officers walked to the back of a vacant house and found some underwear and observed blood near a concrete stoop. The officers secured the scene until police detectives arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A.S., a 39-year-old female, resides on the west side of Columbus; in 2014 she was homeless. In January 2015, at the time of the events at issue, A.S. was staying with two friends, Dale and Connie, who had a residence near the intersection of Parsons and Markison Avenues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the early morning hours of January 30, 2015, A.S. was returning to Dale and Connie's house after visiting with a friend. While A.S. was walking through an alley, she encountered a male who asked if she was working. A.S. testified that \"[h]e questioned me and I said, 'I'm not working.' \" A.S. related that she \"kept walking and he grabbed me by my hair and punched me in my face.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 119.) The man dragged A.S. by her hair to the backyard of an abandoned house; during this time, he also punched her on the back of her head, the back of her ribs, and kicked her in the legs. A.S. was familiar with the abandoned house because she had previously slept at that location while homeless. Once in the backyard, A.S. testified that \"[t]he beating got worse, * * * the blows, the kicks, the punching in my head and my face.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 132.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The man told A.S. that he had a gun. A.S. testified that the man \"ripped my clothes off, threw it. Threw my pants, threw them. And my shoes, he threw them. Even my underwear with a maxi pad.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 132-33.) The man\n   \"[s]aid, 'Bitch, shut the fuck up.' \" A.S. \"told him [she] was cold.\" She \"started to cry and * * * said, 'Please don't do this. I have kids.' \" The man \"said, 'Bitch, shut the fuck up,' again anytime I spoke.\" A.S. stated that her \"whole face was hitting the concrete where it was ice and snow. And then he would punch me in my ribs and hit me in the back of the head again.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 133.) A.S. testified that the man then raped her \"from behind.\" After \"he was finished,\" he \"kicked [her] and also spat on [her], told [her] to count to a hundred.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 134.) The man told her if she got up he would shoot her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After the assailant left the scene, A.S. walked toward Parsons Avenue looking for a police officer. She was bleeding, and walked to the residence of her friends Dale and Connie. When she arrived, Connie \"start[ed] to cry and sa[id], 'Oh, my God, what happened?' And Dale said, 'What happened?' \" (Tr. Vol. I at 136.) They walked to a nearby fire station but were unable to locate anyone, so Dale called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A police officer arrived and asked A.S. if \"I could take him to where this happened to me and I said yes.\" Connie and Dale also walked with A.S. and the officer, \"and they started to see the blood trail.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 139.) A.S. testified that her assailant did not use a condom. When asked how a condom could have been found in the area, A.S. stated that other females \"use that place back there.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 151.) A.S. further testified that she and the father of one of her children previously engaged in sexual activity at that location, and that they would use condoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A.S. testified that she was wearing a \"maxi pad\" that evening, and that her assailant used the maxi pad \"to wipe himself off with.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 152.) Specifically, after the man told her to remain on her stomach and count to one hundred, A.S. \"watched him wipe the blood away; so I watched him pick up my underwear and use them to wipe himself off with the maxi pad.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 156.) Police officers found the maxi pad near the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A.S. was transported to Grant Hospital for a rape kit examination and treatment for her injuries. Her jaw was fractured in \"three places,\" requiring surgery, and she remained in the hospital for more than a week. (Tr. Vol. I at 140.) Police detectives subsequently interviewed A.S. and showed her a photographic array. She was unable to identify her assailant from the array. At trial, A.S. identified appellant as \"[t]he guy that raped me.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On cross-examination, A.S. stated she did not recall telling a police detective that her assailant was carrying a black semi-automatic handgun, or that he struck her with the weapon. A.S. testified that the man was dressed in black and wearing a hoodie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Columbus Police Detective Tim Hedrick is assigned to the department's sexual assault unit. Following the incident, Detective Hedrick and his partner were dispatched to Grant Hospital to speak with A.S. Detective Hedrick testified that the woman \"had been beaten, face was bloodied. She was very upset, crying [and she] could barely open her mouth to speak.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 231.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After leaving the hospital, the detectives drove to Markison Avenue and \"were able to find the yard that she was talking about,\" located in the backyard of a vacant house. (Tr. Vol. I at 234.) Detective Hedrick took photographs of the scene, and noted there was blood on the \"cement stoop.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 240.) Detectives collected a maxi pad from the stoop, and they also found a condom in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Detective Hedrick testified that appellant became a suspect in the case and detectives subsequently interviewed him and obtained buccal swabs from him. At trial, Detective Hedrick identified state's exhibit G as an array of six photographs prepared as part of the investigation. When shown the array by detectives, A.S. did not definitively identify any individuals. On cross-examination, Detective Hedrick testified that A.S. indicated her assailant struck her with a pistol during the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Carrie Jackson, a registered nurse, is coordinator of the sexual assault program at Grant Medical Center. On January 30, 2015, Jackson performed an examination of A.S. at Grant Hospital. A.S. informed Jackson that her assailant was a black male \"unknown to her, stranger.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 36.) A.S. stated that he penetrated her vagina and ejaculated. During the interview, A.S. related that the man had a weapon. When asked by the nurse if her assailant used a condom, A.S. initially told the nurse that the man did have a condom; later, however, when asked to recount the events, A.S. stated that no condom was used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Regarding the incident, A.S. informed Jackson that she was \"walking from my girl's house and I was cutting through the alley so nobody would see me and think I was a working girl. When I got to Parsons and Welch and I was about to cut through the alley, that's when I saw him.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 42.) A.S. related that her assailant was \"standing by the funeral home and yelled after me and asked, 'What are you doing out here, are you working.' I told him, no, I wasn't and to leave me alone.\" A.S. stated she \"went into the alley and then I heard what sounded like sprinting and he was behind me. He grabbed me by my hair and my sweatshirt and dragged me behind this house. He was whaling on me.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 43.) A.S. further stated: \"He hit me all up and down my back. He hit me in the face and head. I was kind of foggy from being hit so hard.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 43-44.) A.S. told the nurse that the man then ripped off her coat, pants, and shoes. A.S. further related: \"He ripped my bra in half. He jerked me by my legs from behind so I would be on my knees and he raped me doggy style (clarifies rape as his penis into her vagina). He came in me, no condom. He pulled out and tried to wipe it off.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} At trial, Jackson identified photographs taken of A.S. at the time of the examination. Jackson noted injuries to A.S.'s face and mouth, including redness, swelling and bruising, as well as swelling to her hand and redness to both legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Logan Schepeler, a forensic scientist with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\"), tested the rape kit that the Columbus Police Department submitted to BCI as part of the investigation. According to Schepeler, \"semen was identified from the vaginal and perianal samples from the rape kit.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 100.) A single sperm cell was also collected from the underwear of A.S., and semen was obtained from a condom collected at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Devonie Herdeman, a forensic scientist with BCI, performed DNA analysis with respect to samples submitted from A.S. and appellant. Herdeman testified that the BCI laboratory \"tested the vaginal and perianal samples and those were found to be a mixture of [A.S.] as well as Frederick Madden.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 142.) Testing performed on a condom found at the scene revealed a mixture for A.S. and an unknown male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Following deliberations, the jury returned verdicts finding appellant guilty of rape, felonious assault, and kidnapping. The trial court made a separate finding of guilt with respect to the repeat violent\n   offender specification. By entry filed March 17, 2016, the trial court sentenced appellant to a total of 39 years incarceration, and the court adjudicated him a Tier III sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following three assignments of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I. The prosecutor denied Madden his right to a fair trial and an impartial jury, by asserting that the only eyewitness to the events Madden was being prosecuted for, was \"credible,\" \"believable,\" and \"reliable,\" and by inundating the jury with references to her as the \"victim\" during trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   II. Madden's convictions should be reversed because Appellant's trial counsel was deficient at trial, with resulting prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   III. Prosecutorial misconduct through vouching and saturating the trial with references to his key witness as the \"victim,\" linked with defense counsel's ineffective performance, resulted in cumulative error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Under the first assignment of error, appellant argues the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by improperly referring to the state's primary witness as a \"victim\" throughout the trial. Appellant also contends the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of that witness during opening statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, \"the test for appellate courts is whether the prosecutor's conduct was improper, and if so, whether that conduct prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. McDowell\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 10AP-509,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-6815\">\n    2011-Ohio-6815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206930332\">\n    2011 WL 6930332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33. A claim of prosecutorial misconduct \"will not be grounds for reversal unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206930332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A reviewing court considers allegations of prosecutorial misconduct \"in the context of the entire trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Muhleka\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. No. 19827,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-1822\">\n    2004-Ohio-1822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20759249\">\n    2004 WL 759249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 84. Further, \"[w]here it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have found the defendant guilty even absent the alleged misconduct, the defendant has not been prejudiced, and the conviction will not be reversed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20759249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} At the outset, we note that defense counsel did not object to any of the comments claimed by appellant to be improper. Accordingly, appellant has \"waived any error on that issue on appeal except for plain error.\"\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. In order \"to be 'plain' within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B) an error must: (1) be a deviation from a legal rule; (2) be plain or obvious, i.e., an obvious defect in the trial proceedings; and (3) have affected a substantial right in that it affected the outcome of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20759249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant first contends the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by consistently referring to A.S. as the \"victim.\" Appellant cites to various pages of the trial transcript in which a reference to victim is made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} A review of the record indicates that the majority of the references to \"victim\" cited by appellant were not made by the prosecutor but, rather, by law enforcement officers testifying about the investigation. Specifically, the references at issue occurred during the testimonies of Officers Gibson, Christopher Hostettler, and Detective Hedrick. By way of example, Officer Gibson testified that he responded to the scene in which \"a female * * * had been severely assaulted. We responded to that scene and made contact with the caller and the female victim at that time.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 48.) Similarly, Officer Hostettler testified that he responded to the scene and spoke with a \"male and to the victim.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 90.) Detective Hedrick, when discussing in general how he becomes involved\n   in an investigation, testified that \"[a] lot of times victims will go to the hospital on their own and we will respond directly to the hospital.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 217-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} A review of the record indicates that, in context, the law enforcement officers in most of the instances were referring to the \"victim\" as a complainant. We also note there was no dispute that the individual at issue, A.S., had suffered physical harm, including a broken jaw, as a result of the incident. As noted by plaintiff-appellee, the State of Ohio, defense counsel acknowledged this fact during opening statement, stating to the jury that A.S. was taken to Grant Hospital on the morning of January 30, 2015. Defense counsel further stated: \"She was beat up. There's no question about it. We're going to agree and stipulate her physical and medical evidence.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} While the majority of the references to \"victim\" were made by law enforcement personnel, we note several instances in which the prosecutor utilized the term \"victim.\" For instance, in questioning Detective Hedrick about his general investigative procedures, the prosecutor inquired: \"So is that what you do, you go and interview the victim for the first time?\" (Tr. Vol. I at 219.) The prosecutor further inquired: \"Do you often then end up interviewing the victim for a second time at some point in your investigation?\" (Tr. Vol. I at 220.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} This court has noted that \"[a] 'victim' is a 'person harmed by a crime, tort, or other wrong.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v. Morock,\n   </em>\n   10th Dist. No. 14AP-559,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3152\">\n    2015-Ohio-3152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204660026\">\n    2015 WL 4660026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25, citing\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th Ed.2014). Similarly, it has been held that use of the term \" 'victim' is not the same as expressing an opinion that the defendant was guilty of a crime; the term 'victim applies to anyone who suffers either as a result of ruthless design or incidentally or accidentally.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

At issue in\n   <em>\n    Almedom\n   </em>\n   was whether a crime took place, i.e., whether the defendant had sexual conduct with girls under the age of 13. Further, under the facts of\n   <em>\n    Almedom,\n   </em>\n   \"the trial court judge consistently referred to the girls as 'victims,' \" which this court deemed analogous to \"telling the members of the jury that the girls were truthful when they claimed that sexual abuse occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. By contrast, in the present case there was no dispute that A.S. was physically assaulted and seriously injured, and the record contains no victim references by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Here, where the fact of an assault was not in dispute, and where the witnesses used the term \"victim\" as synonymous with complainant and did not express an opinion as to appellant's guilt, the record does not show plain error as a result of the references to \"victim\" during the testimony of law enforcement officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   at 24-25, ;\n   <em>\n    Wigg\n   </em>\n   at 70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845709\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/179/65/#p70\">\n    889 A.2d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, appellant contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to comments by the prosecutor during opening statement vouching for the complaining witness, and in failing to object to the prosecutor's repeated references to that witness as a victim. Appellant also argues deficient performance by trial counsel in failing to object to the introduction of hearsay testimony of the state's complaining witness, and to the prosecutor's introduction of inflammatory testimony as to why A.S. left the courtroom during the middle of her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Under Ohio law, performance of trial counsel will not be deemed ineffective unless and until such performance \"is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel's performance.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Having found that the prosecutor did not improperly vouch for the witness during opening statement or that such comments affected the outcome of the trial, appellant cannot demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel's failure to object to those remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Similarly, in addressing appellant's claim of prosecutorial misconduct with respect to references at trial to the complaining witness as a \"victim,\" we found no plain error. As noted, the majority of the references were in the context of\n   law enforcement officers referring to the complainant as a victim, and the evidence was undisputed that A.S. suffered physical injury as a result of the incident. Under these circumstances, counsel's failure to object did not constitute deficient performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morock\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25 (where evidence showed individual suffered a wrong, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge use of word \"victim\" by prosecutor and witness).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant also claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to inadmissible hearsay evidence; specifically, purported statements of A.S. made during the testimony of Officer Gibson, the first officer dispatched to the scene. Appellant argues that the prosecutor adduced testimony from the officer describing the substance of A.S.'s allegations, i.e., that a male had forced her to the back of an unknown location, hit her several times, and raped her. Appellant contends the statements were inadmissible hearsay because the officer was testifying to out-of-court statements made by the complaining witness to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In response, the state argues the officer's testimony was not offered to prove that A.S.'s out-of-court statements were true but, rather, to explain the officer's conduct in looking for evidence at the abandoned house and to reveal how the sexual assault squad became involved in the investigation. The state further argues that, had an objection been made, the state likely would have been able to establish the necessary foundation to admit the statements as excited utterances of a rape victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 47} This court has previously noted that, to the extent a victim's statements are offered to explain the conduct of an officer, such statements are \"not admitted for the truth of what the victim stated and are admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defense counsel may have deemed the actions by the trial court adequate under the circumstances, and counsel may have made a tactical decision not to object to the response of A.S. to avoid drawing further attention to the remark.
