Janis, D.P.M., and Total Foot and Ankle of Ohio, Inc. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Timothy worked as a golf professional for the Reid Park Golf Course in Springfield, Ohio. He became a member of the Professional Golf Association in 2008. He married Meredith in 2000. Timothy testified that he began experiencing pain and stiffness in his ankle in 2005 or 2006. Timothy went to see his family physician, Alper Sarihan, M.D., regarding the ankle pain, and Dr. Sarihan ordered an MRI of Timothy's ankle. According to Timothy, Jeffrey Gittins, D.O., reviewed the resulting\n   images and concluded that Timothy had a lesion on his ankle, and he recommended the removal of the lesion arthroscopically. Dr. Gittins told Timothy that he could \"drill some holes into [his] bone where the bad bone used to be, and that would bleed and form a material that would act as [his] cartilage in that joint area.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 605-06.) Timothy testified that the surgery \"seemed like a good idea. It was an opportunity to try to stay out in front of the issue that was starting.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 606.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to Timothy, the surgery \"[s]eemed to work for a while,\" but by the end of the next golf season, the ankle became \"more irritated again.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 607.) When Timothy went back to see Dr. Gittins, he recommended trying the surgery again. Timothy elected to get a second opinion so he went to back to Dr. Sarihan. As a result of his appointment with Dr. Sarihan, Timothy was referred to Dr. Janis at Total Foot and Ankle of Ohio, Inc. Timothy remembers little about his first visit with Dr. Janis other than Dr. Janis using the terms \"bone graft\" and \"good bone.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 610.) According to Timothy, when he went back to see Dr. Janis a second time, Dr. Janis described the surgical procedure he recommended as follows: \"He would go in and open up the ankle joint in that area and take the cadaver bone and take a piece of it out of the cadaver and cut out the bad bone that I still had inside my joint and replace it.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 611.) Timothy did not recall Dr. Janis ever mentioning that he intended to work on Timothy's ligaments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Dr. Janis subsequently performed a surgical procedure on Timothy's ankle. Timothy testified that several months after the surgery, he experienced no improvement in either the range of motion or functionality of his ankle, even though he had faithfully undertaken a course of physical therapy. Timothy testified that the pain and stiffness in his ankle worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} According to Timothy, Dr. Janis informed him that an MRI showed he now had a lesion on both sides of his ankle bone. Timothy testified that Dr. Janis raised the subject of total ankle replacement surgery. Timothy did not know that such a procedure could be performed on the ankle joint. Timothy testified that Dr. Janis told him the total ankle replacement\"would alleviate the pain and give me more mobility, give me more of the lifestyle that I wanted to still lead at that age.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 618.) Dr. Janis also told Timothy that ankle fusion surgery was an option, but Timothy rejected that course of treatment because it would permanently limit his ankle flexibility and functionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After reviewing the information regarding total ankle replacements on Dr. Janis's website and other websites, Timothy elected to have total ankle replacement surgery. In November 2009, Dr. Janis performed total ankle replacement surgery on Timothy's left ankle, using a Salto Talaris prosthesis. Timothy testified that after the surgery and following the completion of physical therapy, \"it was almost like my ankle was locked in place and it hurt 100 percent of the day. * * * I thought I knew what pain was until I had this done. * * * I was taking eight Vicodin a day just to get through the day.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 621-22.) When Dr. Janis was subsequently unable to provide any relief for Timothy's increasing ankle pain and lack of flexibility, Timothy went back to Dr. Sarihan seeking a referral to another physician. Dr. Sarihan referred Timothy to Ethan Thompson, an orthopedic surgeon in Springfield, Ohio. Dr. Thompson took x-rays of Timothy's ankle and then referred him to Gregory Berlet, M.D. Dr. Berlet specialized in ankle surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After consulting with Dr. Berlet, Timothy agreed to undergo surgical revision of his ankle prosthesis. Dr. Berlet replaced the Salto Talaris prosthesis installed by Dr. Janis with a device known as an INBONE prosthesis. According to Timothy, after healing from the surgery performed by Dr. Berlet, \"[t]he pain was not nearly as bad as it was. I stopped taking all of the big pain medications. The movement seemed to be a lot better, and when I moved, I didn't fall down or anything like that. I seemed to be stable.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 626.) Timothy testified that after the revision with Dr. Berlet, his ankle improved \"in all aspects, going to the mall, walking down the mall, walking at the zoo with the kids or the family.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 627.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 15, 2011, appellants filed a complaint against Dr. Janis and Total Foot and Ankle of Ohio, Inc., alleging medical negligence, lack of informed consent, and loss of consortium. On November 3, 2011, the trial court dismissed the complaint, without prejudice, due to appellants' failure to file an affidavit of merit as required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2). (Compl. at 2.) On November 2, 2012, appellants refiled their complaint against Dr. Janis and Total Foot and Ankle of Ohio, Inc., alleging the same claims. The affidavit of Jonathan J. Paley, M.D., is attached to the refiled complaint as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On May 9, 2016, the parties tried the case to a jury. The jury found in favor of appellants and awarded damages against appellees of $140,000 for Timothy and $10,000 for Meredith. The parties submitted three interrogatories to the jury, including an interrogatory which asked the jurors to \"specifically list the act(s) of negligence which you state Dr. Janis committed.\" (Jury Interrog. No. 2, filed May 19, 2016.) All seven jurors answered the interrogatory as follows: \"Deviation from standard of care with malplacement of a total ankle replacement in a 33-year-old patient.\" (Jury Interrog. No. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 24, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry in accordance with the jury verdict. On June 21, 2016, appellees filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\") pursuant to Civ.R. 54. Appellants filed a motion for prejudgment interest, pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C), on that same date. On August 26, 2016, the trial court issued a decision granting appellees' motion for JNOV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On September 13, 2016, the trial court issued both a \"Final Judgment Entry\" in favor of appellees, and a judgment entry denying, as moot, appellants' motion for prejudgment interest. On October 11, 2016, appellants filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59. Appellants' arguments in support of their motion for new trial focused on the trial testimony of Dr. Berlet. According to appellants, appellees' trial counsel and Dr. Berlet's own private counsel improperly influenced Dr. Berlet's trial testimony. More particularly, appellants alleged that these lawyers discouraged Dr. Berlet from providing an expert opinion at trial regarding the applicable standard of care, whether Dr. Janis breached that standard of care, and proximate cause. On December 2, 2016, the trial court issued a decision and entry denying appellants' motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On January 1, 2017, appellants filed a notice of appeal to this court from the following trial court judgments: \"the September 13, 2016\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   , finalizing the Decision Granting Defendants' Motion For Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict that was rendered on August 26, 2016 [and] the\n   <em>\n    Decision &amp; Entry Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for New Trial\n   </em>\n   , filed * * * December 2, 2016.\" (Emphasis sic.) (Notice of Appeal at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellants assign the following as trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court reversed the jury verdict and granted defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} A motion for JNOV is governed by Civ.R. 50(B), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Whether or not a motion to direct a verdict has been made or overruled and not later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment, a party may serve a motion to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party's motion. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If a verdict was returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment. If the judgment is reopened, the court shall either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment, but no judgment shall be rendered by the court on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment or may order a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The test applied by a trial court in ruling on a motion for JNOV is the same test to be applied on a motion for a directed verdict.\n   <em>\n    Kenner v.

Pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(b), an appellate court must \"[d]etermine the appeal on its merits on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs under App.R. 16, the record on appeal under App.R. 9, and, unless waived, the oral argument under App.R. 21.\" Here, appellants' sole assignment of error makes no reference to trial court error regarding the denial of appellees' motion for new trial. Neither\n   appellants' merit brief nor their reply brief make any argument regarding the trial court's ruling on their motion for new trial. Furthermore, appellees' counsel did not address the issue at oral argument. Accordingly, we find that appellants have abandoned the appeal from the December 2, 2016 judgment, and we shall not address the propriety of the trial court's ruling on appellees' motion for new trial in this appeal.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

If the maxim, 'Res ipsa loquitur,' were applicable to a case like this, and a failure to cure were held to be evidence, however slight, of negligence on the part of the physician or surgeon causing the bad result, few would be courageous enough to practice the healing art, for they would have to assume financial liability for nearly all the 'ills that flesh is heir to.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ewing v.

No. 2.) In granting appellees' motion for JNOV, the trial court concluded that because appellants failed to present the testimony of a medical expert in order to establish the applicable standard of care, the evidence presented by appellants was insufficient to support the jury verdict in appellants' favor. The trial court further concluded that because appellants failed to present the testimony of a medical expert in order to establish an alleged deviation from the applicable standard of care by Dr. Janis proximately caused harm to appellants, the evidence presented by appellants was insufficient to support the jury verdict in their favor. We agree with the trial court's analysis and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellees called Stephen Conti, M.D., as their expert witness in this case. Dr. Conti testified that he is an orthopedic surgeon licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania and Ohio and that he has been board certified in orthopedic surgery since 1994. He estimated that he has performed more than 1,000 total ankle replacement surgeries in his career and that he continues to perform such procedures on a weekly basis. According to Dr. Conti, orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists have been performing total ankle replacement surgery for approximately 20 years, and the technology has continued to develop over that time. Dr. Conti first began performing total ankle replacement surgery in the mid-90's, with a prosthetic device that he helped develop. When that device went off the market in 2010, Dr. Conti began using other devices including the Salto Talaris prosthesis used by Dr. Janis in this case and the INBONE prosthesis used by Dr. Berlet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Prior to giving testimony in this matter, Dr. Conti reviewed the medical records relating to Timothy's treatment with Dr. Sarihan, Dr. Gittins, Dr. Janis, and Dr. Berlet, as well as the hospital records from the various surgical procedures performed on Timothy's ankle. He also reviewed the deposition testimony of Timothy, Dr. Janis, Dr. Berlet, and physical\n   therapist Mark Main. Dr. Conti testified that in 2005 and 2006, Timothy suffered from ostechondritis diseccans (\"OCD lesion\") affecting the talus bone, which is located in the lower leg below the tibia. Dr. Conti stated that the ankle is located between the tibia and the talus. Dr. Conti described Timothy's OCD lesion as a small area of dead bone at the top of the talus, about the size of a pencil eraser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Dr. Conti testified that curing the lesion was the goal of the surgical procedures performed by Dr. Gittins, as well as the first surgery performed by Dr. Janis. According to Dr. Conti, after the curative surgical procedures had failed, Timothy had the following options: (1) do nothing and live with the pain and stiffness in his ankle, (2) total ankle replacement surgery, and (3) ankle fusion surgery. Dr. Conti testified that it was reasonable for Dr. Janis to discuss the possibility of total ankle replacement with Timothy after the curative surgical procedures had failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Dr. Conti described total ankle replacement surgery using the Salto Talaris prosthesis. He stated that device includes a metal component which is attached to the tibia, a component that is attached to the talus, with a prosthetic ankle joint between the two, consisting of both metal and plastic parts. Dr. Conti testified that the surgeon visually determines where to drill into the tibia to attach the Salto Talaris prosthesis. The surgeon then makes the incision and drills into the tibia with the aid of a block and jig. According to Dr. Conti, the instruments used by surgeons when installing a total ankle replacement are still \"crude\" when compared to the instruments used in hip or knee replacement procedures, \"but this is standard of what we are currently using.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 475.) He also stated that the medical community is \"still learning, * * * still kind of in our infancy, and some things go well and some things go poorly.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 476.) Dr. Conti testified \"patients that have [a] seemingly well done total ankle, but still hurt * * * on the inside and the outside parts of the ankle.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 476-77.) According to Dr. Conti, the range of acceptable error in regard to the positioning of the Salto Talaris prosthesis as it is attached to the tibia is one to three millimeters. Dr. Conti testified that x-rays taken of Timothy's ankle following the total ankle replacement surgery performed by Dr. Janis do not show a prosthetic ankle joint that is \"mechanically blocked because it has been put in too high as compared to the native joint line.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 488.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} On direct examination, Dr. Conti further opined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. Just to finish up, do you have an opinion whether Dr. Janis in any fashion departed from accepted standards of care in his care and treatment of his patient, Timothy Grieser?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. So my opinion is he did not deviate from any accepted standards of care. In fact, he provided [Timothy] with exceptional care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. And do you have an opinion, again based on reasonable medical certainty, whether any action or inaction of Dr. Leonard Janis directly and proximately caused harm to his patient, Timothy Grieser?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. My opinion is he did not cause harm to Mr. Grieser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 3 at 501.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellants concede that Ohio law required them to produce expert medical\n   testimony in order to support a jury verdict in their favor. Appellants do not claim that the standard of care in the orthopedic surgical community applicable to the implantation procedure for the Salto Talaris prosthesis is a matter within the common knowledge of laypersons. Appellants argue, however, that the testimony of Dr. Berlet, when construed in their favor, provides sufficient support for the jury's determination that Dr. Janis breached the standard of care. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Dr. Berlet testified that he is licensed to practice medicine in Ohio and that he achieved board certification in orthopedic surgery in 1994. Dr. Berlet indicated that he was testifying in the trial of this matter as Timothy's treating physician, not as a paid expert witness for appellants. Dr. Berlet also acknowledged at trial that he did not review the medical records produced by Dr. Janis or those produced by physical therapist Mark Main prior to his giving testimony in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Dr. Berlet's primary criticism of Dr. Janis's treatment of Timothy was that Dr. Janis attached the tibial section of the Salto Talaris prosthesis too high on the tibia, causing an impingement of the prosthetic ankle joint and resulting in stiffness and pain in the ankle. In Dr. Berlet's notes concerning his initial treatment of Timothy's ankle, Dr. Berlet indicated that x-rays taken at his direction showed that the Salto Talaris prosthesis was \"malpositioned.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 375.) Dr. Berlet acknowledged, however, that whether the surgeon is using the Salto Talaris prosthesis or the INBONE prosthesis, \"the most complicated part of this operation is lining it up and deciding where to do the bone cut.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 359.) He also acknowledged on cross-examination that an operative report indicates that adequate range of motion in the prosthetic ankle joint was confirmed by anatomic fluoroscopy immediately following the installation of the Salto Talaris prosthesis by Dr. Janis. Though Dr. Berlet stated that he \"would tend to disagree\" with the operative note, he acknowledged that the development of scar tissue post-operatively could affect range of motion and that he \"saw this patient some six to eight months later, so that there is a lot of things that can happen in the meantime.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 382-83.) On direct examination, Dr. Berlet never offered testimony in the form of an opinion regarding the applicable standard of care in the medical specialty community, nor did Dr. Berlet testify that, in his opinion, Dr. Janis deviated from that standard of care in his treatment of Timothy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellants maintain that Dr. Berlet's testimony on redirect examination regarding a treatment note he authored following his first office visit with Timothy provides the expert opinion necessary to sustain the jury verdict. On redirect examination, Dr. Berlet testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. And finally, in No. 4 of your impression part of the note, you described the persistent pain, and that was a problem that you had to deal with, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. Thank you. And in the plan portion of that note, you wrote: \"Mr. Grieser and I had a very good conversation about what it means to put a joint replacement in a 33-year-old.\" Do you remember writing that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. \"It is certainly not the standard of care, although it can be done. It has to be with a very clear recognition from the client that this will not last their life and ultimately will require some revisions. It seems that this conversation really had not happened with Dr. Janis.\" Do you remember writing that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. So the context is important. The standard I am referring to is the one we\n   discussed earlier. If we are in a room of orthopedic surgeons discussing this case, it would be highly unlikely that would be the option recommended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. And that is your opinion, and not merely to a probability, but based upon all of your skill and training and knowledge and experience to a reasonable certainty, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 2 at 376-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Dr. Berlet also referred to Dr. Janis's decision to perform a total ankle replacement on an active 33-year-old patient as, \"in an orthopedic context, * * * unconventional.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 347.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 33} As previously noted, the parties submitted three interrogatories to the jury, including an interrogatory which asked the jurors to \"specifically list the act(s) of negligence which you state Dr. Janis committed.\" (Jury Interrog.

No. 2.) Even when viewed in a light most favorable to appellants, Dr. Berlet's testimony cannot reasonably be construed as an opinion regarding the standard of care in the field of orthopedic surgery with regard to the placement of the Salto Talaris prosthesis during total ankle replacement surgery. Though Dr. Berlet is clearly qualified to express an opinion in this regard, absent his expression of such an opinion, the jury was left to speculate whether a podiatrist of ordinary skill, care, and diligence in the field of orthopedic ankle replacement surgery would not have positioned the Salto Talaris prosthesis as Dr. Janis did. Dr. Berlet's subjective opinion that the Salto Talaris prosthesis was malpositioned on the tibia does not equate to an opinion regarding the applicable standard of care in the medical specialty community. Similarly, we disagree with appellants' claim that Dr. Berlet's testimony supports a finding that Dr. Janis breached the standard of care by performing total ankle replacement surgery on a 33-year-old patient, Dr. Berlet's testimony was not the basis on which the jury found Dr. Janis had breached this standard of care. Moreover, there is no dispute that following the total ankle replacement surgery performed by Dr. Janis, Timothy elected to undergo a second total ankle replacement with Dr. Berlet, rather than opting for ankle fusion surgery. Accordingly, we find that the above-cited testimony from Dr. Berlet,\n   when construed in appellants' favor, does not satisfy appellants' burden of producing an expert opinion regarding the standard of care and does not successfully rebut the arguments in favor of granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This being the case, the record does not contain substantial, competent evidence in support of the jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Even if we were to conclude that Dr. Berlet's trial testimony qualifies as an expert opinion regarding an applicable standard of care, when appellees' trial counsel asked Dr. Berlet whether he was offering an expert medical opinion regarding standard of care, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q.

To \"recant\" is to \"[t]o withdraw or renounce (prior statements or testimony) formally or publicly.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1459 (10th Ed.2014). To \"negate\" is \"1. To deny. 2. To nullify; to render ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's\n   </em>\n   at 1195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In this instance, rather than simply contradicting or retreating from a prior opinion he had given regarding the standard of care, Dr. Berlet insisted that he had not offered any such opinion during his direct examination and that it was not his intention to do so. The conclusion to be drawn from Dr. Berlet's testimony on cross-examination is that Dr. Berlet negated and/or recanted any prior\n   opinion he may have rendered regarding the recognized standard of care applicable to the care and treatment of Timothy. Thus, to the extent that Dr. Berlet's testimony on direct examination could be construed as an expression of his expert opinion regarding the applicable standard of care and Dr. Janis's breach thereof, Dr. Berlet expressly recanted any such opinion on cross-examination. In our view, Dr. Berlet's unequivocal testimony on cross-examination effectively negated any standard of care opinion he may have provided during his direct examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellants counter that Dr. Berlet \"affirmed on re-direct\" opinions he had given during his direct examination. (Appellants' Reply Brief at 10.) Appellants cite the following testimony as evidence that Dr. Berlet did render expert opinion testimony regarding the standard of care:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. [Y]our testimony here today is clearly as an expert because you are not a lay person, it is an expert that possesses higher knowledge, skill, training and expertise, and you know that the jury will accept your testimony as an expert?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. Okay. And it is in that spirit that you are here today to talk about what you know and about your observations and opinions that have been recorded in the records?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 2 at 402.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In our view, the testimony on which appellants rely is merely Dr. Berlet's acknowledgment that he possesses the knowledge, skill, training, and experience in orthopedic surgery necessary to qualify him as an expert. Appellees' argument, however, is not that Dr. Berlet lacks the necessary qualifications to offer an expert opinion regarding the applicable standard of care but, rather, that Dr. Berlet did not offer any such opinion in this case. Nothing in his redirect examination rehabilitates him after he stated on cross-examination, \"I am not providing standard of care testimony.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 378.) We agree with appellees. Contrary to appellants' assertion, it is not reasonable to construe Dr. Berlet's testimony on redirect as an affirmation of a previously expressed opinion regarding the applicable standard of care, even if he had offered such an opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court found, alternatively, that appellants did not produce expert testimony to support the jury determination that a failure by Dr. Janis to meet the applicable standard of care in his treatment of Timothy proximately caused appellants' harm. When appellees' trial counsel asked Dr. Berlet whether he had an opinion regarding the cause of Timothy's loss of flexibility in his ankle joint and the ankle pain experienced by Timothy following his treatment with Dr. Janis, Dr. Berlet gave the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. * * * Just a couple of questions. At deposition you testified that you make no opinion as to the cause of this patient's ankle pain, either medial or lateral, either side of the foot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. Maybe you can put a time context to that statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. I can show you the testimony, in fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. I asked you if you would make an opinion about the reason for his lateral pain, meaning pain on the outside of his foot, and the answer was, \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \"Do you make any opinion about the reason for any of this pain, whether lateral or medial?\" And the answer was, \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"He went into the situation with pain?\" And the answer: \"Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"His pain complaints go back to 2005 or so, don't they?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \"Yes. The relevant part is he is able to continue to function.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Do you agree with that testimony today, Doctor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. I do. I also bring up my earlier testimony is that I concluded that his pain was mechanical pain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. Have you ever seen the records of Dr. Janis or the physical therapist up to whatever bits you have been shown today, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (Tr.

Given Dr. Berlet's acknowledgment that Timothy had experienced stiffness and pain in his ankle joint both prior to and following his treatment with Dr. Janis, and Dr. Berlet's admission that patients may still experience ankle pain even though an ankle prosthesis is properly positioned, it was imperative for appellants to present the testimony of a medical expert to support appellants' claim that Timothy's complaints of ankle pain and stiffness following the surgical procedure performed by Dr. Janis were caused, in whole or in part, by Dr. Janis's failure to meet the applicable standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stamper\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hitch\n   </em>\n   . Though Dr. Berlet testified that the pain experienced by Timothy following the total ankle replacement surgery with Dr. Janis was \"mechanical pain,\" he did not testify to a reasonable degree of medical probability that the pain and stiffness of Timothy's ankle were caused by the negligence of Dr. Janis.
