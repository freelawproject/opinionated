Three codefendants, Anthony Barrow, Timothy Watson, and Lonnie Rucker, were also indicted for the kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Buck filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court denied. Buck and Barrow were tried together. The jury found Buck guilty of kidnapping, but acquitted him of the gun specifications and the weapon-under-disability charge. The trial court sentenced Buck to 11 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Buck now appeals. In six assignments of error, he challenges: (1) the denial of his motion to suppress; (2) the denial of his rights to due process by the prosecutor; (3) the denial of his rights to due process by the trial court; (4) the admission of certain photographs; (5) his sentence; and (6) the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. We conclude that the court committed reversible error when it failed to properly award jail-time credit, but we affirm the trial court's judgment in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Buck's Motion to Suppress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Buck argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. He contends that the court failed to apply the appropriate legal standard when it determined that exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search of his person and his apartment, and the search of the contents of his cell phone. He asserts that the exigent-circumstances exception to the requirement for a warrant requires both probable cause and exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

They warned Kellam that if he failed to pay the ransom money, George would be killed. In one of the ransom calls, George told Kellam that the kidnappers had shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} By 10:00 p.m., Kellam worked with Detective Hilbert and other investigators who monitored every ransom call made by the kidnappers to Kellam. During the night of the 6th and the morning of the 7th, Kellam received numerous ransom calls from two different men who continually made threats to hurt or kill George. Throughout the night, the police covertly worked with Kellam so that it would appear to the kidnappers that Kellam was complying with their demands. After several hours, however, the police became concerned that the kidnappers suspected police involvement and that they would act on their threats to kill George.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At one point, the kidnappers demanded that Kellam meet them at a Shell gas station at Colerain Avenue and Hopple Street. Two undercover officers, one of whom dressed like Kellam, drove Kellam's car to the Shell station and parked at the\n   agreed meeting place. For the next two and a half to three hours, the kidnappers demanded in multiple phone calls to Kellam that he move his vehicle to different locations, but Kellam, at the instruction of the police, told the kidnappers he would not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Then Detective Hilbert instructed the undercover officers in Kellam's car to drive it around the block. As they did so, the kidnappers, who were speaking to Kellam on the phone, identified a nearby street by name and told Kellam to change lanes immediately. With that, Detective Hilbert knew that the kidnappers were conducting counter-surveillance to the police surveillance on both the Shell station and on Kellam's car. The fact that the kidnappers had the foresight to operate in that manner heightened police concern for George's safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} According to Detective Hilbert, the police still had no idea where George was. Hoping that George was somewhere near the Shell station, police were looking for suspicious things in that area. Hilbert said, \"[O]ur number one goal right then [was] to find Mr. George and find him alive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The police identified two telephone numbers from which ransom calls had been made to Kellam's phone, one of which was (513) 498-2051, and made an \"emergency exigent request\" to Cincinnati Bell for records pertaining to that number. In addition, Cincinnati Police Officer Timothy Bley of the fugitive-apprehension unit testified that his unit had \"access to a lot of computer programs and databases that the average police officer wouldn't have access to and we use those sometimes to track people [and] try to locate them.\" He testified that on the morning of February 7, 2014, using information from various databases, police were able to track phone calls to (513) 498-2051, and \"by tracking those people backwards,\" were able to identify Buck as the user of the cell phone. This involved linking people and their connections to each other by the use of various databases. In analyzing this information, the police were able to connect Buck as the user of the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Police identified Buck's address as 2872 Montana Avenue, Apartment 4, and learned that the (513) 498-2051 phone was \"pinging\" from a nearby cell tower that morning. Police knew that recovery of that phone was vital to locating George, and that the delay necessitated by the process of obtaining a search warrant could have impaired police attempts to locate George and could have placed George in greater danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Officer Bley and other officers went to Buck's apartment and knocked on the door. Buck answered the door. He was alone in the apartment. Officers entered the apartment to look for George to make sure that he \"wasn't lying inside tied up or anything like that.\" George was not inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Police recovered a cell phone from Buck, and dialed (513) 498-2051 to ensure that it was the phone that they were looking for. Buck's cell phone rang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Meanwhile, during the time that police officers were at Buck's apartment, Kellam was at the police station on the phone with another one of the kidnappers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Police officers took Buck and his phone to Detective Hilbert at the homicide unit. The police asked Buck for his assistance in locating George, but Buck would not cooperate. In speaking with Buck, Detective Hilbert recognized Buck's voice from the numerous ransom calls he had monitored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} At that point, police still did not know where George was, but they were aware that a second kidnapper was still contacting Kellam for ransom money. Detective\n   Hilbert believed that the danger to George had increased: \"[W]e were pretty desperate at that point.\" So the police made another emergency request to Cincinnati Bell to download electronic data from Buck's cell phone. According to Detective Hilbert, the police were concerned that obtaining a search warrant would cost valuable time and might increase the danger to George. The detective testified that \"every second counted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Warrantless Search of Buck and His Home.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Buck first argues that exigent circumstances did not justify the warrantless search of Buck and his apartment. \"[W]arrants are generally required to search a person's home or his person unless the 'exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Brigham City v.

The exigency did not evaporate upon the recovery of Buck's cell phone and his arrest. On the\n   contrary, those circumstances led the police to believe that the peril to the kidnapping victim had increased because a second kidnapper was still trying to negotiate a ransom from Kellam and would surely discover that his accomplice was in police custody. The police had probable cause to search the cell phone under these exigent circumstances and the exigent circumstances had not abated (which would have required a warrant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Consequently, we hold that the trial court properly concluded that the warrantless searches of Buck, his home, and his cell phone were justified by exigent circumstances. We overrule the first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weight and Sufficiency of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} For ease of discussion, we address the remaining assignments of error out of order. In his sixth assignment of error, Buck argues that his conviction for kidnapping was against the manifest weight of the evidence and based upon insufficient evidence. Buck does not claim that the state failed to prove that the kidnapping of George occurred. Rather, he asserts that the state failed to prove that he was involved in the kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 29}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evidence Presented at Trial.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   At the jury trial, the state presented the testimony of Tyrell George, his brother Timothy Kellam, codefendant Lonnie Rucker, a telephone-records custodian, forensic specialists, and multiple investigators, including Detective Hilbert and Officer Bley, in addition to numerous exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Telephone records revealed that on the morning of February 6, 2014, Buck and his codefendant Anthony Barrow communicated about 20 times, and in one text, Buck had asked Barrow, \"Babysitter still on dek?\" The term babysitter referred to a person who watched over a kidnapped victim to make sure he would not escape, while other kidnappers secured ransom money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Later that day, Barrow called George on the pretense of wanting to buy marijuana. George did not know Barrow, but Barrow convinced him that he had bought marijuana from George before. The two exchanged calls and agreed to meet. When George met up with Barrow, he got into Barrow's van, where he was assaulted by Barrow and a second man. The men bound George with duct tape, wiped his clothing and neck with bleach, and then drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 32} George was moved into a second van where two more kidnappers, Timothy Watson and Lonnie Rucker, \"babysat\" him through the night and into the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Rucker testified that Watson had contacted him on February 6th about being a babysitter. That night, Rucker picked up Watson and drove to a spot where a person was tied up in the back of a van. Watson said they had to sit and watch the victim until the other kidnappers came back with the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b634} Communications continued between Kellam and the kidnappers. The officers became more and more concerned about George's safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 35} As discussed in more detail under the first assignment of error, the police were ultimately able to locate Buck and a phone that had been used to make ransom calls. At trial, Officer Bley clarified that Buck's phone was recovered from Buck's pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Buck was arrested at about 9:30 a.m., on the 7th, but the police still had no idea where George was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Within hours of Buck's arrest, Watson and Rucker were frustrated that the ransom had not been paid and were concerned that Kellam had gone to the\n   police. So they left the area, leaving George alone in the van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 38} At about 2:00 p.m., George escaped from the van and ran to a nearby home. The occupant called the police who responded, and the police brought George to the homicide unit. The police recovered pieces of duct tape from George's socks, noted bleach stains on his clothing, and photographed abrasions on his wrists, caused by the duct tape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Police recovered the van that George had escaped from. In the van, they found duct tape, pieces of mail addressed to Barrow, and Barrow's and Watson's fingerprints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Telephone records revealed that Kellam had received about 45 ransom calls from two different telephone numbers, (513) 498-2051 and a second number that Barrow admitted was his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 41} A Cincinnati Bell representative, Paula Papke, testified that the \"IMEI, which is basically the serial number for the phone, which would be contained within the phone itself\" for Buck's cell phone matched the IMEI listed in the subscriber record for (513) 498-2051, a prepaid account. She said that subscribers who use prepaid accounts usually provide fictitious personal information when setting up the account. Prepaid-account subscribers have to provide a date of birth as the password for the account, and, without the password, a subscriber cannot access the account. Papke said that many prepaid-account subscribers provide a date of birth that is a single digit off from their actual birthdate. She said that the number (513) 498-2051 was subscribed in the name \"Tone Montrell,\" and that the account password was \"11/2/76.\" Buck's date of birth is November 2, 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Telephone records confirmed that Buck and Barrow communicated with each other and with Kellam and Watson through the evening of the 6th and the morning of the 7th. In addition, the records confirmed that Buck's cell phone \"pinged\" off cell towers at times and locations that corresponded to those of George's abduction, the kidnappers' movements, and the officer's arrival at his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In recorded telephone calls from the jail, Buck complained to his mother that his live-in girlfriend had been talking to people about the case, specifically about his cell phone, an important part of the case against him, according to Buck. Buck also angrily confronted his girlfriend about her disclosing the fact that he had purchased his cell phone from her son, when she was well aware that \"this whole case [is] surrounded by a cell phone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Barrow testified in his defense that George was a friend of his. According to Barrow, George's brothers were known to be \"[i]nto the high-end drug trade.\" George hatched an extortion plan with Barrow, Watson, Profit, Little D, and Little C to get $100,000 from George's brother. George was to receive $40,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Barrow said that George got into his van voluntarily and that they drove around. At one point, Barrow said, they sat at the Shell station to see if George's brother would come with the money. At that point, they realized that the police might be involved, so Barrow left the group. He did not know where George went.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Barrow testified that he knew Buck, but that Buck was not involved in the kidnapping. He said that he had spoken to several people \"through that Buck phone,\" one of them being Buck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Buck did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 48}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Our Standard of Review.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In a challenge to the sufficiency of\n   the evidence, the question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The phone was in his pocket and contained selfie photographs and videos of Buck. The required-birthdate password for the prepaid account on the phone was one digit different than Buck's actual birthdate.

In the first interview, he told Detective Hilbert that he was grabbed off the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 58} At trial, George testified that he had foolishly gotten into the van at Barrow's direction, and that Barrow \"had somebody in the back waiting on me, snatched me up, choking me out.\" On cross-examination, George acknowledged that he had told the police that the \"van pulled down on me and snatched me up,\" and that later on in the first interview, he had said, \"[T]hey was already parked and dude say hey. I'm walking. I turned around a little bit, next thing you know I'm in the back of the van fighting with this dude[.]\" When asked whether the police had interviewed him a second time, George initially denied it and then stated, \"Not that I can remember. I don't know. I don't remember. I just remember I came up a couple days after it happened and they talked to me, showed me a couple picture.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The issue of a second George interview arose during the cross-examination of Detective Hilbert by Buck's attorney. The attorney asked whether George, when interviewed on the date of his escape, had mentioned that he was selling marijuana when he was kidnapped. The detective responded that George had not. Then the detective said that he was not surprised when, ten to 15 days later, George told him about the arranged and attempted marijuana sale. At that point, codefendant Barrow's counsel asked the court for a sidebar conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 60} At sidebar, Barrow's attorney indicated that he was not aware that the police had interviewed George a second time. Buck's attorney, on the other hand, at no time asserted that he was unaware of a second interview. Instead, his focus was on exploiting the inconsistencies between George's trial testimony and his first police interview, noting specifically, \"my problem is not with [the prosecutor] or Detective Hilbert.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The prosecutor explained to the trial court that he believed he had provided information about the second interview to defense counsel, noting that both defendants had been represented by previous\n   counsel. The trial court noted that there had been no suggestion that the prosecutor had withheld any information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 62} As an accommodation to Barrow's counsel, the trial court allowed a brief recess during which the prosecutor and both defense counsel spoke with Detective Hilbert about the second interview. Afterwards, the court noted that the content of the second interview included George's acknowledgement to Detective Hilbert that he had omitted telling the detective that he had arranged to meet Barrow to sell him marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Then the court allowed Barrow's counsel to further cross-examine Detective Hilbert about the second interview and whether he had divulged that interview to defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 64} It is not clear from the record that the prosecutor failed to disclose the second George interview. Even if we assume the discovery violation occurred, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its handling of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Crim.R. 16 controls the discovery process, the purpose of which is \"to provide all parties in a criminal case with the information necessary for a full and fair adjudication of the facts, to protect the integrity of the justice system and the rights of defendants, and to protect the well-being of witnesses, victims, and society at large.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 16(A).

Buck does not contend that his defense would have changed if he had known that George had voluntarily gotten into Barrow's van initially. His defense was not that the victim was not kidnapped, but that he was not involved in the kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The trial court's remedy for the discovery issue was to recess to allow defense counsel to meet with Detective Hilbert and to allow counsel to fully cross-examine the detective on the matter. We note that Buck's counsel expressed no dissatisfaction following his discussion with Detective Hilbert. And Buck has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the alleged discovery violation. Under these circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in handling the potential discovery violation. In addition, as we discuss in addressing Buck's third assignment of error, the trial court properly denied Buck's request for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 68} On appeal, Buck asserts that, in addition to failing to disclose the second George interview, the prosecutor perpetuated George's \"false\" narrative about being grabbed off the street in the bill of particulars and in his opening statement at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 69}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Bill of Particulars.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Under Crim.R. 7(E), upon request,\n   \"the prosecuting attorney shall furnish the defendant with a bill of particulars setting up specifically the nature of the offense charge and of the conduct of the defendant alleged to constitute the offense.\" The limited purpose of a bill of particulars is \"to elucidate or particularize the conduct of the accused,\" but not \"to provide the accused with specifications of evidence or to serve as a substitute for discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

At that point, Barrow's counsel told the court that he could not recall if he had represented Buck. The trial court expressed skepticism about the timing of Buck's concern because the trial was in its second week and because Barrow's counsel had been involved in the case for quite some time. The court pointed out that Barrow testified that Buck had had nothing to do with the charged offense and that Barrow's counsel had done nothing to try to incriminate Buck.

Buck's defense attorney joined in the motion, but offered no argument. We note that it is not clear from the record that the prosecutor had not disclosed the second interview to Buck because his attorney never made such a representation to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 98} The prosecutor responded that he had had meetings with the defense and had provided them with all the information that he had. He said that he and Detective Hilbert had communicated the substance of the second interview to Barrow's prior counsel. He said that Barrow's trial counsel had told him that Barrow's prior counsel had gotten rid of his case file, so the prosecutor did his best to ensure that both defense counsel had all of the information that had been previously disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 99} The trial court denied the motions for a mistrial, stating that while there was a discrepancy as to \"who knew or who didn't know and what was turned over to prior counsel,\" the defense had adequately dealt with what they had learned about the second interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 100} When the codefendant's counsel asserted surprise at the second interview, the court noted that there had been no assertion that the prosecutor willfully withheld the information and that it may have been provided to prior defense counsel. The court recessed so that defense counsel could meet with the prosecutor and Detective Hilbert to discuss the content of the second interview and allowed counsel to cross-examine the detective about whether the interview had been withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 101} Buck asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the late disclosure prevented him from cross-examining Detective Hilbert about the discrepancies between the two interviews. He does not say how the discrepancies would have aided his defense. According to Detective Hilbert, there were no discrepancies, just new information about a prearranged marijuana sale. And Buck's counsel had already begun cross-examining the detective about\n   the drug deal before Barrow's counsel asserted surprise at another interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 102} At trial, Buck's counsel raised no concern about discrepancies between the two interviews. Rather, he explained to the trial court that the only discrepancies he wanted to explore were those between George's first interview and his trial testimony. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling Buck's motion for a mistrial related to the alleged discovery violation. Buck has failed to establish that a fair trial was no longer possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 103}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Failure to Record Sidebar Conferences.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Buck complains that the trial court denied his right to a public trial and violated Crim.R. 22 by failing to record all of the sidebar conferences.
