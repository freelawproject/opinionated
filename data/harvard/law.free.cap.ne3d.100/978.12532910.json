Robinson (\"Robinson\"), appeals from the order of the trial court granting the motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration filed by defendant-appellee Mayfield Auto Group, L.L.C., d.b.a. Nick Mayer Ford Lincoln (\"Nick Mayer Ford\"). Robinson assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court erred in granting [Nick Mayer Ford's] motion to stay proceedings as to the claims of John P. Robinson pending arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the trial court's decision. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In September 2016, Robinson, the former controller for Nick Mayer Ford, and his coworker Eric Walker, filed a complaint against the dealership alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As is relevant herein, Robinson alleged that he, Robinson, began his employment with Marshall Ford in 2005. In 2014, Marshall Ford was purchased by Nick Mayer Ford, and the terms of Robinson's employment were adopted by Nick Mayer Ford. Robinson alleged that under the terms of the Controller pay plan, he was entitled to a monthly base salary plus commissions in the amount of 1% of the dealership's net pre-tax profit, and payment for unused vacation. He alleged that he is entitled to accrued commissions in the amount of $11,459, past vacation payment in the amount of $5,192, and current vacation payment in the amount of $3,600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In its answer, Nick Mayer Ford denied liability and asserted that Robinson's claims were subject to a mandatory arbitration agreement that was part of his employment. Nick Mayer Ford also moved\n   to stay the proceedings pending arbitration and attached a copy of the arbitration agreement, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   any and all claims or controversies between me and the COMPANY relating to my employment with the COMPANY or termination thereof including claims for breach of contract, tort, employment discrimination (including unlawful harassment) and any violation of any state or federal law shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the applicable National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If any party prevails on a statutory claim, which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees, then the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I understand and agree that this Arbitration Agreement contains a full and complete statement of any and all agreements and understandings regarding resolution of disputes between the COMPANY and me * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In opposition to the motion to stay, Robinson acknowledged that he signed the arbitration agreement but argued that the agreement was unsupported by consideration, and that it is unenforceable because it lacks mutuality and is unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 2, 2017, the trial court stayed Robinson's claims pending arbitration.
