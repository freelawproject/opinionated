Muldrow, appeals an amended judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, entered on May 26, 2017, which ordered him to serve five years' imprisonment for the offense of cocaine possession. Muldrow seeks reversal of a November 23, 2016 decision denying his motion to suppress evidence. We find that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop Muldrow's car after he had left his residence. We therefore affirm the decision and judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 21, 2015, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted Muldrow for possession of cocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding 27 grams but less than 100 grams. (Aug. 21, 2015 Indictment.) Muldrow entered a not guilty plea. (Aug. 26, 2015 Plea Form.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Approximately three weeks later, Muldrow filed a motion to suppress the\n   evidence against him. (Sept. 15, 2015 Mot. to Suppress.) After briefing by both sides, on October 23, 2015, the trial court held a hearing on the motion to suppress. (Oct. 23, 2015 Mot. Hearing Tr., filed Jan. 22, 2016.) At the hearing a single witness testified, Detective Walter Miller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Miller testified that the police received a tip from a person who was allegedly identified to the police but whose name is not reflected in the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 18-19. The tip was to the effect that Muldrow and his girlfriend (\"Cami\" or \"Cammi\" Williams) were engaged in drug trafficking at 3988 Fulton Street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 18-19, 24; State's Hearing Ex. 1, filed Jan. 22, 2016 (see page 1 of the warrant affidavit). Based on the tip, the police surveilled the house and performed two \"trash pulls\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of refuse believed to be associated with the residence. (Mot. Hearing Tr. at 7-11.) The police recovered baggies in both \"trash pulls\" that tested\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   positive for cocaine residue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. They also performed a criminal history check of Muldrow, which showed a number of arrests in connection with drug activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Miller also related that he had seen Muldrow \"many times\" at the residence during surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Based on this evidence, the police obtained a warrant to search 3988 Fulton Street and \"any persons\" at such premises or on the curtilage of such premises for cocaine or other evidence related to illicit drug trafficking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (State's Hearing Ex. 1; Mot. Hearing Tr. at 12.) Some time after obtaining the warrant, the police observed Muldrow arrive at 3988 Fulton Street. (Mot. Hearing Tr. at 13.) In response, Miller gave the order to an accompanying tactical team to execute the search warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} But, after only five or ten minutes, while the tactical team was still en route, Muldrow got back in his car and drove away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 26. There is neither indication nor argument in the record that Muldrow was aware of the impending search. Seeing Muldrow leave the house, Miller ordered the surveillance team to stop Muldrow's car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. The surveillance team, in turn, radioed an officer in a cruiser who stopped Muldrow approximately two or three blocks from 3988 Fulton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Miller testified that he was present when Muldrow was stopped and taken out of his car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. He related that when Muldrow emerged from his car he had a baggie in his hand that contained the drugs for which he was eventually indicted in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Miller testified that he ordered Muldrow stopped because Muldrow was the suspect identified in the original tip, they needed to talk to him, and to bring him back to the scene of the search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Miller admitted he had no specific evidence to believe that evidence of criminal activity was going to be found on Muldrow's person or in his vehicle when he ordered the stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. However, based on Muldrow's criminal history, the tip, the trash pulls, and the surveillance showing Muldrow's comings and goings, he believed Muldrow was making drug deliveries and suspected Muldrow might be carrying drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Following oral argument by both parties on the motion to suppress, the trial court ruled from the bench and granted the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-60. The trial court found the stop of Muldrow not authorized by the warrant because Muldrow was not present at 3988 Fulton or on the curtilage of the property when the warrant was executed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. It found that the officer who stopped Muldrow and the officer who radioed that officer had not testified and thus there was no evidence from which to determine whether or not there were good grounds for stopping Muldrow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60. The trial court also stated that it believed that Miller had acknowledged that he did not have probable cause to stop Muldrow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The State appealed the suppression and, on June 30, 2016, this Court reversed the decision of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v. Muldrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-4774\">\n    2016-Ohio-4774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.E.3d%20260\">\n    68 N.E.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the trial court erred in failing to correctly apply the \"collective knowledge doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Specifically, we found that the trial court should not have focused on the fact that the officers conducting the stop did not testify because the salient issue was whether the officer who ordered the stop, Miller, had the requisite level of reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, 21-22. We also found that the trial court erred in characterizing Miller's testimony as an admission that he lacked probable cause for the stop because the proper legal question was whether the police had \"reasonable suspicion\" for the stop and \"reasonable suspicion is less than the level of suspicion required for probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On remand, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. (Nov. 23, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry.) The trial court concluded that the facts uncovered by the investigation gave rise not only to probable cause for the warrant to search 3988 Fulton, but also to a reasonable suspicion that Muldrow was involved in the possession and sale of drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The trial court also concluded that the State had established a sufficient connection between Muldrow and the property to be searched to justify the stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The trial court therefore decided that the stop of Muldrow after leaving 3988 Fulton was justified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On April 6, 2017 Muldrow pled \"no contest\" to the indicted charge of cocaine possession. (Apr. 6, 2017 Plea Form.) After holding a sentencing hearing on May 19, 2017, the trial court sentenced Muldrow to serve five years in prison and fined him $10,000. (Sentencing Tr., filed June 30, 2017; May 25, 2017 Jgmt. Entry.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Muldrow now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The first was that reasonable suspicion existed that Muldrow \"had or was violating Ohio law governing the possession of cocaine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The second was that \"the State established a reasonable connection between [Muldrow] and the property to be searched pursuant to a valid search warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

Whether the Stop of Muldrow was Permissible Incident to the Execution of the Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Muldrow argues in essence that the trial court erred in finding that the search warrant of 3988 Fulton Street justified the traffic stop that did not occur on those premises. (Muldrow's Brief at 10-15.) We agree, insofar as the trial court held that the search was justified as incident to the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In 1981, the United States Supreme Court decided that, incident to the execution of a search warrant on a house, police officers were justified in detaining a person descending the front steps of the house as they arrived to execute the warrant.\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

While the record does not indicate exactly how frequently Muldrow came and went from the house, surveillance observed him there \"many times\" and on this occasion he arrived, stayed only five to ten minutes, and then left again.

In the seminal case creating the category of investigative stops,\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Even though Muldrow could have been, for instance, on his way to the grocery store based on the corroborated tip that he was engaged in selling cocaine, having been seen \"many times\" at the residence from which cocaine was being sold, and having arrived and stayed for a short time just long enough to pick up something and leave, it was reasonable to stop him to investigate whether, on this particular occasion, he was on his way to deliver cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Because the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion, Muldrow's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
