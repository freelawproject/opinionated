At issue is whether the trial court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying complaint and, if so, whether the trial court erred in concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact for trial\n   and, as such, appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant, an employee of the Trumbull County Engineer's Office, was involved in an accident on October 20, 2008, while working for the Engineer's Office. Appellant was a member of the AFSCME Local 11/AFL-CIO (\"AFSCME\"), which is the representative of the bargaining unit employees of the Engineer's office. AFSCME entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") for the period of April 20, 2007 through April 19, 2013, on behalf of the employees of the Engineer's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As a result of his accident, appellant was on various leaves from October 2008 through February 14, 2011. During his leaves, appellant collected workers' compensation benefits. The CBA requires unit members to share in the cost of hospitalization-insurance benefits while on workers' compensation after the employee has been receiving workers'-compensation benefits for a certain period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Consistent with the terms of the CBA, the Engineer's office continued to provide hospitalization benefits to appellant during his periods of leave. Pursuant to the CBA, appellant was required to pay appellees a total of $10,500.64 as his proportionate share of the advanced hospitalization-insurance premiums. Appellant made one payment toward the premiums of $185.05 in 2009. The outstanding balance of $10,315.59 remained due. Appellees requested appellant to pay the unpaid balance, but appellant did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On December 15, 2015, appellees filed a complaint against appellant asserting claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The complaint sought $10,315.59 reimbursement for appellant's portion of accrued hospitalization insurance-benefit premiums while appellant was on workers' compensation leave. Appellant filed an answer and counterclaim against appellee, Randy L. Smith, Trumbull County Engineer. The counterclaim was ultimately dismissed, after which appellant moved the trial court for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his motion, appellant claimed the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over appellees' claims relating to the reimbursement of his portion of the premiums. He maintained the claims fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Employee Relations Board (\"SERB\"), pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117, as they arise from or are dependent upon rights created by the CBA. In response, appellees argued the trial court possessed subject-matter jurisdiction over the case because R.C. Chapter 4117 does not provide a procedure for SERB to intervene in a dispute regarding an employee's breach of a contractual obligation for contribution under the terms of a CBA; and, because the claim does not involve or allege an unfair labor practice under the statute, the court of common pleas possessed jurisdiction to proceed. The trial court agreed with appellees and denied appellant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 27, 2016, appellees served a request for admissions, to be answered within 28 days, upon appellant and filed a notice of discovery on June 29, 2016. Appellant did not respond to the request for admissions and, on August 5, 2016, appellees moved to have the requests deemed admitted. Appellant did not respond to this motion and, on August 24, 2016, the trial court deemed the requests admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment to which appellant responded, again asserting his jurisdictional arguments. On February 27, 2017, the trial court granted appellees' motion and awarded them judgment in the amount of\n   $10,315.59. Appellant now appeals and assigns two errors for our review. His first assignment of error provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Subject-matter jurisdiction is the power conferred upon a court, either by constitutional provision or by statute, to decide a particular matter or issue on its merits.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Again,\n   <em>\n    Sutula\n   </em>\n   dealt with claims that fell squarely within R.C. Chapter 4117, to wit: various unfair labor practice claims under R.C. 4117.11(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The instant facts are distinguishable from the foregoing cases. Here, neither party made an allegation relating to an unfair labor practice; rather, appellees sought remuneration for appellant's failure to pay his proportional share of the hospitalization-insurance premium. Although appellant's duty to pay his share and appellees' right to reimbursement arise out of the CBA, there is no provision under R.C. Chapter 4117 that creates such rights or obligations. And appellant does not direct this court to any provision of R.C. Chapter 4117 under which the instant breach of contract and/or unjust enrichment claims might arguably fall. In our view, therefore, appellees' right to reimbursement is independent of the rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117 and, pursuant to, inter alia,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. OCSEA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the court of common pleas properly exercised jurisdiction over the case.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4117.09(B)(1) (\"A party to the agreement may bring suits for violation of agreements or the enforcement of an award by an arbitrator in the court of common pleas of any county wherein a party resides or transacts business.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Notwithstanding his claim that SERB possesses exclusive jurisdiction, appellant alternatively argues that, because the CBA contains a binding grievance and arbitration provision, arbitration is the exclusive means of resolving the underlying dispute. Article 8, Section 2 of the CBA, however, makes it clear that \"[t]he word 'grievance' as used in this Agreement refers to an alleged failure of the\n   <em>\n    Employer\n   </em>\n   to comply with the provisions of this Agreement or the law.\" (Emphasis added.) In this case, appellee, the employer, is bringing suit for breach of the CBA against an employee. Accordingly, by definition, the underlying claims do not constitute a \"grievance\" under the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant's first assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant's second assignment of error provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"The evidence in the record now before this honorable court does not resolve all issues of material fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Summary judgment is a procedural tool that terminates litigation and thus should be entered with caution.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Among these requests were (a) whether appellant admitted he owed $10,500.64 in unpaid contributions for health-insurance premiums; (b) whether, pursuant to his obligation to contribute, appellant made a payment of $185.05 towards the amount owed; and (c) whether the calculations were true and accurate. Appellant failed to timely respond and appellees moved that the requests be deemed admitted. On August 24, 2016, without objection, the trial court deemed the requests admitted facts of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellees filed their motion for summary judgment and attached the affidavit of Nicole A. Klingeman, Fiscal Officer at the Trumbull County Engineer's Office. Ms. Klingeman's affidavit recited the background facts in support of the alleged breach of contract/unjust enrichment claims. Specifically, Ms. Klingeman averred appellant was absent from employment and receiving applicable sick leave and Workers' Compensation benefits for a period extending from October 20, 2008 through February 14, 2011; that appellant is a union employee and was provided hospitalization/insurance benefits pursuant to two CBAs, which were applicable during the period of his absence; and that, pursuant to the CBAs, appellant was required to pay a proportionate share of the cost of hospitalization insurance benefits during his absence for a work-related injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Ms. Klingeman detailed the relevant portions of the CBAs, and itemized the proportional amount for which appellant was responsible. She averred the financial records of the Trumbull County Engineer's Office indicated appellant failed to pay a total of $10,315.59 of what he owed, pursuant to the agreement. In effect, the affidavit substantiated, in greater detail, the facts and figures which were deemed admitted by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant maintains that, notwithstanding the foregoing uncontested\n   facts, there remain material issues of fact to be resolved because they do not address a precept that appellant designates the \"law-of-the-shop\" doctrine. According to appellant, this principle requires an employer to apply provisions of a CBA not simply by the letter of the contract, but also in the context of the customs of the plant or office in which the CBA is being applied. In support, appellant cites\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p579\">\n    363 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579-580,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p579\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p579\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960). In that case, the United States Supreme Court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} \"[I]t is not unqualifiedly true that a collective-bargaining agreement is simply a document by which the union and employees have imposed upon management limited, express restrictions of its otherwise absolute right to manage the enterprise, so that an employee's claim must fail unless he can point to a specific contract provision upon which the claim is founded. There are too many people, too many problems, too many unforeseeable contingencies to make the words of the contract the exclusive source of rights and duties. One cannot reduce all the rules governing a community like an industrial plant to fifteen or even fifty pages. Within the sphere of collective bargaining, the institutional characteristics and the governmental nature of the collective-bargaining process demand a common law of the shop which implements and furnishes the context of the agreement. We must assume that intelligent negotiators acknowledged so plain a need unless they stated a contrary rule in plain words.\" (Citation omitted)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p579\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellant maintains the foregoing, in light of an affidavit he attached to his memorandum in opposition, which indicated the Engineer's Office had previously failed to require a separate employee to pay premiums, creates a genuine issue of material fact. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Preliminarily, appellant did not directly raise the \"law-of-the-shop\" issue in his memorandum in opposition. The affidavit of Judene Ainsley, attached to appellant's memorandum, averred that the Engineer's Office did not pursue insurance premium contribution payments from a separate employee injured on the job. This averment, however, represents an isolated instance and cannot be viewed as a so-called \"law of the shop.\" Because the issue was not directly raised below, appellant has waived the issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Even if appellant preserved the issue, it would still lack merit. The CBA in the instant case sets forth in a plain, yet detailed, manner, an employee's duty to reimburse the employer for express percentages of advanced health-insurance premiums during workers'-compensation leave. Even assuming the Engineer's Office failed to demand payment from a previous employee, this does not affect appellant's duty to pay his premiums in the instant case. The failure to make a demand in an isolated case does not establish an institutional custom. Moreover, the quoted portion of the foregoing case suggests the \"law-of-the-shop\" doctrine applies to a union's and/or employees' ability to place certain restraints upon employers, not simply by recourse to a CBA, but by reference to the context and customs of the occupational institution. This does not imply an employee can avoid his or her obligations, to which he or she agreed, under an unambiguous provision of a CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellees established appellant owed them $10,315.59 in unpaid hospitalization insurance premiums. Appellant failed to create a genuine issue of material\n   fact relating to his obligation to pay this amount. We therefore hold appellees were entitled to judgment on their claim of breach of contract as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant's second assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 32} For the reasons discussed in this opinion, the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   TIMOTHY P.
