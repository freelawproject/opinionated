CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Johnnie Pierce (\"Pierce\"), brings this appeal challenging his convictions and the trial court's sentence for escape and two counts of harassment by inmate. Specifically, Pierce argues that (1) he should have been convicted of fifth-degree felony escape because the jury verdict form did not indicate that the most serious offense for which he was under detention was a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree; (2) his due process rights were violated when the trial court denied defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge and failed to provide an intoxication instruction to the jury; and (3) his harassment by inmate convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms in part, modifies in part, and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 12, 2015, Cleveland Police Officers responded to radio call for males fighting near the intersection of Prospect Avenue and East 4th Street. Upon arrival at the scene, officers encountered Pierce, who appeared to be intoxicated, disheveled, and confrontational. Pierce was standing in the vicinity of a broken chair and a broken glass window. When the officers approached Pierce, he made obscene and threatening remarks. The decision was made to detain Pierce based on the officers' belief that he had been involved in the fight and his proximity to the\n   broken chair and glass window. Pierce was detained for vandalism and disorderly conduct while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pierce began vomiting and urinating in the backseat of the police car. The officers became concerned that Pierce was highly intoxicated or experiencing an overdose, and decided to take him to St. Vincent Charity Hospital for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After Pierce was treated, the officers transported him from the hospital to the police car in a wheelchair. Pierce suddenly jumped out of the chair and attempted to flee the area on foot. The officers eventually caught up to Pierce and brought him to the ground. Pierce continued to fight the officers, attempting to strike them with his elbows and feet. Furthermore, he attempted to bite the officers and began spitting at them. Pierce received additional medical treatment for the injuries that he sustained during the altercation with the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-596666-A, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a seven-count indictment charging Pierce with felonious assault, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) with a furthermore specification alleging that the victim was a peace officer; vandalism, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2909.05(B)(1)(b) ; escape, a third-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2921.34(A)(1) ; assault, a fourth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A) with a furthermore specification alleging that the victim was a peace officer; two counts of harassment by inmate, fifth-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2921.38(B) ; and resisting arrest, a second-degree misdemeanor in violation of R.C. 2921.33(A). Pierce was arraigned on July 30, 2015. He pled not guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} A jury trial commenced on October 17, 2016. Cleveland Police Officers Justen Davis, Aaron Petitt, and Christopher Hoover testified on behalf of the state. At the close of the state's evidence, defense counsel moved for a Crim.R. 29 judgment of acquittal. The trial court granted defense counsel's motion on the vandalism offense charged in Count 2; the court denied the motion on all other counts. The defense rested after calling one witness, and renewed the Crim.R. 29 motion, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 21, 2016, the jury found Pierce not guilty on the felonious assault, assault, and resisting arrest counts. The jury found Pierce guilty on the escape count and both counts of harassment by inmate. On October 26, 2016, the trial court referred Pierce to the probation department for a presentence investigation report and set the matter for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court held a sentencing hearing on December 20, 2016. The trial court imposed a prison sentence of two years on the escape count and one year on each of the harassment by inmate counts. The trial court ordered the counts to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On January 20, 2017, Pierce filed the instant appeal challenging his convictions and the trial court's sentence. He assigns four errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when he was sentenced for a felony of the third degree when there was no determination by the jury as to what the underlying offense was for the offense of escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   II. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when the court failed to state [Pierce's]\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   III. Defense was denied due process of law when the court, on its own, did not instruct the jury on intoxication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   IV. [Pierce] was denied due process of law when he was convicted of harassment by an inmate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Verdict Form\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, Pierce challenges his conviction for third-degree felony escape. Specifically, Pierce argues that the jury verdict form omitted the required finding under R.C. 2921.34(C)(2)(b) that makes the offense a third-degree felony. As such, he argues that he could only be convicted of fifth-degree felony escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Pierce was charged with escape in violation of R.C. 2921.34(A)(1), which provides, in relevant part, that \"[n]o person, knowing the person is under detention, * * * or being reckless in that regard, shall purposely break or attempt to break the detention[.]\" Pursuant to R.C. 2921.34(C)(2), the degree of the offense of escape is determined by the most serious offense for which the offender was under detention at the time of the offense. Escape is a felony of the second degree \"when the most serious offense for which the person was under detention * * * is aggravated murder, murder, or a felony of the first or second degree[.]\" Escape is a felony of the third degree \"when the most serious offense for which the person was under detention * * * is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree or an unclassified felony[.]\" Escape is a felony of the fifth degree when \"[t]he most serious offense for which the person was under detention is a misdemeanor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Count 3 alleged that Pierce \"did, knowing [he was] under detention, * * * purposely break or attempt to break the detention, * * * and [the] offense for which [Pierce] was under detention * * * was a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree[.]\" This language elevated the escape offense from a fifth-degree felony to a third-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court instructed the jury on the offense-enhancing language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Before you can find [Pierce] guilty of escape, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that one or about the 12th day of June, 2015, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, [Pierce] did, knowing he was under detention, * * * purposely break or attempt to break the detention, * * * and the offense for which [Pierce] was under detention was a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree, or unclassified felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Tr. 580.) However, the verdict form on which the jury found Pierce guilty did not include a degree for the escape offense nor the aggravating element that elevated the offense from a fifth-to a third-degree felony. The verdict form on which the jury found Pierce guilty provided, in relevant part: \"We the jury in this case, * * * do find [Pierce] guilty of escape, in violation of 2921.34(A)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code as charged in Count Three of this indictment.\" (Tr. 648-649.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} R.C. 2945.75(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   When the presence of one or more additional elements makes an offense one of more serious degree: * * * (2) A guilty verdict shall state either the degree of the offense of which the offender is found guilty, or that such additional element or elements are present. Otherwise, a guilty verdict constitutes a finding of guilty of the least degree of the offense charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In the instant matter, Pierce argues that the jury did not find that the most serious offense for which he was under detention was a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree. Pierce contends that the jury merely found that he was guilty of escape as charged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In support of his argument, Pierce directs this court to\n   <em>\n    State v. Pelfrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885642\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/112/422/\">\n    112 Ohio St.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-256\">\n    2007-Ohio-256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20N.E.2d%20735\">\n    860 N.E.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Pelfrey\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court held that \"[p]ursuant to the clear language of R.C. 2945.75, a verdict form signed by a jury must include either the degree of the offense of which the defendant is convicted or a statement that an aggravating element has been found to justify convicting a defendant of a greater degree of a criminal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20N.E.2d%20735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.

In\n   <em>\n    Eafford\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court \"reversed this court for strictly applying\n   <em>\n    Pelfrey\n   </em>\n   to a challenge of a jury verdict form under R.C. 2945.75(A), and found that the alleged defect in the jury verdict was not plain error based on other circumstances during the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kilbane\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99485,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1228\">\n    2014-Ohio-1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201327963\">\n    2014 WL 1327963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17. The court looked beyond the jury verdict form and considered the whole record. Although the jury verdict form did not state the degree of the drug possession offense or the aggravating circumstance, the court held that the alleged defect in the jury verdict form did not constitute plain error because (1) the indictment charged the defendant with possessing cocaine, (2) the verdict form reflected a finding of guilty as charged in the indictment, (3) the evidence presented at trial only related to possession of cocaine, and (4) the trial court instructed the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of drug possession unless it found the drug involved to be cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Eafford\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In the instant matter, the state argues that the additional element-that Pierce committed the escape offense while the most serious offense for which he was under detention was a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree-was alleged in the indictment and the jury verdict form reflected a finding of guilty \"as charged in Count Three of [the] indictment.\" Furthermore, the state contends that the evidence presented at trial established that Pierce had been detained for vandalism, a fifth-degree felony, at the time he committed the escape offense. Officer Davis testified that Pierce was detained for vandalizing the apartment door's glass window, a fifth-degree felony. (Tr. 292, 304.) Finally, the state emphasizes that the trial court instructed the jury that it could not find Pierce guilty of escape unless it found that he committed the offense while under detention for a third-, fourth-, or fifth-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The state does not address the effect of the Ohio Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the issue of compliance with R.C. 2945.75(A)(2) in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   , the court made clear that \"in cases involving offenses for which the addition of an element or elements can elevate the offense to a more serious degree,\n   <em>\n    the verdict form itself is the only relevant thing to consider\n   </em>\n   in determining whether the dictates of R.C. 2945.75 have been followed.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17, citing\n   <em>\n    Pelfrey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885642\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/112/422/\">\n    112 Ohio St.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-256\">\n    2007-Ohio-256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20N.E.2d%20735\">\n    860 N.E.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 14.

In\n   <em>\n    Kilbane\n   </em>\n   , this court attempted to reconcile the three holdings. This court applied the strict compliance analysis from\n   <em>\n    Pelfrey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that the jury verdict forms contain \"a statement of the additional element to justify convicting Kilbane of the greater degree of the offense\" and \" 'further findings' that expressly required the jury to find that the aggravating element was present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15-16.

This young lady was a woman of color. My client is a person of color, and I believe that it is no longer necessary to show a pattern where there is no rational basis for excluding a juror, and I don't see that there was a rational basis for excluding this juror number 6.\" (Tr. 170.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court noted that it was unclear whether prospective Juror 6 was African or Latin American. Nevertheless, the trial court reviewed the three-part test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   with the parties and provided the state with an opportunity to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In response to defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, the prosecutor noted that he was also a person of color and that there were still \"numerous persons of color\" on the jury. (Tr. 170.) The prosecutor argued that defense counsel failed to make a prima facie case that the state engaged in racial discrimination based on the fact\n   that both the parties and the trial court were unable to determine the nationality or race of prospective Juror 6. The prosecutor opined that prospective Juror 6 was Hispanic rather than African American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court inquired as to whether the state had a race-neutral reason for removing the juror. The prosecutor provided the following reasons for excusing prospective Juror 6:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   There are a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that during the state's initial questioning of the panel, juror number 6 would not make eye contact with the State of Ohio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, during the court's examination of the witness, the State of Ohio noted that juror number 6 did not like to make eye contact with the court, and was, in general, just not involved in the process and showed a demeanor that she did not want to be present or participate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, your Honor, on the State of Ohio's questioning during the voir dire, juror number 6 did indicate that both of her parents were in jail at some point on drug charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   And so when juror number 6 elucidated those facts, it kind of clarified for the State of Ohio the feeling of mistrust there was that the State of Ohio was getting from her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Tr. 174-175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court rejected defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge based on the prosecution's explanation of its basis for excusing prospective Juror 6. The trial court noted on the record that the juror who replaced prospective Juror 6 was also an African American female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Pierce appears to argue that the state failed to provide a race-neutral explanation to exclude prospective Juror 6. Furthermore, Pierce emphasizes that although prospective Juror 6's parents had been charged with drug-related offenses in the past, she indicated that her parents' experiences would not affect her ability to be fair to the prosecution or the defense. (Tr. 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 35} After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trial court's denial of defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was clearly erroneous. After defense counsel objected to the state's removal of prospective Juror 6, the trial court thoroughly reviewed the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   three-part test and gave the prosecution an opportunity to provide its reasons for excusing the juror. The prosecutor provided permissible race-neutral justifications for exercising its peremptory challenge. In denying defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, the trial court evidently concluded that Pierce failed to prove purposeful racial discrimination.

Thompkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"375127\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/78/380/#p386\">\n    78 Ohio St.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n    678 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Pierce was convicted of harassment by inmate in violation of R.C. 2921.38(B), which provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [n]o person, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm a law enforcement officer, shall cause or attempt to cause the law enforcement officer to come into contact with blood, semen, urine, feces, or another bodily substance by throwing the bodily substance at the law enforcement officer, by expelling the bodily substance upon the law enforcement officer, or in any other manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In support of his sufficiency challenge, Pierce argues that there was no evidence that he intended to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm the officers. He appears to suggest that the transfer of blood was accidental or incidental rather than deliberate. Furthermore, Pierce argues that the state failed to prove that the blood on Officers Petitt and Hoover belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The record reflects that the state presented sufficient evidence to support Pierce's convictions. First, Officer Davis testified that Pierce was spitting at the officers. (Tr. 301.) Officer Davis asserted that Pierce had blood in his mouth. Officer Davis testified that Officer Hoover \"was spitted [sic] upon; bodily contamination.\" (Tr. 303.) As a result of Pierce's conduct, officers placed a spit bag on Pierce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Second, Officer Petitt testified that Pierce \"began to bite and spit at both Officer Hoover and I.\" (Tr. 355.) Officer Petitt explained, \"[w]hen we were able to gain control of [Pierce's] hands, he then turned and started biting at us, and spitting saliva and blood and anything else he could do to try to hit us or hurt us.\" (Tr. 356.) Officer Petitt stated that Pierce \"spat several times,\" and that Pierce was spitting purposefully. He testified that blood came from Pierce's mouth. Officer Petitt asserted that he was contacted by Pierce's spit and blood. Officers placed a spit mask on Pierce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Third, Officer Hoover testified that a spit mask was placed on Pierce because he was spitting on him and Officer Petitt. Officer Hoover confirmed that he was hit by Pierce's spit, and that the spit got on his uniform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The testimony of Officers Davis, Petitt, and Hoover, if believed, is sufficient to establish that Pierce caused the officers to come into contact with his blood by expelling the spit and blood in his mouth upon the officers. Accordingly, Pierce's convictions for harassment by an inmate are supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Pierce's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 54} After thoroughly reviewing the record, we find that the jury's verdict form for the escape offense failed to comply with R.C. 2945.75 because it did not state the degree of the offense nor state that an aggravating element was found. Thus, we reduce Pierce's escape conviction to a fifth-degree felony. The trial court's sentence for third-degree felony escape is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for the limited purpose of resentencing Pierce on the fifth-degree felony escape conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 55} We affirm the trial court's judgment in all other respects. We cannot say that the trial court's ruling denying defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was clearly erroneous. The trial court did not\n   commit plain error by failing to provide the jury with an intoxication instruction. Pierce's convictions for harassment by inmate are supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Judgment affirmed in part, modified in part, and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., and SEAN C. GALLAGHER, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Prospective Juror 6's nationality and race are unclear from the record. Defense counsel suggested that she is African American; the trial court opined that she is Latin American; and the prosecutor opined that she is Hispanic.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
