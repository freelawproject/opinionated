Under these circumstances, we hold that it may and therefore affirm the Appellate Division order, which reached the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The federal courts have long permitted federal agencies responding to Freedom of Information Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [FOIA] ) requests to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive documents-a so-called Glomar response-when the agency's acknowledgement that it possesses responsive documents would itself reveal information protected from disclosure under a FOIA exemption. In the context presented here, where a law enforcement agency was asked to disclose records relating to a police investigation and surveillance activities involving two specific individuals and associated organizations-information protected under the law enforcement and public safety exemptions of Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 -such a response is compatible with the FOIL statute and our precedent interpreting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2012, petitioners Talib Abdur-Rashid and Samir Hashmi separately submitted targeted FOIL requests seeking any records possessed by the New York City Police Department (N.Y.PD) related to any \"surveillance\" and \"investigation\" of them as individuals and of certain specified entities with which they were associated (including a mosque and a university student association, respectively) for the six-year period immediately preceding the request. The agency denied the requests, stating in each case that the information, \"if possessed by the NYPD,\" would be protected from disclosure under various statutory exemptions, including the law enforcement, public safety and personal privacy provisions. After the NYPD adhered to those decisions on administrative appeal, petitioners commenced separate CPLR article 78 proceedings challenging the determinations. Petitioners asserted that the NYPD was engaged in an ongoing domestic surveillance program in which, as alleged in press articles, it had targeted Muslim individuals, places of worship, businesses, schools, student groups and the like. It was in this context that petitioners attempted to ascertain whether they were subjects of surveillance or investigation, noting that they had supplied certifications of identity waiving their personal privacy interests and authorizing the\n   NYPD to release responsive records to their attorneys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The NYPD's response, although styled as a motion to dismiss the petition in each case, did not assert a procedural objection but defended the FOIL responses on the merits. The agency explained the basis for its denial of the FOIL requests and its refusal to disclose whether it possessed responsive documents in a 22-page affidavit of its Chief of Intelligence, Thomas Galati. Without offering any specific information relating to petitioners, Chief Galati described the NYPD's ongoing and wide-ranging counterterrorism efforts, acknowledging that the agency was actively engaged in covert surveillance and other intelligence gathering in its effort to preempt acts of terrorism in New York City, which remains a prime target in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks. The Galati affidavit averred that disclosure of whether the NYPD possesses records responsive to the FOIL requests would necessarily reveal whether petitioners had been the subjects of its investigation,\n   information which-particularly if aggregated-would provide unprecedented and invaluable information concerning NYPD counterterrorism strategies, operations, tactics and techniques to those planning future terrorist attacks. The Galati affidavit also averred that the NYPD intelligence strategies are monitored by individuals and organizations with the goal of developing counterintelligence measures, and the greatest vulnerability to the NYPD Intelligence Bureau is the release of even \"seemingly innocuous information\" which would inexorably reveal sources from which information is gathered by the NYPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The proceedings were assigned to different justices for resolution. In\n   <em>\n    Abdur-Rashid,\n   </em>\n   Supreme Court granted the NYPD's motion to dismiss and denied the petition, reasoning that the NYPD demonstrated that its response-including its refusal to acknowledge whether responsive records existed-was not prohibited by FOIL as the records sought were exempt from disclosure under the statute and the cases interpreting it (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267444\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc3d/45/888/\">\n    45 Misc.3d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267444\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc3d/45/888/\">\n    992 N.Y.S.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Sup. Ct., NY County 2014] ). In\n   <em>\n    Hashmi,\n   </em>\n   although not disputing that the content of responsive records may be exempt, Supreme Court, among other things, denied the motion to dismiss on the rationale that the NYPD's failure to acknowledge whether or not responsive records existed was impermissible under FOIL (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957101\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/46/712/\">\n    46 Misc.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , N.Y.S.2d 596 [Sup. Ct., NY County 2014] ). Hearing the cases together, the Appellate Division affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Abdur-Rashid\n   </em>\n   and, among other things, reversed the order denying the motion to dismiss in\n   <em>\n    Hashmi,\n   </em>\n   granting the motion and dismissing the petition (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5773859,5775228\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/140/419/\">\n    140 A.D.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775228\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/140/419/5775228/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). The Appellate Division reasoned that, through the affidavits of Chief Galati, the NYPD had \"establish[ed] that confirming or denying the existence of the records would reveal whether petitioners or certain locations or organizations were the targets of surveillance, and would jeopardize NYPD investigations and counterterrorism efforts\" in contravention of the law enforcement and public safety exemptions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 421,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775228\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/140/419/5775228/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, the Court held that NYPD's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records was consistent with FOIL and the cases construing it. We granted petitioners leave to appeal (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284032,12283905,12283917,12284046,12283931,12284060,12283944,12284073,12283829,12284089,12283963,12283840,12284102,12283976,12283855,12283986,12284125,12283870,12283999,12284137,12283883,12284015,12283894,12284151\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/908/\">\n    28 N.Y.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.Y.S.3d%20223\">\n    47 N.Y.S.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.3d%201019\">\n    69 N.E.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To promote open government and public accountability, FOIL imposes a broad duty on government agencies to make their records available to the public (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Officers Law \u00a7 84 ). The statute is based on the policy that \"the public is vested\n   with an inherent right to know and that official secrecy is anathematic to our form of government\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Fink v.

Consistent with the legislative declaration in Public Officers Law \u00a7 84, FOIL is liberally construed and its statutory exemptions narrowly interpreted (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Data Tree, LLC v.

Nor may the courts order disclosure of records deemed\n   <em>\n    confidential\n   </em>\n   by the Legislature: \"[o]nce it is determined that the requested material falls within a FOIL exemption, no further [balancing of interests] or policy analysis is required\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.Y.S.2d%20715\">\n    580 N.Y.S.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20750\">\n    588 N.E.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From the outset of FOIL, the legislature expressly exempted certain agency records from public access, recognizing that there is sometimes \"a legitimate need on the part of government to keep some matters confidential\" (\n   <em>\n    Fink,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4371434\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/47/567/#p571\">\n    47 N.Y.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=419%20N.Y.S.2d%20467\">\n    419 N.Y.S.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20N.E.2d%20463\">\n    393 N.E.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). For example, the law enforcement exemption and the public safety exemption, which the NYPD relied on here, protect records that, if disclosed, would interfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings, reveal nonroutine criminal investigative techniques or endanger the\n   life or safety of any person ( Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][e][i], [iv], [f] ). When interpreting these provisions, we have emphasized that \"the purpose of [FOIL] is not to enable persons to use agency records to frustrate pending or threatened investigations nor to use that information to construct a defense to impede a prosecution\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Madeiros v.

Petitioner argued, among other things, that the District Attorney had not adequately explained how the release of records relating to a publicly acknowledged prosecution would interfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings.

Thus, in the case of a pending criminal investigation or prosecution, a law enforcement agency is not required to make a specific evidentiary showing relating to the likelihood that disclosure of records would pose any unique or unusual danger of interference in the individual case that is the subject of the request (\n   <em>\n    Lesher,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    19 N.Y.3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    945 N.Y.S.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    968 N.E.2d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Before criminal proceedings have commenced, the inherent dangers of premature disclosure are even greater. In fact, the need for government confidentiality may be at its zenith when a law enforcement agency is undertaking a covert investigation of individuals or organizations, where the lives of the public, cooperators and undercover officers may hang precariously in the balance and the reputation, livelihood or liberty of the subject may be at stake. This Court has never held that FOIL compels a law enforcement agency to reveal records relating to an ongoing criminal investigation of\n   a particular individual or organization to the target, the press or anyone else-and the structure and purpose of the law enforcement and public safety exemptions in Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 are rendered meaningless by a contrary conclusion. The dissent does not argue otherwise and petitioners in this case no longer challenge the applicability of the cited exemptions to the content of the investigation and surveillance records they requested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the thrust of petitioners' argument is that, when declining to disclose records which fall squarely within an exemption, the NYPD must specify whether or not it possesses materials responsive to the FOIL request even when doing so would reveal information safeguarded by that same FOIL exemption. Taken to its logical extreme, petitioners argue a Catch-22 paradigm where the NYPD would have to acknowledge the existence of an investigation involving a particular person notwithstanding that the contents of any responsive records would be exempt and revelation of their existence would result in the same harm justifying exemption of the contents-whether the FOIL request comes from the target, a newspaper or some other member of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The NYPD counters that this Court should follow the commonsense doctrine employed by the federal courts, which have recognized that it is permissible under the federal statutory scheme of FOIA for a federal agency to decline to acknowledge possession of responsive records when the fact that responsive records exist would itself reveal information protected under a FOIA exemption. Federal recognition of this policy dates back to\n   <em>\n    Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5691852,1010007\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/546/1009/\">\n    546 F.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [D.C.

The District of Columbia Circuit credited the CIA's explanation that, to require it to reveal whether it possessed records relating to the vessel would be tantamount to requiring it to reveal its connection to the vessel-a fact exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemptions 1 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b][1], protecting materials classified pursuant to Executive Order) and 3 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b][3], protecting materials \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute\").

The District of Columbia Circuit emphasized that the specific request could not be viewed in isolation, particularly there where the CIA had received 125 similar requests seeking information relating to about 100 American colleges and universities. Acknowledgment of the existence of records concerning any one institution, when aggregated, could reveal substantial information relating to the CIA's covert activities and assist foreign intelligence\n   bodies in determining which institutions to avoid and where to concentrate their efforts. In\n   <em>\n    Gardels,\n   </em>\n   the court reasoned that the CIA could properly treat all such requests uniformly by providing a Glomar response, neither revealing the existence or nonexistence of responsive records with respect to any one institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Given that our statute was modeled after FOIA, we have repeatedly looked to federal precedent when interpreting FOIL, particularly in relation to the law enforcement exemptions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Friedman v.

And while it is not necessary for us to consider on this appeal whether there are other circumstances when a Glomar-type response might be permissible under FOIL, the analysis in the federal cases is instructive in the unique situation presented here where a targeted request seeks records concerning a specific individual's involvement in a pending NYPD investigation. As these cases demonstrate, there are indeed occasions when, due in large part to the precise manner in which the FOIL request is structured, an interpretation of the statute that compels a law enforcement agency to reveal that responsive records exist with respect to a specific individual or organization would, in effect, force the agency to disclose substantive information that is protected under FOIL's law enforcement and public safety exemptions. Just as requiring the CIA to state whether it possesses documents relating to the Hughes Glomar Explorer would reveal whether or not it was connected to that vessel, compelling the NYPD to state whether or not it possesses \"investigative or surveillance\" records would reveal substantive information concerning an individual's involvement with the NYPD investigation. Put another way, when there is a FOIL request as to whether a specific individual or organization is being investigated or surveilled, the agency-in order to avoid \"tipping its hand\"-must be permitted to provide a Glomar-type response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We reject petitioners' argument that there is a textual basis in New\n   York's FOIL statute foreclosing an agency from declining to reveal whether responsive documents exist when it is denying a FOIL request based on a statutory exemption. The general rule requiring an agency to acknowledge the existence of responsive records stems from the presumption of access-it is usually necessary for an agency to reveal that a particular record exists in order to demonstrate the applicability of an exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But there is no specific statutory language requiring an agency to certify the existence of records wholly protected under an exemption. Petitioners rely on Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), which states that an agency \"shall certify that it does not have possession of such record or that such record cannot be found after diligent search.\" However, that provision is triggered when, in lieu of granting a FOIL request, the agency finds that it either does not possess the item requested or is unable to locate it after a diligent search (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rattley v. New York City Police Dept.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203111\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/873/#p874\">\n    96 N.Y.2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874-875,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203111\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/873/#p874\">\n    730 N.Y.S.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203111\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/96/873/#p874\">\n    756 N.E.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2001] ); it does not require certification of the existence of records for which the agency is claiming an exemption. Here, the NYPD based its denial on the applicability of various exemptions and not on an inability to locate responsive documents after\n   a diligent search. Nor is the response inconsistent with the provisions in section 89(3)(a) identifying the three permissible final responses to a FOIL request: (1) grant the request and disclose documents, (2) certify that the record cannot be found after a diligent search, or (3) \"deny such request,\" invoking one or more exemptions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Beechwood Restorative Care Ctr. v. Signor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"983960\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/435/#p440\">\n    5 N.Y.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440-441,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"983960\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/435/#p440\">\n    808 N.Y.S.2d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"983960\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/435/#p440\">\n    842 N.E.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2005] ). The determinations under review, in which the NYPD refused to turn over any records relying on multiple exemptions, fell into the third category-a denial of the request for records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is the rare case where, due to the surrounding circumstances and the manner in which a FOIL request is structured, acknowledging that any responsive records exist would, itself, reveal information tethered to a narrow exemption under FOIL. But when a FOIL request seeks to ascertain if a specific person or organization is under investigation by the NYPD Intelligence Bureau, such a response is entirely consistent with the purpose and structure of our statute. To recognize that those unusual circumstances coalesce here does not create a broad judicial exemption as the dissent erroneously claims. Rather, we are applying a commonsense interpretation of the relevant statutory language to give full effect to the law enforcement and public safety exemptions carefully crafted by the legislature, as interpreted for decades by this Court. A model of understatement, the dissent recognizes that requiring an agency to acknowledge the existence of records in these circumstances \"may have concerning implications\" (dissenting op. at 270-271, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 496-97, 100 N.E.3d at 835-36) but protests that the Court is powerless to avoid such a result-that only the Legislature can intervene. We disagree. The legislature has already acted by adopting the law enforcement and public safety exemptions-the task of\n   interpreting them falls squarely within the province of the courts. At bottom, the legislative intent was not to provide public access to information, the secrecy of which is necessary to sustain the government's legitimate exercise of police powers to investigate criminal activity. We will not abdicate our fundamental role to interpret the statutory language to give full effect to the FOIL exemptions implicated in this case, just as the federal courts have done in the Glomar cases. While the dissent rightfully expresses concern about \"blanket\" or \"carte blanche\" exemptions, we endorse nothing of the sort here as our decision is premised on respondents' factual demonstration of the necessity for non-access, which is addressed below. Like the federal courts, our courts must scrutinize an agency's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of responsive documents on a case-by-case basis to ensure it is warranted under the particular circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, in assessing the propriety of the agency's refusal to reveal whether responsive records exist, we begin with the requests themselves, which were both extremely specific and quite unusual. Indeed, we know of no other FOIL case in which individuals who had never been arrested, involved in a police confrontation or formally charged have asked a police agency to acknowledge if they were under investigation. Abdur-Rashid requested records relating to any \"investigation\" or \"surveillance\" of himself, individually or in his capacity as leader of a religious institution. Hashmi similarly sought all records relating to \"investigation\" or \"surveillance\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   of himself or a student group with which he is associated. In their petitions, both men referred to news articles describing the NYPD's ongoing counterterrorism investigation and surveillance program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners seek to learn their connection, if any, to this endeavor-anyone\n   who suspects, reasonably or otherwise, that they are the subject of or even a peripheral figure in a covert police investigation might understandably feel the same. However, FOIL was never designed to compel a law enforcement agency to disclose inherently confidential, investigatory information of this nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioners' requests for information concerning a recent or ongoing investigation by a law enforcement agency implicate the core concerns underlying the law enforcement and public safety exemptions. Under\n   <em>\n    Lesher,\n   </em>\n   the agency could meet its obligation to provide a factual basis for the exemptions by identifying the generic kind of records for which the exemption was claimed and the generic risks posed by disclosure of those types of records. The Galati affidavits fulfilled that requirement. Without revealing any specific information about these petitioners (which it could not do without revealing the very information it claimed was exempt), the affidavit explained in extensive detail how disclosing the information sought-i.e., who has been the subject of investigation or surveillance-would imperil its ongoing counterterrorism efforts to protect New York City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Chief Galati noted that, unlike other NYPD units that investigate crimes after they have occurred (essentially gathering evidence to reconstruct a past event), the intelligence unit of the NYPD is tasked with the objective to be preemptive-amassing information to deter, detect and thwart future terrorist activity. He described numerous, recent cases involving terrorist activity in New York City, demonstrating that the City remains a primary target for terrorist attacks and that, working jointly and sharing information with other state and federal law enforcement agencies, his unit plays a pivotal role in identifying terrorist plots and arresting those involved in order to prevent planned attacks designed to cause mass casualties. The unit gathers information from a myriad of sources, from undercover operations and confidential informants to open sources, as well as a well-publicized counterterrorism hotline, welcoming any and all leads from the public on a promise of confidentiality. Chief Galati averred that it was essential to the\n   operational integrity of the intelligence program that it be\n   able\n   to keep confidential the information it gathers, the sources it uses and the methodologies and tactics it employs to defend against countermeasures used by individuals and organizations to expose the vulnerabilities in the NYPD program. The NYPD's role in preventing the next attack is dependent on its ability to collect information without publicizing its methods or sources to anyone who can use the information to counter its efforts, an assertion consistent with the basic realities of intelligence work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, Chief Galati asserted that the FOIL requests under review here could not be viewed in isolation, noting that the NYPD was beginning to receive similar requests from others. In particular, Chief Galati highlighted the recent initiation of a mass FOIL campaign by a local organization, which encouraged and assisted constituents in submitting requests to the NYPD \"FOILing\" themselves. The affidavit explained that, if records from disparate requests were aggregated, this would place any individual response into a larger mosaic which could be used to analyze NYPD's counterterrorism operation and identify areas of focus and sources of information. Critically, Chief Galati contended that compelling the NYPD to acknowledge that it possesses records responsive to the request-even if it did not turn over documents-would reveal whether petitioners or the organizations with which they are affiliated were subjects of NYPD investigative interest, information that is itself exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Appellate Division did not err in determining that the Galati affidavit established a factual basis for the exemptions claimed under the circumstances presented. This is true even though the NYPD does not claim (nor could it, consistent with its desire to maintain secrecy) that petitioners or their organizations are connected in any way with its pending counterterrorism investigation. As the federal courts have recognized (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardels,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1469833,3636301\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/689/1100/\">\n    689 F.2d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), a Glomar-type response would be ineffective if it were permissible only when the agency possesses responsive records, even though that is the situation when it is most evident that revealing the existence of the records would damage a pending investigation. Such a myopic approach would prove unworkable because it would not be difficult to distinguish between individuals and organizations who are under investigation (who would receive a Glomar-type response) and those who are not (who would be\n   told that responsive records do not exist). Thus, in the circumstances presented here, when confronted with a targeted FOIL request of this nature, a police agency must be permitted to give a uniform response-to decline to confirm or deny the existence of responsive material in either scenario-on the rationale that whether or not it is investigating a particular person or organization constitutes information that is itself statutorily exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, petitioners argue that even if-as we have concluded-an agency can decline to acknowledge that responsive records exist in these unique circumstances, various safeguards recognized by the federal courts preclude the NYPD's use of such a response here. For example, petitioners contend that an agency cannot decline to reveal the existence of records when it has publicly revealed the information for which it is claiming an exemption. They further argue that the NYPD invoked Glomar in a bad faith effort to cover up embarrassing or unlawful acts, such as its use of racial or religious profiling. We caution that we have no occasion in this case to consider whether a Glomar-type response is available under FOIL in any circumstance other than that presented\n   here where the request involves an ongoing\n   criminal investigation, nor do we adopt wholesale the approach taken by the federal courts. That being said, we agree that a police agency that has already revealed the records sought and for which it claims an exemption cannot credibly support such a response. Here, petitioners have not come forward with any evidence that the NYPD publicly acknowledged that it investigated or surveilled petitioners or the organizations referenced in their specific FOIL requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As for bad faith, the strongest safeguard against misuse of a FOIL exemption is the factual showing requirement. An agency denying a FOIL request must establish a bona fide, factual basis for the exemptions claimed and any evidence that undermines that showing is material to the court's assessment of the adequacy of the agency's submission-including a claim of bad faith. Although there is no language in the statute authorizing the procedure, New York courts have interpreted FOIL to permit in camera review of sensitive or confidential materials when the court deems such a procedure appropriate or necessary in a particular case to test the legitimacy of a claim of confidentiality or to oversee the redaction process in cases where portions of a record are subject to disclosure (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of New York Times Co. v.

Notably, the Galati affidavit set forth the types of investigative activities which the NYPD is authorized to conduct in furtherance of its goals of detecting or preventing terrorist activities, none of which hinted at an insidious type of surveillance (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Capolongo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434082\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/151/#p160\">\n    85 N.Y.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434082\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/151/#p160\">\n    623 N.Y.S.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434082\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/151/#p160\">\n    647 N.E.2d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1995] ). Here, the Galati affidavit was properly deemed sufficient to meet the factual basis requirement for the invocation of the statutory exemption. However, there may well be instances when the FOIL request is more general, either in terms of its subject or the nature of the materials sought, where the propriety of a Glomar-type response is less clear from the law enforcement agency affidavit, or where indicia of improper motive significantly undermine the asserted basis for the exemption. In that event, some form of in camera review may be warranted, even if modifications to the typical procedure are necessary. Thus, our existing FOIL paradigm contains important safeguards against misuse of the exemptions\n   that are no less available in the rare instance when a law enforcement agency\n   denying a request neither confirms nor denies the existence of responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It bears emphasizing, as is also true under FOIA, that if an agency establishes that the records sought fall within a FOIL exemption adopted by the legislature, the courts cannot order disclosure based on some other public policy concern asserted by a party or the court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanig,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4425549\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/106/#p110\">\n    79 N.Y.2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.Y.S.2d%20715\">\n    580 N.Y.S.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20750\">\n    588 N.E.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minier v.

While FOIL is an important tool in ensuring government transparency and public accountability, it is not-and was never designed to be-the only check against government overreach. For example, post-use notice requirements are set by the legislature for intrusive police surveillance, taking into account the need to protect the secrecy of the pending investigation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPL 700.50[3] ). Complaints of unconstitutional discriminatory actions have resulted in federal court actions and settlements (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Handschu v. Special Services Div.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755075\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/605/1384/#p1416\">\n    605 F.Supp. 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1416 [S.D. N.Y.1985] ). Further, petitioners' claims that an NYPD investigative unit engaged in improper racial and religious profiling were the subject of numerous press articles. As averred in the Galati affidavit, the NYPD-while denying any wrongdoing-has nonetheless changed its policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For all of these reasons, under the circumstances presented here, where necessary to give full effect to the law enforcement and public safety statutory exemptions, the NYPD's response neither confirming nor denying the existence of the investigative or surveillance records sought is compatible with FOIL and the policy underlying those exemptions, which is to provide the public access to records without compromising a core function of government-the investigation, prevention and prosecution of crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    While petitioners waived their own privacy interests, they did not claim to have the authority to waive the privacy interests of other members of the associated entities with respect to which they also sought information.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    In New York, challenges to FOIL determinations are resolved in summary proceedings pursuant to CPLR article 78 (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Public Officer's Law \u00a7 89[4][b] ). Where-as here-exemptions are relied upon, \"the agency involved shall have the burden of proving that such record falls within\" the claimed exemptions (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ). Beyond merely disposing of motions to dismiss, here the Appellate Division considered the petitions on the merits, concluding the NYPD met its burden of justifying its reliance on FOIL exemptions in each instance to shield the existence and contents of any responsive records. Whether the court erred in that regard presents an issue of law in this Court. We therefore disagree with the suggestion that the merits are not ripe for adjudication by virtue of a \"scant record\" or \"contested facts\" (Wilson, J., concurring and dissenting op. at 257, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 486-87, 100 N.E.3d at 825-26).

There the Appellate Division indicated that these documents fell within the law enforcement exemption. Petitioners do not dispute that the \"investigation\" and \"surveillance\" records they seek here, if they exist, would be a subset of the documents they acknowledge were properly treated as exempt in\n    <em>\n     AALDEF\n    </em>\n    . While, as the dissent notes, petitioners have not been provided with the records requested, they could have argued that records of a recent or pending covert investigation of specific individuals are not exempt from disclosure-but it is telling that neither they nor the dissent make such a claim. Instead, the dissent essentially ignores the fact that petitioners specifically requested \"investigation\" and \"surveillance\" records-not some other class of documents without a clear connection to such activities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Although we find federal law persuasive, we reach this conclusion by interpreting FOIL's statutory exemptions and our cases construing them-there has been no \"blind adoption of a federal judicial doctrine\" (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    dissenting opn. at 267, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 494, 100 N.E.3d at 833). That being said, we are unpersuaded that there are relevant textual distinctions between the provisions of FOIA and FOIL. The fact that FOIL requires that a request be \"denied\" whereas FOIA permits an agency to treat FOIA as \"not apply[ing]\" to exempt matters in no way impacts the Glomar issue, nor has any federal court relied on the dissent's novel textual analysis. The 1986 amendment adding\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 USC \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) -discussed extensively by the dissent-likewise in no way undermined the commonsense analysis underlying the federal Glomar cases that precede or follow it, which do not restrict the doctrine to classified or national security materials under exemptions 1 and 3. The dissent's speculation that the analysis is unavailable or limited in cases involving FOIA's law enforcement exemptions is unsupported and inconsistent with cases indicating just the opposite (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vazquez,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318225\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/887/114/\">\n     887 F.Supp.2d 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States Dept. of Justice v.

Moreover, the dissent's analysis misses the mark for the more fundamental reason that it fails to focus on the facts of this case and the contours of New York's law enforcement and public safety exemptions-which are controlling here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    In most instances, the fact that an agency possesses responsive records does not itself provide substantive information protected by an exemption. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Lesher,\n    </em>\n    the pending prosecution was a matter of public record and, as such, the fact that the District Attorney possessed responsive records did not reveal confidential information-only the contents of those records fell within an exemption. Thus, in cases like\n    <em>\n     Lesher\n    </em>\n    involving pending or completed prosecutions, a request for records related to a defendant in the possession of the pertinent police agency would be unlikely to engender a Glomar-type response because the fact that defendant has been the subject of investigation is obvious from the prosecution itself. In that scenario, the contents of the records may or may not be exempt under FOIL, but the fact that responsive records exist would not be.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The dissent's conclusion to the contrary is puzzling. FOIL provides a mechanism for public access to records and, here, the NYPD expressly and categorically denied petitioners' FOIL requests. In this case, if responsive records do not exist, petitioners were not entitled to disclosure of anything. If responsive records do exist, the question is whether either their contents-or the fact that they exist, which itself may disclose confidential information-is protected under one or more FOIL exemptions. We believe this is the central issue in the case, which the dissent entirely fails to confront. If the existence of records is protected information under a statutory exemption, nothing in FOIL compels its disclosure. In this regard, it is the dissent that adopts a new requirement found nowhere in the text of the statute-a requirement that, in all instances, an agency expressly certify that responsive records exist, regardless of whether the existence of the records is protected under an exemption.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The dissent faults the Galati affidavit for justifying the NYPD's response by referencing its counterterrorism investigation, lamenting that \"we do not know if any past or current investigations of petitioners actually related to counterterrorism\" (dissenting op. at 265, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 492-93, 100 N.E.3d at 832). However, the NYPD response cannot be so easily dismissed. In the petitions, petitioners referenced news articles alleging that the NYPD was engaged in an ongoing domestic surveillance program involving Muslim individuals and institutions. The news articles reported that, in the wake of the September 11th attacks, the NYPD, with the assistance of the CIA, had undertaken a covert domestic counterterrorism operation in the tri-state area. The NYPD thus interpreted petitioners' request for \"investigation\" and \"surveillance\" records (for a discrete time period immediately preceding the request) as relating to that ongoing investigation, described in detail in the Galati affidavit; this was not the product of an \"unsupported assumption\" (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    dissenting op. at 265, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 492, 100 N.E.3d at 831). The NYPD could not have provided more specific information relating to these individuals without disclosing precisely the information claimed to be exempt-i.e., whether petitioners were subjects of the investigation they referenced-which is exactly the purpose of the refusal to confirm or deny the existence of the information sought.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Despite its concern about judicial overreach, the dissent endorses the in camera review procedure, taking no issue with this exercise of judicial prerogative. While noting the absence of in camera review (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    dissenting op. at 266, 270, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 492-93, 495-96, 100 N.E.3d at 831-32, 834-35), the dissent neither suggests that the nisi prius court abused its discretion by failing to invoke the procedure nor explains what types of materials could have been submitted that would have warranted a different outcome here where no one disputes that the requested \"investigation\" or \"surveillance\" records, if they exist, are exempt from disclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-46\">\n   WILSON, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We have not before been asked whether a governmental agency may, in response to a Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law art 6 [FOIL] ) request, decline to confirm or deny the existence of documents. All of us agree that FOIL expresses New York's strong policy command that, subject to limited exceptions, government documents must be made available to the public; that FOIL differs from and is more powerful than FOIA (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and that the public is not permitted to use FOIL to disrupt law enforcement operations. FOIL eschews a police state in which citizens are subject to the secret whims of government, yet recognizes the immense public interest in the effective and faithful enforcement of law. As the majority points out, the dissent's position is unsupportable, because FOIL does not require that an agency state whether documents exist if that disclosure itself would reveal information falling within an exemption. As the dissent explains, the majority's\n   position, though repeatedly self-described as narrow and pertaining solely to the facts of this case, logically requires that the NYPD-or any other governmental agency charged with law enforcement-should respond to all FOIL requests seeking information about investigations by refusing to state whether any responsive documents exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I write separately to explain what the process compelled by FOIL and our prior decisions should be. In this case, that\n   process would result in a partial remittal. I have organized my explanation as follows.\n   <em>\n    First,\n   </em>\n   neither FOIL nor our decisional law interpreting it requires an agency to confirm or deny the existence of protected documents if such confirmation or denial would itself be protected by an exemption.\n   <em>\n    Second,\n   </em>\n   conforming our FOIL doctrine to the FOIA Glomar doctrine is inappropriate, because of the unique foreign policy concerns underlying the Glomar doctrine and the criticism of federal decisions expanding that doctrine into more mundane areas.\n   <em>\n    Third,\n   </em>\n   agencies must evaluate the specific terms of each FOIL request and, if appropriate, make partial responses differentiated by the scope of the request and the nature of documents the agency possesses.\n   <em>\n    Fourth,\n   </em>\n   the procedural safeguards proffered by the NYPD, along with some additional safeguards, should be part of the CPLR Article 78 process when a FOIL applicant seeks to challenge an agency's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of records on the ground that the act of doing so would itself disclose protected information.\n   <em>\n    Fifth,\n   </em>\n   the evidence tendered here by the NYPD is not sufficient to meet its prima facie burden to justify its wholesale nonresponse or to overcome the objections raised by the petitioners. Although that evidence is presently insufficient, I would remit to Supreme Court to give the parties the opportunity to present evidence in line with the process and guidelines I suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I begin with FOIL's language. Within five business days of receiving a written request for records, an agency \"[i] shall make such record available to the person requesting it, [ii] deny such request in writing or [iii] furnish a written acknowledgement of the receipt of such request and a statement of the approximate date ... when such request will be granted or denied.\" ( Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3][a] ). The statutory language authorizing denial of a request does not require the agency to offer any reason for the denial at this stage. Thus, at this initial stage an agency is permitted merely to deny a\n   request, without explanation-and certainly without any requirement to state whether such documents do or do not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As a second step, any person whose request is denied may take an administrative appeal to the agency's director or her designee, who then has ten business days to provide the responsive records or \"fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 89[4][a] ). The statute does not state that the \"full explanation\" must identify any particular document's existence, or the existence of responsive documents at all. Thus, if the response to a request would itself reveal exempt information, the \"full explanation\" could state only that. For example, \u00a7 87(2)(h) exempts \"examination questions or answers which are requested prior to the final administration of such questions.\" In anticipation of sitting for a police officer examination, I might lodge a FOIL request asking for all documents concerning any questions on the forthcoming test that relate to this court's\n   <em>\n    DeBour\n   </em>\n   factors. Confirming that such documents exist would tell me that I should study those factors; confirming that they do not exist would tell me not to bother. I might serve hundreds of similar requests which, if answered, would give me a very good idea of the test's composition. A satisfactory \"full response in writing\" to my request would be that the request seeks to compromise the test, and without confirming or denying whether any such documents exist, if they did they would be exempt from disclosure. But if I asked the same questions for a test given in the\n   1970s, that response would be patently unsatisfactory.\n   As a third step, a person displeased with the result of the second step (or whose administrative appeal is not timely resolved) may commence an Article 78 petition in Supreme Court (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 89[4][b] ). In that proceeding, the agency \"shall have the burden of proving that such record falls within the provisions of\" one of the exceptions contained in \u00a7 87(2) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). That, then, brings us to the question in this case: what does the agency's burden entail when the agency asserts that the acknowledgement of the existence or nonexistence of documents would itself fall within an exception?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The statute is silent as to any requirements specifically pertaining to such an Article 78 challenge. Although FOIL's process requires agencies to explain why any records they withhold are be exempt from disclosure, no provision in the statute\n   requires those agencies in possession of responsive but exempt documents to disclose the existence of those documents in every case. Instead, the statute contemplates a spectrum of increasingly circumscribed, and increasingly difficult to justify, responses. To be sure, FOIL's goal of extending public accountability \"wherever and whenever feasible\" requires agencies to disclose as much information as is not protected by an exemption (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 84); exemptions are to be applied only to the relevant \"records or portions thereof\" and requests are to be \"granted ... in part\" whenever possible (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 87 [2]; 89 [3] [a] ). Thus, if an agency establishes a responsive document contains protected information, it will be \"required to prepare a redacted version\" (\n   <em>\n    Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5557321\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/9/454/#p462\">\n    9 N.Y.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5557321\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/9/454/#p462\">\n    849 N.Y.S.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5557321\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/9/454/#p462\">\n    880 N.E.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2007] ).

By extension, if an agency establishes that enumeration would divulge protected information, it may acknowledge the existence of, but choose not to in any way describe, the withheld documents (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union v.

In the \"rare case\" (majority op. at 233, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 469-70, 100 N.E.3d at 808-09) where an agency establishes that even acknowledging the existence of responsive documents would divulge information protected by any one of the FOIL exemptions, it may provide an evidentiary basis for its conclusion while refusing to admit or deny the existence of any requested documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The majority's reliance on the federal Glomar doctrine is misplaced. Yes, FOIL was structurally modeled on FOIA. However, as the dissent explains, the Glomar doctrine arises not from FOIA's law enforcement exemption, but from FOIA's exemption of documents \"specifically authorized under criteria\n   established by an\n   Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b] [1] [A] ), which has no analog in FOIL. The Constitution arrogates\n   national defense and foreign policy to the federal government; the NYPD is not searching for a lost Soviet submarine or worried about the foreign policy consequences thereof. Both the majority and dissent tar their FOIL analysis by referring to the NYPD's response as a \"Glomar\" response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Glomar's peculiar history has had a profound effect on its logic. FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, together with certain national security-related statutes, create a \"near-blanket ... exemption\" for properly classified materials and CIA records (\n   <em>\n    Minier v. Cent. Intelligence Agency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047344\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/796/#p802\">\n    88 F.3d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801 [9th Cir.1996] ). The exemptions' near-blanket nature opens the door to the federal judiciary's hands-off approach. The national security-related content of FOIA exceptions 1 and 3, coupled with a sense of the uniquely executive purview of national security, pushes judges through it: federal courts consistently reaffirm their \"deferential posture\" in Glomar cases (\n   <em>\n    Larson v. Dep't of State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 [D.C. Cir.2009] ). By way of example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit believes that it is \"in an extremely poor position to second-guess the predictive judgments made by the government's intelligence agencies regarding questions such as whether a country's changed political climate has yet neutralized the risk of harm to national security posed by disclosing particular intelligence sources\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The federal courts' routine deference to Glomar responses \"has been justified on both constitutional and prudential separation of powers grounds: Courts opine that protection of national security information is entrusted to the executive under Article II of the Constitution and that courts lack the competence to assess executive determinations to withhold national security information\" (Nathan Freed Wessler, \"[ We] Can Neither Confirm Nor Deny the Existence or Nonexistence of Records Responsive to Your Request\": Reforming the Glomar Response Under FOIA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%201381\">\n    85 NYU L Rev 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1398 [2010] ). It has also been criticized for resting on \"concerns about comparative competence [that] are overblown and are outweighed by the institutional conflict of interest that arises when the executive branch makes essentially unreviewed decisions to withhold its own records from disclosure\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Those foreign-policy insecurities have no place in New York State's excellent unified court system. Our government\n   features neither a unitary executive tasked with the national defense nor an elaborate system of classified information to which courts routinely defer. Most CIA endeavors will never see the light of day, let alone that of a courthouse; the destiny of every successful NYPD investigation is to appear before a judge. Regardless of federal courts' competence to evaluate foreign countries' changing political climates, we are not similarly handicapped in judging the soundness of FOIL exemptions based on police, privacy, or other justifications. Our courts are fully capable of scrutinizing an agency's response ''on a case-by-case basis to ensure it is warranted under the particular circumstances presented\" (majority op. at 234, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 470, 100 N.E.3d at 809).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Glomar aside, both the majority and the dissent come to what I view as unsound resolutions because they fail to consider two important propositions. First, the scope of a particular FOIL request affects the appropriateness of a response refusing\n   to admit or deny the existence of documents. Second, an agency, in responding to a FOIL request, may not be able to make a single response that is appropriate\n   for all the information sought by the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Consider two requests: (1) all documents the NYPD possesses concerning any investigation of me; (2) all documents the NYPD possesses concerning any female undercover officer present at the XYZ bar on the evening of February 27, 2018. FOIL requires a different agency response to these two requests, and the former requires far more proof than the latter to justify a refusal to admit or deny the existence of documents. In the case of the latter request, the request facially is to determine the identity of an undercover officer or the existence of an ongoing investigation, and no extrinsic proof should be required to justify the NYPD's refusal to admit or deny the existence of documents. The dissent's absolutist position would require the NYPD to respond that documents do (or do not), exist, which is neither required by FOIL nor responsible public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the other hand, the majority's treatment of Mr. Abdur-Rashid's request-which is very much like request (1) above-prompts the dissent's salvo at the expansive implications of the majority's writing, allowing the NYPD to \"claim the right to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of any record that even tangentially relates to any past, present, or future investigation of 'crime,' thereby avoiding its FOIL obligations in innumerable\n   cases\" (dissenting op. at 266, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 494, 100 N.E.3d at 833).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the NYPD has in its possession documents from its surveillance of Mr. Abdur-Rashid in 1993, when he attended the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago, the majority has exempted the NYPD from saying whether it has such documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Neither the majority nor the dissent acknowledges that, in the case of a broad request such as (1) above, the agency is not entitled to give a monolithic response, and cannot give any response without examining the documents in its possession, if any. That is, FOIL expressly states that agencies may grant or deny requests \"in whole or in part\", and a broad request likely calls for a differentiated response, based on the agency's examination of what, if anything, it possesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, as the dissent notes, the requests seek information about current investigations as well as past investigations. Those two differ in the proof required. As to pending investigations, an agency's refusal to admit or deny the existence of responsive records should require little, if any, proof, because the acknowledgement of the existence of an investigation while it is pending (or being contemplated) is clearly likely to \"interfere with law enforcement investigations\". However, absent some specific proof that would bring disclosure of the existence of a past investigation within a FOIL exception, documents related to closed matters do not presumptively interfere with law enforcement investigations. Although agnostic on the question,\n   today's decision, if properly implemented, should allow the NYPD categorically to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records only if those records \"involve[ ] an\n   ongoing criminal investigation\" or were provided to it under an information-sharing agreement with federal agencies whose records are specifically exempted from disclosure (majority op. at 237, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 471-72, 100 N.E.3d at 810-11). I discuss the application to the facts of this matter in part V.\n   <em>\n    IV\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I agree with the majority that \"our existing FOIL paradigm contains important safeguards against misuse of the exemptions that are no less available in the rare instance when a Glomar-response is asserted\" (majority op. at 238, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 472-73, 100 N.E.3d at 812-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Chief among those safeguards is the parties', our lower courts', and the majority's recognition that an agency declining to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records must be held to the same standard expected of every agency that denies any part of a FOIL request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To withhold responsive records, or any information about those records (including the fact of their existence or nonexistence), an agency must demonstrate that they, or the information, \"fall[ ] squarely within a FOIL exemption by articulating a particularized and specific justification for denying access\" (\n   <em>\n    Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v.

If FOIL petitioners can establish that the existence of a document, or the information an agency seeks to protect by refusing to confirm the existence of a document, is already included in a public record, then agencies should have to disclose that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Together, these safeguards-as well as others that courts deem appropriate in discharging their obligations to adjudicate FOIL determinations challenged pursuant to Article 78-suffice to protect petitioners from overzealous assertions of an agencies' inability to confirm or deny the existence of records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    V.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, the NYPD moved to dismiss petitioners' Article 78 proceeding because it alleged confirming or denying the existence of any records responsive to their requests would cause harms cognizable under FOIL's law enforcement and public safety exemptions ( Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][e], [f] ). In support\n   of that contention, it offered a public affidavit from NYPD Chief of Intelligence Thomas Galati. Chief Galati's \"22-page affidavit\" consists of five pages describing his background and the organization of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and another seven listing public accounts of apprehending and trying terrorists. The balance avers that \"disclosure of whether responsive documents even exist necessarily would reveal whether Petitioner currently is or previously has been the subject of a counter-terrorism investigation.\" Chief Galati lists four consequences the NYPD seeks to avoid:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   1. \"The knowledge that a person or group is the subject of a NYPD counter-terrorism investigation\n   would allow that person or group to alter their behavior so as to avoid detection\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   2. \"Conversely, the knowledge that a person or group is not a subject of investigation would allow such persons to more freely engage in illegal activity\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   3. \"[A] person who knows he or she is under investigation might scrutinize his or her contacts more carefully and, in doing so, could discern the identity of an undercover police officer or confidential informant working on the case. Not only would this compromise the integrity and value of any information to be learned from such sources, but it could endanger the lives and safety of such sources\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   4. \"Disclosure of whether a particular individual or group is the subject of investigation would allow those bent on unlawful activity to prepare a roadmap of investigatory operations, decisions, techniques and information that would enable every group to anticipate investigative tactics and activities, and undermine current and future investigations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In opposing the motion to dismiss, the petitioners argued that Chief Galati's affidavit failed to establish a prima facie case for asserting such a severely circumscribed response. They also argued that, even had the case been established, it would have been defeated by the fact that the information the NYPD sought to protect was already a matter of public record, by the stricter scrutiny turned on agencies that assert FOIL exemptions in bad faith, and by in camera review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    A. The NYPD's Prima Facie Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As discussed in part III, in response to a FOIL request seeking information about investigations, I would hold that the NYPD has the right to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of documents as to any pending investigation, because such a request facially interferes with a law enforcement investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the requests here are not limited to present investigations, but include past ones as well. As to those, the NYPD has not carried its burden of articulating a particularized and specific justification for refusing to confirm or deny whether documents responsive to any of petitioners' 22 requests exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The first three harms it alleges are premised on the conjecture that individuals-presumably other than Mr. Hashmi and Mr. Abdur-Rashid, whom the record suggests are upstanding citizens-inclined to terrorism or organized crime will FOIL themselves, and then tailor the scope of their activities to either stymie investigators or exploit the discovery that they are not (or were not) under investigation. Chief Galati's affidavit, however, cannot identify ''any instance of this use of FOIL by terrorists'' (\n   <em>\n    Hashmi v. New York City Police Dep't,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957101\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/46/712/\">\n    46 Misc.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957101\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/46/712/\">\n    998 N.Y.S.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Sup. Ct., N.Y. County 2014] ), nor does it provide any factual basis to conclude that terrorists have used similar information to tailor their activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Absent such a statement, let alone the evidence thereof that our probing standard would require, it strains belief that terrorists\n   are self-identifying themselves to the NYPD by filing regular FOIL requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Those three harms fail to justify the NYPD's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of past investigations. Contrary to the majority's insistence that the requests were \"extremely specific\" and related to \"a discrete time period immediately preceding the request\", many of them were unbounded in time and in type (majority op. at 234, 238, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 470-71, 472-73, 100 N.E.3d at 809-10, 811-12). Petitioners requested, for instance, \"[a]ll records related to the surveillance of Imam Talib W. Abdur-Rashid by NYPD\", \"[a]ll records related to the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood ... relied upon by the NYPD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   that led to any report being filed\", and \"[a]ll records related to any investigation of Samir Hashmi, between 2006-2012\". Chief Galati's affidavit does not suggest that law enforcement purposes or the public safety would be compromised if the agency revealed that it had records from the 1960s pertaining to Mr. Abdur-Rashid or the mosque with which he is now affiliated (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lesher v. Hynes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    19 N.Y.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    945 N.Y.S.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751430\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/57/#p60\">\n    968 N.E.2d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2012] ), or to an investigation into noise complaints against Mr. Hashmi's college parties. FOIL's demand that agencies provide in part what records or information they cannot provide in whole should have led the agency to disclose, or Supreme Court to require it to disclose, whether relevant records from a time or of a type that did not trigger the affidavit's concerns existed. The NYPD could readily have accompanied that admission with a statement that it would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records related to ongoing terrorism investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The fourth harm alleged in Chief Galati's affidavit is more substantial. Acknowledging the existence of records responsive to requests of the kind submitted by these petitioners could, in the aggregate, provide terrorists and other criminals or criminal organizations with a guide to the people and places, or the type of people and places, monitored by the NYPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That rationale, however, is subject to the same time and type restrictions as its companions. As to time, there is some point, which the NYPD should have specified or Supreme Court should have determined, prior to which information about the NYPD's historical capabilities, strategies, and operating tactics will cease to provide today's threats with relevant information. A map of NYPD activities around Rutgers may continue to reveal important general practices, or may be considerably less germane to a world in which the NYPD has substantially curtailed or abandoned its out-of-state activities. Given the constant improvements to and alterations in NYPD capabilities and strategies, as well as the significant changes made to the Intelligence Division in the wake of the 2013 mayoral election that separated the initial request for records from the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Chief Galati's affidavit either failed to justify categorically refusing to acknowledge the existence of records pertaining to closed investigations or-equally fatally-must be taken to justify withholding such information permanently. As to type, whatever the counterintelligence capacities of gangsters and terrorists, garden-variety criminals\n   (and law-abiding citizens) are probably not piecing FOIL reports into a jigsaw puzzle depicting the anticipated movements of NYPD officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Put aside the deficiencies in Chief Galati's affidavit. Still, its purported justification goes to terrorism-related threats only,\n   and the NYPD's FOIL response should at a minimum have read \"We [have] [do not have] records of investigating or surveilling the petitioners on suspicions other\n   than terrorism. As to whether terrorism-related records exist, we cannot say.\" Accordingly, I would reverse the Appellate Division's order granting the motion to dismiss and remand the case to Supreme Court, where the NYPD can augment Chief Galati's affidavit and the parties can hash out, on a request-by-request basis, to what extent an entirely circumscribed response is appropriate as to past investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Petitioners' Rebuttal Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the NYPD's affidavit, petitioners invoked one other safeguard native to FOIL and two modeled on federal FOIA decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to the native safeguard, petitioners have steadfastly requested in camera review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, although the NYPD could have refused to confirm or deny the existence of records relating to\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   investigations on the strength of only a public affidavit, the doubts the petitioners raised about the propriety of withholding information about\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   investigations should have required Supreme Court, absent a very different affidavit, to order in camera review of responsive documents, if any. In\n   <em>\n    Abdur-Rashid,\n   </em>\n   the court abused its discretion in impliedly deciding to forgo that review. In\n   <em>\n    Hashmi,\n   </em>\n   uncontrovertibly, the court committed an error of law in concluding that in camera\n   review, which it wished to undertake, was, by spurious analogy to the Glomar doctrine, unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In addition to requesting in camera review, petitioners alleged facts invoking two additional FOIL safeguards: the bad faith and official acknowledgment doctrines. The NYPD urges not only those safeguards' adoption but also their zealous enforcement; \"Federal courts employing similar safeguards do not operate as a rubber stamp on agencies' use of the circumscribed response ... [P]rocedural safeguards are far from a paper tiger and allow for meaningful judicial review\" (reply brief for respondents-appellants in\n   <em>\n    Hashmi v. New York City Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5773859,5775228\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/140/419/\">\n    140 A.D.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775228\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/140/419/5775228/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016], at 20, reprinted in record at 837). Because respondents are here on a motion to dismiss, it is our responsibility to accept all the facts claimed in the petitions as true, accord petitioners the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged make out any cognizable legal theory for defeating the protections of the FOIL exemptions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon v. Martinez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431905\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/83/#p87\">\n    84 N.Y.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87-88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431905\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/83/#p87\">\n    614 N.Y.S.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431905\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/83/#p87\">\n    638 N.E.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1994] ). Under that standard, even had Chief Galati's affidavit made out a prima facie case for non-disclosure, the motion to dismiss should have been denied and the cases remitted to Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Turning first to the bad faith doctrine, petitioners allege several grounds for their assertion that the NYPD is refusing to\n   confirm or deny the existence of responsive records not because that would cause a harm cognizable under a FOIL exemption, but because it wishes to conceal evidence of underlying illegality: an investigation and surveillance program premised on religious discrimination. The majority dismisses that argument by complaining that \"other than general allegations arising from news reports, petitioners offered no evidence that the NYPD's response to these particular requests is a function of bad faith\" (majority op. at 238, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 473, 100 N.E.3d at 812). In so doing, it ignores the standard of review appropriate on a motion to dismiss. The AP's Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles detailing the NYPD's questionable conduct and efforts to cover up that conduct satisfies the threshold showing required to allow petitioners to \"seek appropriate discovery ... to identify the procedures by which [the NYPD's] position was established\" (\n   <em>\n    Phillippi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5691852,1010007\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/546/1009/\">\n    546 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1013 ). That showing is buttressed by the allegations that the NYPD, which took nearly eight months to respond substantively to the petitioners' requests, was \"purposefully delaying the process\" by supplying sequential notices of delay and by\n   throwing up unusual objections to the form of the requests, including a particularly obstructionist cavil regarding a typographical error in Mr. Abdur-Rashid's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, the petitioners alleged the NYPD has already officially acknowledged the information it hopes to conceal by refusing to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records. In a June 2012 deposition in a different case, Chief Galati acknowledged that \"none of the visits conducted by the Zone Assessment Unit [ZAU] resulted in an investigation.\" Although that statement is followed by some discussion of what constitutes an investigation and whether the ZAU was designed to pursue them, it seems in tension with the NYPD's claim that it had not already denied having, for example, \"records related to any investigation of Talib W. Abdur-Rashid in relation to his activities as Imam of the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood.\" In addition, in\n   <em>\n    Hashmi,\n   </em>\n   it is ambiguous whether Supreme Court found nothing in \"Mayor de Blasio's well-publicized decision to disband the NYPD unit that had conducted the surveillance\" that undermined the agency's ability to deny the existence of records or erroneously concluded, as the prior sentence of its opinion suggests, that the mayor was not the kind of senior executive branch official whose statements are \"sufficient to effect waiver of a Glomar response\" (\n   <em>\n    Hashmi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957101\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/46/712/\">\n    46 Misc.3d at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957101\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/46/712/\">\n    998 N.Y.S.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). It may be that \"whatever protection\" the records \"might once have had has been lost by virtue of public statements ... at the highest levels\" (\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v. United States Dep't of Justice,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p120\">\n    756 F.3d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120-121 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Even if those disclosures do not satisfy the official acknowledgment doctrine, they, coupled with the information in the AP articles and in the leaked NYPD documents that accompanied those articles, may defeat the NYPD's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of certain responsive documents. Rather than grapple with the full scope of the disclosures, the NYPD fixates on the fact that they emanate from the AP, rather than from its own officials. That fixation \"confuses the act of waiver ... with an agency's independent obligation to 'carry its burden' \" of showing the mere disclosure of a document's existence would be protected (\n   <em>\n    Florez v. Cent. Intelligence Agency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341216\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/178/\">\n    829 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 and n. 8 [2d Cir.2016] [rejecting a \"per se rule barring consideration of third party disclosures\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   and instead remanding \"to allow the district court to weigh the facts in the first instance\" (emphasis omitted) ] ). A third\n   party's disclosures \"cannot waive the asserting agency's right to a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, but such disclosures may well shift the factual groundwork upon which a district court assesses the merits of such a response\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341216\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/178/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 186 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Several references in the existing record suggest that has happened in this case. To give but one example, the petitioners requested \"[a]ll directives and/or memoranda sent or received by the NYPD related to surveillance of the Rutgers Muslim Student Associations from 2006-2012.\" The AP published a copy of the NYPD's weekly Muslim student association report responsive to that request. It is untenable for the NYPD to neither confirm nor deny the existence of that responsive record. Once the existence of one record in a category must be disclosed, it may be that the existence of other records in the same category are not protected.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"The\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   doctrine is in large measure a judicial construct, an interpretation of ... exemptions that flows from their purpose rather than their express language.

Indeed, it would make little sense for the certification to apply only where a FOIL request has already been granted because an agency will not always be able to ascertain whether, and to what extent, a requested record is disclosable under FOIL without undertaking a review thereof.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The majority asserts that petitioners do not \"analyze the propriety of the exemptions as applied to their requests\" (majority op. at 227 n. 3, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 466 n. 3, 100 N.E.3d at 805 n. 3). Considering that petitioners are unaware of what, if any, records exist and cannot discern when, if ever, they were investigated, it is unclear exactly what argument the petitioners could make, other than that which is currently presented, which is that the NYPD's Glomar response is an impermissible blanket exemption that has not been authorized by the legislature. Again, the majority's response to this is to assume, without foundation, that the only records that exist, if any, relate to a \"pending covert investigation\" (majority op.at 227-228 n. 3, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 466-67 n. 3, 100 N.E.3d at 805-06 n. 3) and are, therefore, \"protected under one or more FOIL exemptions\" (majority op.at 233 n. 6, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 470 n. 6, 100 N.E.3d at 809 n. 6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Further, the majority completely fails to address the implications of Glomar responses in cases where records exist that are not protected by a statutory exemption but which, nevertheless, will be shielded from disclosure and judicial review by such a response. Instead, the majority avoids this problematic aspect of its position by suggesting that petitioners limited the dispute to records concerning terrorism-related investigations. This is inaccurate. Petitioners' FOIL requests are devoid of any reference to terrorism investigations or to news articles relating to the NYPD's covert domestic counterterrorism operations. Petitioners requested, among other things, \"[a]ll records related to\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    investigation of [petitioners] between 2006-2012,\" \"[a]ll records related to [the petitioners] relied upon by the NYPD that led to any report being filed,\" and \"[a]ll records related to the surveillance of [the petitioners] by [the] NYPD\" (emphasis added). Indeed, the majority's apparent claim that the Glomar response was given only because the investigations at issue related to terrorism is untenable considering that the NYPD denied petitioners' administrative appeals, in part, on the ground that petitioners failed to specifically identify the nature of the investigations to which the FOIL requests pertained. Moreover, while it is true that petitioners referenced a series of news articles concerning NYPD surveillance of Muslim communities in their CPLR article 78 petitions-filed after the Glomar responses had been conveyed-at no point did they disavow or narrow their earlier requests for records pertaining to \"any investigation.\" In addition, they maintained that the NYPD's response was an impermissible blanket exemption and that the NYPD should instead redact any records containing protected information. Despite the majority's repeated attempts to shift the blame to petitioners for the agency's noncompliant response here, it is unquestionably the NYPD's burden to demonstrate the applicability of an exemption to any records withheld-a showing that is woefully lacking.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The majority's failure to require any in camera review also increases the likelihood that a Glomar response will violate the precept that an agency \"cannot refuse to produce the whole record simply because some of it may be exempt from disclosure\" and, instead, should make every effort to redact protected information while disclosing exempt information (\n    <em>\n     Matter of Schenectady County Socy. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Inc. v.

Further, contrary to the majority's likening of its creation of a blanket exemption to this Court's prior approval of in camera review, unlike the Glomar response, FOIL expressly authorizes judicial review of an agency's response to a FOIL request (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[4][b] ), and our precedent clearly establishes the propriety of in camera review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    To the extent the NYPD also relies on\n    <em>\n     New Jersey Media Group Inc. v.

Super. Ct. App.Div.2016] ), such reliance is misplaced. In that case, a New Jersey appellate court interpreted the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), to permit an agency to neither confirm nor deny the existence of records when the agency \"(1) relies upon an exemption authorized by OPRA that would itself preclude the agency from acknowledging the existence of such documents and (2) presents a sufficient basis for the court to determine that the claimed exemption applies\" (\n    <em>\n     New Jersey Media Group,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169908\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/447/182/#p188\">\n     447 N.J.

That court held that a Glomar-type response was authorized in limited circumstances by language in OPRA providing that the statute \"shall not abrogate ... [a] grant of confidentiality heretofore established or recognized by the Constitution of this State, statute, court rule or judicial case law, which privilege or grant of confidentiality may duly be claimed to restrict public access to a public record or government record\" (NJ Stat Ann 47:1A-9 ). Under New Jersey law, \"before OPRA was enacted, judicial decisions recognized the need to maintain 'a high degree of confidentiality' for records regarding a person who has not been arrested or charged\" (\n    <em>\n     New Jersey Media Group,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169908\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/447/182/#p188\">\n     447 N.J.

Accordingly, the New Jersey court held that the mere existence of records pertaining to someone who had been investigated, but not charged or arrested, was exempt under the statutory provision exempting materials that were confidential under prior case law. FOIL, however, does not contain a similar provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The majority concedes this point, but claims-without any basis in record or fact-that FOIA requests analogous to those presented here are \"rare\" (majority op. at 229, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 467, 100 N.E.3d at 806).

However, this Court must look to New York's FOIL statute, as it is written and has been interpreted by our prior case law, to answer the question of whether Glomar responses are permissible and, if so, under what circumstances. In my view, authorization for such responses cannot be found in, or reconciled with, the language of FOIL, and the majority's determination to the contrary sanctions a blanket exemption from disclosure for a vast amount of information and records. Granting such a broad judicial exemption is at odds with the express will of the legislature, as reflected in the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It is beyond dispute that terrorism presents a significant threat that our law enforcement agencies must be equipped to combat. Undoubtedly, the concerns of respondent New York City Police Department (N.Y.PD) and various amici warrant\n   legislative attention with regard to whether FOIL should be amended to allow agencies to refuse to acknowledge the existence of certain records when confronted with requests seeking targeted information regarding, among other things, \"pending\" or \"ongoing\" law enforcement investigations of particular persons or organizations (majority op. at 226, 227, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 464-65, 465-66, 100 N.E.3d at 803-04, 804-05). Conversely, there are compelling policy arguments raised by petitioners and amici on the other side of the issue, pertaining to governmental transparency and accountability, and to a citizen's right to access information pursuant to FOIL. These concerns also merit legislative consideration. Because existing state law does not accommodate Glomar responses, weighing these competing interests is a matter for the legislature, not the Court.

More specifically, Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2) states that an agency \"shall ... make available for public inspection and copying\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   records\" (emphasis added). This open access is qualified by the caveat that an agency \"may deny access to records or portions thereof\" which, \"if disclosed,\" would cause certain specified harms ( Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2] ). The harms justifying an agency's denial of access include, as relevant here, disclosure of records and information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy or endanger the life or safety of any person, as well as disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement purposes, where such disclosure would interfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings, identify confidential sources or confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, or reveal criminal investigative techniques or procedures (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][b] ; [2][e][i], [ii], [iv]; [2][f] ).

Rather, the majority accepts, without any scrutiny, the NYPD's claim that the scope of the relevant \"investigation\"\n   is \"terrorism,\" and that revelation of any investigation-apparently of any person for any reason-could impede\n   its counterterrorism efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewed in this light, it follows that the NYPD could claim the right to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of any record that even tangentially relates to any past, present, or future investigation of \"crime,\" thereby avoiding its FOIL obligations in innumerable cases.

The CIA asserted that the existence or nonexistence of the requested records was, itself, a classified fact since admitting their existence would implicitly reveal that the CIA had some affiliation with the Explorer. Accordingly, the CIA argued that the existence or nonexistence of records was exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (1) and (3), which exempt \"classified\" information (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b][1] ) and certain additional information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by other statutes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b][3] ), such as the National Security Act of 1947.

That reluctance is not only at odds with our precedent, but also predicated on Glomar's unique context. Because federal courts have committed to policing, absent a showing of bad faith, only the formal logic of an agency's affidavit, they have less need to examine the documents, if any, underlying that affidavit. Furthermore, the blanket nature of the first and third FOIA exemptions makes in camera review both less relevant and considerably more time-consuming for the court. As most equally circumscribed responses under FOIL will be justified by the extremely specific way in which the requests are phrased, they are likely to involve more exercises of discretion and fewer responsive records through which the court, aided by a confidential index, can be expected to sift.
