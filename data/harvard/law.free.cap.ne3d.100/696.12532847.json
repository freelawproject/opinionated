State\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548849\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1033/\">\n   91 N.E.3d 1033\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (Ind. Ct. App. 2018). On March 15, 2018, we granted the State's petition to transfer, thereby vacating the Court of Appeals opinion. During the 2018 legislative session, the General Assembly amended Indiana Code sections 35-35-1-2 and 35-38-1-17, addressing guilty pleas and the reduction or suspension of a sentence, effective July 1, 2018. Section 35-38-1-17 provides that the section applies to a person who commits an offense or is sentenced before July 1, 2014, notwithstanding Indiana Code section 1-1-5.5-21.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  Accordingly, the Court REMANDS this case to the Court of Appeals to reconsider in light of the amended statutes. The Court of Appeals opinion reported at\n  <em>\n   Rodriguez v. State\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548849\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1033/\">\n   91 N.E.3d 1033\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (Ind. Ct. App. 2018), remains vacated.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   All Justices concur.\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
