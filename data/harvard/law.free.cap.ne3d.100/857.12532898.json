GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Blake Dickson appeals the judgment entered on the pleadings in favor of Pamela Gorski. The allegations in the complaint stem from Gorski's performance of duties as guardian ad litem in Dickson's domestic relations case, Cuyahoga C.P. No. DR-13-348970 (\"divorce case\"). The trial court accordingly held that Gorski was entitled to absolute immunity from the claims asserted in the separate proceeding. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Gorski was appointed by the domestic relations court to serve as a guardian ad litem during Dickson's divorce proceedings. At the conclusion of the divorce case, Gorski was awarded fees totaling around $33,000 for services rendered. Dickson was responsible for half. After obtaining a judgment lien against Dickson, Gorski initiated proceedings to collect on the judgment. Dickson then filed a motion for relief from judgment in the divorce case, which is the subject of another appeal pending in 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105318. In this action, Dickson claims Gorski was negligent in performing her obligations as the guardian ad litem and committed fraud through requesting excessive fees for services not rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Gorski answered the complaint and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Civ.R. 12(C), claiming that she is entitled to absolute immunity in the separate action for any actions arising from her service as the guardian ad litem. The trial court agreed and entered judgment in favor of Gorski upon all claims. Dickson appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In the sole assignment of error, Dickson claims the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of absolute immunity in this case. Essentially, he seeks an exception allowing for a factual, case-by-case inquiry into whether a guardian ad litem is entitled to assert immunity for actions arising from her performance of the duties associated with the appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We review a ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo.\n   <em>\n    Thornton v.

And the party against whom she is acting not only has no recourse for her fraudulent, tortious, criminal actions, but they have to pay her at whatever rate she chooses, for however many hours she claims she worked, even if she did not work those hours, with no ability to challenge that bill or investigate whether the work was done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The applicability of the absolute immunity doctrine is not pinned to the severity of the party's alleged misconduct. We reiterate, \"the existence of immunity as a defense in a civil action is a purely legal issue, properly determined by a trial court prior to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Giusto\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9, citing\n   <em>\n    Kronenberg\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Goad\n   </em>\n   . We cannot create the rule Dickson desires; such a proposition would defeat the purpose of providing guardians ad litem with absolute immunity in the first place. \"A guardian ad litem must also be able to function without the worry of possible later harassment and intimidation from dissatisfied parents. * * * A failure to grant immunity would hamper the duties of a guardian ad litem in his role as advocate for the child in judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Penn\n   </em>\n   at 152,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.E.2d%201234\">\n    573 N.E.2d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Instead, whether absolute immunity applies is a question of law with the only inquiry focusing on from where the allegations arose. If the alleged misconduct stems from the guardian ad litem's performance\n   under the court appointment, which is readily apparent from reviewing the allegations in the complaint, the guardian ad litem is entitled to absolute immunity as a matter of law. On this point, there is no factual dispute. Dickson does not challenge the conclusion that the allegations in the underlying complaint stem from Gorski's performance as the guardian ad litem in the divorce action-the complaint is entirely based on her fulfillment of the court-appointed role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We acknowledge that parties in a divorce action are vulnerable and in certain situations may need to challenge the guardian ad litem's action. Absolute immunity does not give a guardian ad litem impunity to misbehave, as Dickson fears. A guardian ad litem's conduct, including issues related to the billing, may be timely challenged in the case in which she was appointed and monitored by the trial court. Absolute immunity simply precludes parties from collaterally attacking the guardian ad litem in another venue for any acts or omissions arising from the performance of her duties as a guardian ad litem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} As a matter of law, absolute immunity precludes Dickson from advancing his separate action, which is based on allegations of misconduct arising from Gorski's performance of her duties as the guardian ad litem in the divorce case. Dickson's sole assignment of error is overruled. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., and FRANK D. CELEBREZZE, JR., J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
