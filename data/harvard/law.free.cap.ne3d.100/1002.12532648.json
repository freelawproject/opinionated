For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On the morning of February 15, 2014, Brandi Gonyer-Boaston was found dead in the hatchback of her Dodge Journey. Her vehicle was parked, engine running, more than 35 feet off a rural roadway in a snow-covered field in Fulton County, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 21, 2014, the Lucas County Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment against Boaston: one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and 2929.02, an unclassified felony, and one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) and 2929.02, an unclassified felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At a trial by jury, the following evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Brandi first met Boaston when she worked as a babysitter for Boaston's three children. In time, Brandi and Boaston began a relationship with each other and had two children together. They married in October 2005 and divorced in October 2006. Brandi became involved with another man and bore his child. A short time after Brandi's third child was born, Brandi and Boaston reentered into a relationship. They moved into an apartment with five of the six children (Boaston's two children from another marriage, the two children Brandi and Boaston share, and the child Brandi had with another man).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2013, Brandi finished nursing school and began working at Arbors of Waterville. There, she met co-worker Daron Walls-Jones. Brandi was flirtatious with Daron at work, by text, and by phone. In October of 2013, Boaston became aware of Brandi's relationship with Daron. From October of 2013 until her death in February 2014, Boaston installed three different types of spyware on Brandi's mobile phone. The spyware allowed him to track her location, read her text messages, and listen to her telephone conversations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sometime in late January or early February 2014, there was an incident involving Brandi and Boaston in the bathroom of the apartment they shared. A woman that lived next door to the family indicated that she heard running water and a woman's scream. She also felt a \"vibration\" through the shared wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Boaston's son, W.B, was 16 at the time of Brandi's death. W.B. testified that one afternoon, a few weeks before Brandi died, he came home from school and saw Brandi walk out of the bathroom with a towel on her head. She \"was purple with black eyes.\" It appeared to him as though Brandi had just gotten out of the bath or shower. W.B. explained, \"from her head down she was purple and blue, looked like she had lack of oxygen. She showed me her shoulders and her arms and they were colored the same way as her face.\" She appeared \"upset and scared.\" Over Boaston's objections, W.B. stated, \"She told me that she was taking a bath, dad was just shaving, minding his own business, they were talking. Then out of nowhere,\n   seemed like nobody was inside of his body anymore, he just pounced on her and tried to drown her.\" W.B. indicated that after the bathtub incident, Brandi started the process of moving out of the apartment. On February 3, 2014, Brandi and Boaston informed the children that they were separating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On the witness stand, Brandi's mother, Cindy Gonyer-Rumer, recalled seeing Brandi a few weeks before she died. Cindy had purchased a new pair of shoes for Brandi and insisted that Brandi come to her home to pick them up. When Brandi arrived, her face was hidden under the hood of her sweatshirt. Cindy insisted that Brandi put her head down. That is when Cindy noticed that Brandi's eyes were black and blue and her nose was a little crooked. Over Boaston's objections, Cindy explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Brandi] started crying and she told me that what happened was bad. So my thought was that he raped her and she said, no, it was worse than that. And I said, well, what could be worse than that? And she said, he tried to drown me. And I goes, what do you mean, he tried to drown you? And she goes, yeah, she goes, he asked me to take a bath with him, so I was in the tub, he was shaving his head. She goes, and I never seen this look on his face before and he jumped on me * * * She said that that-that he tried to drown her and she was fighting him off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When asked to describe Brandi's demeanor at the time of the conversation, Cindy stated, \"[Brandi] was really upset and she told me that he was gonna kill her one of these days. And I said, then let's go to the cops or something, Brandi, you know. And she said, no, mom, I can't. She said, I won't be able to see my kids.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Some of Brandi's co-workers also testified about statements Brandi made regarding the alleged bathtub incident. Judy Holmes testified that once every two weeks she worked the same shift as Brandi at Arbors of Waterville. Judy never saw any injuries on Brandi. However, she did recall a conversation she had with Brandi the day before she died wherein Brandi indicated that she was no longer with Boaston because \"he tried to drown her in the bathtub.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Shelby Hanes also worked with Brandi at Arbors of Waterville. Shelby recalled going into work one day-perhaps three to seven days before Brandi died-and noticing \"what looked like popped blood vessels in her eyes * * * so it appear[ed] as though she had two black eyes.\" Brandi told Shelby that she received the injury by running into a door. Brandi asked Shelby to help her \"cover the bruises\" with make-up. Queen Anderson also worked with Brandi at Arbors of Waterville. Queen testified that she noticed a \"mark\" on Brandi's face on the day Shelby covered it with make-up. Queen could not remember where the mark was. She did, however, recall a conversation regarding the bathtub incident. Queen testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Brandi] told me that her and her husband had got into a disagreement or argument. * * * She didn't say what the argument was about, she said that she thought everything was fine between them, you know, that he ran her a bath water and she took a bath. She said she don't know what happened, what triggered him, but he came in the bathroom and he tried to hold her down in the tub. She said that that's when she was getting out of the tub-trying to get out and she hit her face. * * * But she didn't say anything about, you know, him hitting her or anything, she said that he was holding her down in the water and that's how she got the mark on her face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} One of Boaston's friends also testified about the bathtub incident. Derek Wood testified that he and Boaston had been friends for 12 or 13 years. A few weeks before Brandi's death, Boaston told Derek that he and Brandi had gotten into an argument in their apartment bathroom. Derek explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. [Boaston] texted me and said, I fucked up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. And did he elaborate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. There was really no-too much elaboration via text message but he kind of just told me-kind of described the scenario of what happened. We talked about it more in person though. * * * That they were arguing in the bathroom and that she says that he held her under water and that she couldn't, you know, breathe for a few seconds and then he let her up and-but he said that he didn't remember doing anything like that to her and did not remember hitting her either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On Monday, February 3, 2014, Brandi placed her apartment key in Boaston's mailbox and packed some things in a tote. She began staying with her mother, Cindy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Despite what had occurred between Brandi and Boaston in the apartment bathroom, Brandi continued to see and communicate with Boaston on a daily basis. On numerous occasions, she went over to Boaston's apartment and helped him get the children ready for school and assist with the children's homework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On February 10, 2014, Brandi and her mother signed a rental application for a mobile home. Brandi listed her three children as dependents on the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On February 12, 2014, Cindy received a phone call from her daughter. Brandi informed Cindy that Boaston was with her at Cindy's home. When Cindy arrived at her home a few minutes later, Boaston was standing on the porch holding the screen door ajar. Boaston followed Cindy into the home and shut the door. According to Cindy, Boaston started talking to Brandi and told her that either Brandi or Daron \"was gonna pay.\" Despite the heated conversation, Brandi agreed to follow Boaston to Target to purchase Valentine's Day treats for the kids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Brandi worked her usual shift from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., February 12-13, 2014. After work, Brandi went to Boaston's apartment to help get the children off to school. Brandi stayed alone with Boaston for six hours. Boaston later reported to a friend that he and Brandi had sex while they were alone together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Brandi worked from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., February 13-14, 2014. While at work, Brandi made plans with co-worker Judy Holmes to go out to a club on Valentine's Day evening. From 8:34 p.m. on February 13, 2014 through 2:20 a.m. on February 14, 2014, Brandi and Daron exchanged 46 text messages, some of which were sexual in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Meanwhile on the evening of February 13, 2014, Mark Reno was hanging out with his friend, Matt Gwozdz. Matt and Boaston were friends. Sometime between 9-11:00 p.m., Boaston arrived at Gwozdz's home. When Reno headed towards the door to leave, Boaston followed him. Boaston asked Reno if he could \"get a gun\" or knew anyone that could \"take care of business.\" Reno asked Boaston if he needed him to \"gather up the home boys and go take care of some shit.\" Boaston said \"something like that, but deeper.\" Reno asked Boaston, \"what do you want to do? You want to pistol whip him, put him in ICU or something, send a message to him?\" According to Reno, Boaston looked down and shook his head. Reno testified, \"it just didn't seem, real, I blew it off and left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Boaston called Reno at 2:51 a.m. The phone call lasted nearly eight and one-half minutes. According to Reno, Boaston had called him and asked him to \"have lunch and talk.\" Reno indicated that he did not take Boaston's lunch invitation seriously and had no intention of speaking with Boaston again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At 4:05 a.m. Boaston filled his vehicle with gasoline. He then conducted two transactions at a nearby ATM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} At 7:21 a.m. on February 14, 2014, Brandi went to McDonalds and purchased two breakfast sandwiches; one for herself and one for Boaston. Brandi made it to Boaston's apartment at about 7:30 a.m. Shortly thereafter, she and Boaston each ate one of the breakfast sandwiches. The kids finished getting ready for school. The last child boarded the school bus at 8:30 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} W.B. never heard from Brandi on the afternoon of February 14, 2014, even though Brandi had made plans to drive W.B. and his girlfriend to a local restaurant for an early Valentine's Day dinner. According to family members, it was unusual for Brandi to fail to follow through with plans she had made. W.B. became concerned about Brandi and telephoned Brandi's brother, Kevin Gonyer. Kevin tried to contact Brandi by phone, to no avail. Every time he called he heard a message that Brandi's voice mailbox was not set up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Kevin went to Boaston's apartment and asked Boaston to track Brandi down using the spyware installed on Brandi's phone. Boaston left the room for a few moments. When he came back, Boaston informed Kevin that Brandi's phone was not on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Kevin tried to call Brandi again. This time, he heard a message that the number he called was either changed or disconnected. Kevin went to Cindy's house. Cindy began calling Brandi's phone. She too heard a message that Brandi's number had been changed or disconnected. Cindy called Boaston to ask about Brandi. Boaston informed her that Brandi had stopped by the apartment after work, paid the gas bill, and gave him her debit card and pin number with instructions to spend the rest of her paycheck on the kids. Boaston also informed Cindy that Brandi had showered and put her dirty work clothes back on before she left the apartment at 10:30 a.m. At the time, Cindy thought Boaston's statements were odd because Brandi was saving money for the mobile home. Brandi always purchased things for the children herself. Cindy also testified, and W.B. confirmed, that it was unusual for Brandi to put dirty clothes on after she showered. In fact, she often scolded the children when they did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} At 11:45 p.m. on February 14, 2014, Boaston called 911 to report Brandi's disappearance. Toledo Police Officer Martin Przybysz responded to the call. When the officer arrived at the apartment, Boaston invited him into the foyer. Boaston indicated that his ex-wife was not answering her phone and she was not at her mother's home. Boaston did not inform the officer that he had the ability to track Brandi's phone nor did he mention that Brandi's phone was turned off. Officer Przybysz characterized Boaston's demeanor as calm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Just before 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 15, 2014, hunters came across Brandi's vehicle parked in a snow-covered field in Fulton County, Ohio. One set of boot prints lead from the driver's side of the vehicle to the road. One of the hunters called his son, Matthew Smithmyer, a deputy with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} When Deputy Smithmyer arrived at the scene, he noted two key fobs lying on the vehicle's front passenger seat. Officer\n   Smithmyer opened the unlocked rear driver-side door and looked around. He then opened the rear hatch of the vehicle and found a woman's body wrapped in a clear plastic tarp. A shattered mobile phone was found on the roadway. The Bureau of Criminal Investigation was called in to process the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The Fulton County Sheriff's Department contacted the Lucas County Sheriff's Department who, in turn, contacted Toledo Police. Officers from each agency met at Toledo's detective bureau and discussed how to proceed with the investigation. Jeff Kozak, a detective with the Lucas County Sheriff's Department, went to Boaston's home and asked Boaston if he would be willing to go down to the bureau to speak with detectives about Brandi's disappearance. Boaston agreed. Boaston called Brandi's mother and asked her to come over to the apartment and get the kids. During the time they were waiting for Cindy to arrive, Boaston never asked the detective if they had found Brandi nor did he ask the detective whether he had any information about where Brandi might be. In Detective Kozak's opinion, Boaston appeared calm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Detective Kozak testified that when Cindy arrived to pick up the children, she was crying and begging for information about her daughter. At the time, Detective Kozak did not reveal any information about what had been found in Fulton County. Instead, he informed Cindy that they were \"working on it.\" A few minutes after Cindy left with the children, Toledo Police Detectives arrived with a crime scene unit and a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Boaston arrived at the bureau just before 6:30 p.m. on February 15, 2014; detectives noted small scratches on Boaston's face and neck. Photographs of the injuries were presented to the jury. Boaston's coat had a 2.5 inch rip in the seam near the wound on his neck. Detectives found a glove in each pocket of Boaston's coat. One of the gloves had \"a lot\" of light brown human hair embedded in an outer Velcro strap and buckle. Forensic testing of the hair revealed that the DNA profile from the hairs was consistent with Brandi Boaston's DNA profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Boaston's interview with police lasted from 6:30 p.m. on February 15, 2014, through 4:15 a.m. the following morning. The interview was recorded. Portions of the recording were redacted and the jury was shown over 4.5 hours of the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 33} During the interview, Boaston told Detective Ryder that he withdrew $100 from the ATM at 4:07 a.m. on the morning of February 14, 2014, because he was \"out with friends.\" He further indicated that he needed the money for gasoline. However, a receipt from the gas station indicates Boaston used a credit card to put $20 of fuel in his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Cell phone record analysis indicated that Brandi's cell phone utilized a tower near Delta, Ohio, at 11:15 a.m. February 14, 2014. Less than 15 minutes later, Brandi's cell phone utilized a tower near where her body was found. No signals were detected from Brandi's phone after 4:36 p.m. on February 14, 2014. During a critical time in the chronology of events (from 10:41 a.m. through 11:35 a.m.) Boaston's phone did not utilize any cell phone towers. At 11:36 a.m. Boaston's phone utilized a cell phone tower north and west of his home. Then, at 12:04 p.m., Boaston called Brandi's phone. A minute later, he texted her asking, \"are you awake yet?\" and \"call me so we can go file taxes.\" He was in the vicinity of his apartment when the 12:04 call and 12:05 texts were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Deputy Coroner Dr. Diane Scala-Barnett performed the autopsy on Brandi's body. At trial, Dr. Scala-Barnett described the injuries on Brandi's face and\n   neck. Dr. Scala-Barnett opined that the manner of death was homicide by strangulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 36} After Brandi's death, Boaston appeared \"calm, not caring\" to some of his family members. One day, while watching the local news, Boaston commented to his son, \"so far there's nothing going on with this investigation and hopefully there's nothing else and [the investigation into Brandi's death] should end soon.\" Boaston also said, \"the evidence doesn't point towards anybody and the evidence doesn't point towards [me].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Boaston was found guilty of murder on both counts. At sentencing, the trial court merged offenses, and the state elected to proceed on the violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and 2929.02. The trial court sentenced Boaston to a term of life with parole eligibility after 15 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Boaston's first assignment of error provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial court erred by allowing the coroner to opine the victim's time of death based on the contents in her stomach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 39} A year before trial, the state forwarded to trial counsel a copy of Dr. Scala-Barnett's report of autopsy. Relevant to this assignment of error, the report indicates: \"The stomach contains 110 cc of recognizable particles of meat and brownish-tan liquid.\" The report does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include any findings, conclusions, or opinions resulting from the deputy coroner's analysis of the stomach contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Nineteen days before trial, trial counsel interviewed Dr. Scala-Barnett. During the interview, Dr. Scala-Barnett opined, based upon stomach contents that Brandi died within two hours of eating a breakfast sandwich. Surprised by this revelation, trial counsel orally requested that the state supplement the report of autopsy with a summary of Dr. Scala-Barnett's time-of-death opinion. The state refused. Trial counsel did not notify the court that the state refused to provide him with a summary of Dr. Scala-Barnett's time-of-death opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The case went to trial by jury. After opening arguments, but before Dr. Scala-Barnett took the stand, trial counsel moved, under Crim.R. 16(K), to preclude the state from introducing evidence of Dr. Scala-Barnett's time-of-death opinion. At a bench conference, trial counsel admitted he became aware of Dr. Scala-Barnett's time-of-death opinion 19 days before trial. The state accused trial counsel of gamesmanship asserting that under Crim.R. 12, a motion to exclude the time-of-death opinion testimony should have been filed before the jury was empaneled. Upon consideration, the trial court denied Boaston's motion to exclude the time-of death opinion testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Dr. Scala-Barnett testified that once an individual dies, digestion ceases. She explained that a small meal begins to empty from the stomach in about two hours. Dr. Scala-Barnett opined that Brandi died \"within one to two hours after she ate her [breakfast] sandwich.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 43} On appeal, Boaston contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled his motion to exclude the time-of-death testimony under Crim.R. 16(K). He further asserts that the deputy-coroner's time-of-death opinion testimony was prejudicial and contributed to his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 44} \"Ordinarily, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence in any particular case, so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Rigby v. Lake County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1428752\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/58/269/#p271\">\n    58 Ohio St.3d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=569%20N.E.2d%201056\">\n    569 N.E.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 45} For decades, Crim.R. 16 has governed discovery and inspection in criminal cases. In October 2009, the Supreme Court Commission on the Rules of Practice and Procedure proposed an overhaul of Crim.R. 16 to provide more open discovery in criminal cases. Grove,\n   <em>\n    Criminal Discovery in Ohio: \"Civilizing\" Criminal Rule 16\n   </em>\n   , 36 Dayton L.Rev. 143, 144 (2011). Comprehensive changes to Crim.R. 16 went into effect July 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In regard to witnesses, former Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) required the prosecutor, upon request, to provide to the defendant the names and addresses of all witnesses that the state intended to call at trial. If a party failed to comply with discovery, the trial court had complete discretion to formulate an appropriate remedy. Former Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Nothing under the prior version of Crim.R. 16 required an expert to prepare a written report. However, the new Crim.R. 16(K) specifically provides, \"An expert witness for either side\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   prepare a\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   report summarizing the expert witness's testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert's qualification.\" (Emphasis added). The rule further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule\n   <em>\n    no later than twenty-one days prior to trial\n   </em>\n   , which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party.\n   <em>\n    Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert's testimony at trial\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=569%20N.E.2d%201056\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Here, Boaston argues that Crim.R. 16(K) is unambiguous. He asserts that the state's failure to amend the report of autopsy, in writing, to include a summary of Dr. Scala-Barnett's time-of-death opinion is a clear violation of the rule.

She noted that there was a \"very unusual-looking abrasion\" under Brandi's chin. Two days after the autopsy was complete, Detective Lenhardt brought a number of items to the morgue to do a side-by-side comparison. Included in the items taken to the morgue was the pair of gloves found in Boaston's coat. On the outside of each glove was a patch of Velcro and a buckle. Dr. Scala-Barnett covered Brandi's body\n   with clear plastic and she and Detective Lenhardt \"test-fitted\" the buckle to the abrasion. Photographs that were taken during the test-fitting were presented to the jury at trial. Dr. Scala-Barnett explained her finding to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. So there you have that same abrasion you saw and she's all covered in plastic now, so we have the plastic between the two items. And this buckle, part of the plastic was compared to the abrasion or the white area underneath the abrasion. Because the plastic is soft the plastic itself is not going to abrade it, it's the Velcro that can abrade it. * * * [next photo exhibit is introduced] * * * And we can come back to this. There's a closer up. Remember I said look at the corners of this abrasion, how they come down. There's a little square here and it goes back down.

Here, trial counsel discovered that the deputy coroner had formed an opinion about a matter not contained in the written report 19 days before trial. Boaston's failure to file a\n   <em>\n    pretrial\n   </em>\n   motion to compel a supplement to the report of autopsy or exclude the evidence constitutes a waiver of his objection to the state's use of this opinion testimony.

Boaston was charged with murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A). Pursuant to R.C. 2903.02(A), \"[n]o person shall purposely cause the death of another.\" The admissible evidence in this case indicates that Boaston was in his apartment with Brandi on the morning of her death. He is the last known person to see Brandi alive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Two weeks before her death, Boaston and Brandi had a disagreement in the bathroom in her apartment that left her feeling as though he wanted to drown her. Brandi suffered physical injuries during the incident. In the days leading up to her death, it appeared that Brandi had little interest in reconciling her relationship with the father of her children. She moved in with her mother. She made plans to spend Valentine's Day evening with a female coworker and sent text messages of a mildly sexual nature to a male coworker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 91} In the early morning hours of February 14, 2014, Boaston was \"out with friends\" looking for a gun or someone to\n   \"take care of business.\" He withdrew cash from his checking account. Brandi arrived at Boaston's apartment a few hours later. At 8:30 a.m., the children left the apartment to catch the bus for school. By Boaston's own admission, Brandi was alone with him at the apartment until 10:40 or 10:45 a.m. on February 14, 2014. Boaston was the last known person to see Brandi alive. Her body was found 20 miles north and west of Boaston's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Boaston called 911 to report Brandi's disappearance at 11:45 p.m. on February 14, 2014. He was calm when an officer arrived at the apartment to fill out the missing person report. Boaston offered no information beyond the questions asked by the investigating officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 93} According to Boaston, Brandi ate a breakfast sandwich around 7:30 a.m. Brandi's children did not leave for school until 8:30. According to the coroner, Brandi died one to two hours after eating a breakfast sandwich. Thus, Brandi died sometime 8:30 and 9:30 a.m. Boaston indicated that Brandi was at the apartment until 10:40 or 10:45 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 94} While there is no direct evidence that Boaston was in Fulton County on the morning of Brandi's death, there was no cell phone activity on Boaston's cell phone during the period of time Brandi's phone was traveling to Fulton County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 95} While there is no direct physical evidence that Boaston strangled Brandi, the day after Brandi died, Boaston had a tear in his coat and scratches on his cheek and neck. Brandi's hair was found embedded in the Velcro of Boaston's glove. There was a mark under Brandi's chin that was similar in size and shape to Boaston's glove buckle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Prior to her death, Brandi had engaged in a flirtatious relationship with a co-worker and ended her relationship with Boaston. Boaston had a hard time \"let[ting] her go\" and \"mov[ing] on\" with his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 97} In the months prior to her death, Boaston was utilizing spyware to track Brandi's location and communications, yet after Brandi's disappearance, he appeared either unable or unwilling to share relevant data with family members and authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Boaston's friend, Derek Wood, testified that prior to Brandi's death, Boaston expressed concerns that Brandi was having a relationship with Daron. Derek testified that Boaston appeared depressed and saddened by the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 99} In light of this evidence, taken together with the other evidence presented by the state, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence that Boaston purposely caused Brandi's death. Boaston's seventh assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 100} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Mark L. Pietrykowski, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Christine E. Mayle, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
