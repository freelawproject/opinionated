Deckard appeals the judgment entry filed August 31, 2016 in the Gallia County Court of Common Pleas. Deckard was convicted by a jury on three counts: (1) illegal conveyance of drugs onto grounds of a detention facility, R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) ; (2) possession of drugs (heroin), R.C. 2925.11(A) ; and (3) possession of drugs (cocaine), R.C. 2925.11(A). On appeal, Appellant asserts three assignments of error. He first argues the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to confrontation by admitting into evidence a chemical laboratory report without also requiring the chemist who prepared the report to be available for cross-examination. He next argues the trial court erred by failing to merge his convictions for illegal conveyance into a detention facility with the convictions for possession of drugs. He also argues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of illegal conveyance of drugs. However, we find no merit to Appellant's arguments. Accordingly, we overrule his assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 29, 2016, Dustin A. Deckard was incarcerated at the Gallia County Jail. According to the trial testimony, he was booked in around 9:00 a.m. that day. During the evening hours, Deputy Cain noticed an odor similar to burning plastic. Appellant was in a cell block with approximately 8 to 10 other inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} During a search Deputy Cain discovered suspected drugs on Appellant's person. The substances were submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI) for analysis. A written report obtained from BCI indicated\n   the substances submitted contained heroin and cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 16, 2016, Appellant was indicted on three counts: (1) illegal conveyance of drugs onto grounds of a detention facility, in violation of R.C. 2921.36 ; (2) possession of drugs (heroin), in violation of R.C. 2925.11 ; and (3) possession of drugs (cocaine), also in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). The first count for illegal conveyance is a felony of the third degree. The possession counts are both fifth degree felonies. On June 23, 2016, Appellant entered not guilty pleas to all counts. Appellant was appointed legal counsel. He was scheduled for a status conference in July 2016, and for jury trial on August 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 8, 2016, Appellant's counsel was granted leave to withdraw. The court appointed another attorney to represent him. On August 24, 2016, the State filed a motion to continue the jury trial on the basis of the unavailability of a witness: the chemist from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). The trial court denied the State's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 29, 2016, prior to the beginning of trial, Appellant's counsel filed a motion in limine seeking exclusion of the BCI laboratory report which identified the substances found on Appellant's person as heroin and cocaine. The trial court denied this motion. During trial, the court allowed the BCI report to be admitted into evidence. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 31, 2016, the trial court conducted Appellant's sentencing hearing. After hearing arguments from the parties regarding the issue of merger of allied offenses, the trial court did not merge the counts and sentenced Appellant to a maximum and consecutive sentence of five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth, where pertinent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"I.

However, due to the change in attorneys, and through no fault of Appellant or his trial counsel, the request was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Trial counsel argued that pursuant to the statute, the trial court had the discretion to extend the time for filing in the interest of justice. In response, the State argued that it had intended to have the BCI analyst appear at trial but she was pregnant and unable to travel. The State maintained, however, that since Appellant had not made his request within the 7-day window, and the matter was in the court's discretion, that the motion in limine should be overruled. The trial court subsequently overruled Appellant's motion in limine, recognizing that trial counsel had appeared late in the matter through no fault of his own but, nevertheless, finding the report to be admissible as a business record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We recently discussed a Confrontation Clause argument in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant argues there is no investigatory evidence regarding the other inmates, and no investigatory evidence regarding visitors the other inmates may have received. Appellant further asserts there is no evidence regarding the circumstances of his arrest which would provide him with the opportunity to conceal substances for future conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) provides: \"No person shall knowingly convey, or attempt to convey, onto the grounds of a detention facility * * * (2) Any drug of abuse, as defined in section 3719.011 of the Revised Code.\" Appellant was indicted for possession of heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), and also for possession of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Appellant did not contest the finding that the Gallia County Jail constituted a detention facility or that the drugs alleged in the indictment constituted drugs of abuse as defined by the Revised Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} We begin by setting forth the relevant testimony. Nicholas Cain, a corrections officer at the Gallia County Jail, testified he reported to work at 4:00 p.m. on February 29, 2016. Appellant had been booked into the jail at 9:00 a.m. on February 29th. To Officer Cain's knowledge, an anal cavity search warrant was not requested or conducted at the time Appellant was booked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 34} While Officer Cain was performing routine duties, he noticed an odor of burning plastic in B-Block. There were approximately 8 other inmates housed in B-Block on that date. He and another corrections officer, Debra Smith, handcuffed the inmates to bars for the officers' own safety, and searched each inmate individually. Officer Cain's searches of the inmates yielded nothing until he came to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Officer Cain testified he performed an initial pat-down on Appellant and felt something. He retrieved a baggie with an unknown substance from Appellant's buttocks. Officer Cain handed the baggie through the bars to Officer Smith, who preserved it as evidence and turned it over to Sergeant Jason Brown. Sgt. Brown then preserved the chain of custody and eventually forwarded the baggie to the BCI Task Force technician. Officer Cain identified Appellant in court and Exhibit 1, the baggie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 36} He further testified once they finished the search, other officers arrived to assist. The officers searched the B-Block and found no other drugs or weapons there. Officer Cain took no further part in the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On cross-examination, Officer Cain testified every inmate is initially patted\n   down and then strip-searched when they are booked into the jail. He acknowledged the Gallia County Jail has video cameras above the toilets and showers. He admitted there was no video evidence against Appellant, and that no lighter was recovered. Officer Cain also admitted that his report did not list the names of the other inmates or witnesses involved in the incident and he did not check the visitor's log pertaining to the other inmates. He acknowledged there had been issues and ongoing investigations with items smuggled into the jail on food trays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 38} On redirect, Officer Cain clarified that the camera systems in the toilet and shower areas do not tape inmates as they shower or use the restroom. The camera systems do not preserve evidence of the inmates performing these personal functions. He also clarified that the reason he did not name other inmates in B-Block in his report was because Appellant was the only person on which drugs were found. To his knowledge, the defense did not request video evidence or visitor log evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Officer Debra Smith next testified that whenever inmates are booked into the jail, they are strip-searched and given jail clothing and necessary toiletries. She was working on February 29, 2016, and there were approximately 8-10 inmates housed in B-Block. She also testified during her shift she smelled burning plastic. They handcuffed each inmate to the cell bars. Officer Cain went into the block himself and patted down the inmates and searched them from behind the bars while Officer Smith remained in front of the inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Officer Smith testified that when Officer Cain searched Appellant, he \"pulled Dustin Deckard back, pulled the back of his pants out and he really had a funny look on his face. Um, he looked down, he reached into his pants and he pulled out a big plastic bag. Uh, he found this between Mr. Deckard's butt cheeks.\" Officer Smith verified that Officer Cain handed the baggie to her and Officer Cain then proceeded to finish the search of the last inmate. She testified after she and Officer Cain opened the baggie, they contacted other officers and turned the evidence and the matter over to Sgt. Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Officer Smith also testified that on numerous occasions, inmates bring contraband inside the anal or vaginal cavities. Gallia county officers are only allowed to do general patdown searches. They are required to get a search warrant and transport inmates to the hospital to do body cavity searches. Officer Smith's cross-examination testimony mirrored Officer Cain's. She acknowledged that the Prosecutor's Office, to her knowledge, did not request video evidence. She testified the food trays are searched upon arrival. On redirect, Officer Smith acknowledged that any item brought into the jail through an inmate's anal cavity would be unbeknownst to the officers until it was outside of the body cavity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Deputy Jason Brown testified he is an evening shift patrol supervisor with the Gallia County Sheriff's Office. On February 29, 2016, he was working regular patrol when he received information from jail staff about an issue in the jail. When he arrived at the jail, Officers Cain and Smith relayed the details of the incident and the discovery of the baggie on Appellant's person. At that point, Deputy Brown took custody of the evidence and secured it in the evidence room. On cross-examination, Deputy Brown admitted that to his knowledge, no interviews of the other inmates were conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Here, the evidence regarding the material element of \"conveyance\" is clearly only circumstantial.

While the evidence of Appellant's \"conveyance\" is circumstantial, we find the evidence, if believed, reasonably supports a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The guilty verdict here is based on direct and circumstantial evidence. Both Officers Cain and Smith testified that Appellant would have been patted down and searched upon booking on February 29th at 9:00 a.m. and both officers further testified that although strip-searches are also performed, they are not allowed to do body cavity searches without a warrant. Appellant's anal cavity was not searched. Later in the day, Officers Cain and Smith investigated a burning smell, searched 8-10 inmates, and found a baggie containing cocaine and heroin located only on Appellant's person, in his buttocks. From this testimony, the jury obviously inferred circumstantial evidence that Appellant knowingly conveyed the drugs into the jail via his anal cavity, and that he evaded detection of the drugs during the booking process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 45} For the foregoing reasons, after reviewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential element of \"conveyance\" of drugs into a detention facility proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, we find no merit to Appellant's third assignment of error and it is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Lastly, we consider Appellant's second assignment of error. Appellant contends he was subjected to Double Jeopardy by the imposition of multiple punishments upon him for a single act. Appellant argues that the trial court committed reversible error by declining to merge the illegal conveyance violation with the drug possession violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellate courts conduct a de novo review of a trial court's R.C. 2941.25 merger determination.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, the trial court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"Further as to the offenses being committed separately the Court finds that\n   the offenses of possession were committed separately from the offense of illegal conveyance. Mr. Deckard had to have committed the possession offenses prior to the offense of uh, illegally conveying them into the jail. Also as to the separate possession offenses one involved heroin and the other one involved cocaine. As such, the animus for one was the possession of heroin and the animus for the other was the possession of cocaine. Based on the above the Court finds that the offenses of illegal conveyance of drugs onto a detention facility, possession of drugs, the heroin and possession of drugs, the cocaine do not merge for purposes of sentencing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 52} At sentencing and on appeal, Appellant's counsel argued the conduct constituting the possession charges and conveyance did occur at the same time and place. We agree with the trial court's conclusion that the separate possession convictions, one for heroin and one for cocaine, do not merge for purposes of sentencing. Contemplating the third question set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ruff,\n   </em>\n   the possession convictions were committed with a separate animus. Therefore, they are not allied offenses of similar import. We need not consider the other questions posed by\n   <em>\n    Ruff.\n   </em>\n   The legislature clearly intended that possession of different drug groups constitutes different offenses.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the trial court viewed the possession conduct as separate conduct having occurred prior to the offense of illegally conveying them into the jail. Given the circumstantial evidence presented at trial, from which the jury inferred that Appellant conveyed the drugs into the jail via his anal cavity, we find this reasoning to be correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary defines \"convey\" in several ways: \"* * * [T]o bear from one place to another; to move: to carry away secretly: to transfer or deliver: to cause to pass from one place or person to another * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    www.merriam-webster.com.\n   </em>\n   2017 Merriam Webster, Inc. The inference arising at trial was that Appellant possessed the two distinct drugs outside of the jail. His \"conveyance\" or \"movement\" of the drugs into the jail facility constituted a separate and distinct action. In this way, the conveyance offense was committed separately and with a separate animus, affirmative answers to both the second and third questions prescribed by\n   <em>\n    Ruff.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Our research did not yield other cases in which the failure to merge a possession conviction into an illegal conveyance conviction was challenged. In reviewing cases involving appeal of other illegal conveyance convictions, we observe the\n   State provided evidence in many cases that upon booking, defendants were questioned as to whether they were carrying contraband and further, advised if they were later found to be carrying contraband, they would be subject to prosecution for the offense of illegal conveyance. In this manner, a distinct and separate break in the conduct would be obvious. However, the fact that the record herein does not contain evidence of such questioning, or evidence of further advisal to Appellant of a potential additional charge for any conveyance of contraband, does not change the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 55} For the foregoing reasons, we find neither of Appellant's possession convictions must be merged into the illegal conveyance conviction as allied offenses for purposes of sentencing. As such, we find no merit to Appellant's second assignment of error and it is hereby overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Abele, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs with Concurring Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Appellant's first court-appointed counsel was permitted to withdraw from representation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Evid.R. 103(A)(1) provides that a claim of error may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected and, if the ruling is one admitting the evidence, the opponent of the evidence raises a timely objection to the evidence, stating the specific ground of objection, unless the ground of objection is apparent from context.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at \u00b615.
