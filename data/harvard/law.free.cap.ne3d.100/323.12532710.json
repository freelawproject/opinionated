L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (<em>a</em> ) (1). Her operator's license was suspended, and she received a continuance without a finding for one year, with probationary conditions including payment of $140 in restitution. The defendant appealed, claiming (in part) that the judge erred in finding that she had an ability to pay restitution. We allowed the defendant's application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the judge failed to make adequate findings to support an order of restitution, we vacate so much of the order as required payment of restitution, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-9\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"325\" href=\"#p325\" id=\"p325\">*325</a>A judge may order a defendant to pay restitution to a victim as a condition of his or her probation. See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>McIntyre</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178156\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/829/#p833\">436 Mass. 829</extracted-citation>, 833-834, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20N.E.2d%20578\">767 N.E.2d 578</extracted-citation> (2002). Such an order has a dual purpose: it serves not only \"to compensate the victim for his or her economic loss tied to the defendant's conduct, but also to make the defendant pay for the damage [that] he or she caused as a punitive and rehabilitative sanction.\" <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250665\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/917/#p918\">57 Mass.App. Ct. 917</extracted-citation>, 918, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=785%20N.E.2d%20706\">785 N.E.2d 706</extracted-citation> (2003). Before any such order may be entered, however,</p><p id=\"p-10\">\"the judge must determine the amount the defendant is able to pay. See [ <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Nawn</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385164\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/1/#p8\">394 Mass. 1</extracted-citation>, 8-9 [<extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=474%20N.E.2d%20545\">474 N.E.2d 545</extracted-citation>] (1985) ]. Where a defendant claims that he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the victim's economic loss, the defendant bears the burden of proving an inability to pay. See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Porter</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273261\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/462/724/#p732\">462 Mass. 724</extracted-citation>, 732-733 [<extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20N.E.2d%20291\">971 N.E.2d 291</extracted-citation>] (2012) (defendant bears burden of persuasion regarding indigency, in part because '[a] criminal defendant is the party in possession of all material facts regarding her own wealth and is asserting a negative').

Although the judge's findings referenced the back injury, they do not indicate that the judge sufficiently considered, as required, the matter of \"the financial resources of the defendant, including income and net assets, and the defendant's financial obligations, including the amount necessary to meet minimum basic human needs such as food, shelter, and clothing for the defendant and ... her dependents.\" <em>Henry</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457197\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/117/#p121\">475 Mass. at 126</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20N.E.3d%20943\">55 N.E.3d 943</extracted-citation>. To be sure, the defendant bore the burden of persuasion, but the judge's findings were inadequate to support the conclusion that the defendant had an ability to pay restitution.</p><p id=\"p-14\">We therefore vacate the order for restitution and remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the question of restitution consistent with this opinion.</p><p id=\"p-15\"><em>So ordered</em>.</p><p id=\"p-18\">The defendant additionally argues that the restitution order exceeded its permissible scope, because the restitution amount consisted of the wages the judge determined the victim had lost due to her appearance at the restitution hearing. Concluding, as we do, that the judge's findings were inadequate to support any order of restitution, we do not address that additional argument. Nor do we attempt here to define the \"full contours of restitution, or the differences between restitution and the damages that are compensable in a civil action.\" <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Casanova</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658813\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/65/750/\">65 Mass.App. Ct. 750</extracted-citation>, 754 n.7, <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=843%20N.E.2d%20699\">843 N.E.2d 699</extracted-citation> (2006).
