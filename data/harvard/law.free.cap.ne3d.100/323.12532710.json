Concluding, as we do, that the judge's findings were inadequate to support any order of restitution, we do not address that additional argument.

Her operator's license was suspended, and she received a continuance without a finding for one year, with probationary conditions including payment of $140 in restitution. The defendant appealed, claiming (in part) that the judge erred in finding that she had an ability to pay restitution. We allowed the defendant's application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the judge failed to make adequate findings to support an order of restitution, we vacate so much of the order as required payment of restitution, and remand for further proceedings.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      A judge may order a defendant to pay restitution to a victim as a condition of his or her probation.
