Gomez, from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas following his entry of a guilty plea to nine counts of trafficking in heroin and one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 14, 2015, appellant was indicted on one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, in violation of R.C. 2923.32 (a felony of the first degree), seven counts of trafficking in heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.03 (all felonies of the first degree), one count of trafficking in heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.03 (a felony of the second degree), and one count of trafficking in heroin, in violation of\n   R.C. 2925.03 (a felony of the third degree). The indictment also named four co-defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 16, 2016, appellant appeared before the trial court and entered a plea of guilty to all ten counts of the indictment. During the plea proceedings, the prosecutor gave the following recitation of the facts, beginning with Count 2 of the indictment. According to the prosecutor, the events giving rise to Count 2 occurred on June 30, 2015, after detectives with the Columbus Police Department identified \"the group that was indicted in this case involving [appellant] and his co-defendants.\" On that date, co-defendant Manuel Montero, characterized by the prosecutor as a \"runner\" dispatched by appellant, \"sold over 50 grams of heroin to * * * Richard Adams.\" Adams was detained by detectives \"and found in possession of the heroin.\" (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The group remained under surveillance, and the events giving rise to Count 3 occurred \"[t]wenty-one days later,\" when detectives \"observed a similar narcotics trafficking incident with Joseph Martini,\" whereby \"Martini would call [appellant] and Montero did the sale [for] over 250 grams of heroin.\" (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 9, 10.) With respect to Count 4, the prosecutor related that \"Martini became an informant after his first arrest and made a controlled purchase from the same two individuals for over 50 grams of heroin on July 28, 2015.\" Count 5 involved \"an additional sale to the informant of greater than 50 grams of heroin.\" (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The conduct giving rise to Counts 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the indictment occurred on August 5, 2015, as \"[s]earch warrants were executed at about six or seven locations identified as either the places in which the defendants were sleeping, where they were obtaining the drugs, cutting up the drugs or storing the drugs and money.\" Specifically, Count 6 involved \"one of the locations [that] had numerous kilos of heroin that was used as a storage location by this group.\" With respect to Count 7, heroin was discovered in \"the co-defendant's car with him\" (i.e., specifically, co-defendant Omar Sanchez). (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The prosecutor represented that Count 8 was for \"another of the locations and that was greater than 50 grams of heroin.\" (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 10.) Count 9 involved the discovery of heroin at \"another storage location, greater than 250 grams.\" Finally, Count 10 involved the recovery of \"greater than ten grams\" of heroin at the home of co-defendant Sanchez. (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Regarding the facts giving rise to Count 1, the prosecutor related that appellant \"would take calls from customers and dispatch Montero to facilitate the trafficking in heroin for this group on more than two occasions for the RICO offense.\" The prosecutor further related that the heroin \"was being sold for about 900 to $1,100 an ounce,\" and that \"each of these transactions was for about $9,000 or so.\" (May 16, 2016 Tr. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Following the recitation of facts, the trial court engaged in a colloquy with appellant regarding his plea. The trial court accepted appellant's guilty plea, ordered a presentence investigation report and scheduled a sentencing hearing date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court conducted a sentencing hearing on June 23, 2016. During the hearing, the trial court noted that, at the time of the May 16, 2016 plea hearing, \"the Court incorrectly advised the defendant regarding the maximum possible sentence in this case.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 2.) Specifically, the court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The flaw was related to Count Seven where it was originally pled as an F-1, requiring-or having the maximum of 11 years of mandatory prison time. However,\n   Count Seven is actually an F-3 and on the previous guilty plea it was listed as both. And on the previous guilty plea * * * the Court previously advised Mr. Gomez that his maximum prison sentence that was possible was 110 years when in actuality, the maximum prison sentence that's possible for Mr. Gomez is less than 110 years and is actually 99 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court inquired of appellant whether he understood, and appellant responded affirmatively. Defense counsel represented to the court that he had explained this development to appellant \"outside of the courtroom.\" Defense counsel further stated on the record: \"We would waive any defect in the plea, proceed on the plea as originally entered, but with this amendment obviously to his benefit.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The prosecutor, \"out of [an] abundance of caution,\" noted that the trial court, at the time of the plea, \"indicated there were no promises as to sentencing,\" and that defense counsel \"had indicated an approximate range\" of sentence \"pursuant to off-the-record discussions.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 5-6.) The prosecutor further noted that, based on subsequent events, \"the Court has become aware more fully of the facts of this case, as well as the existence of a previously unknown significant record.\" The prosecutor then represented to the court: \"In case the defendant is not sentenced in the range that was indicated by [defense counsel], we want you to make sure that the defendant has the opportunity, if he wishes, to withdraw his guilty plea.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In response, defense counsel stated: \"I have told my client today that because of the facts that came out during the presentence report and specifically this arrest and deportation that the Court wasn't aware of, that may not be the range.\" Defense counsel also represented that he told his client \"he would be able to withdraw his plea, but that * * * plea negotiations would probably stop and this will be set for trial and go that route.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 7.) Defense counsel stated that his client wanted to proceed \"with the sentencing today with this amendment.\" (June 23, 2016 Tr. at 8.) The trial court then inquired of appellant whether he wished to proceed with sentencing, and appellant responded affirmatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} By decision and entry filed August 23, 2016, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate term of 22 years imprisonment. The court's entry also indicated that appellant was subject to a mandatory five-year term of post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following two assignments of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [I.] THE STATE ERRED WHEN IT CREATED FIVE SEPARATE CHARGES OUT OF THE SIMULTANEOUS POSSESSION OF THE SAME DRUG FOUND AT SEPARATE LOCATIONS INSTEAD OF AGGREGATING THE AMOUNTS INTO A SINGLE OFFENSE. THE TRIAL COURT CONSEQUENTLY ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO PROPERLY ADVISE THE DEFENDANT ON THE MAXIMUM PENATLY OF THE CHARGES, THE NATURE OF THE CHARGES, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE PLEA, AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURE TO MERGE THE FIVE CHARGES INTO A SINGLE OFFENSE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [II.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CRIM.R. 11 BY INFORMING THE DEFENDANT THAT HE COULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   TESTIFY AGAINST HIMSELF AT TRIAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Under the first assignment of error, appellant challenges Counts 6 through 10 of the indictment as multiplicitous, arguing that the counts involved the same type of drug (i.e., heroin), found on the same date at five different locations. Appellant argues that, based on plaintiff-appellee, the State of Ohio's, recitation of the facts, police officers executed search warrants on August 5, 2015 at seven apartments and one storage locker, and heroin was found at five of the locations, constituting grounds for Counts 6 through 10 of the indictment. Appellant maintains that the above facts give rise to the legal issue of whether the state can file separate charges for simultaneous possession of the same type of drug found at different locations, or whether the state was required to aggregate the drugs into a single offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} At the outset, we note the state raises the issue of whether appellant has waived his claim that the indictment was multiplicitous by failing to raise an objection to the indictment and by entering a guilty plea to the offenses at issue. In support, the state relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Conn,\n   </em>\n   12th Dist. No. CA2014-04-059,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1766\">\n    2015-Ohio-1766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202169273\">\n    2015 WL 2169273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 47, in which the court held the defendant waived any claim that his 50-count indictment was defective and multiplicitous by failing to raise alleged defects in the indictment prior to entering his guilty plea. The state also cites this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Fortner,\n   </em>\n   10th Dist. No. 08AP-191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-5067\">\n    2008-Ohio-5067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204416533\">\n    2008 WL 4416533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10 (holding that \"[b]ecause appellant pled guilty to six counts of aggravated robbery as charged in his indictment, he has waived his right to challenge alleged defects in the indictment\"). The state, however, acknowledges that appellant has also raised a merger argument (which, when not raised in the trial court, operates as a forfeiture, not waiver, of all but plain error).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Rogers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353553\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/385/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2459\">\n    2015-Ohio-2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20860\">\n    38 N.E.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Accepting, for purposes of argument, that appellant has not waived the issue of multiplicity, we disagree with his contention that the state was precluded from charging him with multiple counts of trafficking based on conduct occurring on the same date. In general, \"[a]n indictment is multiplicitous where it charges a single offense in multiple counts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hendrix\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. No. 2011-L-043,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-2832\">\n    2012-Ohio-2832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202369411\">\n    2012 WL 2369411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 51. In this respect, the \" 'vice of a multiplicitous indictment lies in the possibility of multiple punishments for a single offense in violation of the cumulative punishment branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202369411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, R.C. 2941.25, which \"codifies the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, clearly provides that 'where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import,\n   <em>\n    the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses,\n   </em>\n   but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=728%20N.E.2d%20379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting R.C. 2941.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} R.C. 2925.03 sets forth the offense of trafficking in drugs, and states in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) Prepare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance or a controlled substance analog is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As noted, appellant contends Counts 6 through 10 of the indictment are multiplicitous as involving the simultaneous possession of the same contraband. In support, appellant relies on federal cases holding that possession of drug stashes recovered on the same day constitute a single offense under the federal statute for possession with intent to distribute ( 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On review, we agree with the state that, where the facts presented indicate the recovery of stashes found at separate locations, involving different quantities of drugs, appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that the convictions at issue are allied offenses of similar import committed with the same conduct and without a separate animus.\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.

Having found, however, that appellant has failed to demonstrate plain error as to the merger issue, we find no merit with his claim that the trial court's failure to merge the offenses affected the plea proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Based on the foregoing, appellant's first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Under the second assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in failing to strictly comply with Crim.R. 11 by not properly advising him of his right against self-incrimination. Specifically, appellant contends the trial court failed to inform him that he could not be compelled to testify against himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Crim.R. 11(C)(2) states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of\n   guilty or no contest without first addressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (a) Determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved, and, if applicable, that the defendant is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant understands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon acceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (c) Informing the defendant and determining that the defendant understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him or her, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant's favor, and to require the state to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which the defendant cannot be compelled to testify against himself or herself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Certain rights enunciated under Crim.R. 11(C)(2) are constitutional rights of which a defendant must be personally informed, i.e., \"(1) the right to a jury trial, (2) the privilege against self-incrimination, (3) the right to compulsory process, and (4) the right to confront one's accusers.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
