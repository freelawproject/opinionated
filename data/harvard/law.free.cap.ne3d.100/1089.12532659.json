Rexrode, appeals from the judgment entry of the Franklin County Municipal Court finding appellant guilty of violating a protection order pursuant to R.C. 2919.27(A)(2). Because we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, we dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 17, 2016, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, issued, pursuant to R.C. 2903.214, an ex parte civil stalking protection order (\"ex parte order\") against appellant. The order specified, in pertinent part, that appellant not threaten or harass the petitioner and \"not initiate or have any contact with the [petitioner]\" including, but not limited to \"landline, cordless, cellular or digital telephone, text, instant messaging, fax, e-mail, voice mail, delivery service, social networking media, blogging, writings, electronic communications, or communications by any other means directly or through another person.\" (Ex Parte Order at 2.) The order set October 24, 2016 as the date for a full hearing on the request for a protection order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 20, 2016, police officers took appellant, involuntarily, to Riverside Hospital for mental health issues. A return of service states that a deputy sheriff served appellant with a certified copy of the ex parte order on October 20, 2016. The next day, October 21st, while still at Riverside Hospital, appellant called the petitioner. Appellant was released from Riverside Hospital on October 24, 2016 and was arrested that same day on charges of violating a protection order pursuant to R.C. 2919.27(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Regarding the full hearing on the protection order, a court order dated October 24, 2016 indicates that appellant moved the court for a continuance in order for appellant to \"obtain counsel, additional witnesses and/or evidence\" and that the court granted the motion and set February 8, 2017 as the new date for the full evidentiary hearing. (Order at 1.) A return of service states that another deputy sheriff served appellant with the continuance notice on October 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 26, 2016, appellant was arraigned on the charge for violating the ex parte order from the hospital calls; appellant appeared in person and was represented by an attorney. On October 28, 2016, while in the custody of the Franklin County Correctional Center, appellant called the petitioner while she was at work and left her voice mails. Appellant was again charged with violating a protection order pursuant to R.C. 2919.27(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At a hearing on the criminal charges on March 1, 2017, the trial court found appellant not guilty of the charge for violating the ex parte order arising out of the hospital calls and guilty of the charge for violating the ex parte order arising out of the jail calls. In the trial court sentencing entry, the court indicates that a \"court trial\" was held under R.C. 2919.27(A)(2), and the court imposes a jail term of 180 days with 124 days of time served and 56 days suspended, with two years of community control including 90 days G.P.S. monitoring. (Mar. 2, 2017 Sentencing Entry at 1.) The sentencing entry does not check the box or otherwise state that the court found the defendant guilty of the charge. The sentencing entry is signed by the judge and stamped as filed in the record on March 2, 2017. By a separately signed and stamped entry dated the same day, the trial court writes that a court trial was held and \"[b]ased upon the evidence the Court finds [appellant] GUILTY.\" (Emphasis sic.) (Mar. 2, 2017 Entry at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant timely appealed the March 2, 2017 sentencing entry. He asserts on appeal that his conviction for violating a protection order is not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence due to the failure of personal service of the ex parte order. In this case, we cannot address the merits of appellant's appeal because a lack of a final order subject to appeal under R.C. 2505.02 deprives us of jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Article IV, Section 3(B)(2) of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2505.03(A) restrict the appellate jurisdiction of courts of appeal to the review of final orders.\n   <em>\n    Flynn v.
