Our jurisdiction is predicated upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1292. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the finality principles of res judicata precluded its review of appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">Until October 1, 1970, appellant was a corporate\" on-sale general public premises licensee of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, in the city and county of San Francisco, and as such exercised the privileges of selling alcoholic beverages at retail consumption on its licensed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">On June 8, 1967, an accusation was filed with the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (hereinafter the Department) against appellant\u2019s alcoholic beverage license.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">The accusation, pled in two counts, alleged in substance that continuance of appellant\u2019s alcoholic beverage license would be contrary to public welfare and morals, within the meaning of Article XX, Section 22, of the California Constitution, and sections 24200(a), 24200(b) and 25601 of the California Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (Div. 9, Cal. Business and Professions Code).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>sation alleged that appellant \u201cdid permit, allow and suffer the * * * [licensed premises] to be used as a disorderly house and a place to which people resorted for purposes injurious to the public mind, health, convenience and safety * *</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Count I of the accusation was pled in eleven subeounts, and alleged that on various respective dates between September 1, 1966, and June 1, 1967, certain activities described in the accusation had occurred on appellant\u2019s licensed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Count II alleged that on April 26, 1967, appellant\u2019s president had in his possession, for sale or distribution, two named objects, conduct claimed to be contrary to public welfare or morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">On September 18 and 19, 1967, and May 27, 1968, hearings were held on the accusation before the Department\u2019s hearing officer. On July 11, 1968, the hearing officer submitted a proposed decision which found the allegations of the accusation to be true, and which provided for revocation of appellant\u2019s alcoholic beverages license on Count I, and a 30-day suspension of the license on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">On July 18, 1968, the Department adopted the proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">Appellant appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the California Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (hereinafter Appeals Board), the appellant tribunal established by Article XX, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>22, of the California Constitution to review decisions of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">On June 18, 1970, after oral argument, the Appeals Board filed its opinion, wherein it affirmed the Department\u2019s decision as to Count I (providing for the revocation of appellant\u2019s license), but reversed the decision as to Count II (providing for a 30-day license suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Appellant\u2019s subsequent petition for a writ of review in the California District Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, was denied. Its petition to the California Supreme Court for a hearing was likewise denied,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after which the revocation of appellant\u2019s alcoholic beverages license was placed in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">One month later, appellant filed its complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking to have appellees restrained and enjoined from enforcing the revocation of its alcoholic beverages license, because of claimed violations of its rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, presently codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jurisdiction of the district court was alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The federal complaint alleged (1) that the state revocation proceedings originated in a plan, scheme and conspiracy among appellees \u201cto eliminate [appellant\u2019s] business because it is frequented by adult male homosexuals and for no other reason\u201d; (2) that the revocation proceedings deprived appellant of due process and equal protection of the laws and chilled the freedom of association of its patrons; and (3) that the state statutory provisions pursuant to which appellant\u2019s license was revoked was framed in unconstitutionally vague terms of \u201cpublic welfare or morals\u201d and \u201cpublic morals, health, convenience and safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">The district court, relying upon Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); Flynn v. State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, 418 F.2d 668 (9 Cir. 1969), and Wilke &amp; Holzheiser, Inc. v. Reimel, 266 F.Supp. 168 (N.D.Cal.1967), dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint on the grounds that \u201ca District Court may not entertain appellate review of a state court judgment, nor hear collateral attack against such a judgment by considering a cause of action for injunctive relief.\u201d The district court stated that appellant's remedy under the circumstances was \u201cthat of appeal or petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">The district court\u2019s dismissal on the above grounds was predicated upon a determination that \u201cthe California Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ment of Alcoholic Beverage Control is a state court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d The district court made such a determination after examination of relevant California law. Martin v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, 52 Cal.2d 238, 340 P.2d 1 (1959); Covert v. State Board of Equalization, 29 Cal.2d 300, 173 P.2d 545 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that California law considers the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to be a state court of limited jurisdiction, <em>see Martin, supra; Covert, supra, </em>and that res judicata principles precluded its entertaining the federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Res judicata principles have been consistently applied to preclude parties from relitigating federal constitutional claims in a federal district court subsequent to an adverse determination on the merits <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of such claims by a state court of competent jurisdiction. The sole recourse for the losing litigant is by appeal or writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Further, res judicata principles have been expressly applied to actions brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. P I Enterprises, Inc. v. Cataldo, 457 F.2d 1012 (1 Cir. 1972); Taylor v. New York City Transit Authority, 433 F.2d 665 (2 Cir.) aff\u2019g, 309 F.Supp. 785 (S.D.N.Y.1970); Coogan v. Cincinnati Bar Association, 431 F.2d 1209 (6 Cir. 1970); Brown v. Chastain, 416 F.2d 1012 (5 Cir. 1969); Rhodes v. Meyer, 334 F.2d 709 (8 Cir.), cert. den. 379 U.S. 915, 85 S.Ct. 263, 13 L.Ed.2d 186 (1964); Goss v. Illinois, 312 F.2d 257 (7 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">While we recognize that application of res judicata principles to actions brought under section 1983 has been criticized,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> change, if any, in that area must emanate from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Inasmuch as the district court properly concluded that res judicata principles precluded its entertaining the federal complaint, Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972) is of no solace to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AvhI\">.
