The plaintiff, Mary Ellen Bernard, a citizen of Illinois, sued Omaha Hotel, Inc., the owner and operator of the Holiday Inn in Omaha, Nebraska. She alleged that she was injured when she caught her heel and fell in an exitway as she was preparing to leave the motel on July 11, 1969. The trial court instructed the jury under Nebraska law and upon deliberation the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-16\">On appeal the plaintiff essentially raises the following alleged errors: that the court erred (1) in submitting contributory and comparative negligence to the jury; (2) in excluding evidence concerning defendant\u2019s knowledge of the existence of missing tiles in the area of Mrs. Bernard\u2019s fall; (3) in refusing additional pre-trial discovery time in view of defendant\u2019s late disclosure of its maintenance records; (4) in refusing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested instructions; and (5) in requiring plaintiff to try her case to a six-man jury. Upon review we find no prejudicial errors in the trial court\u2019s rulings and affirm the judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-17\"> Mrs. Bernard was leaving the Omaha Holiday Inn from an exitway when she fell. The evidence shows some small tile squares were missing from the floor immediately in front of the door sill. The defendant produced evidence from several witnesses, including an officer of the Omaha Police Department, who testified that Mrs. Bernard had told them that she did not see the step, had missed it, and had fallen. This evidence was sufficient to place plaintiff\u2019s exercise of reasonable care into issue. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>sion to the jury of contributory negligence under Nebraska\u2019s comparative negligence statute. Likewise our review, limited by plaintiff\u2019s brief oral exceptions made at trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of plaintiff\u2019s requested instructions and the court\u2019s given instructions, convinces us that there was no error in the instructions. Further, the issue raised relating to the district court rule requiring submission of the case to a six-man jury has now been resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States, Colgrove v. Battin, -- U.S. -, 93 S.Ct. 2448, 37 L.Ed.2d 522 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s basic complaint centers around the restrictions placed by the trial court on her counsel\u2019s examination of Mr. McCue, the manager of the Holiday Inn. Plaintiff asserts that her counsel was not allowed to prove that an ice machine, located near the exit, had flooded prior to July 11, 1969, thereby supposedly loosening the tiles. Plaintiff claims this evidence was relevant to demonstrate the defendant corporation\u2019s knowledge of the defective condition existing. The difficulty with plaintiff\u2019s premise is that it is based on a supposition of proof that was neither demonstrated nor offered to be demonstrated and as far as the present record is concerned, it is extremely doubtful whether it could have ever been shown. The related examination of Mr. McCue was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-8\">\u201cQ. Going back to this period of July of 1969, had you had trouble with flooding in the breezeway area ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-9\">A. Not to my knowledge. It would be on these reports if we had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-10\">Q. Would you take a look at them and find out.\u201d Immediately following this plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-16\">\u201cQ. Mr. McCue, have you had problems prior to 11 July 1969? Did you have problems in that particular breezeway, Breezeway 165, with respect to the ice machine creating flood conditions in that breezeway ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqd-dedup-1\">and the court sustained an objection saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-17\">\u201cI say the jury and the Court wouldn\u2019t be concerned about why they were in the condition they were in, except as to the knowledge the defendant might have as to the records that existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-18\">In Hawkins v. Missouri Pacific Railway Company, 188 F.2d 348, 350 (8 Cir. 1951), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-19\">\u201c . . . the failure to comply with the requirement of rule 43(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., as to making offer of proof, leaves appellant here without any basis for complaint of the trial court\u2019s action. This is not a situation of such plainness and certainty as to what the witness\u2019 testimony would be that the making of an offer of proof could properly be regarded as a mere futility. Cf. Cropper v. Titanium Pigment Co., 8 Cir., 47 F.2d 1038, 1042, 1043, 78 A.L.R. 737; Gantz v. United States, 8 Cir., 127 F.2d 498, 503. And equally, the situation can not be said to be one that involves such a plain probable miscarriage of justice on seeming error as to entitle it to be urged that we should act sua sponte, without regard to procedural preservation and actual demonstration of the asserted error.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>Although we tend to agree that the trial court may have been overly restrictive in the examination, this witness\u2019 prior response indicates that he did not possess any knowledge concerning the flooding of the ice machine. Furthermore, an examination of the Holiday Inn\u2019s maintenance logs, later pursued in McCue\u2019s direct and redirect examination, showed that no record was made of such an incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">Complaint is likewise made that the court would not allow McCue to testify whether any employees noted a defective condition in the area on July 11 and July 12 and whether they made a report of the same. The record shows the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-5\">\u201cQ. Under your system of reports of employes of defective conditions or conditions needing repair in the premises, would this have included reporting missing tiles or loose tiles in Breezeway 165?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-6\">A. Had they noticed it, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-7\">* * * \u2022\u00bb *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-8\">Q. Assuming, Mr. McCue, that on July 11th, or prior thereto, a condition of loose tiles and missing tiles had been observed by an employe, would that have been a condition that you would have expected them to report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-MZ\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-9\">Q. If that condition existed on July 11th, July 12th or July 19th, the dates of the accident and the photographs, would that condition have been reported by an employe ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-10\">A. If they had noticed it, it should have been, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-11\">Q. You, yourself, did not notice it, you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-12\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-13\">Q. Assuming that condition existed at the time the photographs were taken on July 12, 1969, you didn\u2019t notice it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-17\">MR. SODORO: I object to the question, Your Honor, for the reason it is argumentative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-18\">BY THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-19\">Q. Did you or did any employes make any report of any condition on July 12,1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-20\">A. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-21\">BY THE COURT: Just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4x2\">MR. SODORO: Objected to, Your Honor, for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-23\">BY THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-24\">MR. SODORO: It is subsequent to this accident. It has nothing to do with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-25\">Later the witness was given the opportunity to review the logs to see if any employee had ever reported the missing tiles. Although the record is not altogether clear, it is apparent the logs failed to show that any employee made such a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-26\">Complaint is likewise made that the defendant was dilatory in turning over the maintenance records and that plaintiff should have been given more leeway to develop the names of employees to be subpoenaed at trial. We have examined the entire record and find no prejudice here. Plaintiff was given the names of all employees who possessed knowledge of the condition several months before trial. Only one such employee\u2019s deposition was taken and none were subpoenaed to attend the trial. Under these circumstances we do not find such prejudice in the record as a whole to hold that the trial court\u2019s rulings require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-27\">Although we affirm the judgment we nevertheless order that the defendant absorb its own costs and pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>one-half of the cost of the overall appendix. Defendant is responsible for requiring the appendix to contain the complete medical testimony which is totally immaterial on this appeal. Under Rule 30(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the parties are responsible for agreeing on only that portion of the record necessary for appellate review on the issues raised. The inclusion of the medical testimony merely prolonged the time for a busy court reporter to complete the transcript, increased the costs to the appellant and served to hinder the efficient administration of handling of a civil appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Judgment affirmed; costs are assessed as ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap5L\">\u201cNo party may assign, as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ARTX\">. Compare Harris v. Smith, 372 F.2d 806, 815 (8th Cir. 1967), wherein we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-21\">\u201cAppellee claims that in any event there was no offer of proof concerning the essence of Dr. Harris\u2019 testimony and therefore the issue is here not reviewable. Rule 43(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., provides specifically that an offer of proof <em>may </em>be made when objection has been sustained to a question propounded by the examining attorney. To make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>offer of proof in the above circumstances would have been the proper course but a formal offer of proof is not an absolute requisite to enable the presentment of error on appeal if that error affects the substantial rights of the parties. . . <em>. If a question is proper on its face and indicates an answer favorable to the appellant, no offer of proof is necessary.\u201d </em>(Our emphasis).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
