Arizona; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. Appellant Lyon contends that (1) the court erred in denying him standing to object to the evidence seized in Irion\u2019s motel room and in failing to suppress; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-15\">\n<em>Statement of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">Appellants, with Peter Lesser and Robert Ralston, Jr., who were also indicted but not apprehended, sailed a 38-foot sailboat, the Storm Petrel, into Oceanside, California, from Mexico without clearing Customs at San Diego.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-17\">About 8:00 P.M. on November 29, 1971 Lesser and Ralston inquired of Officer David M. Wanner of the Oceanside Harbor Police about mooring the boat, then located in the harbor\u2019s haulout dock, which is not generally accessible and not for the use of transient vessels like the Storm Petrel. Wanner assigned a mooring slip directly in front of the Harbor Headquarters building. Shortly thereafter Lesser requested change for a telephone call. Wanner asked why the boat had not been moved to the assigned slip, and Lesser replied that one of the occupants had gone somewhere and had not yet returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-18\">Suspicious, Wanner proceeded to the fuel dock and began surveillance of the Storm Petrel and its occupants. The vessel was located in a darkened area about 100 to 150 yards from Wanner\u2019s point of observation. Wanner observed a vehicle, later identified as a Ford Pinto, arrive near the Storm Petrel. An occupant of the Pinto, carrying a small package, went down the rampway where the vessel was located. A few minutes later three persons carried large parcels about the size of duffel bags from the vessel and placed them in the Pinto. The Pinto left the mooring area, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Wanner\u2019s attempt to follow it was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Later that evening, Wanner returned to the Storm Petrel and observed Ral-ston, Lesser and Lyon aboard the boat eating chicken. Wanner then became aware for the first time that, when the parcels were placed in the Pinto, there may have been four persons (including the driver of the Pinto) in the area of the Storm Petrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">About 10:30 P.M. in a conversation at the patrol office, Ralston told Wanner that they had come directly to Oceanside from Mexico without reporting to Customs at San Diego. Wanner phoned this information to customs officials and requested assistance. About 11:30 P.M. three customs agents arrived at the harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">At about 3:30 A.M., Customs Agent Gore had a conversation with Ralston, Lesser and Lyon, all of whom denied that they knew anything about parcels being removed from the Storm Petrel and placed in an automobile. They proceeded to the Harbor Police Office, where Lesser stated that Irion had, during their journey, departed from the boat at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">Also about 3:30 A.M., Officer Bezen-ah of the Oceanside Harbor Police reported observation of a blue Ford Pinto in the parking lot of the Travelodge Motel in Oceanside. A check revealed that Irion was registered in Room 11 and that the Ford Pinto (a rent-a-car) had been rented by him the prior evening. On the basis of this information, Agent Gore, accompanied by two other officers, proceeded at about 3:35 A.M. to the room registered to Irion and knocked loudly on the door. The officers did not have a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">After five knocks, the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d latch was lifted. Gore announced himself as a customs agent. Irion opened the door about 18 inches. Gore displayed his credentials, again announced who he was, and informed Irion that he desired to talk to him. Irion said either: \u201cCome in, but let me get my pants on first\u201d, or \u201cCome in, but I\u2019d like to put on my pants.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_lv\">Upon entering the room the officers observed three duffel-type bags leaning on the wall directly in front of them. After Irion returned from the bathroom, Gore asked Irion if he had anything to declare to Customs. Irion replied, \u201cNothing of any value.\u201d Gore then asked Irion if they could see the items removed from the Storm Petrel earlier that evening. Irion pointed to the bags and said, \u201cThere they are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">Gore asked Irion to open the bags. Irion attempted to open one bag, but, as it was sealed tightly with masking tape, he requested a knife. Understandably hesitant to give Irion a knife, Gore went to a nightstand, picked up a knife belonging to Irion, and opened the bag. Upon examination of the contents, a brick of marihuana was found. The other two bags also contained marihuana, along with sleeping bags, blankets and some books on navigation. In all, the duffel bags contained about 100 pounds of marihuana. Thereupon Irion was placed under arrest and advised of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">Later that morning Gore arrested Lyon near the harbor area and \"advised him of his rights.' Lyon later stated to Gore that he \u201chad no money in the weed, that Irion was nothing but a drunkard anyway, or alcoholic, and refused to make any comment as to where the weed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>was purchased or where the other individuals could have gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">\n<em>Warrantless Search of Irion\u2019s Motel Room</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Irion first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion .to suppress the evidence obtained through the warrantless search and in holding that he consented to the search of his motel room. Relying upon the holding of this court in Bustamonte v. Schneckloth, 448 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1971) and related cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he argued primarily that \u201cwhere, as here, there is no evidence that the appellant knew, or was informed by the officer, that he had a right to withhold permission for the search of the dwelling, effective consent cannot be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">Certiorari having been granted in Bustamonte v. Schneckloth when this case was argued on January 8, 1973, an order was entered vacating submission pending the decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Bustamonte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">Schneckloth v. Bustamonte was decided May 29, 1973, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854. In reversing the prior holdings of this court upon which Irion relied the Court held that knowledge of the right to refuse consent is but one of a number of factors to be considered in determining whether a consent is given voluntarily. The Court recognized that when the subject of a search is not in custody and the prosecution attempts to justify the search on the basis of his consent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Fourth Amendment requires that it demonstrate that the consent was in fact voluntarily given, and not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied. \u201cVoluntar-iness is a question of fact to be determined from all .the circumstances, and while the subject\u2019s knowledge of a right to refuse is a factor to be taken into account, the prosecution is not required to demonstrate such knowledge as a prerequisite to establishing a voluntary consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 93 S.Ct. at 2059.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">Irion contends further that he conditioned his consent to entry upon his first putting on his pants and that this condition was ignored by the agents, \u201cwho slithered through the eighteen inch door\u201d. Both the court and Government counsel questioned the accuracy of a similar statement by Irion\u2019s counsel at the oral argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: He said, \u2018Come in, but I would like to put my pants on.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A05\">\u201cMR. ARBETMAN: And the testimony was that he was allowed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: The door was opened far enough so that they could pass through without squeezing their way in and then they noticed 3 duffel bags.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-15\">There was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the district court that Irion did not condition his consent to entry on his <em>first </em>putting on his pants and that, in any event, the agent granted his request to put on his pants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>It is true, as appellants argue, that when, as here, consent is obtained \u201cunder color of the badge\u201d, coercion is implied and \u201cthe government must show that there was no coercion in fact.\u201d United States v. Page, 302 F.2d 81, 84 (9 Cir. 1962). We recognized in <em>Page, </em>however, that appellate courts usually sustain a trial court\u2019s finding that there was consent to a search, even though the consent was obtained under authority of the badge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> particularly where there is a finding of express consent. <em>Id. </em>at 84 and cases cited in footnote 10. Here the district court found that the agents were permitted to enter the motel room \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d and that Irion consented to the entry and the search of the duffel bags.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Considering the totality of the surrounding circumstances, we conclude, as did the district court, that Irion\u2019s consent was in fact voluntarily given and not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\"><em>Was Miranda Warning </em>Required?</p>\n<p id=\"anr-dedup-1\">Irion argues that the statement he made to the customs agents after their entry into the motel and observation o\u2019f the duffel bags was inadmissible as \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d within the meaning of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). As noted <em>supra </em>(Note 1) the parties stipulated for the receipt in evidence of the police report containing the testimony of Agent Gore. No objection was interposed to any part of his testimony, although subsequently in oral argument counsel suggested that <em>Miranda </em>would be applicable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">\u201cCustodial interrogation\u201d is \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. A number of tests have been applied in determining whether a person has been deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court in Lowe v. United States, 407 F.2d 1391 (9 Cir. 1969), adopted the \u201creasonable man\u201d test for determining whether a person is \u201cin custody\u201d, i. e., whether a person, as a reasonable man, believes that his freedom is significantly impaired. \u201cIt is the officer\u2019s statements and acts, the surrounding circumstances, gauged by a \u2018reasonable man\u2019 test, which are determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">In a careful analysis of the Court\u2019s language in <em>Miranda </em>and the application of the reasonable man test Judge Friendly pointed out that where, as here,- there is no actual arrest, \u201csomething must be said or done by the authorities, either in their manner of approach or in the tone or extent of their questioning, which indicates that they would not have heeded a request to depart or to allow the suspect to do so.\u201d United States v. Hall, 421 F.2d 540, 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>(2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1123, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">We conclude that the brief and non-coercive questioning of Irion at the time of the entry and search and prior to his arrest did not constitute \u201cin custody\u201d interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ap3-dedup-0\">Irion\u2019s final contention, in which he is joined by Lyon, is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions in that there was no competent evidence that the substance seized in Irion\u2019s motel room was in fact marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">It is true that the substance itself was not introduced into evidence at trial. This, however, is not fatal to the Government\u2019s case, since \u201cIt is axiomatic that the nature * * * of physical objects may be proved by parol evidence and production of the objects themselves is merely cumulative.\u201d Francis v. United States, 239 F.2d 560, 562 (10 Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">The \u201cpolice report\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the only evidence at the trial, contains the following references to marihuana:</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">The report recites at the outset that it involves \u201cthe seizure of approximately 100 lbs. of marihuana\u201d and under the title \u201cSeizures\u201d there is included \u201cA. Approximately 100 lbs. of marihuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">Under \u201cDisposition of Seizure\u201d it is recited that Special Agent Gore delivered the marihuana to the Seizure Clerk and that samples had been submitted to the United States Customs Chemist for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">Included as part of the testimony of Agent Gore with reference to finding \u201ca brick-type package inside\u201d the duffel bag, there appears: \u201cAfter close examination, it was determined that it contained marihuana.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">In listing the witnesses, it was recited that, \u201cCustoms Chemist, San Diego, California will testify as to the chemical analysis of the substance sent by the Seizure Clerk * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-17\">It is unfortunate that the report did not specify what the chemist would testify, but presumably when it was prepared it was assumed the chemist would be called as a witness. In any event, there is positive testimony from Customs Agent Gore that the substance was marihuana, and his competency to so testify was not challenged at the trial. In oral argument (approximately two months after the trial) all counsel relied on the stipulation and evidence at the suppression hearing, and there was no suggestion of any question regarding the nature of the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-18\">This issue was first raised on appeal. Had it been raised at the trial or oral argument, the Government would no doubt have been permitted to reopen its case and call the chemist as a witness or introduce his written report in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-19\">Under these circumstances, and in view of Gore\u2019s unchallenged and uncontradicted testimony that the substance was in fact marihuana, this untimely challenge by both appellants to the sufficiency of the evidence must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-20\">\n<em>Was Evidence of Lyon\u2019s Participation Sufficient to Sustain his Conviction?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXs4\">It is true, as appellant Lyon contends, that the mere fact that a person is a passenger on a sailboat from which mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>ihuana is removed does not make him criminally responsible for possession or importation of the marihuana. There must be a \u201cbasis for a rational attribution that he had some interest in the marihuana itself, or if he was without any such interest, that he was participating in its importation by some proximate action to effect that end, such that his status <em>* * </em>* was that of an aider and abettor.\u201d Bettis v. United States, 408 F.2d 563, 568 (9 Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Moreover, \u201cmere knowledge of the crime, or mere presence at the scene of it, is not sufficient evidence to convict a defendant of knowingly participating in a crime.\u201d United States v. Samaniego, 437 F.2d 1244, 1246 (9 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">It is undisputed that Lyon was one of four persons on a sailboat, the Storm Petrel, which departed from Guadalupe Island, Mexico, and arrived five days later at Oceanside, California, without stopping at a United States port of entry. The Storm Petrel was registered to Irion. Both Irion and Lyon were residents of Eureka, California, and each had a Mexican Tourist Permit for Ma-galan, Sinalon, Mexico, dated October 14, 1971. There is substantial evidence that 100 pounds of marihuana were transported in the boat, taken off at Oceanside, and removed by car to Irion\u2019s motel room, where the contraband was seized by customs agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">To determine the extent of Lyon\u2019s alleged participation in the possession and importation of the marihuana, it is necessary to refer in some detail to the specific references to Lyon in the \u201cPolice Report\u201d of the Bureau of Customs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">The first specific reference to Lyon appears in the \u201ctestimony\u201d of David Wanner, Oceanside Harbor Patrol, when Wanner went to the boat after his unsuccessful attempt to follow the Ford Pinto:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-13\">\u201cHe then returned to the Harbor Headquarters building area, but before returning to the office, advised the subjects in the vessel that they would have to move their vessel to the assigned berthing area. At this time, it was noted that there were three subjects aboard the vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-14\">\u201cUpon engaging in conversation with the third subject, later identified as James Evan LYON, it was learned that they were eating fried chicken and would move their vessel very shortly.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">The \u201ctestimony\u201d of Agent Gore contains the following specific references to Lyon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-16\">(Conversation with Lesser, Ralston &amp; Lyon about 3:30 A.M.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>\u201cGore then asked what articles had been removed from the vessel earlier that evening and placed in a vehicle, at which time LESSER and the individuals later identified as RALSTON and LYON replied, \u2018What vehicle are you talking about? Nothing has been taken off the boat, and we don\u2019t even have a car.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-5\">\u2022X- * -X- -X- *x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-6\">\u201cAt 5:10 a. m., 11/30/71, Gore placed LYON under arrest and advised him of his constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-7\">* * * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-8\">\u201cAt 9:22 a. m., Agent Gore re-advised LYON of his constitutional rights. LYON stated that he had no money in the weed, that IRION was nothing but a drunkard anyway, or alcoholic, and refused to make any comment as to where the weed was purchased or where the other individuals could have gone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">The trial court could reasonably infer from the evidence that Lyon knew that the vessel was transporting marihuana. He did not at any time in his conversations with the officers deny knowledge of the marihuana. Rather his statement that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any money in the weed\u201d was a tacit admission he knew contraband was on the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">It is true, as Lyon contends, that Wanner was unable to identify the three persons who carried the duffel bags from the boat and placed them in the Ford Pinto. The court could reasonably infer, however, whether or not Lyon was one of those persons, that he knew someone from the Ford Pinto had come aboard and that the duffel bags were removed from the boat. Within a few minutes after Wanner observed the transfer of the duffel bags he was aboard the vessel talking with its occupants. It was Lyon who then told Wanner they were eating fried chicken<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and \u201cwould move their vessel very shortly\u201d. Lyon participated in the later conversation with the officers when the three occupants remaining on the boat (Lyon, Lesser and Ralston) denied that any parcels had been taken off the boat and claimed that Irion had left the boat in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">This is not a case where the defendant was a passenger for a short period of time in a vehicle crossing the border. It was an extended trip by four persons in a sailboat, culminating in the five-day trip from Mexico to Oceanside, California.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor is it a case where the accused was simply present when the offense was committed or a mere listener when others made incriminating statements. He actively participated in the conversations with the officers and joined in exculpatory statements which were obviously false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">As we noted in <em>Bettis, supra, </em>408 F.2d at 568, proof of the requisite relationship to the contraband such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>the accused \u201ccould probatively be found to be more than a passenger\u201d can \u201csufficiently be made by indication from relationship, attitude, conduct, utterance or other probative circumstances shown.\u201d In our opinion this case is closely analogous to the situation in Eason v. United States, 281 F.2d 818 (9th Cir. 1960) where we sustained possession convictions, denying application of the \u201cpassenger doctrine\u201d on the ground that the occupants of the vehicle were close friends and had participated together in \u201cjoint venture\u201d fashion in a pleasure trip to Mexico. Here the reasonable inference that Lyon knew there was contraband on the Storm Petrel and the joint venture participation in the lengthy sailboat cruise were sufficient to establish that Lyon was \u201cmore than a passenger\u201d and had the required relationship to the contraband sufficient to sustain his convictions for possession and importation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">It is true that the evidence against Lyon is largely circumstantial, but as this court has recognized in many cases it is proper \u201cto infer a fact at issue from other facts which have been established by circumstantial evidence\u201d and \u201ccircumstantial evidence is not inherently less probative than direct evidence.\u201d United States v. Nelson, 419 F.2d 1237, 1239 (9 Cir. 1969). As to both direct and circumstantial evidence, \u201cthe jury must use its experience with people and events in weighing the probabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244, quoting from Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954). In determining whether a motion for acquittal should have been granted, \u201cthe reviewing court may properly inquire whether the evidence, considered most favorably to the government, was such as to permit a rational conclusion by the jury that the accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1242), and the test of reasonable doubt is whether the \u201cjurors reasonably could decide that they would not hesitate to act in their own serious affairs upon factual assumptions as probable as\u201d that the defendant participated in the criminal offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1245.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">Viewing the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that the evidence and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom were sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt on the grounds that the \u201cpassenger doctrine\u201d was not applicable and that Lyon was participating in a joint venture with the other occupants of the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Affirmed as to both appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">.

The Court noted that, \u201cIn situations where the police have some evidence of illicit activity, but lack probable cause to arrest or search, a search authorized by a valid consent may be the only means of obtaining important and reliable evidence.\u201d <em>Bustamonte, supra </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2048.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-0\">. Gore was examined and cross-examined at length at the suppression hearing regarding the conversation when the agents entered Irion\u2019s motel room. On cross-examination he testified in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-20\">\u201cQ. And what was the conversation, again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-21\">\u201cA. I identified myself to him. He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said, T would like to talk to you,\u2019 and I had my credentials in my hand. He said, \u2018Just a moment. Can I get my pants on? I\u2019m in the nude.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So, we stepped in.

This is clear from the trial judge\u2019s comments in open court following oral argument and before finding appellants guilty. The parties had waived special findings of fact. It may be noted also that Gore was examined at length at the suppression hearing and the district court had the benefit of this testimony, as well as the police report, in finding that consent was given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">. In view of this holding it is unnecessary to determine whether the search could be upheld as a border search, as is alternatively argued by the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">. The trial was held on April 13, 1972. No objections were made by any of the parties to any portion of the police report. The parties were given an opportunity to file briefs and present oral argument at a later date. At oral argument on June 5, 1972 counsel for Irion suggested the application of the <em>Miranda </em>rule by reason of the \u201cinterrogative atmosphere in his own house, 3:30 in the morning\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">. See Kamisar, Criminal Law and the Constitution \u2014 Sources and Commentaries, and particularly Chapter 4 dealing with \u201cCustodial Interrogation Within, the Meaning of <em>Miranda,\" </em>listing at page 362 four alternative tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">. The police report was in fact presented to the court by counsel for Irion, with this statement: \u201cMr. Arbetman of the government, and Mr. Politis (counsel for Lyon) and I have entered into a stipulation to the police report in this case, that if the officers named in the police report were called today to testify, they would testify exactly as they have testified in the report of the customs officers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1297-21\">. At the suppression hearing Gore testified on direct examination, \u201cInside the first package I opened up there was a brick-shaped object, which upon closer examination revealed to be marihuana,\u201d and \u201cThe other two also contained marihuana along with sleeping bags, blankets, and some' navigation books.\u201d \u25a0 On cross-examination he was asked by counsel for Irion, \u201cHow much marihuana was found in the bags?\u201d, to which he replied, \u201cApproximately a hundred pounds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">.

These cases involved presence as a passenger in an automobile transporting contraband across the border.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"ad--dedup-0\">. The determination of whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt by the trial court is complicated by the manner in which the case was tried \u2014 through submission of the police report by stipulation rather than an adversary proceeding with both sides having an opportunity to clarify con-clusory testimony. Wanner and Gore did testify at the hearing on Irion\u2019s motion to suppress. Lyon had not joined in the motion to suppress. His counsel was present, but did not participate in the hearing. It was agreed, however, at the trial that a transcript of the testimony should be obtained and considered by the court. All counsel referred to the evidence at the suppression hearing, but it was of course concerned with the validity of the search rather than Lyon\u2019s guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1298-18\">. This was between 9 :20 P.M. when Wanner first observed the vehicle and 9:50 P.M. when ho returned to the Patrol Office. Wanner testified at the suppression hearing that he observed a vehicle pull up adjacent to where the vessel was parked and a person \u201cexited from the passenger side of the vehicle carrying some sort of a package\u201d and went down a rampway where the vessel was moored. Shortly thereafter three persons were observed carrying large parcels of duffel-bag size to the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1298-19\">. Wanner testified at the suppression hearing that he found three subjects eating at that time and one of them stated they were eating Kentucky Chicken. He observed a bucket size barrel of chicken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">. At the suppression hearing Gore testified in part: \u201cThe three individuals jointly or unanimously said, \u2018What packages are you talking about? We don\u2019t know anything about that. AVe don\u2019t even have a car.\u2019 And I explained to them that one of the officers from the Harbor Police had observed what he thought was packages coming from the vessel and placed in the car, and they said, \u2018AVe don\u2019t know anything about that. We don\u2019t know what the officer has seen.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ar9-dedup-0\">It appears under \u201cHistory of Case\u201d in the report, signed by Gore, that in the same conversation Lesser stated that Irion \u201chad debarked the vessel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and they did not know his whereabouts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">. Under \u201cHistory of Case\u201d, it appears that after Irion was arrested, \u201cOfficers then proceeded to the vicinity of the STORM PETREL and arrested LYON, who had been observed proceeding from the vessel. Neither LESSER nor RALSTON could be found.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">. The court could reasonably infer also that the package carried on board contained the Kentucky fried chicken to which Lyon referred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1299-18\">. In colloquy with counsel during the oral argument, the trial court noted that Lyon was a passenger \u201call the way up the coast of Mexico\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">. Here a jury was waived and Lyon was found guilty by an experienced trial judge who was familiar with the tests to be applied in determining whether the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
