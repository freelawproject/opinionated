His adult criminal record consisted of two charges of disorderly conduct and one conviction of robbery \u2014 the theft of $40 from a theater cashier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His juvenile record showed charges of housebreaking, petty larceny, truancy, disorderly conduct, and involvement in taking several dollars from another boy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant had served a six-month sentence on the robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Each of appellant\u2019s four codefendants <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> received a disposition under the Youth Corrections Act. When, two weeks later, appellant appeared for sentencing, his counsel called the court\u2019s attention to his promising employment record and requested the court to either place him on probation or commit him under the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In response the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">This is not a pleasant case. This man has a perfectly terrible record, and the recommendations of the Probation Officer are adverse to the Youth Corrections Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Then, as we have said, appellant was sentenced to prison for five to fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">Our chief concern is appellant\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in refusing a commitment pursuant to the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act without an express finding that he would not benefit from treatment thereunder. For a convicted defendant qualified by age for a disposition afforded by the Act, an affirmative finding to that effect is required by our decisions in United States v. Waters,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and United States v. Ward;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in our recent <em>en bane </em>decision in United States v. Coefield,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we held that the sentencing judge must explicate his reasons for his conclusion that such a disposition should not be directed. Applying these requirements to the circumstances of appellant\u2019s case, it is evident that his contention has substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">The question to be resolved hinges on our need to determine the basis for the District Court\u2019s decision not to sentence appellant under the Act. In order to implement the rehabilitative goals which Congress sought by that legislation, Section 5010(d) <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> requires the sentencing judge to affirmatively find that the youth offender will <em>not </em>benefit from treatment under the Act before sentencing him as an adult.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the \u201cexceptional case\u201d where the judge makes such a finding, he may exercise his discretion to impose the adult sentence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but this does not mean that he has unrestricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>freedom to pick and choose between a disposition authorized for youths by the Act and the adult sentence authorized by the statute which the youth offended.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s discretion is strictly circumscribed by Section 5010(d)\u2019s requirement that he affirmatively determine that the youth \u201cwill not derive benefit from\u201d a commitment under the Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The affirmative finding which Section 5010(d) mandates involves more than simply meting out the full statutory penalty to an otherwise eligible youth. In <em>Coefield </em>we emphasized that unless the rejection of a Youth Act disposition is accompanied by explicit reasons supporting the conclusion that the youth will not benefit, \u201cit cannot be said with certainty that the Act was considered and a negative finding with respect to its possible benefits was made.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Even if it could be said that the disposition in appellant\u2019s case reflects a finding that he would not gain from Youth Act treatment, articulation of the judge\u2019s supporting reasons is essential to meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">As we pointed out in <em>Coefield, </em>a clear statement of the judge\u2019s reasons for refusing a Youth Act disposition is \u201cessential to a knowledgeable administration of the Act as intended by Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we held therein that the record in every case must reflect (a) that the judge is aware of the applicability of the Act to the offender before him and understands the scope of his discretion under the Act; (b) that the judge has been apprised of the aspects of the offender\u2019s background pertinent to the sentencing decision either from what he has learned at trial, from a presentenee report, or from a report made pursuant to Section 5010(e) ;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and (c) that the judge by his statement of reasons or reference to a Section 5010(e) report has related the facts of the offender\u2019s situation to the applicable law in concluding that the youth would not benefit from disposition under the Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">From the record of appellant\u2019s sentencing, it appears indisputably that these three essential considerations were neglected by the District Court. Here the judge simply stated that appellant had \u201ca perfectly terrible record\u201d and that the probation officer\u2019s recommendations were \u201cadverse to the Youth Corrections Act.\u201d There was no identification of facts in the presentence report indicating that appellant was an inappropriate candidate for a Youth Act disposition, nor does the transcript of the sentencing reveal any statement of any other reason why the judge felt that such treatment would be unfruitful for appellant. Neither \u201ca perfectly terrible record\u201d nor an unelucidated \u201cadverse\u201d recommendation by a probation officer is necessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the youth would not benefit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Those statements, standing alone without explanation or elaboration, can hardly be said to evince that relationship of relevant facts to applicable law which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>prerequisite to a refusal of Youth Act treatment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">When an appellate court is asked to determine the propriety of a denial of Youth Act treatment to an apparently eligible offender, and the record contains only a comment on the defendant\u2019s record and a reference to a probation officer\u2019s \u201crecommendations\u201d instead of an explicit supporting rationale for the sentencing judge\u2019s action, meaningful review is impossible. It is neither our function nor our prerogative to supply missing reasons for the judge\u2019s conclusion, and it would contravene the plain requirement of the Act and our own <em>en banc </em>decisions<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for us to affirm without such a factual finding.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We have no recourse but to vacate the sentence imposed on appellant, and remand for resentencing in accordance with the standards set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-24\">.
