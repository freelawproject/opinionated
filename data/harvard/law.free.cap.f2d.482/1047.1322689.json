BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">The question is whether summary judgment should have been granted below against an electrical subcontractor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in an action seeking damages for breach of contract against the general contractor <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the owner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the action was barred because Plaintiff below had failed to comply with the notice provision in the contract under which it was suing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After carefully reviewing the record, under the usual standard, we have concluded that the court below erred in finding the nonexistence of any triable issue of fact and entering judgment for Defendants below as a matter of law. Dunnington v. First Atlantic National Bank of Daytona Beach, 5 Cir., 1952, 195 F.2d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-19\">Summary judgment as envisioned by F.R.Civ.P. Rule 56, 28 U.S.C. A. is a method of testing in advance of trial, not as formerly on bare contentions found in the legal jargon of pleadings, but on the intrinsic merits, whether there is in actuality a real basis for relief or defense. Bruce Construction Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 873, 874. When a movant makes out a convincing showing that genuine issues of fact are lacking, it becomes incumbent on the adversary to adequately establish by receivable facts that a real, not formal, controversy exists. Stopping short of expressing any opinion as to how the trier should resolve the fact issue ultimately, we think App\u00e9llant has made the required showing and should have been allowed to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-20\">Perspective into the posture of the parties in this dispute may be gained by briefly reciting the events preceding the filing of the suit. On April 18, 1967 Appellant entered into a contract with General Motors Corporation which required that it provide labor and materials to perform electrical work in the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>struetion of the General Motors Lakewood New Final Process Building in Atlanta. The contract required that General Motors pay Appellant $356,950.00 therefor. Though the contract was negotiated and concluded between only Appellant and General Motors Corporation, it was generally understood between the parties that ultimately the contract would be assigned by General Motors to a general contractor such that Appellant would perform its contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the contract General Motors specifically reserved the right to make such an assignment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Prior to the conclusion of Appellant\u2019s contract, General Motors, on April 6, 1967, had entered into a contract in the amount of $1,279,470.00 with Whiting-Turner Contracting Company for construction of the Lakewood New Final Process Building. The contract specifically provided that Whiting-Turner, as the general contractor for the project, would assume the contract covering the electrical work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">In its contract with GM, it was expressly stated that Appellant would be able to (i) \u201cstart work immediately and proceed with the utmost dispatch and diligence\u201d and (ii) \u201ccomplete all work contemplated hereunder in accordance with the schedule set forth on page 1-E-ll of the Special Conditions.\u201d It was further declared that \u201ctime was to be of the essence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">Notwithstanding the urgency expressed in the contract, and through no fault of its own, Appellant was unable to begin work immediately. The project, initially scheduled to be fully completed in less than one year hence, was seriously delayed from the beginning by GM\u2019s rough grading contractor who was approximately six weeks behind schedule in site preparations. GM\u2019s Field Representative at the project site testified that the reasons for the delay, at least partially, were that the rough grading contractor had failed to follow instructions, failed to have sufficient men and equipment on the job, and failed to have adequate supervision on the job. Appellant was formally advised of this delay at a \u201ccontractors progress meeting\u201d held on May 1, 1967.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Immediately after this meeting Appellant protested its inability to begin work \u201cwithout delay\u201d by a letter addressed to Whiting-Turner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">By the terms of Appellant\u2019s contract, the building was to be ready for GM\u2019s beneficial occupancy on or before December 1, 1967, with the entire project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>due to be completed on or before April 11, 1968. To assist in meeting these contract completion dates, Appellant\u2019s contract required that the Critical Path Method (CPM) be used to plan and schedule all phases of the project. The preparation and final submitted to GM of a CPM, which was the responsibility of Whiting-Turner, had not been accomplished as late as September 26, 1967. The result was that Ernst and others working on the project received written instructions in the form of progress meeting minutes and bar charts which reflected changing beneficial occupancy dates. The beneficial occupancy date finally achieved was not until late March or early April of 1968 with final completion of the project not occurring until September of 1968. On January 5, 1969, Appellant presented to GM a 180 page \u201cclaim booklet\u201d seeking payments in the amount of $134,000.00 for purported delays and inefficiencies in completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">The suit below, initially filed in state court, alleged breach of an electrical construction contract in that Defendants delayed and disrupted Plaintiff\u2019s performance, thereby requiring Plaintiff to perform its contract over an extended period of time and in an inefficient and more costly manner. After removal, Defendants entered general denials and pled certain defenses which were to also provide the grounds for their motion for summary judgment which was made after discovery. On Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment the court held that the Plaintiff\u2019s entire cause of action as to both Defendants was barred by the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions contained in paragraph 52 of the contract, entitled \u201cProcedure for Alleged Change in Cost \u2014Contractor\u2019s Supervision.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>court specifically found that the procedure contained in section (c \u2014 1) of paragraph 52 was directly applicable to claims such as Plaintiff\u2019s which sought \u201cdamage or loss because of any action or omission of the owner, or others engaged by the owner, during the performance of the work * * * \u201d (note 9, <em>su/pra,).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s rejoinder below, and its contention here on appeal, is two-pronged. The first prong alleges that the provision of paragraph 52 which is applicable to its claims is section (a) which deals with increases in costs resulting from verbal instructions from the Purchasing Department [of General Motors] (see note 9, <em>supra). </em>Appellant contends that notice was not required because the increased costs resulted from written directives from Appellees. These written directives, it is contended, were in the form of minutes of progress meetings, letters and bar charts. Part (c) of paragraph 52, appellant maintains, only applies to extra work situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\"> The trial judge, while agreeing with that the increased costs claimed by Appellant were not barred by part (a) of paragraph 52 as the continuing delay was confirmed in writing, found that part (c) of the paragraph was applicable to the claims and that compliance with its provisions was, as a result of part (d), a condition precedent to any recovery. After studying the provisions of the controverted contract and in view of the settled law in Georgia that the construction and legal effect of a written contract is for determination by the court, Goodwin, Inc. v. City of Lafayette, 5 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 698, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s holding on this part of Appellant\u2019s argument was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">The second prong of Appellant\u2019s argument upon appeal, however, alleges that it did in fact give notice to Appellees sufficient to satisfy paragraph 52(c-1) by a letter dated May 1, 1967.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">The trial court rejected this latter contention holding that the letter failed in several respects to comply with the strict terms of part (c-1) of paragraph 52. Specifically, the trial court held that the letter was inadequate notice under the contract because (i) it was not sent to the Architect-Engineer (Argonaut, a division of GM) and the Purchasing Department of GM as expressly required by the contract, and (ii) the letter did not contain the amount of the claim and all details in connection therewith as required expressly by the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant retorts here that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>since its contract with General Motors (GM) envisioned from the beginning that the contract would be assigned from GM to the general contractor for the project (Whiting-Turner)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and GM\u2019s contract with the general contractor made such assignment mandatory,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it was not thus unreasonable for Appellant to have understood that any letters regarding delays should be sent to Whiting-Turner. Furthermore, it is argued that, considering the ostensible, if not yet formalized,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> relationships between GM, Appellant and Whiting-Turner, Appellant\u2019s letter of May 1, 1967 to Whiting-Turner should have served as notice to GM. Appellant asserts as supportive of this proposition the agenda transacted at the first project progress meeting held on May 1, 1967.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>paragraph 25 of its contract<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> made mandatory Appellant\u2019s attendance at these progress meetings and full compliance with the instructions promulgated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In response to the lower court\u2019s holding that Appellant did not state in its letter the \u201camount of the claim and all details in connection therewith,\u201d it is submitted on appeal that such a detailing and allocating of the additional costs involved here would have been virtually impossible at that time. Appellant contends that it was impracticable for it to arrive at a dollar measurement with any degree of accuracy until the project was completed. It is alleged that the original delay complained of in Appellant\u2019s May 1 letter was of a continuing nature, with further delays and resultant inefficiencies emanating therefrom,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> necessitating that notice only be given once to adequately apprise Appellee that it had a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-15\">A careful review of the record <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> has convinced us that threshold dismissal of Appellant\u2019s claims as a matter of law on grounds that it failed to strictly comply with the notice provisions of the contract was unwarranted. Here, Appellant\u2019s contention that the instructions given at the first progress meeting acted to modify the contractual reporting procedures and responsibilities is certain3y made more believable by the common knowledge among all involved that assignment of the \u201csubs\u201d contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>to the general contractor was predetermined. It is settled that the question of whether such modification actually occurred may not be summarily decided but must be preserved for the trier of fact. Farnsworth &amp; Co., Inc. v. Tri-State Construction Co., 5 Cir., 1959, 271 F.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The lower court apparently considered it significant that Appellant\u2019s letter of May 1 referred only to damages for delay itself and not costs due to inefficiencies. The court concluded that' the letter could not thus be considered to cover increased costs due to inefficiencies. We disagree. As already discussed, the vast majority of the inefficiencies complained of were either closely connected to or emanated from the initial delay complained of in the letter. The purpose of a notice provision in a contract is to alert the other party that the claimant has a grievance against it. We are of the opinion that notice that one cannot be responsible for extra costs inherent in a delay encompasses those inefficiencies caused by severe winter working conditions which would not have been incurred but for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The district court, while conceding that Appellant, at the time of its letter, probably could not have known the costs due to delay, held against Appellant in any event, because Appellant did not make known the amount of the claim when an official start date was given <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or as the increased costs were actually incurred. Our reading of the record has not convinced us that an official start date was ever in fact given to Ernst.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, since the initial delay appears to have been a continuing one, thereby causing certain stages of the work to be done under severe weather conditions with an absence of corresponding support as contractually required.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> notice given \u201cas the increased costs were actually incurred\u201d would have practically required Appellant to give daily notice. Bearing in mind the generally accepted purpose of the notice provision, which is to alert the other party of a grievance against it, we think the giving of such daily notice is more of a burden than a contract or the law should impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">The relationship of an electrical subcontractor with a general contractor on an overall project is in the nature of symbiosis. The performance of one is dependent on prior performance by the other, and so on until completion, with their combined efforts, producing, in this case, a building.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The general contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>tor, however, as the assignee of the \u201csub\u2019s\u201d contract, has the ultimate responsibility for completion of the project.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, though the subcontractor\u2019s attempt to give notice of its grievance was limited to its letter of May 1, 1967, there is ample evidence in the record that GM was notified of the hardships being experienced by its contractors due to the delays and the consequent severe winter working conditions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Our decision here should in no way be construed as relieving the parties to a contract of strict compliance with notice provisions and the like. To the contrary, it results from our conclusion that, under the particular facts of this case, Appellant complied with the notice provision contained in paragraph 52 of its contract to the extent reasonable. When a contract calls for such a specification of damages as the one here, obviously it cannot exact of a claimant the impossible, and no Georgia court would so .require. The question we have answered here is \u2014 need Appellant, at the time of its May 1 letter, have made their notice any more specific than it did? Our answer to that is one well supported in general contract law \u2014 if it could have, it should have. We think the record supports the conclusion that here it did all it could have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">Though never reached by the trial court, defendants below asserted four alternative grounds for summary judgment (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>One of them, we think, merits treatment here. On October 29, 1968, at the behest of Appellant,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a meeting was held between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>representatives of GM, Whiting-Turner and Appellant to settle \u201coutstanding directives which had not been covered by change orders.\u201d At this meeting Appellant accepted payment of more than $20,000 in settlement of these \u201coutstanding directives.\u201d Appellees argue that all claims, including the claims which are the subject of this suit, are barred by the settlement reached at the October 29 meeting. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">Though we would agree that Appellant\u2019s letter evidences a poor choice of language,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we do not think that their intention there was to settle the claims at bar here. To so hold would not only be to read that particular phrase out of context with the rest- of the letter, but, in view of the nature of the other claims settled at the October 29 meeting, such a holding would be illogical. The record' supports the conclusion that Appellant requested this meeting to settle various directives from GM to perform extra work incurred during the course of the project, but for which no price had been agreed upon between the parties. The only thing which remained on these claims of record was for the parties to meet and negotiate the prices.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Appellant here has demonstrated to our satisfaction that genuine triable issues of fact are in existence. Where such a showing is made, summary judgment may not be substituted for trial. Bruce Construction Corp. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">. E. C.

Also weighed heavily by the court below was the failure of the letter to mention costs due to inefficiencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">.

Advised that the site for the Process Facility Building would not be ready before June 12, 1967.

It was immediately following this notification that Appellant sent its letter to Whiting-Turner putting them on notice that it could not be responsible for additional costs incurred as a result of the delay (see note 7, <em>supra,).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">Appellant further submits that the agenda transacted at the meeting rendered inescapably reasonable its conclusion that Whiting-Turner was the proper party for such notification in accordance with its contract. In support of this assertion Appellant relies on the fact that it was instructed at the meeting to deal directly with Whiting-Turner on several matters. Entries in the minutes of the May 1 meeting reflect these instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-15\">2. Subcontractors will arrange with Whiting-Turner superintendent the location for all office and tool trailers.

Subcontractor shall be responsible for cleaning up daily and removing from the jobsite all trash and debris resulting from his operations. If he fails to fulfill this obligation, the General Contractor will take necessary measures to accomplish this clean up and will back-charge the Subcontractor accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-21\">7. Subcontractors will furnish badges to their personnel working within fenced plant area and they much check in each day with proper security guards. Only authorized personnel will be allowed within plant.

It is urged that the instructions recorded at the progress meeting clearly suggested, if not compelled, the existence of such a relationship here and that the announced purpose of the meeting serves to strengthen this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"ALv\">Appellant points out that the fifth entry in the minutes listed above, requiring the subcontractors to submit certificates of Insurance to Whiting-Turner, altered paragraph 13 of its contract with GM which stated \u201cContractor (Ernst) shall submit to the Owner (GM) certificate of insurance * * * \u201d. Appellant argues that the eighth entry in the minutes is likewise inconsistent with paragraph 3 of its contract which provides \u201cAfter the contract is awarded and previous to the first payment under the contract, the contractor (Ernst) shall submit to the Architect-Engineer and Owner a schedule of prices or breakdown of the estimated cost * * * \u201d and paragraph 8 of its contract which provided \u201ccontractor\u2019s applications to the Architect-Engineer for payment * \u00ae * \u201d. Ernst maintains that it complied fully with these changes in procedure without ever hearing a protest from GM. It is strenuously argued that the instructions given Ernst at the progress meeting should not be construed to have altered the contractual relationship of the parties on some matters and not on others. Finally, Appellant submits that entry number seventeen in the progress meeting minutes which stated</p>\n<p id=\"Al7t\">:}: * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afy-dedup-1\">As of this date Whiting-Turner has not received any contract documents (plans, specifications, purchase orders) for the assigned subcontractors. It will be necessary for these documents to be delivered before work can progress and bulletin changes can be quoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-17\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-18\">reflected only a delay in paperwork between the Appellees and should not permit them to escape liability to Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1106-19\">. Paragraph 25 of Appellant\u2019s contract entitled \u201cContractor\u2019s Meetings\u201d provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-20\">As directed by the Architect-Engineer, there is to be held at his field office a meeting of the representatives of the various trades engaged about the building, for furthering the progress of the work and giving of instructions by the Architect-Engineer. Where the Contractor\u2019s Representatives fail in attendance or in executing the instructions given them, <em>they </em>shall on request of the Owner be dismissed from the work and other representatives must be immediately substituted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1106-21\">. Appellant contends that the extra costs incurred as a result of inefficient performance during the winter season, some six to seven months after the initial delay, are directly attributable to the late start. Had the project been able to get underway as originally planned, Appellant contends that the omissions of Appellees such as failure to timely enclose the building, failure to provide roof heaters, and failure to provide temporary protection and heat would not have been so significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1106-22\">. Our review, not limited to the appendices prepared by the parties, has encompassed the original record including all depositions and exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">. Appellant\u2019s letter of May 1 clearly indicated that a proposal for additional compensation would be forthcoming after the \u201cofficial start date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">. We are convinced that Ernst\u2019s acceptance of the contract envisioned their beginning work \u201cwithout delay\u201d as its contract provided. In his deposition Mr. Bystry, the division manager for Whiting-Turner testified that he didn\u2019t believe a new (subsequent to the initial delay) start date, beneficial occupancy, or completion date was ever given by GM. The importance of an \u201cofficial start date\u201d where, as here, there has been an initial delay, is to inform all contractors whether the owner intends to hold them to the original contract completion date which would inherently involve extra costs due to accelerated performance (extra men and overtime).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">. The contract between GM and Ernst provided in its special conditions section under a paragraph entitled \u201cTemporary Space Heating Requirements\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-13\">After the building construction has progressed far enough, the areas will be enclosed by the General Contractor, by use of temporary walls, partitions and suitable coverings to retain heat within the work areas. Within the various rooms and areas the ambient temperature shall be maintained at no less than 50\u00b0F. and higher where and as required for each particular type of trade work.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1107-14\">. Of the seven items of work required to be complete for beneficial occupancy, three were of great significance to the Appellant \u2014 the floor slab and the enclosure of the building (roofing and siding). The completion of these three items of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>was important to Appellant because a large part of its work was overhead electrical work. The floor slab was critical since Appellant, when bidding the job, had planned to use rolling scaffolding. The roofing and siding was necessary to prevent rain, sleet, snow, and cold weather from interfering with the work.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">The revised bar charts and job schedules distributed periodically to Appellant reflected repeated ijostponements of the completion of these three items of work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">. It is significant here that Mr. Feren, GM\u2019s Field Representative, testified that the delays on the project were due to no fault of Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">. AVhiting-Turner notified GM by letter dated January 17, 1968 that, due to the initial delay, they were experiencing great hardship involving additional time and money resulting from severe winter weather working conditions. There can be no doubt that GM knew that these hardships must have equally hampered the activities of the \u201csubs\u201d working under Whiting-Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">As it turned out, Whiting-Turner never submitted a claim for additional compensation. Mr. Bystry, Division Manager for Whiting-Turner, testified that \u201cthe main purpose (of the letter) was for us to get on record * * * with the owner in accordance with the specifications for any delays or claims that we might come up with a later day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">That GM was acutely aware of the continuing problems caused by the initial delay is made manifestly clear evidenced by a letter from GM\u2019s field representative, Mr. Greco, to GM\u2019s Senior Project Engineer, Mr. Feren, written upon receipt of Whiting-Turner\u2019s letter of January 17, 1968. In that letter Mr. Greco speculated that the efficiency of the men working on the project in the extremely cold weather dropped to 40% of that which was normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">The \u201cprogress meetings\u201d and periodic \u201cbar charts,\u201d a substitute for the CPM requirement which had never become reality, had as their purpose the assurance of timely completion of the various phases of the project. The minutes of the meetings and the revised job schedules which were submitted continually from Whiting-Turner and General Motors to Appellant clearly confirmed their knowledge of the delays. There is ample evidence in the record which indicates that there was no \u201csurprise\u201d upon receipt of Appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">.
