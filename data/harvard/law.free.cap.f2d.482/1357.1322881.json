Lowe charging her with unlawfully uttering and publishing three forged United States Savings Bonds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495. She entered a plea of not guilty at her arraignment on July 20, 1972. Lowe appeared again on September 7, 1972 and, while accompanied by competent counsel, changed her plea to guilty to Count Two of the indictment. Thereafter the District Court imposed a two year sentence on December 7, 1972. Lowe\u2019s subsequent request for an opportunity to examine the presen-tence report was denied and this appeal followed. It is contended that the sentence was so harsh as to amount to an abuse of discretion and that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and the assistance of counsel were denied when she was not permitted to view the presentence report. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-14\">This Court has long declined to interfere in a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence except in the most extraordinary circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In United States v. Latimer, 415 F.2d 1288 (6th Cir. 1969), we had occasion to state the position which we reaffirm today. There we stated: \u201cThe sentencing of one convicted of a crime is largely dependent on matters which are within the knowledge, experience and judgment of the sentencing court. For this reason the District Courts are given broad discretion in assessing punishment within the limits of the various federal statutes. On appeal this Court will not disturb that sentence unless there has been a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d 415 F.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-15\">Congress has provided that whoever violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495 shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. The sentence imposed by the District Court is well within the statutory limits and certainly cannot be said to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-16\">Appellant\u2019s second contention raises the issue of whether a criminal defendant has a right to examin'e a presentence report. If appellant has this right, it must be found in the Constitution. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are clear in indicating that a defendant has no such absolute right. Rule 32(c)(2), Fed.R.Crim.P., provides that a district judge <em>may </em>disclose all or part of the material contained in the presentence report. This has been uniformly interpreted as granting discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>tion to the trial court in determining whether a defendant should be permitted to examine the report. <em>2 </em>Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 524.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">No reported decision of this Court on this constitutional isspe has been found. We follow the sound reasoning expressed by several other Circuits in rejecting this contention of appellant. <em>See </em>United States v. Stidham, 459 F.2d 297 (10th Cir. 1972); United States v. McKinney, 450 F.2d 943 (4th Cir. 1971); United States v. Warren, 432 F.2d 772 (5th Cir. 1970); Fernandez v. United States, 432 F.2d 426 (9th Cir. 1970). <em>Contra, </em>Verdugo v. United States, 402 F.2d 599, 613 (9th Cir. 1968) [concurring opinion of Judge Browning], cert. denied, 402 U.S. 961, 91 S.Ct. 1623; 29 L.Ed.2d 124 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1410-17\"><em>.

In an analogous situation the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit a state judge from relying on responsible information in a presentence report even though the defendant has not had an opportunity to confront those persons providing the information.
