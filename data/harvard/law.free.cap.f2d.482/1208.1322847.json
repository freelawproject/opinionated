The amount transferred to the amortization reserve account may be used pursuant to \u00a7 10(d) to reduce a licensee\u2019s net investment in the project. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(d). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>means that if, after expiration of the license, the government decided to take over or recapture the project under \u00a7 14 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 807,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it will be required to compensate the licensee for its net investment in the project reduced by the amortization reserve for the project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">We are concerned here with Alabama Power\u2019s Project No. 82 (the Mitchell Dam on the Coosa River in Alabama). On August 15, 1943, Project No. 82 completed its first twenty years of operation, thus becoming subject to \u00a7 10(d) for periods after this date. On November 1, 1959, the Commission\u2019s accounting staff concluded that Alabama Power had derived excess earnings from Project No. 82 for the period from August 15, 1943 through December 31, 1949. It was therefore recommended that the licensee transfer certain funds from Account 216, Unappropriated Retained Earnings to Account 264, Amortization Reserve-Federal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Believing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Project had not accumulated excess earnings and also objecting to the methods used by the staff in reaching its result, Alabama Power appealed the staff\u2019s decision. The Presiding Examiner, after conducting appropriate hearings, upheld the staff\u2019s recommendation. The company then proceeded to the Commission. Briefs were filed and oral argument was held on May 19, 1964. In the meantime, and before the Commission had reached a decision, the Commission decided that it was necessary to establish a method for determining a licensee\u2019s net investment in a project as that term is used in \u00a7 3(13) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(13).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A notice of proposed rulemaking was issued on January 20, 1966. Because the establishment of amortization reserves under \u00a7 10(d) is related to the computation of net investment in a project under \u00a7 3 (13),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the instant proceedings were deferred pending the outcome of the rule-making. The Commission was unable, however, to come up with a satisfactory uniform method of calculating net investment. On September 27, 1968, the Commission issued Order No. 370, 40 FPC 1351, setting forth the proposed formula. After numerous objections were filed, a rehearing was held, the re-suit being that on August 4, 1969, Order No. 387, 42 FPC 330, was issued which concluded that Order No. 370 should be set aside and the rulemaking terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">After this interlude the present proceedings resumed. The Commission upheld the Presiding Examiner in all respects save two.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Alabama Power brought this petition for review of Commission Opinion No. 596, - FPC - (1971), when it failed to obtain the relief it desired on rehearing before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">Project No. 82 is only a part of Alabama Power\u2019s power generating system. The complete system is referred to as the Electric Department. While a licensee is required to keep detailed accounting records as to the total earnings of the whole system, it is not required to identify earnings as attributable to a particular project. Thus, because we are concerned with the excess earnings of only one project in the system, No. 82, it is necessary to allocate a portion of the Electric Department\u2019s earnings to No. 82 in order to determine if this project produced excess earnings for the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">Both Alabama Power and the FPC agree on the allocation formula. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>formula states that the proportional relationship of project earnings to investment base of the project shall be equal to the proportional relationship of Electric Department earnings to investment base of the Electric Department.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Order No. 596, <em>supra, </em>at f\u00ed 15. Once the project earnings are determined, it will be a relatively simple task to ascertain the amount of those earnings which can be labeled \u201cexcess or surplus\u201d as exceeding the licensee\u2019s specified reasonable rate of return. The controversy, therefore, centers around the proper method of computing project earnings. It is at this point that the company hopes to reduce the ultimate amount of excess earnings required to be transferred to the amortization reserve account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The issues in this case can be further narrowed. The true unknown in the allocation formula is project earnings. The Electric Department earnings are determinable by reference to the licensee\u2019s books.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Generally, the investment base of both the project and the Electric Department is not difficult to determine. But the problem \u2014 which is the crux of this case \u2014 is resolving what elements should comprise the investment base. Alabama Power disagrees with the Commission in four particular areas and these form the issues to be resolved here: (1) the term \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d as used in \u00a7 10(d) of the Act, and in Article 17 of the license, contemplates an investment base undiminished by depreciation reserves; (2) the unamortized portion of the Plant Acquisition Adjustments Account should be included in the Electric Department investment base;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) the Electric Department investment base should include contributions in aid of construction; and (4) construction work in progress should be included in the investment base of both the Electric Department and the project. As can be seen, each issue relates to an effort by the company to increase the investment base (the denominator of the allocation equation) of either the Electric Department or the project, or both. If the company can increase the denominator of the equation, then naturally the resulting percentage will be lower. When this lower earnings percentage is applied to Electric Department earnings to determine the allocable portion of Project No. 82 earnings, a lower dollar amount will result. The company\u2019s goal would thus be achieved \u2014lower project earnings and correspondingly decreased excess earnings required to be transferred to the amortization reserve account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">We turn first to a consideration of whether \u2014 as the Commission held \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>investment base of both the Electric Department and the project for purposes of allocation should not include depreciation reserves. The resolution of this question turns on the meaning of \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d as that term was used in \u00a7 10(d) of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920, in Regulation 17 of the Commission\u2019s Rules and Regulations, First Revised Issue, effective June 6, 1921, and in Article 17 of the license issued to Alabama Power for Project No. 82.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The parties have created a mystery surrounding the meaning of this term and have developed complex arguments based primarily on legislative history and 1920 accounting principles in quest of their differing solutions to this mystery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have concluded, nevertheless, that the issue is resolved very simply. For after all is said and done, and we return to the beginning, the Act and the license, we find that \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d is defined in the license, and that the definition there contemplates an undepreciated investment base. The controversy must end once that conclusion has been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\">As originally enacted \u00a7 10(d) of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-5\">\u201cThat after the first tweny years of operation, out of surplus earned thereafter, if any, accumulated in excess of a specified reasonable rate of return upon the <em>actual, legitimate investment </em>of a licensee in any project or projects under license, the licensee shall establish and maintain amortization reserves, which reserves shall, in the discretion of the Commission, be held until termination of the license or be applied from time to time in reduction of the net investment. Such specified rate of return and the proportion of such surplus earnings to be paid into and held in such reserves shall be set forth in the license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">Federal Water Power Act, \u00a7 10, ch. 285, 41 Stat. 1068 (1920), as amended 16 U. S.C. \u00a7 803(d) (1968) (emphasis added).' Section 1 of Regulation 17 of the Commission\u2019s 1921 Rules and Regulations tracks the language of \u00a7 10(d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 2 of this regulation defines the term \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d for purposes of \u201cthis regulation and of Section 10(d) of the act\u201d in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-14\"><em>\u201cActual, legitimate investment </em>means the net debit balance in the fixed capital accounts of a project or projects of items properly includible therein under the accounting rules and regulations of the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>Regulation 17 is incorporated into Article 17 of Alabama Power\u2019s license for Project No. 82.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">As the Commission recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-5\">\u201cEven though Section 10(d) relates to computing excess earnings, based on a comparison of allocated earnings and the specified reasonable return, and even though it does not directly govern allocation of earnings, it nevertheless provides that the investment in the project is the \u2018actual, legitimate investment\u2019 in the project. <em>Facing the problem of defining this phrase is thus made a prerequisite to allocating earnings to the project.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Opinion No. 596, <em>supra, </em>at ff 32 (emphasis added). Because this phrase is defined in Article 17 of the license by reference to Commission Regulation 17 as being the \u201cnet debit balance in the fixed capital accounts,\u201d we must determine what role depreciation plays in arriving at the net debit balance of the fixed capital accounts. If depreciation is deducted in arriving at this balance, then the phrase \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d means a figure computed by deducting depreciation. If, in arriving at the net debit balance in the fixed capital accounts, depreciation is not deducted, however, then \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d must mean a figure calculated without reduction of depreciation. For the answer, we look to the testimony before the Presiding Examiner of Paul J. Arrington, the FPC staff\u2019s expert witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-7\">\u201c. . . The term \u2018net debit balance,\u2019 as used in the Regulation 17 refers to the fixed capital accounts and the net debit balance in the fixed capital accounts is the original project cost plus additions minus retirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-11\">PRESIDING EXAMINER: And depreciation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-13\">THE WITNESS: Not depreciation. Depreciation is not recorded in the fixed capital accounts. The net debit balances in the fixed capital accounts would be only the original cost of the property as originally constructed plus the cost of additions and minus the cost of retirements and minus the cost of any amounts representing donations, donations in aid of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-14\">Now, it is our position that the definition of \u2018actual legitimate investment\u2019 in Regulation 17, is not correct in view of the clarification amendment of the Act in 1935.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-15\">Neither party has presented, and our independent research has not disclosed, any reason to conclude that the staff\u2019s expert erroneously defined the phrase \u201cnet debit balance in the fixed capital accounts.\u201d It is thus clear that the term \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d as defined by Commission Regulation 17 for purposes of \u00a7 10(d) of the 1920 Act and for the license to Project No. 82 means a figure calculated without a reduction of depreciation reserves. Therefore, unless there is a reason to ignore this definition, it must control this case, and Alabama Power\u2019s investment base for allocation purposes should not be reduced by depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-16\">The amendment of \u00a7 10(d) in 1935 does not furnish a basis for ignoring the 1920 definition of \u201cactual, legitimate investment.\u201d We realize, of course, that when the Federal Water Power Act was amended in 1935 to become Part I of the Federal Power Act, the term \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d as used in \u00a7 10(d) of the original version of the Act, was changed to read \u201cnet investment.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>FPC relies heavily on the evidence that this amendment was made merely for clarification and was not intended to substantively change the meaning of this section.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, notwithstanding the arguments to the contrary, we have held that the term, as used in Alabama Power\u2019s license for Project No. 82, is clearly defined. We cannot ignore this definition on the ground that \u2014 in Mr. Arring-ton\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cthe definition of \u2018actual legitimate investment\u2019 in Regulation 17 is not correct.\u201d That definition, even though it may not be \u201ccorrect,\u201d is the definition which is correct for purposes of determining the meaning of actual, legitimate investment in this allocation case which has its roots in a license issued before the alleged correction in the definition. \u201cA license issued under Part I of the Federal Power Act may not be altered except by agreement between the Federal Power Commission and the licensee. (\u00a7 6 of the Act [16 U.S.C. \u00a7 799]). The Commission has no power, acting alone, to amend or in any way change an outstanding license.\u201d Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Federal Power Com\u2019n, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 202 F.2d 190, at 198 n.3 (1952), aff\u2019d, 347 U.S. 239, 74 S.Ct. 487, 98 L.Ed. 666 (1954). <em>See </em>Alabama Power Co. v. Federal Power Com\u2019n, 291 F.2d 558 (5th Cir., 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Through an analysis influenced by a desire to implement what it believed to be sound policy considerations <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Commission held that actual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>legitimate investment means a depreciated investment base. Paragraph 35 of its opinion is illustrative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-4\">\u201cThe staff has offered an unconvincing argument that the phrase, \u2018actual, legitimate investment,\u2019 as defined by the reference in Regulation 17 to \u2018net debit balance,\u2019 requires deduction of depreciation. However, we take note of the fact that at the time the regulations were written, a profound difference of opinion existed within the accounting profession with regard to the accounting treatment of depreciation. Regulation 17, as interpreted by the licensee, did not reflect the thinking which was beginning to prevail within accounting circles at the time the license was issued. Furthermore, it is unlikely that anyone carefully explored the exact meaning of the terms in Regulation 17 since, by law under Section 10(d), Regulation 17 would not be applied for twenty years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Thus, the Commission, at least implicitly, recognized that actual, legitimate investment, defined in Regulation 17 as the \u201cnet debit balance in the fixed capital accounts\u201d does not require deduction of depreciation. Nevertheless, the Commission side-stepped this conclusion by reasoning that \u201cthe issue should be stated in terms of clarifying what has been heretofore an unclear Commission policy, from the point of view of Alabama Power Company and other licensees. The issue then becomes whether the Commission can legally prescribe a new rule, in spite of the estoppel and binding contract questions.\u201d Opinion No. 596, <em>supra, </em>at j[ 40. The Commission then concluded that \u201cthe Commission\u2019s discretion to prescribe a precise rule is clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at f[ 46. The Commission\u2019s formulation of the issue and the analysis resolving it in favor of the FPC were based on the premise that the meaning of actual, legitimate investment, as used in Alabama Power\u2019s license, needed clarifying. That we disagree with this premise is clear from our earlier analysis of \u00a7 10(d), prior to amendment, Regulation 17, and Article 17 of Alabama Power\u2019s license. For this reason, we cannot accept the Commission\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s investment base must be determined by deducting depreciation reserves.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We, therefore, set aside that portion of the Commission\u2019s order which required Alabama Power to allocate earnings to Project No. 82 on the basis of a depreciated investment base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-9\">\u201cWhen a utility acquires property to be used as an operating unit, and when the purchase price is more than the original cost of the property less the accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization as of the time of the acquisition, the excess portion of the purchase price is placed in Account 100.5, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustment. It is then amortized over a period of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">Opinion No. 596, - F.P.C. -, at H 60 (1971). Alabama Power\u2019s electric plant acquisition adjustments account contained a \u201csubstantial sum\u201d referable to the period involved in this \u00a7 10(d) allocation proceeding. The company argued that this sum should be included in the Electric Department\u2019s investment base,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but this contention was rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>by the staff and the Examiner. The Commission, however, accepted the company\u2019s argument for including such un-amortized sums in the Electric Department\u2019s investment base and adopted the following standard as the test for determining whether inclusion is appropriate in a particular allocation proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-4\">\u201cWe think that in an amortization reserve proceeding our treatment of the unamortized portion of the acquisition adjustments account should be determined by reference to the policy of the state regulatory commission which sets the retail rates for the utility owning the project. To the extent that a state commission in a rate proceeding has actually allowed acquisition adjustments in the rate base, the Federal Power Commission, for allocation purposes only, will allow such amounts in the earnings (investment) base of the company\u2019s electric department and in the earnings base of the project if such amounts relate to the project. This policy will apply only if the allocation formula is the same as that used in this proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Opinion No. 596, <em>supra, </em>at |f 70. The reason for establishing this new standard was explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-6\">\u201cThe annual earnings figure for the company\u2019s electric department is the starting point in allocating earnings. Since this figure results from the rates set by the state commission, it is proper for the Federal Power Commission when considering earnings base components both to recognize the relationship between earnings and earnings base and to incorporate in its determination the state commission\u2019s rate base policy relating to the issue of acquisition adjustments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\"><em>Id. </em>at H 71. In short, unamortized acquisition adjustments will be included in a licensee\u2019s investment base in a \u00a7 10(d) allocation proceeding if the state regulatory agency having authority over the licensee\u2019s retail rates permits the licensee to include such amounts in its rate base; the touchstone is state regulatory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">This standard was that advocated by Alabama Power. The company\u2019s apparent victory proved hollow, however, because the Commission held that Alabama Power had \u201cnot clearly demonstrated that for the amortization reserve period involved in this proceeding, the Alabama Commission included acquisition adjustments in its rate base.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The company\u2019s evidence before the Commission when this determination was made consisted of an exhibit relating to accounting adjustments, first approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission in 1945, which allowed the company to amortize Account 100.5, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, by charges to Account 505, Amortization of Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Since the latter account is an operating revenue deduction account (an above-the-line entry),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the inference sought by the company is that this allowance was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>dicative of a state regulatory policy to treat plant acquisition adjustments as a proper element of a licensee\u2019s rate base. However, this desired inference is negated by a statement in the closing lines of the Alabama Commission\u2019s 1945 report: \u201cThis permission to make such changes to Account 505 is made with the express reservation that such treatment is for accounting purposes only and such treatment shall not be construed as decisive of or presumptive of the treatment to be accorded these charges in rate or other proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Included in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>exhibit was a letter from the Alabama Public Service Commission dated August 20, 1951, directing the company \u201cto continue to amortize amounts recorded in Account 100.5 by charges to Account 505, Amortization of Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.\u201d This ruling was based on the evidence adduced in the 1945 proceedings. Again, the 1951 ruling was not issued in a rate-determination proceeding and thus concerns only suitable accounting practice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nonetheless, certain language in this letter indicates that by 1951 the Alabama Commission was not as reluctant as it had been in 1945 to make a definite decision regarding the proper treatment\u2014 whether for accounting or rate making purposes \u2014 of the amortization of the acquisition adjustments account. This letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-6\">Alabama Power Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4xc\">600 North 18th Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALg\">Birmingham, Alabama</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-7\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-8\">In the proceedings conducted in August 1945 and bearing Docket No. 9437, with respect to the reclassification of your accounts, this Commission considered the question whether the charges to amortize the amount recorded in Account 100.5, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, should properly be treated as operating revenue deductions or its income deductions. We did not deem it necessary at that time to determine this question but permitted you to make such charges to Account 505, Amortization of Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, which is an operating revenue deduction account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>You have now advised us that by-reason of developments in the pending proceedings in connection with your proposed issue and sale of $15,000,000 First Mortgage Bonds, it has become important for this Commission to issue a ruling as to the proper accounting treatment of such amortization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-4\">We have reviewed the evidence submitted by you in the proceeding bearing Docket No. 9437 in support of your position that charges to amortize the amounts recorded in Account 100.-5,-Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, should be treated as operating revenue deductions. Such evidence is to the effect that the amounts recorded in Account 100.5 represent reasonable costs incurred in arms length transactions by which properties devoted to electric public utility service were acquired in the course of establishing or extending your integrated system with resultant better service and lower rates. We are of the opinion that costs of such a nature are costs incurred to provide electric utility service and that amortization of such costs should be accomplished by operating revenue deductions. We assume the accuracy of your evidence in such proceedings and you are therefore directed to continue to amortize amounts recorded in Account 100.5 by charges to Account 505, Amortization of Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-5\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-6\">ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">In the instant case the FPC attached little or no probative value to this letter because of the statement in it by the Alabama Commission that: \u201cWe assume the accuracy of your evidence.\u201d The FPC considered this statement as implying that in issuing its 1951 ruling, the Alabama Commission had \u201cnot scrutinized in any way\u201d the company\u2019s evidence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In light of the Alabama Commission\u2019s statement in the letter that it reviewed the evidence presented in the 1945 proceedings, however, it is obvious that the Commission placed far too much emphasis on the statement concerning the accuracy of the company\u2019s evidence. This isolated sentence, divorced from the context in which it was made, does not support the FPC\u2019s total rejection of this evidence. When the 1951 letter is read as a whole, and considered with the 1945 order and opinion, it could support an inference that the Alabama Commission would treat plant acquisition adjustments as having place in a licensee\u2019s rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">Alabama Power also offered evidence that in a 1958 rate proceeding involving another company, the Alabama Commission held that acquisition adjustments were properly included in the rate base.

Paragraph 70 of Opinion No. 596, together with the FPC\u2019s treatment of the petition for rehearing, exhibits an almost complete reliance by the Commission on the absence of a general rate case involving Alabama Power during the period involved in this allocation proceeding as the basis for holding that the company could not meet the standard. There is an absence of any other explanation for its holding. Moreover, there is no discussion of the reasons for the FPC\u2019s apparent requirement that in order to come within the new standard a licensee be involved in a rate case during the period concerned in a subsequent allocation determination. This requirement does not appear in the Commission\u2019s formulation of the standard.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\"> Our function as a reviewing court is not to set up standards or rules for the FPC to follow in deciding whether unamortized acquisition adjustments should be included in this petitioner\u2019s investment base.

The next step would be for the government, upon termination of the license (after fifty years of operation), to initiate recapture proceedings under \u00a7 14. Section 3(13) would then be used to determine the licensee\u2019s net investment in the project.

The policy considerations underlying the Commission\u2019s decision are adequately summarized by this statement from Opinion 596 at If 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-6\">The practical effects of not deducting-depreciation, depending on the relative ages of the project and the remainder of the system, were clearly described by the examiner. From the point of view of the ratepayer who pays for annual depreciation expense, logic and fairness compel deduction of depreciation in this proceeding as well as in rate proceedings. In a rate proceeding, if the rate of return were applied to gross investment rather than a depreciated rate base, the licensee would receive a double recovery of its investment in plant. Since the licensee has collected depreciation charges from the ratepayers, it is not logical to argue that the amortization reserve must be computed on a non-depreciated base. If such a base were used, the excess earnings would be reduced, the compensation paid to the licensee would be that the licensee would receive another form of double recovery. This would be patently unfair to the ratepayers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-1\">This statement overlooks at least one consideration. As explained in note 4, <em>supra, </em>and as recognized by the Commission in Order No. 387, 42 FPO 329 (1969) \u00a7 10(d)\u2019s primary purpose is to provide a regulatory tool to prevent a licensee from distributing its \u201cexcess\u201d profits to its shareholders. These excess profit are to be set aside in an amortization reserve account to be used in the event the government recaptures a project. Section 3(13) defines the amount to bo paid in the event of recapture as the \u201cnot. investment\u201d of the licensee in the project. This section then details the manner in which to compute net investment. It is significant that this computation requires the deduction of depreciation. Pursuant to \u00a7 10(d), the amortization reserve account can be used to reduce this net investment. Therefore, under the Commission\u2019s interpretation of actual, legitimate investment, depreciation would be deducted twice \u2014 once in computing net investment under \u00a7 3(13) and again when the net in.vestment is reduced by the amortization reserve, because the amortization reserve was computed by deducting depreciation. Perhaps this is a proper policy determination. But, it can be plausibly argued that, at least in 1920, this determination had not been made and that this explains tire use of the phrase \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d instead of \u201cnet investment\u201d in \u00a7 10(d). The legislative history is not revealing, much less decisive, on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">TVe are thus left, as we have previously reasoned, with the definition of the term \u201cactual, legitimate investment\u201d as it appears in the license and the Act. Contrary to the Commission\u2019s statement in If 42 of Opinion 596 that there had not been, prior to the instant case, an attempt to define actual legitimate investment, we are convinced that Regulation 17 clearly defines the term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">. We have reached this conclusion well aware that in reviewing the action of an administrative agency the scope of our review is limited. However, contrary to the position taken by the FPC in its appellate brief, our scope of review on this issue is not governed by the substantial evidence rule because we have not been dealing with agency conclusions based on findings of disputed facts.

The distinction between above-tlie-line and below-the-line accounts is that an expenditure entered in a below-the-line account operates to reduce distributable income of the licensee without a corresponding inclusion of the expenditure in determining the rate base. Hence, although an expenditure entered below-the-line is properly classed as an expense, it is not an operating expense (a cost of service) whicli can be recouped through charges to the ratepayer. Above-the-line accounts are charged to operating expenses and are considered in determining a licensee\u2019s rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Although the initial accounting entry classifying an expenditure is not binding in a subsequent rate-determination case, it is, practically speaking, very difficult for a company to establish that a below-the-line entry should be considered as a part of the cost of service and consequently as an operating expense. <em>See generally </em>Southwestern Elec.

In support of its position, the Company presented evidence that the amounts reflected in Account 100.5 represented actual cash or cash equivalent paid in many arms-length transactions throughout <em>the </em>history of the Company for properties acquired as operating units or systems; that these acquisitions were made in the course of and as a necessary part of its program to provide an integrated electric system and that as a result of such acquisition and integration it has been able to replace small isolated systems throughout the State served by small and inefficient generating plants with a modern integrated electric system consisting of large centrally located hydro electric and steam generating plants, an interconnected system of transmission lines and distributing systems, all of the most modern type, to the great improvement of the quality of its service to its customers.
