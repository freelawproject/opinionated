C., and to unlawfully interfere with the Selective Service System by engaging in \u201cdraft board raids\u201d (Count I); for unlawfully sending through the mails a letter containing a threat to kidnap Mr. Kissinger (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876) (Counts II and III); an\u201cd for smuggling or attempting to smuggle letters into and out of a federal prison without the knowledge and consent of the warden (Counts IV to X). The jury was unable to agree upon a verdict on Counts I, II and III. Appellants urge that we reverse the convictions on Counts IY to X, or, alternatively, grant a new trial. Appellants have advanced numerous contentions which we will consider seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">Appellants contend that they are the victims of a prosecution which is discriminatory as to them, and, therefore, offensive to the equal protection clause. As to the counts for which they were convicted, they argue that (1) there have been relatively few prosecutions under \u00a7 1791, (2) these isolated prosecutions concerned letters directly relating to prison conditions, and (3) none of these cases involved prosecution of a letter writer who was not a prisoner, <em>i. e., </em>the position of Sister McAlister. They also argue that the prosecution of all the counts was conducted for political reasons, because of defendants\u2019 efforts to end the use of United States military forces in Southeast Asia and for personal reasons to vindicate the reputation of the late Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Therefore, appellants conclude that the charges against them violate the concept of equal justice required by Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed.2d 220 (1886), and reaffirmed in Two Guys v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 81 S.Ct. 1135, 6 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961). <em>See also </em>United States v. Crowthers, 456 F.2d 1074 (4th Cir. 1972); and United States v. Robin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>son, 311 F.Supp. 1063 (W.D.Mo.1969). These cases teach that although the government is permitted \u201cthe conscious exercise of some selectivity\u201d in the enforcement of its criminal laws, Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 506, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), any \u201csystematic discrimination\u201d in enforcement, <em>Robinson, supra, </em>311 F.Supp. at 1065, or \u201cunjust and illegal discrimination between persons in similar circumstances,\u201d <em>Yick Wo, supra, </em>118 U.S. at 374, 6 S.Ct. at 1073, violates the equal protection clause and renders the prosecution invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Distillation of appellants\u2019 discriminatory prosecution arguments yields three separate contentions: (1) that the question of the existence of discriminatory prosecution was a matter for the jury; (2) that appellants produced unmistakable evidence of discriminatory prosecution; and (3) that appellants\u2019 attempts to prove discriminatory prosecution were improperly frustrated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Observing preliminarily that this court has already held that the burden of proving intentional or purposeful discrimination is placed upon the defendants, United States v. Malinowski, 472 F.2d 850, 860 (3d Cir. 1973), we proceed with our analysis of appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Appellants sought to introduce evidence of discriminatory prosecution to the jury. After hearing argument on this point, the court decided that \u201cdiscriminatory prosecution is not a defense to be presented before a jury but is a matter that could have been raised at pretrial on a motion and perhaps can be raised post-trial on a motion, if necessary.\u201d Appellants assert that the court erred in so ruling, and rely upon decisions of intermediate state courts in California and New York, People v. Harris, 182 Cal.App.2d Supp. 837, 5 Cal.Rptr. 852 (App.Dept.Sup.Ct.1960); People v. Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., 16 A.D.2d 12, 225 N.Y.S.2d 128 (1962), for the proposition that the defense of discriminatory prosecution should be presented to the jury. Moreover, they urge that the Supreme Court in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 194, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 49 (1968), contemplated this result when the Court observed that the right to a jury trial is granted to prevent oppression by the government, and to protect against arbitrary law enforcement. \u201cProviding an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the complaint, biased, or eccentric judge.\u201d 391 U.S. at 156, 88 S.Ct. at 1451.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">On more than one occasion this court has remarked that the citation of isolated nomenclature from miscellaneous opinions does not rise to the level of black letter law. United States v. Malinowski, <em>supra, </em>472 F.2d at 854; United States v. Vallejo, 482 F.2d 616 (3 Cir., 1973), (concurring opinion). Hence, the stark fact remains that <em>Duncan, supra, </em>never addressed the issue before us, and the intermediate state court cases are not controlling here. Moreover, appellants\u2019 characterization of these state decisions is totally inaccurate. Although in People v. Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court did reverse appellant\u2019s conviction because the trial court improperly excluded evidence of discriminatory prosecution, the Supreme Court <em>expressly disapproved </em>the trial court\u2019s submission of the discriminatory prosecution issue to the jury. The court recognized the existence of \u201cwell nigh insoluble problems if a claim of discriminatory enforcement is left to the jury,\u201d and remanded the case with instructions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">The claim of discriminatory enforcement should not be treated as a defense to the criminal charge, to be' tried before the jury and submitted to it for decision, but should be treated as an application to the court for a dismissal or quashing of the prosecution upon constitutional grounds. Insofar as a question of fact may be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>volved, the court should take the evidence in the absence of the jury and should decide the question itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">225 N.Y.S.2d at 131-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In fact, two years after the New York Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., </em>the New York Court of Appeals cited that case for the principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">A denial of equal protection is not a defense to the criminal prosecution in the ordinary sense in which, when the point is raised, the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is not discriminatory. It is in the nature of an injunctive proceeding to bar prosecution of a crime regardless of <em>guilt </em>\u2014 which <em>the defendant must establish to the court, not the jury, </em>\u201cby a clear preponderance of the proof.\u201d (People v. Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., 16 A.D.2d 12, 18, 225 N.Y.S. 128, 134, supra).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">People v. Walker, 14 N.Y.2d 901, 252 N.Y.S.2d 96, 99, 200 N.E.2d 779, 781 (1964). (Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3U\">People v. Harris, <em>supra, </em>is similarly in-apposite since the case never treats the issue of whether the defense of discriminatory prosecution should be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Indeed, appellants\u2019 argument misconceives the proper division of responsibility between judge and jury in a federal criminal proceeding. By both tradition and constitutional mandate the jury is given the responsibility of determining guilt or innocence according to instructions of law delivered by the court. The question of discriminatory prosecution relates not to the guilt or innocence of appellants, but rather addresses itself to a constitutional defect in the institution of the prosecution. Rule 12(b)(2), F.R.Cr.P., provides: \u201cDefenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution . . . may be raised only by motion before trial.\u201d Rule 12(b)(4) provides: \u201cAn issue of fact shall be tried by a jury if a jury trial is required under the Constitution or an act of Congress. All other issues of fact shall be determined by the court with or without a jury or on affidavits or in such other manner as the court may direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">The Supreme Court has distinguished between the necessity for a jury determination when the question is the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and those preliminary matters concerning the right of the court to conduct the trial. Thus, in reviewing a prosecution for smuggling alcoholic spirits into the United States in violation of federal prohibition laws, Chief Justice Taft observed that \u201c[t]he issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants\u2019 guilt or innocence,\u201d and, therefore, was not properly a jury question. Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 606, 47 S.Ct. 531, 535, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Moreover, the federal substantive law of crimes derives only from statute, whereas federal practice emanates from rules and statutes. In the federal experience there has never been any constitutional requirement that the jury find facts other than those relating to the issue of guilt or innocence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ford v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Appellants have not cited, nor has our research discovered, any federal statute or rule in support of their present contention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After consideration of the evidence of discriminatory prosecution adduced at trial and at a special, post-trial evidentiary hearing, the court found that the prosecution did not \u201cfall outside of the proscribed limits of the discretionary control of the executive over the prosecution of criminal cases.\u201d United States v. Ahmad, 347 F.Supp. 912, 928 (M.D.Pa.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellants claim that the evidence they presented discloses that some one hundred F.B.I. agents were arrayed outside of a New York City church on April 21, 1970, for the purpose of capturing a brother of the priest appellant, one Daniel Berrigan, who had been convicted on another charge and had failed to appear for sentencing; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that thereafter agents surveilled Sister McAlister for the purpose of locating Father Daniel Berrigan, and that this surveillance ceased after his arrest; that the government had a \u201cchagrin and concern over the publicity surrounding Daniel Berri-gan\u2019s fugitive status;\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that by August, 1970, the government had in its possession the critical evidence supporting the convictions now under review; that by Labor Day the government had the letter suggesting a plot to kidnap Dr. Kissinger, yet no investigation was underway commensurate with the charges later made by F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover before a Senate appropriations subcommittee in November, 1970, and the subsequent publicity surrounding these statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>In sum, appellants contend \u201cthey were prosecuted for conspiracy and smuggling of letters in [an] attempt to vindicate the reputation of the former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and because of their outspoken views and position of leadership in deeply opposing the war in Viet Nam.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have carefully considered the various contentions and accompanying evidence in support of appellants\u2019 argument of discriminatory prosecution. We find no error in their rejection by the district court. There was sufficient evidence supporting a <em>prima facie </em>case of conspiracy to kidnap Dr. Kissinger, to destroy the underground heating system in Washington, and to interfere with the Selective Service System by engaging in draft board raids. A fair reading of the letters involved in this appeal persuades us that they were germane to the matters which form the substance of the prosecution. Appellants contend that the prosecution was contrived as an attempt to rationalize Director Hoover\u2019s public statements of November, 1970. This contention implies that no serious investigation of appellants went forward prior to Hoover\u2019s statements. At the same time, however, appellants argue, \u201c[b]y the end of August, 1970, the government already had in its possession the critical evidence supporting the convictions now under review.\u201d Thus even the most superficial analysis of appellants\u2019 basic argument reveals it to be self-contradictory and, therefore, self-destructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Without denigrating the importance of the right of a person accused of crime to establish the presence of discriminatory prosecution, central to the issue must be some initial showing that there is a colorable basis for the contention. Appellants attempted at the trial level to isolate the prosecutions under \u00a7 1791 from the charges of conspiracy and charges of the overt acts of planning the kidnap of Dr. Kissinger, the disruption of the Selective Service System, and the destruction of the underground heating system in Washington. They renew this attempt here. Were we to accept this approach, we would be applying judicial blinders to the realities of the actual prosecution. There was ample evidence justifying initiation of the prosecution of these appellants:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In the letter forming the basis of Count IV, Government Exhibit 25, Father Berrigan discussed a code for use in the letters. \u201cSorry as hell that I missed the code \u2014 hellova wasteful stupidity on my part. But let\u2019s develop an axiom, viz \u2014 will check every regular letter of yours for the third word thing\u2014 the other is too hard. Do the same with mine \u2014 need to perfect the technique, and then too, periodically, there may be a need. Moreover, will get the Harlem address from Pete, and see if I can locate a mail drop while working outside.\u201d The priest then suggested to Sister McAlister plans to convince members of the National Guard \u201c(1) that they resign their military status (2) that they make a unit, public resignation (3) that they join the movement. . . . As a capstone, the students can perhaps, be lead (sic) to the idea that occupying buildings, going nose to nose with cops &amp; N.G. is passe \u2014 bad politics, bad tactics. They should shut down ROTC and begin to zapp Sel. Service in college and University towns. So the statement could address N. Guard &amp; students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">In Government Exhibit 48, the Count IX letter, Sister McAlister reported to Father Berrigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">Eq outlined a plan for an action which would say \u2014 eseallated (sic) seriousness \u2014 &amp; we discussed pros and cons for several hours. It needs much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>more thought &amp; careful selection of personnel. To kidnap \u2014 in our terminology make a citizen arrest of\u2014 someone like Henry Kissinger. Him because of his influence as policy maker yet sans cabinet status, he would therefore not be as much protected as one of the bigger wigs; he is a bachelor which would mean if he were so guarded, he would be anxious to have unguarded moments where he could carry on his private affairs \u2014 literally &amp; figuratively.. To issue a set of demands, e. g. cessation of use of B 52\u2019s over N. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, &amp; release of political prisoners. Hold him for about a week during which big wigs of the liberal ilk would be brought to him \u2014 also kidnapped if necessary (which, for the most part it would be) \u2014 &amp; hold a trial or grand jury affair out of which an indictment would be brought. There is no pretense of these demands being met &amp; he would be released after this time with a word that we\u2019re non-violent as opposed to you who would let a man be killed \u2014 one of your own \u2014 so that you could go on killing. The liberals would also be released as would a film of the whole proceedings in which, hopefully, he would be far more honest than he is on his own territory. The impact of such a thing would be phenomenal. . . . Think about it &amp; maybe when I see you in Danbury I can get your thoughts as well as fill you in on where the plan lies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In Government Exhibit 49, the Count X letter, Father Berrigan responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">About the plan \u2014 the first time opens the door to murder \u2014 the Tupa-maros are finding that out in Uruguay \u2014 I hope you are following them (last 2 issues of the Guardian). When I refer to murder it is not to prohibit it absolutely (violence against non-violence bag). It is merely to observe that one has set the precedent, and that later on, when govn\u2019t resistance to this sort of thing stiffens, men will be killed. More to the point, the project as you outlined it is brilliant, but grandiose. . . . Which is to say that grabbing the gentleman will take a force of perhaps 10 of your best people \u2014 guarding him, getting communications out, perhaps moving him 2 or 3 times within the week. Now, in addition, to grab a prosecution of liberals would take dozens more, making the network too wide. . Nonetheless, I like the plan and am just trying to weave elements of modesty into it. Why not coordinate it with the one against cap\u00edtol utilities? \u2014 You should talk more thoroughly with the charge about this, or with Little Shane or Big Joe German. To disrupt them, and then grab the Brain Child \u2014 this would be escalation enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">This comes off the top of my head. Why not grab the Brain Child, treat him decently, but tell him nothing of his fate \u2014 or tell him his fate hinges on the release of pol. people or cessation of the air strikes in Laos. Then have batteries of movement people\u2014 Brain Child blind folded (sic) \u2014 engage him on policy. After he has been taught (the consideration of his safety will make him more and more human in his answers) get it filmed and record it. One thing should be implanted in that pea brain \u2014 that respectable murderers like himself are no longer inviolable. (This should be done just before release.) And that if he doesn\u2019t work to humanize policy, the likes of him will be killed by less scrupulous people. Finally, that political prisoners are the best guarantee of his sweet skin\u2019s safety and that he better get them out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">Taken along these lines, you have both a material and personal confrontation with the warmakers. The trick to pull off is to hit them very, very hard without giving them violence to react to, or to justify themselves with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">He can be blindfolded, and participants can wear stocking masks &amp; disguise their voices. It could be done and brilliantly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>I would sic Eq on it immediately, but tie it in with the D.C. Fiasco, and keep his imagination under ropes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azt-dedup-0\">Additionally, there was testimony that Philip Berrigan and Joseph Wenderoth entered underground tunnels in Washington, D.C. Boyd Douglas, an informer and courier of these letters, testified that Berrigan discussed with him the destruction of the utility system in Washington, D.C., and admitted that, prior to his arrest, he and Joseph Wen-deroth had been in the tunnel system, posing as electrical engineers, and had gained access through the entrance at the Forestal Building. Douglas said that Wenderoth had admitted to the same. One John Millard testified that Wenderoth had discussed with him \u201ca possible protest against the war which would involve a power failure in certain federal buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">A dispassionate review of this evidence reveals the appellants as individuals who planned to express a protest against the war in terms outside the parameters of First Amendment protected speech. They fashioned specific plans designed to disrupt the functions of government and enhance their revolutionary cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellants\u2019 scheme was, by its very nature, bizarre in concept and purposefully dramatic. The plan was unusual; indeed, it was unique. There is no historical precedent for the kidnapping of an American Presidential Advisor as a vehicle for demonstrating political or moral opposition to a given war.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The sensational quality of the plan runs counter to the critical ingredients in appellants\u2019 discriminatory prosecution argument. Appellants premise their argument on the proposition that smuggling letters out of prison is commonplace \u2014 so commonplace that very few prosecutions result therefrom \u2014 and, therefore, that this particular prosecution was discriminatory. The short answer to this contention is that the Kissinger kidnap plan and the Washington tunnel sabotage plan were not commonplace. Indeed, they were conceptualized because of their bizarre quality in order to capture the imagination of the nation, if not the world. Under such circumstances, and in light of the evidence presented at trial, the argument that this prosecution was based upon antiwar sentiments is hardly convincing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Prima facie </em>evidence of the conspiracy and the accompanying serious plans totally rebuts this frivolous contention. However idealistic and sincere, the motives of those who would violate federal law are immaterial in a prosecution therefor. United States v. Malinowski, <em>supra, </em>472 F.2d at 855-856.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">It is the entire prosecution, and not an examination of its isolated parts, which must command the attention of a court considering the defense of discriminatory prosecution. When all of the circumstances of this prosecution are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>considered, the prosecution under \u00a7 1791 was a justifiable aspect of the entire prosecution, viz., the conspiracy, the overt acts, and the violation of \u00a7 1791.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Appellants seem to recognize that they have marshalled little substantive evidence of discriminatory prosecution, and urge that the trial court aborted and frustrated their attempts at proof. Specifically, they complain of objections to their cross-examination of Associate Warden Hendricks, and Assistant United States Attorney Harry A. Nagle, Jr. They also unsuccessfully attempted to make the government\u2019s trial prosecutors witnesses, as well as the prosecutor who handled the original indictment. The court sustained the government\u2019s objection to any testimony by the attorneys most intimately involved in the prosecution. In addition, the defense subpoenaed all documents in the government\u2019s files dealing with the decision to investigate and prosecute the case. A government motion to quash the subpoenas was granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Chief Justice (then Circuit Judge) Burger, writing for the court in Newman v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 382 F.2d 479, 480 (1967), observed that \u201c[f]ew subjects are less adapted to judicial review than the exercise by the Executive of his discretion in deciding when and whether to institute criminal proceedings, or what precise charge shall be made, or whether to dismiss a proceeding once brought.\u201d This basic principle of general application is premised on a recognition of the constitutional separation of powers. United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is a broad body of law recognizing the practical and legal necessity of vesting broad discretion in the government\u2019s attorneys with respect to their enforcement of the federal criminal laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The cases recognize the various factors which influence the executive branch\u2019s decision to prosecute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">[Some of the] considerations are the likelihood of conviction, turning on choice of a strong case to test uncertain law, the degree of criminality, the weight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, precedent, policy, the climate of public opinion, timing and the relative gravity of the offense. In weighing these factors, the prosecutor must apply responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>standards, based, not on loose assumptions, but, on solid evidence balanced in a scale demanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt to overcome the presumption of innocence . . . Still other factors are the relative importance of the offense compared with the competing demands of other cases on the time and resources of investigation, prosecution and trial. All of these and numerous other intangible and imponderable factors must be carefully weighed and considered by the conscientious United States Attorney in deciding whether or not to prosecute. All of these considerations point up to the wisdom of vesting broad discretion in the United States Attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Pugach v. Klein, <em>supra, </em>193 F.Supp. at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We find no error in the court\u2019s refusal to permit examination of the government lawyers. We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that testimony concerning the decision to decline prosecution of Boyd Douglas was completely irrelevant to the issue of whether these appellants were the victims of impermissible discrimination. 347 F.Supp. at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In quashing the subpoenas for all government files relating to the decision to investigate and seek indictments in this ease, and all files relating to decisions to prosecute any violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791, the district court held that the appellants failed \u201cto present evidence from which at least an inference of the use of improper standards can be drawn.\u201d 347 F.Supp. at 928. The court stated: \u201cIt is clear that through these subpoenas defendants are attempting to circumvent a long-accepted intolerance toward judicial inquisition into the process whereby prosecutorial decisions are formulated. United States v. Cox, <em>supra; </em>Spillman v. United States, <em>supra </em>[413 F.2d 527 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 930, 90 S.Ct. 265, 24 L.Ed.2d 228 (1969)].\u201d 347 F.Supp. at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">On appeal, the standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion. Gevinson v. United States, 358 F.2d 761, 766 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 823, 87 S.Ct. 51, 17 L.Ed.2d 60 (1966). It is well established that the executive branch is privileged not to disclose intra-governmental documents reflecting advisory opinion, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions are formulated. Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 85, 93 S.Ct. 827, 835, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). The privilege is based upon the public policy of encouraging open, frank discussions between subordinate and chief concerning administrative action, and on the constitutional principle of separation of powers. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Cox, <em>supra. </em>Exemption (5) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), was enacted to reflect this privilege. Ackerly v. Ley, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 420 F.2d 1336, 1340 (1969). <em>See also </em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, <em>supra, </em>410 U.S. at 86, 93 S.Ct. at 835. With exceptions not relevant here, Rule 16(b), F.R.Cr.P., specifically exempts from discovery, \u201creports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case. . . . \u201d Moreover, Rule 17(c), F.R.Cr.P., provides that the court may quash a subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. The district court acted within the strictures of that rule. These subpoenas were without factual basis, and were aimed at internal government documents relating to the decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">We agree with the district court that appellants failed to meet their burden of proving a colorable entitlement to the defense of discriminatory prosecution so as to entitle them to the desired testimonial and documentary evidence. <em>See </em>United States v. Dubrow, 201 F.Supp. 101, 104 (D.Mass.1962); United States v. Charamella, 294 F.Supp. 280 (D.Del. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>1968). We specifically hold that there was no abuse of discretion by the district court. In sum, we are persuaded that appellants\u2019 argument on discriminatory prosecution, in all respects, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appellants contend that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power without standards or guidelines in violation of Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution, and the due process clause, and that it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The power to fashion rules governing the movement of contraband as it relates to the federal prison system resides with Congress. Implementation of congressional enactments in this sphere, such as \u00a7 1791, is the duty of the Attorney General. In this case, the Attorney General has delegated this power of implementation to individual prison wardens. The crucial flaw in this scheme, appellants suggest, is that this particular statute contains no guidelines or standards to regulate the Attorney General\u2019s authority, and, as such, is simply a naked grant of power. Accordingly, appellants rely upon the principle that Congress cannot delegate unfettered discretion to administrative agencies to promulgate regulations enforceable by criminal sanctions, and the corollary that the exercise of administrative ability must be governed by the guidelines provided by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">This same argument was presented to, and rejected by, the Tenth Circuit in Carter v. United States, 333 F.2d 354, 355 (10th Cir. 1964). We accept the holding of that court and the reasoning employed by Chief Judge Murrah:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">We know, of course, that Congress may not penalize the violation of an administrative rule or regulation which it has no constitutional power to authorize. See: Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446; and Schechter Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570. It is equally clear, we think, that Congress may penalize the violation of an administrative rule or regulation which it is constitutionally empowered to authorize. See: United States v. Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506, 31 S.Ct. 480, 55 L.Ed. 563. In the exercise of its lawmaking function, Congress has committed to the Attorney General the \u201ccontrol and management\u201d of Federal penal and correctional institutions, and has vested him with the duty and authority to \u201cpromulgate rules for the government thereof.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001. In the performance of his statutory duty, the Attorney General undoubtedly may provide by regulation that nothing shall be brought into or taken out of a Federal penal institution without the knowledge and consent of the warden or superintendent of such institution. And, the regulation does not lose its administrative character simply because Congress has seen fit to make its violation a public offense. See: United States v. Grimaud, ibid; and United States v. Ruckman, D.C., 169 F.Supp. 160. The validity of the regulation is unquestioned here \u2014 the power of Congress to penalize its violation is unquestionable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-15\"><em>See also </em>Fulwood v. Alexander, 267 F.Supp. 92, 94-95 (M.D.Pa.1967), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>United States v. White, 295 F.Supp. 893, 893-894 (M.D.Ga.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We can rapidly dispose of appellants\u2019 second contention that the statute is void for vagueness. Recently, this court discussed in detail the various concepts underlying the constitutional vagueness doctrine. Levy v. Parker, 478 F.2d 772 (3d Cir., 1973). Appellants rely on United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., 461 F.2d 468 (3d Cir. 1972), modified and remanded, 411 U.S. 655, 93 S.Ct. 1804, 36 L.Ed.2d 567 (1973), suggesting that a statute which is linguistically clear may be rendered unconstitutionally vague because it simply cannot mean what it purports to mean. We are not persuaded that the comparison is appropriate. The regulation in question admits of no ambiguity whatsoever. It gives clear, concise and fair notice of what is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Moreover, we are satisfied that both appellants knew of its provisions. When Father Berrigan entered Lewisburg, he signed a visitor and correspondence list which indicated that inmates would not be permitted to write to or receive mail from any person not on the approved list. This document also authorized the warden or his representative to open, read and inspect all mail. Furthermore, a booklet made available to new inmates outlined the correspondence regulations, and warned that \u201cany attempt to \u2018kite\u2019 letters out of the institution will be considered a serious infraction and may be subject to prosecution.\u201d Sister Mc-Alister signed a visitor\u2019s document which contained a statement warning that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 prohibited the taking of anything into or out of the prison without the knowledge and consent of the warden. We reject appellants\u2019 vagueness contention as being totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the statute is overbroad is founded on the general rule that a statute is tainted if the conduct it prohibits includes protected activity as well as criminal conduct. \u201cIn every ease the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom.\u201d Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 304, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). <em>See also </em>United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11, 86 S.Ct. 1238, 16 L.Ed.2d 321 (1966). The minor premise proceeds that certain communications cannot constitutionally be excluded from prisons. <em>See, e. g., </em>Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (3rd Cir. 1968); Rowland v. Jones, 452 F.2d 1005 (8th Cir. 1971); Fortune Society v. McGinnis, 319 F.Supp. 901, 905 (S.D.N.Y.1970), and other cases upholding a prisoner\u2019s right to send and receive various types of correspondence and literature. Because prisoners enjoy the right to send and receive mail, appellants conclude that this statute is overbroad because it makes criminal certain acts protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">It hardly deserves extended discussion to observe that appellants\u2019 syllogism strains to a conclusion which is invalid and illicit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At issue is not the right of a prisoner to send or receive mail; rather, it is the right of a warden to establish an authorized channel of communications for the sending or receipt of this mail. Assuming, without deciding, that a prisoner has an unqualified right to send and receive all mail, there is no allegation that prisoner Berrigan\u2019s right to send or receive mail was denied him. Therefore, as we said in Veterans and Reservists for Peace in Vietnam v. Regional Commissioner of Customs, 459 F.2d 676, 681 n. 8 (3d Cir. 1972), there exists a serious question whether appellants have standing to raise the argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>merit that the statute is void for over-breadth because it might be utilized to restrict materials protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Prescinding, however, from this serious question, and addressing ourselves to the merits of appellants\u2019 contention, this court has previously held that \u201cimprisonment unavoidably results in the forfeiture of certain rights and privileges commonly exercised in a free society. The loss of these rights has been recognized by the Supreme Court as \u2018a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u2019 Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S, 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). Stated simply, a man in jail is not a free man; the denial of his right to drink fully from the cup of freedom is the very hypostasis of confinement. . And, unpleasant as it is to contemplate the physical restrictions of a \u2018settled environment\u2019, we must also recognize that even those rights which survive penal confinement may be diluted by peculiar institutional requirements of discipline, safety, and security. To determine, with precision, those rights which follow an inmate into prison involves a process of weighing and balancing conflicting interests.\u201d Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1, 3-4 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The presence of \u201can important or substantial government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression\u201d has been held to \u201cjustify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Using the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test, the district court reasoned;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">A letter is essentially neutral, made dangerous or innocuous by its author. Given the potential of a letter \u2014 to transmit escape plans, etc. \u2014 the warden must know of its contents before passing judgment on its suitability for importation into or exportation from the prison . . . This court concludes that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 meets each of the requisites set down in O\u2019Brien. . . . The interest involved is an \u201cimportant and substantial\u201d one and unrelated to the suppression of free speech. By definition there is a distinction between \u201cincidental limitations\u201d on speech and its suppression. This statute and case present examples of an incidental limitation, at most, and a limitation no greater than that absolutely required for the furtherance of safe and efficient prison maintenance. This court, therefore, rejects defendants\u2019 attack on the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">United States v. Ahmad, <em>supra, </em>347 F.Supp. at 919-920.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Therefore, even if the First Amendment issue were properly before us, we would agree with the district court\u2019s analysis and its rejection of the contention. <em>See also </em>Nolan v. Fitzpatrick, 451 F.2d 545, 548 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">Appellants\u2019 contentions that the judgments of conviction on Counts V through X must be reversed because the government failed to prove all elements of the crime presents a very serious and difficult question. In these counts they were charged with and convicted of attempts to violate \u00a7 1791. Unlike the circumstances attending Father Berrigan\u2019s dispatch of the Count IV letter, which occurred prior to any knowledge on the part of the warden, it is undisputed that the prison officials had prior knowledge of letters embraced by these convictions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">We begin with the proposition that the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of an offense in order to sustain a conviction. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). One of the elements of a violation of \u00a7 1791 is the absence of \u201cknowledge and consent of the warden or superintendent of [the] federal penal or correctional institution.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.1. From this, the defense reasons that if the warden knows of the smuggling, the purpose of the law is satisfied and no crime can exist. The district court rejected this argument holding that \u201c[s]ueh an interpretation of the statute is unjustified and inaccurate. . . . The intent of the parties to bypass prison channels and smuggle the letters, combined with action toward that goal is sufficient to complete a punishable offense. . The intent of the party committing the offense to deprive the warden of knowledge of such smuggling seems to this court to be the gravamen of the offense.\u201d 347 F.Supp. at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In support of its conclusion that intent to commit the offense plus some overt act constituted the crime, irrespective of legal impossibility to commit the crime, the district court relied on New York Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws c. 40, \u00a7 110.10; United States v. Thomas, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 278, 32 C.M.R. 279 (1962); Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law, 586 (2d Ed. 1960); Perkins, Criminal Law, 489 (1957); and the Model Penal Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">The first difficulty we have in accepting this analysis is that it utilized criminal codes which contain provisions having no counterpart in existing federal criminal law. Federal criminal law is purely statutory; there is no federal common law of crimes. Levy v. Parker, <em>supra, </em>478 F.2d at 796. The Model Penal Code provides that a person is guilty of an attempt \u201cif acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime he: (a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be.\u201d The proponents of the code report that \u201c[t]he purpose of paragraph 1(a) is to eliminate legal impossibility as a defense to an attempt charge.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Absent such statutory language, courts have held that a person accepting goods which he believed were stolen, but were not actually stolen goods, was not guilty of an attempt to receive stolen goods;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that an individual who offered a bribe to a person whom he believed to be a juror, but who was not a juror, could not be said to have attempted to bribe a juror; <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, that a hunter who shot a stuffed deer, believing it to be alive, had not attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ed to kill a deer out of season.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Faced with these holdings, the Model Penal Code proponents suggested that courts were exonerating defendants \u201cin situations where attempt liability most certainly should be imposed.\u201d Hence, they felt necessity for the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The National Commission on Reform of Criminal Laws, also recognizing this apparent void in the existing federal criminal code, has proposed a general attempt statute, applicable to every federal offense. Its proposal closely resembles that of the Model Penal Code: \u201cFactual or legal impossibility of committing the crime is not a defense if the crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.\u201d \u00a7 1001(1). Other measures presently before Congress contain similar provisions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 l-2A4(c), Criminal Attempt, Defense Precluded, S.l, Criminal Justice Codification, Revision and Reform Act of 1973, 93rd Cong., 1973; \u00a7 1001(b), Criminal Attempt, Defense Precluded, H.R. 6046; S. 1400, Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973, 93rd Cong., 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Indeed, we are informed that elimination of impossibility as a defense to a charge of criminal attempt, as suggested by the Model Penal Code and the proposed federal legislation, is consistent with \u201cthe overwhelming modern view,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and with criminal provisions in such diverse parts as Canada, India and New Zealand.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Nevertheless, the brute fact remains that present federal criminal statutes do not contain this provision. And for this court to uphold these convictions in the absence of such statutory authority would be to impose criminal liability upon mere intent, where the will is to be taken for the deed, \u201cor, as expressed in the Latin formula appearing in the Year Books, <em>Voluntas reputabitur pro facto.\u201d </em><footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Professor Williams asserts that \u201c[i]t should need no demonstration that a person who commits or attempts to commit what is not a crime in law cannot be convicted of attempting to commit a crime, and it makes no difference that he thinks it is a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Professor Hall<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> is equally insistent that to make such conduct a criminal attempt would violate the principle of legality.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Moreover, whatever be the approach taken in those jurisdictions utilizing the common law of crimes, except as modified by statute, <em>e. g., </em>Pennsylvania, the interstices of federal criminal law cannot be filled by resort to common law precedents. It cannot be overemphasized that conduct intended to be prohibited by federal law must be explicitly prohibited by statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It becomes necessary, therefore, to turn to the rudiments of the law of attempt. \u201cSome words of definition are necessary. For convenience of usage the following terms shall be used as indicated: <em>Act </em>\u2014 the defendant\u2019s physical bodily movements; <em>Circumstances or attendant circumstances </em>\u2014 the external, objective situation which the substantive law may require be present in addition to the defendant\u2019s act before he can be convicted of the substantive crime; <em>Conduct </em>\u2014 -the act combined with the circumstances regarded by the substantive law as relevant; <em>Consequences </em>or <em>result </em>\u2014 an additional occurrence caused by the defendant\u2019s act.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We reduce the law of attempt to these basic components because it is a subject that has long attracted the attention of the commentators and legal historians producing a wealth of legal literature.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The problems have been called \u201cmuch-mooted,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cintricate and difficult,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cone of the most interesting and difficult problems of the criminal law,\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> reflecting \u201cambivalence as to how far the governing criteria should focus on the dangerousness of the actor\u2019s conduct,\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and exerting \u201ca fascination for legal scholars far beyond their significance in terms of the number of litigated issues.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Emanating from the many thoughtful observations and the multitude of case law are the following teachings. (1) We must not generalize in the law of attempt. (2) There is a basic distinction between early common law decisions and those beginning in the latter Eighteenth Century. (3) There is a distinction between the holdings in common law jurisdictions and those which have codified the law of attempt. (4) One of the most sophisticated areas of the troublesome law of attempt is that which must command our attention here \u2014 legal impossibility of criminal attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">Indeed, even a decision to analyze impossibility on the basis of what is generally described as the two categories of factual impossibility and legal impossibility presents serious problems unless conceptual distinctions between the two labels are recognized and respected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Generally speaking factual impossibility is said to occur when extraneous circumstances unknown to the actor or beyond his control prevent consummation of the intended crime. The classic example is the man who puts his hand in the coat pocket of another with the intent to steal his wallet and finds the pocket empty. Regina v. Collins, 9 Cox Crim. Cas. 497 (1864). Generally, the cases which have imposed criminal liability for attempt where factual circumstances precluded commission of the intended crime have emphasized, as a primary requisite, proof of an intent to commit a specific crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Legal impossibility is said to occur where the intended acts, even if completed, would not amount to a crime. Thus, legal impossibility would apply to those circumstances where (1) the motive, desire and expectation is to perform an act in violation of the law; (2) there is intention to perform a physical act; (3) there is a performance of the intended physical act; and (4) the consequence resulting from the intended act does not amount to a crime.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Were intent to break the law the sole criterion to be considered in determining criminal responsibility \u2014 and this was the approach utilized by the district court \u2014 we could sustain the conviction of appellants on Counts V to X. Clearly, it can be said that Father Berrigan intended to send letters to Sister Mc-Alister, and vice versa. Normally, of course, the exchange of letters is not a federal offense. Where one of the senders is in prison, however, the sending may or may not be a criminal offense. If the letter is sent within normal channels with the consent and knowledge of the warden it is not a criminal offense. Therefore, an attempt to send a letter through normal channels cannot be considered an attempt to violate the law because none of the intended consequences is in fact criminal. If the letter is sent without the knowledge and consent of the warden, it is a criminal offense and so is the attempt because both the intended consequence and the actual consequence are in fact criminal. Here, we are faced with a third situation where there is a motivation, desire and expectation of sending a letter without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>knowledge and consent, and the intended act is performed, but unknown to the sender, the transmittal is accomplished with the knowledge and consent of the warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Applying the principles of the law of attempt to the instant case, the writing of the letters, and their copying and transmittal by the courier, Boyd Douglas, constituted the <em>Act. </em>This much the government proved. What the government did not prove \u2014 and could not prove because it was a legal impossibility \u2014 was the \u201cexternal, objective situation which the substantive law may require to be present,\u201d to-wit, absence of knowledge and consent of the warden. Thus, the government failed to prove the <em>\u201cCircumstances or attendant circumstances\u201d </em>vital to the offense. Without such proof, the <em>Consequence </em>or <em>Result </em>did not constitute an offense that violated the federal statute.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The warden and the government were aware of the existence of the letters. The courier acted with the consent of the warden. Although there was no entrapment, United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the public authorities were privy to the <em>Act </em>which gave rise to these charges. There are many supporters of the view that irrespective of the absence of a necessary element of the offense prohibited by statute \u2014 the \u201cexternal, objective situation which the substantive law may require be present\u201d \u2014 criminal responsibility should attach \u201cif the attendant circumstances were as [the actor] believes them to be.\u201d The bills presently before the Congress contain such a provision.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But the efforts of the distinguished scholars who drafted these proposals must be kept in perspective; they are recommending changes to fill an apparent void in existing law. They suggest a statutory change which would remove one of the elements of the offense which still must be proved under the present federal statutory law of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">We are also aware that in those jurisdictions which permit the development of elements of the criminal law by the common law tradition of judicial decision, the courts have been willing to change the law through the centuries from an absolute defense of factual impossibility, to a jurisprudential environment which, though extremely complicated and confused, seems to be watering down, if not eliminating, the defense of factual impossibility. But as we have heretofore indicated, we will not fall into the trap of equating <em>legal </em>with <em>factual </em>impossibility in the law of criminal attempt.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>In sum, we distinguish between the federal system, where criminal law is solely statutory, and jurisdiction patter upon the common law. \u201cIt is commonplace that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and that there are no common law offenses against the United States. \u2018The legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the Court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.\u2019 United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch. 32, 34, 3 L.Ed. 259. \u2018It is axiomatic that statutes creating and defining crimes cannot be extended by intendment, and that no act, however wrongful, can be punished under such a statute unless clearly within its terms.\u2019 Todd v. United States, 158 U.S. 278, 282, 15 S.Ct. 889, 890, 39 L.Ed. 982\u201d. Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205, 215, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1999, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973) Stewart, J., dissenting. We distinguish between the defense of factual impossibility, which is not involved here, United States v. Osborn, 385 U.S. 323, 87 S.Ct. 429, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966), and legal impossibility, which is. Even were we to concede that factual impossibility of success may not prevent an attempt, there can be no crime of attempt where there is a legal impossibility to commit a crime. Simply stated, attempting to do that which is not a crime is not attempting to commit a crime.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Congress has not yet enacted a law that provides that intent plus act plus conduct constitutes the offense of attempt irrespective of legal impossibility. Until such time as such legislative changes in the law take place, this court will not fashion a new non-statutory law of criminal attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Accordingly, the convictions on Counts V-X may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Appellants have raised other contentions which, for the limited purposes remaining, apply only to Father Berrigan\u2019s conviction on Count IV. We have concluded that the court did not err in adopting Government Request No. 15, or in failing to include the phrase, out \u201cof a federal penitentiary,\u201d when it charged that \u201cdefendant Philip Berrigan caused a letter to be sent to Elizabeth McAlister. . . . \u201d Although no defense was presented by defendants, prior to resting they unsuccessfully moved the court to grant immunity, or to require the government to seek immunity, for any defense witnesses who might refuse to give testimony on grounds of self-incrimination when called. The court ruled it had no authority to grant such immunity or to demand that the government seek immunity for defense witnesses. We agree. <em>See </em>United States v. Smith, 436 F.2d 787 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 976, 91 S.Ct. 1680, 29 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); United States v.

As a result of the relatively recent \u201ccriminal law revolution,\u201d extensive hearings, ancillary to the trial itself, have become commonplace in today\u2019s criminal proceedings. Pre-trial challenges to indictments, hearings challenging reception of evidence, and elaborate post-conviction hearings, often raise both constitutional questions and issues of fact. What we are experiencing today in the realm of federal criminal procedure had no counterpart in the common law jurisdictions at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Indeed, the Bill of Rights, the fountainhead of most of these proceedings, was not incorporated into the original draft of the Constitution.

There, appellant was prosecuted for failure to carry a draft card. He offered to prove that 25,000 Selective Service registrants had dispossessed themselves of their draft cards without being prosecuted, and that his prosecution was therefore discriminatory and intended to chill his anti-war activities. The court, over a strong dissent, held that appellant was entitled to a hearing on his claim. However, in <em>Falk, </em>the offense for which appellant was indicted was certainly commonplace. Clearly, the same cannot be said for the instant case. Secondly, the <em>Falk </em>court found \u201cunrebutted evidence [which] . . . made out at least a prima facie case of improper discrimination in enforcing the law.\u201d 479 F.2d at 623. Appellants here, on the other hand, have submitted no convincing evidence of discriminatory prosecution. Indeed, the court in <em>Falk </em>premised the granting of a hearing upon an allegation of \u201cintentional, purposeful discrimination,\u201d <em>and, </em>the existence of \u201cfacts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the prosecutor\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellants were given the opportunity both at trial, and at a special, post-trial evidentiary hearing, to present facts tending to demonstrate that the prosecution was discriminatory. They failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. The warden was asked whether he knew \u201cthat it has always been the firmest and most important federal bureau of prisons\u2019 policy never to permit any prisoner to act as a government agent or informant while he was in prison.\u201d By this, the appellants sought to prove not only that the policy existed, but that it had been violated in this case, and that deviation from that policy raised an inference of discriminatory treatment. At a post-trial hearing on discriminatory prosecution the defense again sought to prove the same issue through the testimony of the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Through Nagle, the appellants sought to show that the government declined to prosecute Boyd Douglas, the government informer. AVe find no prejudicial error in any of the rulings of the trial court regarding this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. \u201cIt follows, as an incident of the constitutional separation of powers, that the courts are not to interfere with the free exercise of the discretionary powers of the attorneys of the United States in their control over criminal prosecutions.\u201d United States v.

As the majority opinion reveals, Counts IX and X involved letters from Sister McAlister and Father Berrigan, respectively, specifically discussing the idea of kidnapping Henry Kissinger. The important aspect of the convictions under review on this appeal is not that the alleged criminal conspiracy was \u201cbizarre\u201d, but that the letters pertaining to it involved the participation of a prisoner in the planning of criminal activity. The prohibition against taking or sending anything into or out of a federal prison without the knowledge or consent of the warden is designed to guard against just this sort of conduct, as well as to prevent contraband from coming in and out of the prisons. Because letters aimed at the perpetration of criminal activity are an evil at which the regulation is aimed, I believe the Government had ample justification for its alleged selectivity in commencing prosecution. It is immaterial that the statute and regulation might not be enforced through prosecutions when prison authorities discover \u201cinnocent\u201d letters being smuggled.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">I also agree that the convictions of both defendants on Counts V through X should be vacated. The letters involved in these counts were all smuggled after June 3, 1970, i.e., after Warden Hendricks knew of Douglas\u2019s activities. I think the regulation of the Attorney General, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.1 imports into the statutory attempt offense the essential element of absence of knowledge and consent by the warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">The introduction or attempt to introduce into or upon the grounds of any Federal penal or correctional institution or the taking or attempt to take or send therefrom anything whatsoever without the knowledge and consent of the warden or superintendent of such Federal penal or correctional institution is prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The prohibition, as it applies to attempts, is ambiguous. It can be read to apply when there is an attempt to smuggle a letter with the belief that the warden does not know about it. Reading the regulation in this manner, the focus would be on the defendants\u2019 intent. On the other hand, it can be read to make the absence of the warden\u2019s consent or knowledge an absolute element of the attempt offense. Lacking any indication of the intent of those who framed the regulation, I feel compelled to follow the maxim that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed. I therefore accept the latter reading and, finding in the evidence no proof that the warden lacked knowledge of the smuggling attempts, agree that the Government failed to sustain its burden of proof on these six counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
