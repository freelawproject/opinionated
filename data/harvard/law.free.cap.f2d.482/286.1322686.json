One count charged him with aiding and abetting in the possession of heroin with intent to distribute it, and the second count charged him with aiding and abetting in the distribution of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(a)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>2.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case was tried before the district judge without a jury. Because the district judge found that there was reasonable doubt that McCray had the right to exercise dominion and control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>heroin, he acquitted him on the first count. McCray was found guilty, however, of the second count, and sentenced to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment plus three years\u2019 parole. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The essential facts are clear. McCray himself testified that he helped an undercover agent, Detective Lindsay, not then known to appellant to be a police officer, purchase heroin from a drug dealer, Wackenhut. McCray participated by directing Wackenhut to Lindsay and by instructing Wackenhut to supply Lindsay with the heroin Lindsay wanted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Appellant contends that he committed no crime, apparently on the theory that he did not have a financial interest in the transaction and did not possess or control the heroin. Appellant relies on a number of cases decided under a prior statute dealing with the \u201csale\u201d of narcotics. <em>See, e. g., </em>Henderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 261 F.2d 909; Adams v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 297; United States v. Sawyer, 3 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 169. But as we explained most recently in United States v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 1973, 481 F.2d 645, the rule of law has changed since those cases. It is now illegal to aid and abet in the distribution of heroin without regard for whether the defendant actually performed the act of sale. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(8), 802(11), defined \u201cdistribute\u201d as \u201cto deliver\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d was defined as the \u201cactual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.\u201d <em>See also </em>United States v. Workopich, 5 Cir., 1973, 479 F.2d 1142. In United States v. Anthony, 5 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 770, we explained the definition of an aider and abettor: \u201cAiding and abetting means to assist the perpetrator of the crime. . To be an aider and abettor requires that a defendant \u2018associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seeks by his action to make it succeed.\u2019 \u201d Here McCray actively participated with a desire to see the crime of distributing heroin succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">When defendant McCray told the district judge that he did not feel guilty of the crime charged, the district judge correctly pointed out that aiding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>abetting, as well, constituted a violation of the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is sufficient evidence to support the district judge\u2019s finding that defendant McCray was guilty on count two in the indictment. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-16\">.

McCray testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Q. What, exactly, did happen between you and Detective Lindsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">A. Well, when I come inside of the Paradise he was sitting at the restaurant part in the Paradise and as I walked in,</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">I was going to order a sandwich and he asked me did I know where he could purchase some heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">I told him I didn\u2019t have any; I know where he could get some.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">I went outside and got Wackenhut and when I come back inside, Wackenhut asked him how much did he want and he said two bags, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Q. You came back inside?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Q. Did you introduce Wackenhut to the agent, Detective Lindsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">Q. What happened when you came inside?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">A. When I come inside we walked over to Detective Lindsay and Wackenhut asked him what did he want. He said he wanted three bags. I said, \u201cJust give him what he wants,\u201d and in the process of Wackenhut giving it to him, I walked off.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">I didn\u2019t even see them \u2014 whether he gave him the money or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">Q. When you first went outside, after Detective Lindsay asked you whether you could get some heroin for him, and you went outside, did you have any conversation, at that time, with Wackenhut?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">A. I told him someone inside wanted some.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-25\">Q. Did you tell him what he wanted?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-26\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-27\">Q. What did you say to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-28\">A. I said, \u201cWackenhut, somebody inside wants some heroin,\u201d and we walked back in there together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-4\">. The district judge responded as follows to McCray\u2019s comment that he did not feel guilty:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">THE COURT: It is because you don\u2019t understand the law. You really came here and told the Court, Mr. McCray that you did violate the law. You went out and arranged for a fellow to come in and sell some heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Now, you are under the impression that you have to be the seller. You don\u2019t have to. If you just help the other fellow by getting them together and arranging the thing, if you don\u2019t get a nickel, you are still guilty of this charge, and that\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">You just don\u2019t go around finding heroin for people, because it is against the law, even if you think that it is often done. It is against the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">There is no question but that you helped this fellow Wackenhut at least give or turn over to another fellow, three bags of heroin, because you admit that, you see.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
