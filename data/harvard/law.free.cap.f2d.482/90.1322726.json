Kenneth, a registered nurse, was hired in November 1970 as a nurse at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. By statute, the initial hiring by the VA of a nurse, as well as a doctor or a dentist, as \u201cadditional personnel\u201d under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4104 and 4106 is for a three-year probationary period. On July 24, 1972, the VA advised Kenneth that she would be \u201cseparated from the service for failure to qualify and satisfactorily perform the duties of [her] position, effective Saturday, July 29, 1972.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-23\">On August 2, 1972, Kenneth filed an action in the district court challenging the procedures that led to her discharge. Thereafter, on August 22, 1972, before answer, following a hearing on what was denominated as an order to show cause, the district court ordered that Kenneth be immediately reinstated to her position as a nurse, with restoration of all rights and privileges from the date of discharge, until she was given a full evi-dentiary hearing in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4110. From that injunctive type order which granted Kenneth complete relief, the defendants now appeal. We reverse for the reason that in our view 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4110 does not apply where the employment of a probationary employee under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4104 and 4106 is sought to be terminated. Before considering the statutes with which we are here concerned, we shall first review the chronology out of which the controversy arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-24\">As indicated, Kenneth was hired as a nurse by the VA in November 1970. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>May 11, 1972, well within the three-year probationary period, Kenneth was notified that the Professional Standards Board would conduct a summary review to determine whether she would be retained in her employment as a VA nurse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 18, 1972, Kenneth appeared before the Professional Standards Board and read a prepared statement, which responded to the reasons for possible termination as set out in the aforesaid notice. Out of the presence of Kenneth, the Board heard from other persons concerning Kenneth\u2019s performance as a VA nurse, with Kenneth not being afforded the opportunity to confront these persons or to cross-examine them. Kenneth was also denied the opportunity to be represented by counsel at this hearing. Thereafter, on July 24, 1972, Kenneth was advised that her employment would be terminated on July 29, 1972. It was in this setting that Kenneth instituted the present proceeding against Paul Schmoll, director of the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, Charles Still, personnel officer at the hospital, and Helen Brunner, chairwoman of the Professional Standards Board. Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 and the action is said to be a declaratory judgment proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Section 4104, 38 U.S.C., authorizes the Administrator to appoint such additional personnel, including doctors, dentists and nurses, as he finds necessary for the medical care of veterans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Section 4106, 38 U.S.C., provides, in essence, that such appointments may be made without reference to civil service requirements after qualifications have been established in accordance with regulations of the Administrator, with the further provision that such probationary appointee shall be separated from the service if the Board should find him or her \u201cnot fully qualified and satisfactory.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">The regulations promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \u00a7 4106 provide for a so-called summary review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>wherein, though the probationary appointee is given notice that his services are unsatisfactory, and the reasons therefor, and may appear personally before the Board or submit a written statement in his behalf, he nonetheless is not permitted to confront adverse witnesses, let alone cross-examine them, nor is he permitted legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Section 4110, 38 U.S.C., provides, in essence, that a disciplinary board shall be appointed by the Chief Medical Director under regulations prescribed by the Administrator to determine upon notice and \u201cfair hearing\u201d charges of inap-titude, inefficiency or misconduct of any person employed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C., \u00a7 4104(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regulations promulgated by the Administrator under this particular statute permit an employee to appear personally at the hearing, be represented by counsel, and generally participate in the hearing by cross-examining and presenting evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Counsel for Kenneth reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">1. Kenneth was employed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4104;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">2. The hearing provided for in 38 U. S.C. \u00a7 4110 applies to any person employed under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4104;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">3. Therefore Kenneth is entitled to the fair hearing provided for in \u00a7 4110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">The foregoing syllogism, though perhaps appealing in its simplicity, is in reality untenable, mainly because in our view it ignores \u00a7 4106. To thus construe the statute under consideration would violate a cardinal rule of statutory construction, namely, that effect should be given to every provision of a statute. Additionally, such construction would be contrary to the legislative history and intent of the statute and contrary to the construction given by the administrative agency charged with carrying out the mandates contained therein. It is on this general basis that we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Section 4106(b) declares that the appointment of additional personnel \u201cshall-be for a probationary period of three years,\u201d during which period of time the record of a person thus serving shall be reviewed by a board appointed in accord with regulations promulgated by the Administrator and that if such board shall determine that a probationary employee is not \u201cfully qualified and satisfactory,\u201d then the probationary employee shall be \u201cseparated from the service.\u201d In this connection, the VA views the probationary period as being an extension of the appointment process, which provides the final test of actual performance on the job and which is designed to protect the VA against the retention of individuals who are found in actual practice to be unsuited for permanent employment. In any event, there is most certainly no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>language in \u00a7 4106(b) which suggests to us that a probationary employee is entitled to a full-blown, trial-like hearing, with the right to counsel, right to confront adverse witnesses and cross-examine, before he be \u201cseparated from the service.\u201d On the contrary, we believe the exact opposite is indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In line with the provisions of \u00a7 4106(b), the regulations promulgated by the Administrator to effectuate this particular legislative intent sets up a review board known as the Professional Standards Board, which is authorized, among other things, to conduct a so-called summary review \u201cwhen summary separation from the service may be justified.\u201d Under these regulations, notice is required, which notice is to be \u201cbrief, but in sufficient detail so that the employee will clearly understand why his services are considered deficient and/or the nature of the incident involved,\u201d with the subject of the hearing permitted to thereafter appear before the Professional Standards Board and make an oral or written statement in his own behalf, though not being permitted to confront and cross-examine witnesses or be represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Certainly, then, these regulations carry out the legislative intent, as we see it, contained in \u00a7 4106(b). But all this is changed, says counsel, by the language contained in \u00a7 4110. With this suggestion we are not in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Section 4110 provides for the appointment by the Chief Medical Director of a disciplinary board to determine upon notice and \u201cfair hearing\u201d charges of \u201cin-aptitude, inefficiency, or misconduct\u201d of any appointed personnel serving in a position provided for in \u00a7 4104(1). Pursuant to this particular section of the statute, there has been created by administrative regulation a disciplinary board which, after notice of charges, conducts a \u201cfair hearing,\u201d which includes the right to counsel, right to confront adverse witnesses, to cross-examine, and the like. And, again, in our view these regulations carry into effect the legislative intent behind \u00a7 4110.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It is quite true that \u00a7 4110 declares that its provisions shall apply to \u201cany person employed in a position provided in paragraph (1) of section 4104\u201d; but, in our view, it does not follow that probationary employees are also entitled to that particular type of hearing. To so hold would virtually excise \u00a7 4106 from the statute. As indicated, a cardinal rule of statutory construction is that effect should, if possible, be given to every provision of a statute. Parker v. United States, 448 F.2d 793 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 989, 92 S.Ct. 1252, 31 L.Ed.2d 455 (1972). When effect is given to both \u00a7\u00a7 4106(b) and 4110, it is clear to us that it was the intent of Congress by the words of the statute itself that a probationary employee about to be separated from the service need only be given the summary hearing contemplated by \u00a7 4106(b) and as provided by appropriate regulation promulgated pursuant thereto; whereas, an employee with over three years service is to be afforded the \u201cfair hearing\u201d required by \u00a7 4110 and provided by appropriate regulation carrying into effect such legislative mandate. Such construction gives effect to \u00a7 4106(b), as well as \u00a7 4110.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The foregoing squares with legislative intent and the broad legislative purpose behind the entire Act. Without going into great detail, it is obvious to us that in 1945, Congress was concerned about recurring charges that the World War II veterans were not getting satisfactory doctor, dental and nursing care, and to that end, inter alia, authorized the appointment of such additional personnel in those categories as was necessary to make certain that veterans did get satisfactory care, with the proviso that such appointments were to be made without regard to Civil Service requirements. \u00a7 4106(a). In this same connection, Congress then expressly authorized that such personnel during their probationary period could be separated from the service if found to be \u201cnot fully qualified and satisfactory.\u201d To construe the statute in the manner urged upon us by Kenneth would be directly contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the congressional purpose \u201cto free the Veterans Administration from some of the shackles that now, we think, act as an impediment and deterrent to the best medical service.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Additional evidence of legislative intent and purpose are the remarks of Congressman Scrivner to the effect that the disciplinary board provided by \u00a7 4110 \u201cwill function after the three year probationary period.\u201d 91 Cong.Rec. 11663 (1945). In our view, the interpretation which we give these statutes clearly squares with the legislative intent and history.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Our final matter deserves brief comment. There is certainly no doubt as to the interpretation given this statute by the administrative agency charged with carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. The presence in this court of the several defendants appealing the injunctive order entered by the trial court indicates full well the position of the VA. It is of course a well-settled rule of statutory construction that an administrative construction given a statute by the agency charged with its administration \u201cshould be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1802, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), and Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation v. Probst, 428 F.2d 491 (10th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 189, 27 L.Ed.2d 186 (1970). Furthermore, additional weight should be given an administration where, as here, it is of long standing. CIR v. First Security Bank of Utah, N. A., 405 U.S. 394, 402, 92 S.Ct. 1085, 31 L.Ed.2d 318 note 16 (1972). And the administrative interpretation should be accepted by the courts if it be a reasonable one, even though there might be another interpretation which was itself reasonable. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965), and Unemployment Comm\u2019n v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">For all these reasons, then, we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering that Kenneth be reinstated until such time as she was afforded the hearing provided for by \u00a7 4110 and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. The judgment ordering such is reversed and the cause remanded with directions that any further proceedings be in accord with the present opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">As concerns possible further proceedings, we are aware that Kenneth has alternatively alleged that she has a constitutional right, as opposed to a statutory right, to a full scale hearing before she is separated from the service. This matter has not yet been considered by the trial court. However, in the interest of bringing the matter to a speedy conclusion, it is the order of this court that there be no hearing as to whether a preliminary injunction could be based on any constitutional ground and the trial court shall forthwith proceed to hear the case on its merits, i. e\u201e the issues raised by the complaint and answer, such determination to, of course, be consonant with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-4\">.
