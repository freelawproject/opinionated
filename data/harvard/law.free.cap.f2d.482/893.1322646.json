The conviction was based upon the discovery of a loaded revolver in appellant\u2019s briefcase by a Trans World Airlines employee during a search of the carry-on luggage of boarding passengers. Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied on the grounds that he \u201cimpliedly consented\u201d to the search and that, in any event, \u201cthere was no governmental involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">We hold that the United States was sufficiently implicated in this airport screening search to require that it be conducted in compliance with the Fourth Amendment. We hold further that while airport screening searches per se do not violate a traveler\u2019s rights under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Fourth Amendment, or under his constitutionally protected right to travel, such searches must satisfy certain conditions, among which is the necessity of first obtaining the consent of the person to be searched. A remand is necessary in this ease to determine whether appellant gave such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">On March 16, 1971, appellant and a friend checked in a few minutes before TWA Flight 743\u2019s scheduled 6:50 p. m. departure from San Francisco International Airport for Bangkok, Thailand, with an intermediate stop in Los Ange-les. Appellant was ticketed for Los An-geles.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">As appellant approached the loading gate, Malcolm Read, a TWA employee, told him that a routine security check was necessary, reached for his briefcase, opened it, and found a gun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Read handed the gun to Donald Graub, a United States Customs Service security agent who had been standing some six feet away. Mr. Graub found the gun to be loaded. Mr. Read, Mr. Graub, and United States Deputy Marshal Douglas Aaron, who had been standing with other deputy marshals about 15 feet away, thereupon escorted appellant to a nearby room where the officials conducted a search of appellant\u2019s person. Following the search, Deputy Marshal Aaron formally took both appellant and the gun into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Appellant was charged with a minor offense under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(1). He pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to suppress. An evidentiary hearing was held before a United States magistrate on both the motion to suppress and the general issue of guilt or innocence. The motion to suppress was denied on a finding of implied consent. Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of $250.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Appellant appealed to the district court (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402; Rule 8(d), Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses before United States Magistrates), urging error in the denial of the motion to suppress. The district court affirmed, concurring in the magistrate\u2019s finding of consent, and adding, as an alternate ground, that there was no governmental involvement in the seai\u2019ch.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">We consider first whether the United States was sufficiently involved to subject the search to the limitations of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">\u201c[S]eareh is a functional, not merely a physical, process.\u201d Lustig v. United States, 338 U.S. 74, 78, 69 S.Ct. 1372, 1374, 93 L.Ed. 1819 (1949). A search begins with the planning of the invasion and continues \u201cuntil effective appropriation\u201d of the fruits of the search \u201cfor subsequent proof of an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>fense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Amendment applies to a search whenever the government participates in any significant way in this total course of conduct. \u201cThe decisive factor ... is the actuality of a share by a federal official in the total enterprise of securing and selecting evidence by other than sanctioned means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 69 S.Ct. at 1374.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The search of appellant\u2019s briefcase was not an isolated event. It was part of a nationwide anti-hijacking program conceived, directed, and implemented by federal officials in cooperation with air carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The major governmental effort to meet the threat of hijacking began in late 1968, when hijacking of commercial aircraft reached serious proportions, and intensified steadily thereafter. '</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Various techniques for the surveillance and search of potential air passengers have been a part of that effort. At no time since late 1968 could activities of this kind at the nation\u2019s airports have been described accurately as \u201can independent investigation by the carrier for its own purposes,\u201d Gold v. United States, 378 F.2d 588, 591 (9th Cir. 1967), and thus beyond the reach of the Fourth Amendment. The United States has \u201csignificantly involved itself\u201d in airport searches from the beginning. Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 380, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">The first hijacking of an American commercial aircraft occurred in 1961.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress responded by passing a statute making aircraft hijacking and certain related activities federal crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute also authorizes certain relevant conduct by the individual carriers: \u201cSubject to reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the [Federal Aviation] Administrator, any air carrier is authorized to refuse transportation to a passenger or to refuse to transport property when, in the opinion of the air carrier, such transportation would or might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>be inimical to safety of flight.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This statute, and related rules issued under the regulatory authority of the Administrator,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provide the basis for the anti-hijacking program.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In 1963 the United States joined in the Tokyo Convention, an international agreement addressed to some of the jurisdictional problems involved in international hijackings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Little more occurred, however, until 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Between 1961 and 1968, hijackings of United States aircraft averaged about one per year. In 1968, however, the number rose to 18. In 1969 there were 40 attempted hijackings of United States aircraft, 33 successful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Spurred by these events, the United States entered into additional international conventions aimed at solving complications left unresolved by the earlier Tokyo Convention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It also undertook domestic action to avert further hijacking episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Beginning in October 1968, a Federal Aviation Administration task force, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce, compiled a \u201cprofile\u201d of objective characteristics to identify potential hijackers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In December 1968, the Federal Aviation Administration held an intensive high-level symposium on the development of devices for the screening of individuals for possession of concealed weapons.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The FAA Task Force,- working in cooperation with the carriers, then developed the initial anti-hijacking \u201csystem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">Although the specific elements varied over a period of time, the system generally included, first, the use of the \u201cprofile,\u201d next, the use of a magnetometer to detect the presence of metal on any prospective passenger who met the \u201cprofile,\u201d and finally, a weapons search of the carry-on luggage and/or person of anyone who activated the magnetometer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>The FAA and the airlines worked together to put the system into operation at the nation\u2019s airports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a part of this cooperative effort, United States deputy marshals and Customs Service agents were made available to carry out searches and make arrests.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By September 1970, approximately 400 United States deputy marshals were assigned to surveillance and search activities at airport boarding gates.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">On September 11, 1970, the President of the United States announced \u201cA Program to Deal with Airplane Hijacking.\u201d Pertinent excerpts appear in the margin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> , The President \u201cdirected\u201d the Department of Transportation to have airlines extend the use of surveillance equipment and techniques to all appropriate airports in the United States. The President further stated that \u201cthe federal government will pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>vide enforcement officers to work this equipment, to conduct searches when appropriate, and to make necessary arrests.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Although \u201cprepared to require it absolutely by rule,\u201d the Department of Transportation continued for a time to employ informal means to obtain the cooperation of air carriers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> By September 1971, however, the FAA had concluded that voluntary cooperation \u201chad not satisfactorily provided [the] needed protection in many instances,\u201d and proposed a new rule requiring all air carriers to submit a screening program to the FAA for approval.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On February 1, 1972, the FAA issued a rule requiring air carriers to adopt and put into use within 72 hours a screening system \u201cacceptable\u201d to the FAA \u201cto prevent or deter the carriage aboard its aircraft of sabotage devices or weapons in carry-on baggage or on or about the persons of passengers.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This system was to require the screening of <em>all </em>airline passengers \u201cby one or more of the following systems: behavioral profile, magnetometer, identification check, physical search.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>In July 1972, the President \u201cordered\u201d the screening of all passengers and inspection of all carry-on baggage on all \u201cshuttle-type\u201d flights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On August 1, 1972, the FAA issued a directive that no airline \u201cshall permit any person\u201d meeting the profile to board a plane unless his carry-on baggage had been searched and he had been cleared through a metal detector or had submitted to a \u201cconsent search\u201d prior to boarding.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On December 5, 1972, the FAA ordered that searches of all carry-on items and magnetometer screening of <em>all </em>passengers be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>instituted by January 5, 1973.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Routine screening and searching under this procedure was to be conducted by airline personnel, but in the presence of armed law enforcement officers \u201c(1) Authorized to carry and use firearms,\u201d and \u201c(2) Vested with a police power of arrest under Federal, State, or other political subdivision authority.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">The search in the instant case occurred on March 16, 1971 \u2014 after the President\u2019s directive of September 1970, but before the issuance of formal regulations mandating pre-boarding searehes.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is entirely clear from the materials summarized above, however, that throughout the period since late 1968 the government\u2019s participation in the development and implementation of the airport search program has been of such significance as to bring any search conducted pursuant to that program within the reach of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The government\u2019s role in the airport search program is and has been a dominant one. But even if governmental involvement at some point in the period could be characterized accurately as mere \u201cencouragement,\u201d or as \u201cperipheral, or . one of several cooperative forces leading to the [alleged] constitutional violation,\u201d <em>see </em>United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 755-756, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 1177, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966), that involvement would nevertheless be \u201csignificant\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Constitutional limitations on governmental action would be severely undercut if the government were allowed to actively encourage conduct by \u201cprivate\u201d persons or entities that is prohibited to the government itself.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">It makes no difference that the act of opening appellant\u2019s briefcase was accomplished by a \u201cprivate\u201d airline employee rather than a \u201cpublic\u201d official. The search was part of the overall, nationwide anti-hijacking effort, and constituted \u201cstate action\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">The government argues that the search of appellant\u2019s briefcase was consistent with the Fourth Amendment (1) because appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his carry-on luggage, citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 516, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring), and (2) because \u201ca police officer is not required to have probable cause for arrest before he can seize a person and subject him to a limited search for weapons,\u201d citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">The search cannot be justified on either ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\"><em>Katz </em>states a threshold test. Its purpose is to determine whether a given intrusion is subject to the Fourth Amendment. If the complaining individual did not haye a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the intru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>sion, the Fourth Amendment is inapplicable; if he did have a reasonable expectation of privacy, however, the government must demonstrate that the intrusion was justified under Fourth Amendment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">As interpreted by Justice Harlan (an interpretation the government urges but that we do not necessarily accept<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>), <em>Katz </em>imposes \u201ca twofold requirement [for Fourth Amendment protection], first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d 389 U.S. at 361, 88 S.Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Clearly the first requirement was satisfied in this case: appellant relied on the privacy of his briefcase to conceal his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The second requirement was also sat- . isfied. This requirement does not mean that any kind of governmental intrusion is permissible if it has occurred often enough. The government could not avoid the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment by notifying the public that all telephone lines would be tapped, or that all homes would be searched. \u201cAirport searches\u201d are not outside the Amendment simply because they are being conducted at all airports. In none of the Supreme Court decisions excluding searches or seizures from the Fourth Amendment on the authority of <em>Katz </em>was the result based on such a rationale. Rather, in each case the individual\u2019s alleged reasonable expectation of privacy was negated on some ground independent of the frequency of the challenged intrusion itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> There is no such independent ground in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\"> <em>Terry </em>along with its companion case Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), and the more recent Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), is also inapposite to the validity of pre-boarding screening searches of passengers and luggage.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Those cases deal with a wholly different problem; and, in doing so, (1) they impose a requirement for justification of individual searches that pre-boarding screening searches cannot meet, and (2) they permit searches which are in some respects more extreme, and in other respects less so, than required to meet the need relied upon to justify pre-boarding screening searches.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><em>Terry </em>dealt with a street confrontation between a citizen and a policeman. The Court held that when a policeman is entitled to forcibly \u201cstop\u201d a person to inquire about possible criminal activity,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and has reason to believe that the person is armed and dangerous, he may conduct a .limited pat-down search for weapons to protect himself while conducting the inquiry. In <em>Terry, </em>in <em>Si-bron, </em>and later in <em>Adams, </em>the Court went to great pains to make clear that the officer\u2019s right to conduct such a search of an individual depends upon the officer\u2019s possession of specific, articula-ble facts sufficient to satisfy a reasonably prudent person that the particular individual is in fact armed and dangerous. To justify a stop-and-frisk, the government must focus on each person and demonstrate that as to that individual there is specific cause to fear the justifying harm.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The Court also emphasized that the justification for a <em>Terry </em>\u201cfrisk\u201d was primarily the officer\u2019s self-protection,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>and that all searches must be \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation,\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. Consequently, the Court held, the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>\u201cfrisk\u201d is limited to a patting down of the \u201cstopped\u201d person\u2019s outer clothing, for no more is required to detect the presence of weapons that might be available for immediate use against the officer.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">The search of appellant, however, occurred as part of a screening process directed not against appellant or any other person as such, but rather against the general introduction of weapons or explosives into a restricted area. The search was indiscriminate, and, in view of its object, necessarily so, absent a foolproof means of isolating in advance those few individuals who were genuine hijack risks. Moreover, it required an intrusion sufficient in scope to detect not only weapons that were immediately accessible to appellant when he was stopped prior to boarding, but also any weapons that would be accessible to him <em>after </em>boarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\"><em>Terry, Sibron, </em>and <em>Adams </em>are inap-posite because Mr. Read had no particular interest in appellant as an individual. He had no individualized basis for the search at all, much less specific and articulable facts that would justify a reasonably prudent man in believing that appellant was about to commit a crime or that he was carrying a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Moreover, the search exceeded the scope necessary to assure Mr. Read that appellant did not have a weapon immediately available for use against him. Some rationale other than that of <em>Terry </em>is required to justify extension of the \u201cfrisk\u201d to appellant\u2019s briefcase.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">Extension of the <em>Terry </em>stop- and-frisk rationale to authorize airport screening searches would result in intrusions upon privacy unwarranted by the need. As the Court made explicit in <em>Adams, Terry </em>applies when \u201cthe officer is entitled to make a forcible stop.\u201d 407 U.S. at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923. In this situation, <em>Terry </em>permits a forcible search: the officer could hardly be required to secure a legitimately detained person\u2019s permission to conduct a reasonable, self-protective search. As will be discussed below, however, neither forcible detention nor forcible search is justified by the legitimate governmental interest served by airport screening searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">If <em>Terry\u2019s </em>authorization of a stop- and-frisk is separated from the requirement that there be specific articulable facts establishing reasonable cause to believe that the individual stopped and searched is committing or about to commit an offense and is armed and dangerous, there is no readily apparent limitation on the policeman\u2019s power short of a concession that governmental agents may detain and search anyone, anywhere, whenever there is a serious threat of crime. There is no reason to believe that the incidence of concealed weapons is greater among airline passengers than among members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>public generally,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and <em>Terry </em>does not justify the wholesale \u201cfrisking\u201d of the general public in order to locate weapons and prevent future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The appropriate standards for evaluating the airport search program under the Fourth Amendment are found in a series of Supreme Court cases relating to \u201cadministrative\u201d searches and in two Court of Appeals decisions applying these precedents.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The essence of these decisions is that searches conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, rather than as part of a criminal investigation to secure evidence of crime, may be permissible under the Fourth Amendment though not supported by a showing of probable cause directed to a particular place or person to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">As we have seen, screening searches of airline passengers are conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, namely, to prevent the carrying of weapons or explosives aboard aircraft, and thereby to prevent hijackings. The essential purpose of the scheme is not to detect weapons or explosives or to apprehend those who carry them, but to deter persons carrying such material from seeking to board at all.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">Of course, routine airport screening searches will lead to discovery of contraband and apprehension of law violators. This practical consequence does not alter the essentially administrative nature of the screening process, however, or render the searches unconstitutional. One purpose of the searches authorized in United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>87 (1972); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), and See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967), was to discover continuing violations of regulatory codes.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aen-dedup-1\">There is an obvious danger, nonetheless, that the screening of passengers and their carry-on luggage for weapons and explosives will be subverted into a general search for evidence of crime.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> If this occurs, the courts will exclude the evidence obtained.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Appellant does not argue that airport searches are currently being used as a subterfuge for the prohibited \u201cgeneral search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>To pass constitutional muster, an administrative search must meet the Fourth Amendment\u2019s standard of reasonableness. \u201cUnfortunately, there can be no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\u201d Camara v. Municipal Court, <em>supra, </em>387 U.S. at 536-537, 87 S.Ct. at 1735.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The need to prevent airline hijacking is unquestionably grave and urgent.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The potential damage to person and property from such acts is enormous. The disruption of air traffic is severe. There is serious risk of complications in our foreign relations.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">A pre-boarding screening of all passengers and carry-on articles sufficient in scope to detect the presence of weapons or explosives is reasonably necessary to meet the need. Little can be done to balk the malefactor after such material is successfully smuggled aboard, and as yet there is no foolproof method of confining the search to the few who are potential hijackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">It is not fatal that the search of appellant\u2019s briefcase was conducted without a warrant. Under the indiscriminate screening procedures required by current regulations and applied in this ease, the decision to search the carry-on luggage of a particular passenger is not \u201csubject to the discretion of the official in the field,\u201d <em>Camara, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 532, 87 S.Ct. at 1733; and the practical effect of a warrant requirement would be to \u201cfrustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 87 S.Ct. at 1733.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">In this and other relevant respects,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the airport search program is indistinguishable, for Fourth Amendment purposes, from the warrantless screening inspection of air passengers and their luggage for plant pests and disease approved in United States v. Schafer, 461 F.2d 856 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">One important caveat should be stressed, however. To meet the test of reasonableness, an administrative screening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with satisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It follows that airport screening searches are valid only if they recognize the right of a person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>avoid search by electing not to board the aircraft.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">It is difficult to see how the need to prevent weapons and explosives from being carried aboard the plane could justify the search of a person who had elected not to board. Perhaps it could be argued that a compelled search might lead to the apprehension of a potential hijacker, eliminating or at least reducing the chance that he would try again. Compared to the degree of additional intrusiveness that compulsory searches involve, however, this possibility seems so slight as to be inconsequential. The risk of successful hijacking is not enhanced by allowing a potential passenger to avoid a search on a particular occasion by electing not to fly. Airport screening searches, as carried out in this ease and as currently employed nationwide, are not selective. A prospective passenger who elects not to fly on an earlier flight is, like all other passengers, certain to be subjected to a search before he can board a later flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">It is significant that the regulations establishing the airport search program do not authorize or require compelled searches.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">Since a compelled search of persons who elect not to board would not contribute to barring weapons and explosives from the plane, it could serve only the purpose of apprehending violators of either the criminal prohibition against attempting to board an aircraft while carrying a concealed weapon, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(J), or some other criminal statute. Such searches would be criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>investigations subject to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In sum, airport screening searches of the persons and immediate possessions of potential passengers for weapons and explosives are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment provided each prospective boarder retains the right to leave rather than submit to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">This conclusion is consistent with a full recognition of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to travel.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Although the right to travel is not absolute,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and its scope and limitations remain uncertain,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> it is firmly settled that freedom to travel at home and abroad without unreasonable governmental restriction is a fundamental constitutional right of every American citizen. \u201cThis Court long ago recognized that the nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts, of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.\u201d Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1329, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-18\">At the minimum, governmental restrictions upon freedom to- travel are to be weighed against the necessity advanced to justify them, and a restriction that burdens the right to travel \u201ctoo broadly and indiscriminately\u201d cannot be sustained. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 505, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964). \u201c\u2018[E]ven though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u2019 \u201d Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S.Ct. 247, 252, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1961), quoted in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, <em>supra, </em>378 U.S. at 508, 84 S.Ct. 1659.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Moreover, exercise of the constitutional right to travel may not be conditioned upon the relinquishment of another constitutional right (here, the Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search), absent a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">These doctrines dictate a critical examination of each element of the airport security program to make certain that neither the passenger\u2019s right to travel nor his right to personal privacy is burdened beyond the clear necessities of current circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">As we have seen, however, the need for some limitations upon these rights is clear. In light of that need, a screening of passengers and of the articles that will be accessible to them in flight does not exceed constitutional limitations provided that the screening process is no more extensive nor intensive than necessary, in the light of current technology, to detect the presence of weapons or explosives, that it is confined in good faith to that purpose, and that potential passengers may avoid the search by electing not to fly.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">The magistrate and the district court, as we have said, found that appellant \u201cconsented\u201d to the inspection of his briefcase, and that the search was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-20\">We agree that in this case the issue may be dealt with as one of \u201cconsent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-21\">We have held that, as a matter of constitutional law, a prospective passenger has a choice: he may submit to a search of his person and immediate possessions as a condition to boarding; or he may turn around and leave. If he chooses to proceed, that choice, whether viewed as a relinquishment of an option to leave or an election to submit to the search, is essentially a \u201cconsent,\u201d granting the government a license to do what it would otherwise be barred from doing by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-22\">The Supreme Court recently re-examined the nature of \u201cconsent\u201d in the Fourth Amendment context in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The Court was concerned with whether a consent, concededly given, was given \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d As stated by the Court, \u201cThe precise question in this case . . . is what must the state prove to demonstrate that a consent was \u2018voluntarily\u2019 given.\u201d 412 U.S. at 223, 93 S.Ct. at 2045. The Court concluded that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>question whether a consent to a search was in fact \u2018voluntary\u2019 or was the product of duress or eoei'cion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances. While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken into account, the government need not establish such knowledge as the <em>sine qua non </em>of effective consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2047-2048. The <em>Bus-tamonte </em>test would be applicable in determining whether consent to a pre-boarding search was \u201cvoluntarily\u201d given. <em>See </em>United States v. Ruiz-Estrella, 481 F.2d 723, 730 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">There is, however, a threshold question, not presented in <em>Bustamonte. </em>That question is whether in fact consent has been given. Only after some form of consent-in-fact is shown can \u201cthe precise question\u201d of the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of that consent arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">It may well be that under the present airport screening program, operating pursuant to current regulations, the alternatives presented to a potential passenger approaching the screening area are so self-evident that his election to attempt to board necessarily manifests acquiescence in the initiation of the screening process.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">It is not so clear, however, that this was true when appellant sought to board TWA\u2019s Flight 743 on March 16, 1971. The nature and scope of airport searches were not then widely known. The regulations mandating pre-boarding searches of passengers on all flights had not yet been issued. <em>See </em>text at note 27. The flights affected and the procedures employed varied with different carriers; the record discloses that passengers seeking to board TWA Flight 743 were searched only because this was a \u201cRed Alert\u201d flight \u2014 one having no more than a single domestic stop before departing for a foreign destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">It may be that signs, pre-boarding announcements, screening operations underway at nearby boarding gates, or other circumstances justified an inference that appellant was alerted to the procedures being employed and, by his attempt to board, manifested his willingness to submit to the search of his briefcase. No such evidence was offered, however. The hearing focused instead upon the instant Mr. Read reached for appellant\u2019s briefcase and appellant relinquished it; and the posture of the evidence was simply that appellant\u2019s briefcase \u201cwas taken from his hand, opened before he had a chance to really do or think anything.\u201d <em>See </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">This record would not support an inference that appellant had decided to accede to the search \u2014 any more than if it appeared that appellant had set his briefcase down and turned away for a moment, and Mr. Read had opened it without his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">The magistrate apparently recognized the absence of either direct or circumstantial proof of consent-in-fact. He held, however, that because appellant arrived late, the burden of proof was not on the government to show \u201cconsent,\u201d but on appellant to show the lack of it: \u201cI think there are certain hazards that go along with arriving late, and I must find in such a situation an implied consent . . . . \u201d The district court presumably agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">This was error. It is settled, of course, that the government bears the burden of proving \u201cconsent.\u201d <em>See </em>Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968); Montana v. Tomich, 332 F.2d 987, 989 (9th Cir. 1964); <em>see also </em>Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948); Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654 (1921). The government and TWA could insist upon a preboarding search; they could deny appellant the right to fly if he refused to consent, or if his late arrival deprived them of sufficient time to obtain his consent or to conduct the search. But the government may not justify a search on the basis of \u201cconsent\u201d unless it first establishes that such consent was given, expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>It may well be, as we have said, that proof is available that would justify an inference that appellant\u2019s attempt to board manifested a consent to the search. This evidence may not have been offered because of the magistrate\u2019s misconception as to who, in the circumstances, bore the burden of proof. A remand for further consideration of the consent issue is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. Mr. Read testified that he told appellant a search would have to be made, and that he simultaneously reached for the briefcase. Appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t fight to keep the . . . case. ...

The search of appellant\u2019s briefcase occurred six months later. Government agents were then sharing the task of conducting the pre-boarding searches with TWA personnel. As Mr. Read testified: \u201cOriginally, we handled it completely, and then we got the customs and the Marshal\u2019s service out there and they handle it in conjunction with us and we both now handle them.

Mr. Read testified that if appellant had arrived ten minutes earlier, the deputy marshals would have been in the gateway and probably would have conducted the search, though \u201chad I been standing there and they had two other or three other people in front of them I would have seerched them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. <em>See </em>Aircraft Hijacking Hearings at 101 (testimony of Under Secretary of Transportation James A.

The FAA used two other methods to control these procedures. First, the new regulations required each carrier and airport operator to file its own \u201csecurity program\u201d with the FAA, containing provisions \u201cacceptable\u201d to the Administrator. The air carriers were apparently informed through unpublished directives what provisions would be \u201cacceptable.\u201d And second, sub section (g) (1) of the new 14 O.F.R. \u00a7 121.538 authorized the Administrator to make direct amendments to the various filed security programs.

Volpe shed additional light on the overall program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">\u201cI have been directed by the President to institute immediately new security procedures at the Nation\u2019s airports to further protect American air travelers against threats and acts of violence by air hijackers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">Accordingly I have instructed the Federal Aviation Administrator to issue immediately an emergency order and to amend procedures under existing regulations to carry out the intent of the President\u2019s directive. The action will have the effect of tightening security at all the Nation\u2019s 531 airports which serve scheduled air carriers. It will also increase the security on all scheduled U. S. carrier flights originating abroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">Under the emergency order airport operators will be required to station armed local law enforcement officers at passenger checkpoints during periods when passengers are boarding or re-boarding. Through amendment of procedures already in force under existing regulations, all passengers must be screened electronically as a condition for boarding or reboarding. These revised procedures also will require all carry-on luggage and other items accessible to passengers during flight be inspected prior to boarding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">The new security measures regarding the electronic screening of all passengers and the inspection of their luggage require implementation not later than January 5, and the responsibility for carrying them out will be that of the air carriers. The emergency rule requiring the stationing of armed guards at passenger checkpoints by airport operators requires the operators to submit their plans within 30 days and to be in full compliance no later than 60 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">Through Presidential directives and resulting actions by the Department and the air transport industry, much has been done since the onset of the current wave of air piracy to curb these criminal acts. A cooperative Government-industry program for screening passengers and protecting aircraft from extortionists has been established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-13\">Electronic screening devices of some type are now available at all airports affected by the new orders. The Department of Transportation has purchased 1,100 walk-through metal detectors and 1,185 hand-held units, and is prepared to buy enough additional walk-through screening devices to equipi all airports. The program established by the President in September 1970 lias provided 1,500 Federal officers to enforce security at 40 of the country\u2019s larger airports, and local law officers have provided similar protection at more than 80 other airports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-15\"><em>See </em>DOT Press Release 103-72, Dec. 5, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">In a statement before the Subcommittee on Transportation and Aeronautics of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 1973, Under Secretary of Transportation Egil Krogh, Jr., summarized the development of the anti-hijacking program in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-19\">\u201cDuring this period of hijacking attempts, the Federal Government has developed varied responses to meet this danger. Initially, in response to the attempts of politically motivated hijackers, the FAA developed a \u2018profile\u2019 by which airline personnel could identify potential hijackers. In September 1970, after Palestinian guerrillas seized and destroyed several American and foreign aircraft, the President directed Federal law enforcement personnel to ride on American air carrier flights over international routes. In February 1972 the airlines were ordered by the FAA to use a profile to screen all passengers. In July of last year the President ordered the screening of all passengers and inspection of carry-on baggage on all \u2018shuttle-type\u2019 flights. And, in August the FAA required the air carriers to search all profile selectees and all persons in their party and to inspect their carry-on baggage before permitting them to board an aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-20\">However, the Houston and Birmingham incidents called for the further tightening of security. The threat of future incidents of a similar high violence character warrants continuing these measures. Where a simple screening of a selected few passengers might have deterred hijackers in earlier years, we now must be ready to forcefully stop them at the boarding gate and deny them access to the ramp area. Our program has three basic objectives : first, to keep unauthorized persons fi-om boarding an aircraft in possession of a deadly weapon ; second, to prevent sabotage devices from being carried or placed aboard these aircraft; and finally, to insure that the airport operators serving these aircraft have maintained a proper level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>of security in operating areas. To achieve these goals, we have required the action I described a few minutes ago: electronic screening of all passengers, a physical inspection of all carry-on articles, and the presence of armed law enforcement officers at the boarding gates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">As I stated earlier, under our program airport operators were required to submit by January 6 their plans for providing the requisite law enforcement personnel and by February 6 to have these officers in place at their airports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYau\">For intermediate steps in the development of the FAA rules, <em>see </em>37 Fed.Reg. 490^-05 (Mar. 7, 1972) (amending 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.538 to complete the proposed rulemaking on that section) ; 37 Fed.

Instead, prospective passengers were subjected to a series of \u201cscreening\u201d techniques, including the use of the behavioral \u201cprofile\u201d and the magnetometer. Only when a passenger was designated a \u201cselectee\u201d by these consecutive \u201cscreening\u201d techniques was he required to submit his carry-on luggage, or his person, to a more intrusive search. In the present case, however, as under the currently mandated procedure, every passenger (except appellant) was subjected to a magnetometer scan and every carry-on item was subjected to an actual search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>McGinley &amp; Downs, Airport Searches and Seizures \u2014 A Reasonable Approach, 41 Ford.L.Rev. 293, 313-316 (1972) ; Note, Skyjacking: Constitutional Problems Raised by Anti-Hijacking Systems, 63 XCr.L., Criminology, &amp; Police Science 356, 360-363 (1972) ; Note, Airport Security Searches and the Fourth Amendment, 71 Colum.L.Rev. 1037, 1055-1056 (1971) ; <em>but see </em>Abramovski, The Constitutionality of the Anti-Hijacking Security System, 22 Buff.
