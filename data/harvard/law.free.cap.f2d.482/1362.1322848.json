The district court, sitting without a jury, held for the Secretary and granted the relief sought, 351 F.Supp. 741. Defendants appeal from the judgment entered below arguing (1) that they do not constitute a single enterprise and are therefore not covered by the Act for most of the years in question, and (2) that the district court erred in holding that Amos Jones, a Veterans Cleaning employee, was not paid minimum wage because of certain deductions from his paycheck which reduced the net amount he received below the statutory minimum. We affirm as to coverage and affirm with a modification as to the method for computing Jones\u2019 wages for purposes of ascertaining whether he received minimum wage under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-12\">I. Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Defendant Bernard Ettlinger is owner and president of Veterans Cleaning and Roto Rooter and is secretary of Rent-A-Maid, which is owned principally by his son. He is operating manager of all three defendant corporations. The corporate defendants have common central office facilities at a single location, and central office functions, such as bookkeeping, billing, and ordering, are performed by common employees. All supplies and equipment used in defendants\u2019 activities are stored and maintained in a common storage area. Maintenance and repair work on defendants\u2019 motor vehicles is performed by a common employee in a common service area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">The district court described the business of each corporate defendant as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-15\"><em>Veterans Cleaning </em>is an industrial-commercial janitorial, window washing and maintenance firm. While its services are performed primarily on a contract basis for and in offices and places of business, it does, on occasion perform such services in and at private residences. Such services consist of dusting, sweeping and waxing floors, cleaning restrooms, vacuuming and shampooing rugs, shampooing furniture, taking out trash, etc. Employees are transported to and from their particular jobs, along with all necessary equipment and supplies in trucks belonging to Veterans Cleaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-16\"><em>Rent-A-Maid </em>furnishes maids primarily to private residences, for one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>two or more days on a \u201ccustomer need\u201d basis. The company furnishes merely a maid in uniform. All cleaning equipment, supplies and materials are furnished by the individual householder. The maids are transported to and from their particular jobs in trucks belonging to Veterans Cleaning or in the private automobiles of defendant Ettlinger or his son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-5\"><em>Roto Rooter </em>is a sewer and septic tank cleaning and maintenance service. This service is provided to customers who call in to have their sewers, sinks, commodes, tubs, floor drains or septic tanks (including drain fields) unclogged, cleaned and maintained. Employees and equipment are transported to and from the particular job in trucks belonging to Roto Rooter, [citations to trial transcript omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Although the corporations have separate equipment, the trucks of Veterans Cleaning and Roto Rooter are sometimes interchanged \u201con an emergency basis.\u201d The employees of the three corporations are generally separate both as a bookkeeping matter and in the work they do, but some employee witnesses testified that they regularly changed employment among the three companies. To some extent the three companies are held out to the public as related; on Veterans Cleaning\u2019s letterhead business stationery a bold line runs from the words \u201cGeneral Cleaning Contractors\u201d in large print at the top of the page to a list of six \u201ccleaning\u201d businesses, which includes Roto Rooter and Rent-A-Maid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">Whether the defendants are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act depends on whether they are an \u201centerprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206(a). That term is defined in pertinent part as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-9\">an enterprise which has employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, including employees handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person, and which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-10\">(1) . . . beginning February 1, 1969 is an enterprise whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $250,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2n-dedup-0\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(s). It is undisputed that all defendants have been engaged in commerce at all times relevant to this action. Further, it is not contested that Veterans Cleaning had a gross annual volume in excess of $250,000 in 1969, and that Roto Rooter had a gross annual volume over that amount in 1971, so that considered as separate enterprises those two defendants were covered by the Act in those years, respectively, regardless of coverage of the other defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Brennan v. Hatton, 5th Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 9. The disputed issue is whether all defendants \u2014 the three corporations and Ettlinger as principal owner and manager \u2014 must be grouped together and considered to be a single \u201centerprise\u201d under the Act. Defendants\u2019 aggregate gross annual volume has exceeded $250,000 since before 1969, so that if they are considered a single enterprise, they are all covered by the Act, including the minimum wage and overtime provisions, and have been covered since February 1, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>\u201cEnterprise\u201d is defined in the Act as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-4\">the related activities performed (either through unified operation or common control) by any person or persons for a common business purpose, and includes all such activities whether performed in one or more establishments or by one or more corporate or other organizational units. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqXd\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(r). Thus, three elements must coexist if defendants are to be considered a single enterprise: (1) related activities, (2) unified operation or common control, and (3) a common business purpose. <em>See </em>Brennan v. Arnheim and Neely, Inc., 1973, 410 U.S. 512, 93 S.Ct. 1138, 35 L.Ed.2d 463; Wirtz v. Savannah Bank and Trust Co., 5th Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 857, 859. Appellants admit as they clearly must, that the element of common control is present in this case, but they deny that the activities of the three corporations are \u201crelated activities . . . for a common business purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">The legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act sheds light on the meaning of the word \u201crelated\u201d in \u00a7 203 (r). The Report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Welfare, Senate Report No. 145, 87th Cong. 1st Sess. 31 (1961) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1660 [hereinafter Senate Report No. 145],<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-6\">Within the meaning of this term, activities are \u201crelated\u201d when they are the <em>same or similar </em>such as those of the individual retail or service stores in a chain, or departments of an establishment operated through leasing arrangements. They are also \u201crelated\u201d when they are <em>auxiliary and service activities </em>such as central office and warehousing activities and bookkeeping, auditing, purchasing, advertising, and other services. Likewise, activities are \u201crelated\u201d when they are <em>part of a vertical structure </em>such as the manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing of a particular product or products under unified operation or common control for a common business purpose. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">Thus, the three \u201crelated\u201d concepts indicated in the Senate Report are: \u201csame or similar,\u201d \u201cauxiliary and service activities,\u201d and \u201cpart of a vertical structure.\u201d In finding the activities of the defendants to be \u201crelated\u201d the district court relied primarily on the \u201cauxiliary and service activities\u201d concept, as developed in Wirtz v. Savannah Bank and Trust Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">We agree that the day to day operations of the three corporate defendants and the unified public image they present are such that they must be considered \u201cauxiliary and service activities\u201d under the Act. As examples of such activities Senate Report No. 145 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1660 lists \u201ccentral office and warehousing activities and bookkeeping, auditing, purchasing, [and] advertising.\u201d An \u201cinsurance company which existed for the purpose of serving the needs and convenience of customers who purchased cars from the automobile company\u201d was held to constitute an auxiliary or service activity to a new car sales business in Hodgson v. Harvey Motor Co., 20 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 493, 68 CCH Lab Cas. ff 32,667 (1971), aff\u2019d per curiam, 5th Cir. 1972, 461 F.2d 847. The same ease, however, held sale of automobiles and sale of farm implements not to be auxiliary and related when \u201c[t]he only common aspects of [their] operations were the single office in which their separate books were kept, the single bookkeeper in charge of their accounts, and several customers who did business with both companies.\u201d In Wirtz v. Savannah Bank and Trust Co., <em>supra </em>362 F.2d at 861, the renting out of office space in a bank\u2019s building was held auxiliary to the banking business in the same building where it was shown that the operation of the office building enabled the bank \u201cto locate in a desirable downtown area, to provide space for fu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>ture expansion, to improve the Bank\u2019s profit position, both from- the standpoint of revenue and taxes, and to strengthen the image of the Bank in the public eye.\u201d <em>See also </em>Wirtz v. Columbian Mutual Life Insurance Co., 6th Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 903; Wirtz v. First National Bank and Trust Co., 10th Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 641. The basis for this holding was not that the operation of an office building was an activity which by its nature aided the banking business,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that the maintenance and rental of office space in the same building with the bank afforded the bank, as a practical and factual matter, substantial advantages in the operation of its primary business of banking. Thus, the <em>Savannah Bank and Trust Company </em>case focused on operational interdependence in fact, and - not only on the primary activities of the businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">In this case the Secretary has shown such interdependence beyond a mere sharing of common office and storage space. First, as demonstrated by the listing of Roto Rooter and Rent-A-Maid on Veterans Cleaning\u2019s business stationery under the heading \u201cGeneral Cleaning Contractors,\u201d the three defendants \u00e1re held out to the public as part of a single larger \u201ccleaning\u201d business. The operation of each is used to enhance the public image of the others. Second, the vehicles of Roto Rooter and Veterans Cleaning are interchanged when the need arises, and Veterans Cleaning trucks are sometimes used to transport Rent-A-Maid employees to and from-job locations. Thirdly, the employees of the three companies are interchanged with some regularity on a day to day basis. One employee witness testified that although he always received his paycheck from Veterans Cleaning, he frequently worked for Rent-A-Maid and Roto Rooter. On arrival at work in the morning he might be told, for example, \u201cToday you\u2019re going to be on Roto Rooter.\u201d In view of the high degree of interdependence shown between the three corporations in their day to day operations and in the public image that they sought to create, we think the conclusion is inescapable that the defendants\u2019 businesses are auxiliary to each other. <em>See </em>Wirtz v. Savannah Bank and Trust Co., supra; Wirtz v. First National Bank and Trust Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">The \u201ccommon business purpose\u201d requirement is not defined in the Act. Senate Report No. 145, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1660 explains that \u201c [e] leemosynary, religious, or educational and similar activities of organizations which are not operated for profit . . . are not activities performed for a common business purpose.\u201d More than a common goal to make a profit, however, must be shown to satisfy the requirement. Wirtz v. Columbian Mutual Life Insurance Co., <em>supra </em>380 F.2d at 907. Many of the considerations relevant in determining whether businesses perform \u201cauxiliary or service activities\u201d are also relevant in ascertaining whether they have a common business purpose. Wirtz v. Savannah Bank and Trust Co., <em>supra </em>362 F.2d at 861. In view of the interdependence of the corporate defendants shown by the Secretary we are satisfied that the facts of this case demonstrate such a purpose. <em>Cf. </em>Brennan v. Arnheim and Neely, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-9\">Concluding that defendants perform related activities under common control for a common business purpose, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that each defendant is part of a single enterprise which has been covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act since February 1, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>II. Calculation of Jones\u2019 Wages</p>\n<p id=\"AeXT\">Defendant Ettlinger deducted from the weekly paychecks of Amos Jones, a Veterans Cleaning employee, a total of $1661.60 during the period from February 5, 1969 through February 11, 1970, so that the net amount Jones actually received during this period fell below minimum wage by $1960.33. . The district court held this latter amount to be due to him from his employer. Appellants contend that since Jones received the benefit of the amounts deducted these amounts should be counted as part of his wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">The record reflects that the deductions, which were not segregated on the company\u2019s books, were made for at least four different purposes. The first purpose was to repay to the employer advances, or \u201cdraws\u201d, made to Jones before the regular Friday payday. Deductions were also made to repay certain amounts expended by Veterans Cleaning in connection with a traffic accident in which Jones was involved. Defendant Ettlinger\u2019s testimony indicated that Jones had, while driving a company truck in an intoxicated state, destroyed the truck and an automobile belonging to a third party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the accident criminal charges, including driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, were brought against Jones, and he was eventually fined $300, prompt payment of which, was, according to Ettlinger, necessary for his speedy release from jail. Veterans Cleaning paid the fine at Jones\u2019 request, and spent the amount necessary to replace its truck and to compensate the third party for the loss of his automobile. Deductions were made to repay the company for these three types of expenditures pursuant to an assignment of wages executed by Jones, in which he agreed to weekly deductions of $15 until repayment was made in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">The district court viewed the deductions for repayment of advances as proper but considered the other deductions to be improper. Since amounts of the various deductions could not be figured from company books \u2014 which listed all deductions under the heading \u201cMiscellaneous Deductions\u201d \u2014 the court treated all deductions as improper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">In ascertaining the permissibility of the various deductions to the extent that they reduced Jones\u2019 net pay below minimum wage, we must recognize that Congress\u2019 declared purpose in enacting the Fair Labor Standards Act was to correct \u201cconditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 202(a). The minimum wage provisions are intended to enable those dependent on employment by others for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>livelihood to maintain the minimum standard of living referred to in the Act. <em>See </em>Brooklyn Bank v. O\u2019Neil, 1945, 324 U.S. 697, 706-707, 65 S.Ct. 895, 902, 89 L.Ed. 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">To this end, the minimum wage required must normally be paid- \u201cfree and clear\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-6\">Whether in cash or in facilities, \u201cwages\u201d cannot be considered to have been paid by the employer and received by the employee unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or \u201cfree and clear.\u201d The wage requirements of the Act will not be met where the employee \u201ckicks-back\u201d directly or indirectly to the employer or another person for the employer\u2019s benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">The only statutory exception to the requirement that wages be paid free and clear appears in 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203 (m), which allows the employer to count as wages \u201cthe reasonable cost . . . to the employer of furnishing such employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by such employer to his employees.\u201d One other exception has been judicially recognized; repayment to the employer of amounts misappropriated by the employee may be made by means of paycheck deductions, even where they reduce the net pay to the employee below minimum wage. <em>See </em>Mayhue\u2019s Super Liquor Stores, Inc. v. Hodgson, 5th Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 1196, cert. denied 409 U.S. 1108, 93 S.Ct. 908, 34 L.Ed.2d 688. In such cases the employee has actually taken the money free and clear and had the use of it. \u201cIn such a case there would be no violation of the \u2018Act\u2019 because the employee has taken more than the amount of his wage and the return could in no way reduce his wage below the minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. The Act was not intended to protect employees against return of amounts wrongfully taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-9\"> We agree with the district court that a similar rule should obtain for repayment by paycheck deductions of free and clear advances to employees, for the Act does not require inflexibility in the timing of the payment of wages or seek to discourage loans to employees. Unlike the district court, we think this loan-repayment principle should likewise apply to deductions to pay third-party creditors of the employee at the employee\u2019s direction and with his consent, or to recoup such amounts already paid out, when the employee has consented to the arrangement. When an employer has paid a third party at the employee\u2019s request, the employee has had the use of the money for a purpose of his choosing, perhaps for some emergency. Although the transaction is complicated slightly by the involvement of a third party, the payment by the employer to the third party is equivalent to a loan to the employee, or an advance against his salary. Accordingly, deductions to recoup the outlay must be counted as wages. Under this rule, the deductions to recoup amounts expended to pay Jones\u2019 fine and to compensate the owner of the automobile damaged in the traffic accident were permissible and should be counted as wages to the extent their amounts can be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">A debt allegedly owed by the employee directly to the employer which arises out of a non-loan transaction is subject to different considerations. Jones\u2019 destruction of the truck did not involve the supplying of board, lodging, or other facilities to him and did not net him any free and clear payment. The deductions from his paycheck to pay for the truck reduced his net wage below the statutory minimum wage. They impaired his ability to maintain the minimum standard of living contemplated by the Act and thus circumvented the protection sought to be afforded him by the Act. It is true that an employee may have a bona fide undisputed debt to his employer, not arising out of a loan transaction, and that repayment of the debt by means of paycheck deductions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>represents a benefit to the employee, but we do not believe that this type of benefit is the free and clear minimum payment required by the Act as wages. Nor may the otherwise impermissible deductions be authorized by a \u201cvoluntary\u201d assignment of wages by the employee. It has long been recognized that the protection afforded by the Fair Labor Standards Act may not be waived by agreement between employer and employee. Brooklyn Bank v. O\u2019Neil, 1945, 324 U.S. 697, 65 S.Ct. 895, 89 L.Ed. 1296. If the deduction were made at the employee\u2019s direction for the purpose of paying another creditor besides the employer, it might properly be considered part of his wages, but the employer-employee relationship brings into play special considerations, including the superi- or bargaining position of the employer. The voluntariness of an assignment of wages to the employer is inherently suspect. When the employer is the creditor, payment may not be made by paycheck deductions which reduce net pay below minimum wage, even where the employee apparently consents to such an arrangement. Accordingly, we hold the deductions to repay the employer for the damage to the truck were impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The Secretary\u2019s regulations under the Act are in accord with this view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-5\">Where an employer is directed by a voluntary assignment or order of his employee to pay a sum for the benefit of the employee to a creditor, donee, or other third party, deductions from wages of the actual sum so paid is not prohibited: <em>Provided, </em>That neither the employer or any person acting in his behalf or interest, directly or indirectly, derives any profit or benefit from the transaction. In such case, payment to the third person for the benefit and credit of the employee will be considered equivalent, for purposes of the Act, to payment to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.40(a). The quoted portion of the regulation permits deductions at the direction of the employee to pay a third party, but only where the employer does not benefit from the transaction. Since the employer clearly does benefit from deductions made to satisfy a debt owed to him, such deductions are prohibited to the extent they cut into the employee\u2019s minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\"> The district court correctly imposed on the employer the burden of segregating permissible deductions from impermissible ones. The Secretary\u2019s regulations require the employer to keep records reflecting \u201cthe dates, amounts, and nature of the items which make up the total additions and deductions.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2(a)(10). The employer in this case failed to keep such records and listed all deductions indiscriminately under the heading \u201cmiscellaneous deductions.\u201d Since some of the deductions\u2014 specifically, those to recoup the amount spent to replace the Veterans Cleaning truck destroyed by Jones \u2014 were shown to be invalid, the district court properly treated all deductions as invalid which could not be segregated from the truck deductions. <em>Cf. </em>Shultz v. Hinajosa, 5th Cir. 1970, 432 F.2d 259, 261. Thus, even though deductions to recoup advances made to Jones before the regular pay days and to recover the amount spent to pay for damages caused by Jones to the automobile of a third party were valid as a matter of principle, they could not be credited as wages in this case because the amounts of these deductions could not be separately shown. They were commingled with the invalid truck deductions. Defendant Ettlinger\u2019s testimony regarding payment of the $300 fine, however, adequately segregated this amount from the remainder of the deductions, and this $300 should therefore have been counted as wages. The judgment of the district court must accordingly be modified to show the amount due Jones from Veterans Cleaning to be $1660.33 rather than $1960.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-10\">The Judgment of the district court is modified and, as modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">.

The central portion of defendant Ett-linger\u2019s testimony relating to the events referred to in the text was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ase-dedup-0\">We have one other employee by the name of Amos Jones, window cleaner, who took a truck from the office, proceeded to get drunk, wrecked the truck, wrecked the car, left the scene, was arrested for drunk, leaving the scene of an accident, causing an accident, causing a second accident, where we paid for our truck, paid Parrish Motors for replacing the vehicle he wrecked, paid a $300.00 fine and I can go on and on, and of course he then turned around and gave me an assignment when his wife came and cried that he was going to be in jail forever and they\u2019d starve to death, so I paid his fine, got him out of jail and was trying to get my money back a little along and along, ten or fifteen dollars a week plus whatever he would manage to wheedle out of me on draw day as an advance on wages.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1420-11\">. The pertinent portion of the district court\u2019s opinion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-12\">Since there is no identification or segregation on defendants\u2019 records distinguishing wliat might be valid deductions, such as payroll advances made within a workweek, from improper deductions, such as for truck repairs, police fines and failure to perform penalties that reduced wages below statutory m\u00ednimums, all deductions must be treated as improper in instances where they caused weekly wages to fall below statutory minimum wages or overtime rates.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
