Plaintiff has moved for summary reversal of the district court\u2019s denial of relief and for an expedited hearing of this appeal. We think that the motion should be denied and, indeed, that plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">We have been cited to no authority, and we are aware of none, that, as a general rule, the granting or denial of a motion for a temporary restraining order is an appealable order. The authorities cited by plaintiff, where review of action on a request for a temporary restraining order was afforded, all arose from exceptional circumstances not present here, and in our view they constitute no authority for entertaining her appeal. Because we are persuaded that we lack jurisdiction in the premises, plaintiff\u2019s motion is denied and her appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
