Although the District Court found the representations to be false, it held that the plaintiff\u2019s tort claim for damages must fail for want of reliance. We think that the evidence compels a finding of justified reliance and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-27\">On May 31, 1971, Jerome A. Lurie executed a $50,000 promissory note payable to plaintiff, The Community Bank, Lake Oswego, Oregon. The loan had not yet been approved and was to be secured on a two-for-one basis by I.B.M. grade securities in Lurie\u2019s trust account with the Bank of Hallandale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-28\">On June 2, 1971, Maldyn C. Evans, Community Bank\u2019s president, telephoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>Craig G. Kallen, the Bank of Hallan-dale\u2019s sole trust officer, introduced himself, and inquired about Lurie. Evans indicated that the Oregon bank was considering lending Lurie $50,000 and sought information concerning Lurie and his trust account with the Florida bank. Kallen replied that he had discussed this matter with Lurie, who was' an extremely good customer of the bank, had a high seven figure trust with the bank, and had good balances on his accounts. Kallen offered, if Evans would send him a copy of the promissory note, to set aside securities held by Lurie at the defendant bank as collateral for the loan. All of this information was in the hands of the Florida bank, and Kallen neither qualified these statements nor raised any suspicion about his representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The facts reported by Kallen were false. As of June 2nd, Lurie had a zero balance at the Bank of Hallandale. At no time, either before or after that date, were the securities referred to by Kallen in the Florida bank\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">On June 3rd, during an audit, it was discovered that certain securities which the Florida bank held as collateral for its own loans to Lurie were in street name, had been stolen, and were subject to stop orders. Consequently, Kallen was relieved of his duties, but remained in his office and received telephone calls as a bank officer until his employment was terminated <em>on </em>June 11th. The Court found, despite denials by Kallen, that in a second telephone conversation with Kallen, on June 10, 1971, Evans asked if collateral had been set aside for the proposed loan and Kallen responded, \u201cI told you already they had.\u201d When asked if he would forward a list of securities, Kallen replied, \u201cI told you I would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">After the June 10th call, Evans approved the loan. On his instructions, the cashier and vice-president of Community Bank telephoned Lurie at Kal-len\u2019s office in the Florida bank. Kallen answered the telephone, indicated that Lurie was in his office, and then turned the telephone over to Lurie, who authorized disbursement of the $50,000. The funds were then disbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">On June 16, 1971, Evans wrote Kallen a letter which the District Court held evidenced an intent to obtain future documentation before disbursement. Since the Court apparently relied exclusively on this documentary evidence to find no reliance, it is set out in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-9\">\u201cDear Mr. Kallen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-10\">In connection with the loan transaction we have with your client, Dr. Jerome A. Lurie, we enclose herewith a certified photocopy of the note executed by Dr. Lurie and payable to us in accordance with the terms therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">It is our understanding that this copy together with Dr. Lurie\u2019s instructions to you will permit you to collateralize his loan at this bank on a two-for-one value ratio. We enclose our form of collateral agreement which we presume will be executed by your Department for us, and that a collateral receipt describing the securities pledged (or the equivalent thereof) will be forthcoming for our files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-12\">When replying, we would appreciate it if you would include either a photocopy of Dr. Lurie\u2019s financial statement or sufficient narrative information to indicate his general financial strength and reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-13\">Thank you for your assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-14\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-15\">/s/ M. C. Evans, President\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">We think that this letter cannot serve the Bank of Hallandale as a defense. This action is based not on an agreement or an understanding between the parties, but on the tort claim of misrepresentation. Plaintiff predicated this action upon Kallen\u2019s fraudulent telephone misrepresentations and the doctrine of apparent authority in regard to the Bank of Hallandale. <em>See </em>Gleason v. Seaboard Airline R.R. Co., 278 U.S. 349, 49 S.Ct. 161, 73 L.Ed. 415 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">We conclude the evidence compels a finding that, in authorizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>Lurie loan, Community Bank\u2019s president did rely on Kallen\u2019s factual misrepresentations that Lurie had securities in proper form in his trust account with the Bank of Hallandale and that these could be used as collateral for the loan and had been set aside for this purpose. The June 16th letter could not preclude recognition of Community Bank\u2019s reliance on earlier telephone conversations regarding Lurie\u2019s financial condition. Although paperwork needed to be completed to conclude the collateralization, it was not the Bank of Hallandale\u2019s failure to comply with the collateral agreement, but the fact that the Florida bank never possessed the securities in proper form that was fundamental to the damage to Community Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">It is the general law, as well as the controlling law in Florida, that recovery may be had for misrepresentation as to a third party\u2019s financial condition where a person, for the purpose of inducing another to lend money to said third person, misrepresents the financial responsibility or solvency of such third person. Nevada Bank of San Francisco v. Portland Nat\u2019l Bank, 59 F. 338 (9th Cir. 1893); Forbes v. Auerbach, 56 So.2d 895 (Fla.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The District Court, in its final judgment, listed elements essential to proving misrepresentation: (1) a false statement of fact, (2) known by the defendant to be false at the time it was made, and (3) made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act in reliance thereon; (4) action by the plaintiff in reliance on the correctness of the representations ; and (5) resulting damage to the plaintiff. Tonkovich v. South Florida Citrus Industries, Inc., 185 So.2d 710 (Fla.App.1966), remanded on other grounds. The Court recognized in this fact situation each of these elements except reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">For reliance to be proved,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-8\">[i]t is enough that the representation has had a material influence upon the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, and been a substantial factor in bringing about his action. It is not necessary that the representation be the paramount, or the decisive, inducement which tipped the scales, so long as it plays a substantial part in affecting the plaintiff\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">Prosser, Torts \u00a7 103 at 730 (3rd ed. 1964). It is clear from the record that Evans sought information- from Kallen, as the Bank of Hallandale\u2019s trust officer, as to facts concerning Lurie\u2019s financial position, the existence of the subject securities, and their segregation in his trust account. Thus, Kallen\u2019s misrepresentations had a \u201cmaterial influence\u201d on and were a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in Community Bank\u2019s loan decision. No stricter standard of reliance is required. A false representation is actionable if it substantially contributed to the formation of plaintiff\u2019s determination to act. <em>See </em>Woods-Faulkner &amp; Co. v. Michelson, 63 F.2d 569 (8th Cir. 1933); H. D. Sojourner &amp; Co. v. Joseph, 186 Miss. 755, 191 So. 418 (Miss.1939); Stackpole v. Hancock, 40 Fla. 362, 24 So. 914 (Fla. 1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">To constitute remediable fraud, however, it must appear not only that there was reliance on the misrepresentations, but that the reliance was justified under the circumstances. Fote v. Reitano, 46 So.2d 891 (Fla.1950); Ramel v. Chasebrook Construction Co., 135 So.2d 876 (Fla.App.1961). For the reliance to be justified, the misrepresentation must concern some material thing unknown to the plaintiff either because he did not examine it, because he had no opportunity to become informed, or because his entire confidence was reposed in the defendant. Robson Link &amp; Co. v. Leedy Wheeler &amp; Co., 154 Fla. 596, 18 So.2d 523 (1944). <em>See </em>Prosser, Torts \u00a7 108 at 716 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">In light of Kallen\u2019s position as trust officer of the Florida bank, the fact that essential information regarding Lurie\u2019s financial condition was in the hands of the Bank of Hallandale and the fact that Kallen obviously intended for Evans to believe the information given, Evans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>was justified in relying on Kallen\u2019s telephone communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">On remand, the District Court need consider only the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b1180-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">It is ordered that the petition for rehearing filed on behalf of Bank of Hal-landale and Trust Company, Appellee in the above entitled and numbered cause be and the same is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Although the Court\u2019s opinion indicated that the District Court need consider on remand only the question of damages, that reference applied only to Community Bank\u2019s action against Bank of Hal-landale and would not preclude consideration of Bank of Hallandale\u2019s third party action against its former trust officer, Craig Kallen, or any other related actions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
