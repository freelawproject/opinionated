Bus Parha and other parties holding record title to a certain tract of land in Galveston County, Texas, brought an action in Sedgwick County, Kansas, against Signal Properties, Inc., seeking to recover the reasonable value of Signal\u2019s use and occupation of the land. Signal purchased the property in 1964 from a third party who had purportedly acquired title to the property by adverse possession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>No question is here raised as to the Kansas Court\u2019s personal or subject matter jurisdiction of this action. On February 11, 1972, Signal filed a trespass to try title action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and procured from that court an injunction prohibiting the Farhas from bringing the pending Kansas court action to trial. Since such an injunction was not in aid of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, it was barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">It may well be, and we assume arguendo, that this trespass to try title proceeding is an <em>in rem, </em>proceeding or a <em>quasi in rem </em>proceeding. <em>See </em>Reed v. Turner, 489 S.W.2d 373 (Tex.Civ.App. 1972); State v. Bryan, 210 S.W.2d 455 (Tex.Civ.App.1948), writ refused n.r.e.; <em>cf. </em>Lefkowitz v. McQuagge, 296 F.2d 50 (5th Cir. 1961). Under this assumption, the federal court first acquired jurisdiction of the <em>res </em>\u2014 the title to the land. (The Kansas proceeding is conceded by all to have been an <em>in personam </em>action.) Thus, other courts are excluded from exercising jurisdiction which would interfere with the federal\u2019s possession and control of the property. <em>See </em>Miller v. Miller, 423 F.2d 145 (10th Cir. 1970). In two <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem </em>proceedings this factor could be dispositive; however, the Kansas <em>in personam </em>action cannot result in any judgment or decree which would interfere with the constructive possession of the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">A court may properly adjudicate rights in property in the possession of another court and may render any judgment \u201cnot in conflict with that court\u2019s authority to decide questions within its jurisdiction and to make effective such decisions by its control of the property.\u201d United States v. Klein, 303 U.S. 276, 58 S.Ct. 536, 82 L.Ed. 840 (1938). <em>See also </em>Markham v. Allen, 326 U.S. 490, 66 S.Ct. 296, 90 L.Ed. 256 (1946); Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U.S. 456, 59 S.Ct. 275, 83 L.Ed. 285 (1939); United States v. Certified Industries, Inc., 361 F.2d 857 (2d Cir. 1966); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 307 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1962), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 376 U.S. 398, 84 S.Ct. 923, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964); Albuquerque National Bank v. Citizens National Bank, 212 F.2d 943 (5th Cir. 1954); Purcell v. Summers, 126 F.2d 390 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 640, 63 S.Ct. 32, 87 L.Ed. 516 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">While such title issues as are first determined by the Kansas court may become binding on the parties to the Texas District Court action under the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel if properly set up by plea in the latter court, the mere act of resolving those disputed issues which are common to both proceedings in Kansas will not disturb the Texas District Court\u2019s constructive possession or control of the land. An irreconcilable conflict between the state and federal judiciaries would only arise if both sought to exercise authority to dispose of the same <em>res. See </em>1A J. Moore, Federal Practice fif\u00ed 0.222 and 0.223.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">Section 2283 was enacted to limit federal injunctions of state court proceedings in ordinary litigation between private litigants to those situations necessary to avoid unseemly conflict between state and federal courts. It is entitled to a strict construction. Atlantic Coast Line Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970); Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 352 U.S. 220, 77 S.Ct. 287, 1 L.Ed.2d 267 (1957). It is well settled that the statute\u2019s prohibition cannot be evaded by addressing the order to the parties rather than to the state court. Atlantic Coast Line Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, <em>supra. </em>Since this injunction does not come within any of the statute\u2019s specifically defined exceptions, it must be vacated. The cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ath-dedup-0\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The majority opinion ignores a longstanding rule of law that a federal court which obtains custody over property can restrain the litigants from asserting in another court any \u201cclaim, right, or title\u201d to the same property. <em>See </em>Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U.S. 93, 114, 24 S.Ct. 399, 408, 48 L.Ed. 629 (1904).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>For </em>this reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">The majority assumes for purposes of its decision that the federal district court in Texas had <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the land at issue. In the Kansas suit the parties agreed that title to the land was an issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>persuaded by the following reasons expressed by the district judge for issuing the injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-5\">\u201cA. Both the action in this Court and in the District Court of Sedge-wick County, Kansas, involve a determination of the actual ownership of real property located in Galveston County, Texas. Although the Kansas suit is couched as an action for recovery of the value of the use and occupancy of land, that Court must inevitable [sic] decide the present titleholder before awarding damages (which are called rental), if any. That is what is proposed to be litigated in the Kansas action, as admitted in open Court by counsel for defendants here, and as reflected in the pretrial order entered in the Kansas case. Moreover, counsel for defense admitted they could suc-eeed in the Kansas action and fail in the Texas action and thus, obtain damages for use and occupancy of land to which they had no title. This would be manifestly unfair and inequitable to plaintiffs here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-17\">\u201cB. In diversity actions, Texas law is required to be applied to determining title to land located in Texas. Texas courts have held that real property is <em>exclusively </em>subject to the laws of the sovereignty within whose territory it is situated. Therefore, the Kansas court has no <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over a <em>res </em>located within the control of another state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-18\">\u201cC. For the Kansas 'Court to determine possessory title would effectively interfere with, if not deprive, this Court of its jurisdiction. To prevent this interference with this Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Court\u2019s consideration and disposition of this case, a preliminary injunction must issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">We should also consider the impracticality and inconvenience of trying title to Texas land in a distant Kansas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">The anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 (1970), presents no obstacle in this case. A specific exception permits a federal district court to issue an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court where necessary in aid of the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. Here the district court should be able to issue an injunction in aid of its jurisdiction to prevent the Kansas court from continuing multiplicitous proceedings, from rendering a decision which could effectively deprive the federal court of its <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction through principles of <em>res ju-dicata </em>and collateral estoppel, or from rendering a \u25a0 decision potentially inconsistent with a decision of the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">We previously summarized the law applicable to this case in Pacific Indemnity Company v. Acel Delivery Service, Inc., 5 Cir., 1970, 432 F.2d 952, 954, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-7\">The language of \u00a7 2283 is explicit in defining the circumstances in which a federal court may stay proceedings in a state court; however, certain timeworn judicially declared exceptions do exist. Thus, it is said that where the jurisdiction over the proceedings is <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem, </em>\u201c[T]he state or federal court having custody of such property has exclusive jurisdiction to proceed.\u201d Donovan v. City of Dallas, 377 U.S. 408, 412, 84 S.Ct. 1579, 1582, 12 L.Ed.2d 409 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\"><em>See also </em>Jett v. Zink, 5 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 149, 151, where identical issues, concerning the validity of an agreement to define the parties\u2019 interests in an oil field, were pending in both a state and federal court in Alabama. We declined to enjoin the state court suit because the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction in that case was <em>in personam, </em>but we said, however, that it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d to allow the same issues to be pending simultaneously in state and federal courts if the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction of the <em>res. </em>474 F.2d at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">I would adhere to the rules of law enunciated previously by the Supreme Court and our recent Fifth Circuit cases, and affirm the district court decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">. <em>See also </em>Lion Bonding &amp; Surety Co. v. Karatz, 262 U.S. 77, 89, 43 S.Ct. 480, 484, 67 L.Ed. 871 (1923): \u201cThe court which first acquired jurisdiction through possession of the property is vested, while it holds possession, with the power to hear and determine ail controversies relat-ting thereto. It has the right, while continuing to exercise its prior jurisdiction, to determine for itself how far it will permit any other court to interfere with such possession and jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">The majority opinion relies on United States v. Klein, 303 U.S. 276, 281, 58 S.Ct. 536, 538, 82 L.Ed. 840 (1938), for the proposition that a court may properly adjudicate rights in property in the possession of another court and may render any judgment \u201cnot in conflict with that court\u2019s authority to decide questions within its jurisdiction and to make effective such decisions by its control of the property.\u201d In the present case, the Kansas court is being asked by the plaintiffs to decide a question within the jurisdiction of the Texas federal district court, namely, the \u201ctitle to the land in question.\u201d Thus, the quotation from <em>Klein </em>is apparently in conflict with the result reached by the majority opinion. Moreover, a review of the facts in <em>Klein </em>confirms that the case lends little or no support to the majority opinion. In <em>Klein </em>the United States district court held money for bondholders who could not be located but who were awarded the money by a decree in favor of all bondholders similarly situated to plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Several years later a suit was filed by the Escheator of Pennsylvania in a state court to obtain a decree of escheat. This subsequent state court suit did not involve the same controversy as was decided in the federal district court, but rather was a formality necessary to perfect the state\u2019s claim <em>to </em>the money as a transferee of the bondholders. Unlike <em>Klein, </em>in the instant matter the state court suit in Kansas presents issues identical to the suit in the Texas federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">.
