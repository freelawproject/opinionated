The district court denied injunctive relief and this court denied injunctive relief pending appeal. Meanwhile on February 13, 1973 the election of union officers for a four-year term was held. The officers elected took office on June 1, 1973. Also, prior to February 13, 1973 the plaintiffs became sixty-five years of age. They are now both beyond the age protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and beyond the age of eligibility for union office set forth in the union constitution. No injunctive relief can be given to plaintiffs in these circumstances, and the case is moot. <em>E.g., </em>Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 89 S. Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); Colpo v. Highway Truck Drivers, Local 107, 305 F.2d 362 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 890, 83 S.Ct. 188, 9 L.Ed.2d 123 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">This appeal will be dismissed and the case remanded to district court where the judgment appealed from will be vacated as moot. <em>See </em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
