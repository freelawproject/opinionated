Appellant had secured jury verdicts totaling $5,500 against defendants-appellees but the District Judge set the verdicts aside, holding that in this civil rights damage action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970) there were no facts proven from which the jury could appropriately have held that the injuries plaintiff received occurred under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-25\">The principal defendant was a constable, Burton Cagle, and the other defendant against whom judgment was entered was his son, Danny. At the time two other defendants (Deputy Sheriffs Con-dra and Sons) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had plaintiff in custody, following an election night argument in a cafe, and were questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Constable Cagle, having learned that plaintiff\u2019s father had fired a shot at his son, Danny, came to the scene, approached the three men outside of the jail, and proceeded to attack plaintiff, who received a nearly fatal knife wound. Plaintiff testified that Constable Cagle struck him while Danny Cagle knifed him and the two deputies stood by.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The case was decided principally on the question of whether or not the constable at the time was investigating a crime within his official orbit. There appears to be no doubt that his constitutional duties did empower him to do this. But it is appellees\u2019 contention that the argument was wholly personal with Ca-gle and not a matter of any official duties. As to this issue Cagle\u2019s cross-examination supplied some evidence from which the jury might have found that Cagle was on official business in approaching plaintiff on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We believe, however, that the record will also support a finding of state action in that Cagle\u2019s chance of access to the plaintiff was enhanced by the fact that he was a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The jury apparently accepted appellant\u2019s version of what happened, as set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201cQ Now, how long was it from the time he had left until he came back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">A It was only a few minutes, I couldn\u2019t estimate, a short time, a very short time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">Q Who was with him this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">A A whole car load of boys. I know Danny Cagle was with him and I believe his brother, Darrell, was with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">Q Did he come back in the same car that he was in the first time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">A I believe he did, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-13\">Q Was he dressed the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-15\">Q Did he have a pistol still on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">A Still in his back pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-17\">Q Okay. All right. Now, you say Burton Cagle got out of his car and came over to where you and the two deputies were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-19\">A Yes, sir, and started cussing me and hit me, hit me in the side of the jaw here (indicating) and knocked me up against the county car and me and him was trying to \u2014 I was trying to protect myself, me and him got in a scuffle, while we was scuffling his son, Danny Cagle, jumped out of the car and come around behind the county patrol car and started cutting me with a knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-20\">Q What was Joseph Sons and Rex Condra doing during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-21\">A They were standing on each side of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-22\">Q Not doing anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-23\">A Not doing anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-24\">Q Are you saying that Burton Ca-gle made threatening remarks to you first and then struck the first blow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-25\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-26\">Q Both of those ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-27\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-28\">Q You didn\u2019t say anything back to him before the first blow was struck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-29\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-30\">Q You are standing between the two deputies and he comes over and strikes you where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-31\">A In the side of the jaw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-32\">The law under which plaintiff-appellant filed his complaint 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970), states:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-33\">\u00a7 1983. Civil action for deprivation of rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-34\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizens of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>As the District Judge clearly recognized, the critical question in this case is whether or not there was evidence from which the jury could have found that appellants Cagle were acting \u201cunder color of\u201d state law within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. The definition of this phrase is set forth in United States v. Classic as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auh\">Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken \u201cunder color of\u201d state law. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346 [, 25 L.Ed. 676]; Home Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, 227 U.S. 278, 287 et seq. [, 33 S.Ct. 312, 314, 57 L.Ed. 1423]; Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 507, 519 [, 59 S.Ct. 954, 960, 965, 83 L.Ed. 1423]; cf. [3 Cir.], 101 F.2d 774, 790. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">This definition was adopted in the context of interpretation of statutes providing criminal sanctions against violations of civil rights. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242 (1970). It has also been squarely applied to civil actions for damages authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970). Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 184, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). <em>See also </em>United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794, n.7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We believe that the Cagles\u2019 approach to appellant when he was a prisoner under guard of Sheriff\u2019s deputies could have been viewed by the jury as having \u201cbeen made possible only because the wrongdoer [was] clothed with the authority of state law.\u201d United States v. Classic, <em>supra, </em>313 U.S. at 326, 61 S.Ct. at 1043. It seems clear to us that there was evidence that Constable Cagle consciously or unconsciously used his official position so as to be able to commit a wholly unofficial assault, and that Danny Cagle acted in concert with him. This is exactly parallel to the color of law ruling which the Supreme Court made in United States v. Price, <em>supra, </em>383 U.S. at 795, 86 S.Ct. 1152, albeit in Price under far more aggravated circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and vacated and the case is remanded for entry of judgment on the verdicts of the jury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-26\">. The jury found no cause for action as to these two defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
