Byrne, Sr., United States District Judge, Los Angeles, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-22\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b284-23\">Croxton, Tremblay, and Garcia were convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. Their appeal questions whether a conspiracy agreement was finally formed and whether they were entrapped. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-24\">The three were in Arizona making plans to fly 800 pounds of marijuana into the United States; Tremblay had access to this amount near his home in Mazatlan, Mexico. They travelled to Phoenix and attempted to hire a pilot, but were unsuccessful because the pilot could not qualify to fly the plane desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-25\">Arriving in Tucson, Tremblay contacted Lynne Zongker, discussed his lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>success and requested assistance, Unfortunately for Tremblay, Zongker was a government informer and made arrangements for him to meet a proposed pilot, Warren Parthen, a United States Customs Agent. The scheme was discussed further and plans made. Trem-blay wanted to check out a landing strip near Blythe, California so Parthen flew them there. Tremblay paid to have Parthen certified for the aircraft and also paid for the flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">Only one problem remained \u2014 whether the runway to be used in Mazatlan was adequate. All agreed that Tremblay and Parthen would take a commercial flight to examine the runway. Shortly after airline tickets were purchased, the three were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">I. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Tremblay and Croxton claim the conspiracy agreement was not complete \u2014that it was still in the negotiation stage and would not have been finalized until the landing strip in Mexico had been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Obviously, the marijuana transaction need not be completed as the gist of the offense is the agreement to accomplish an unlawful purpose. Black v. United States, 252 F.2d 93, 94 (9th Cir. 1958); Ong Way Jong v. United States, 245 F.2d 392, 394 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1957). The question raised here is whether the evidence of a conspiracy is sufficient if the parties have not finalized the specific <em>means </em>or plan for transporting the marijuana into the United States. To hold that the evidence in this case was insufficient would produce a doctrine tending to absurd results. These same defendants, having examined and approved the Mazatlan runway, could still claim that their conspiracy was incomplete because they had not filed a flight plan with the appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The trial judge correctly instructed the jurors that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants conspired to commit an offense against the United States. He further instructed them there need not have been a formal or express agreement or a statement of the scheme or the means to effect it. Given these, and other, proper instructions on the law of conspiracy, the jury could find these defendants guilty of an agreement to import marijuana into the United States. It was not essential to the crime charged that the conspirators had agreed upon the specifics of the method proposed. <em>See </em>Williamson v. United States, 207 U.S. 425, 446-449, 28 S.Ct. 163, 52 L.Ed. 278 (1908). <em>See also </em>Pierce v. United States, 252 U.S. 239, 244, 40 S.Ct. 205, 64 L.Ed. 542 (1920); United States v. Root, 366 F.2d 377, 382-383 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 912, 87 S. Ct. 861, 17 L.Ed.2d 784 (1967); Eaker v. United States, 76 F.2d 267, 269 (10th Cir. 1935). Conspiracy \u201cdoes not require \u2018mission accomplished\u2019, only \u2018mission attempted\u2019. An overt act by the conspirators in an effort to accomplish the mission satisfies the requirement of the statute.\u201d United States v. Root, 366 F.2d 377, 383 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 912, 87 S.Ct. 861, 17 L.Ed.2d 784 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">II. <em>Entrapment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">All three appellants assert error involving entrapment or related theories. Croxton did not effectively raise the defense. Further, he failed to admit doing the acts charged \u2014 a condition precedent to raising the defense. United States v. Mehciz, 437 F.2d 145, 149 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 974, 91 S.Ct. 1663, 29 L.Ed.2d 139 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Garcia raised the entrapment issue by his motion for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d at the end of the government\u2019s case. However, subsequent to its denial, he testified in his own behalf. In doing so, and in the absence of plain error, he waived any right to challenge the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. See United States v. Lewis, 426 F.2d 266 (9th Cir. 1970); Viramontes-Medina v. United States, 411 F.2d 981 (9th Cir. 1969); Benchwick v. United States, 297 F.2d 330 (9th Cir. 1961). There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>plain error. He did not renew his motion at the close of the case and he raised no other question on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">As to Tremblay, neither he nor any other appellant submitted an entrapment instruction or objected to the one given. In the absence of plain error, no party may first object to an instruction upon appeal. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b). We have reviewed the evidence and the court\u2019s entrapment instruction and find no error, plain or otherwise. This properly instructed jury could and did reject appellants\u2019 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The appellants argue that they were not given the benefit of United States v. Russell, 459 F.2d 671 (9th Cir. 1972) and Greene v. United States, 454 F.2d 783 (9th Cir. 1971). They assert that without the government\u2019s unconscionable, active participation in supplying an airplane, the venture could not succeed. <em>Russell </em>and <em>Greene </em>represented a departure from the traditional defense of entrapment. Unfortunately for appellants, the United States Supreme Court reversed <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973), reaffirming that the defense was only available to the \u201cunwary innocent\u201d and not the \u201cunwary criminal.\u201d <em>See </em>Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958). \u201cIt is only when the government\u2019s deception actually implants the criminal design in the mind of the defendant that the defense of entrapment comes into play.\u201d United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 436, 93 S.Ct. 1637 at 1645, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">They contend, however, that this case is distinguishable from <em>Russell </em>because only Parthen could secure a plane legally, there was no on-going business and <em>Russell </em>was not a conspiracy case. We are not persuaded. Parthen did not implant the criminal design in their minds and therefore this \u201crelatively limited defense\u201d is not available. United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. at 435, 93 S.Ct. 1637 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
