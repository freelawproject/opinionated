Another type of finely divided solid particle employed is carbon black, the coating of which with a dye improves its color in printing ink. Adhesion of the dye or other colorant to the solid particle is brought about by admixing with a cationic surfactant, defined in the application as a material which, when ionized in a solvent, has a hydrophobic lipophilic end on the positively charged cation. While not limited thereto, it is \u201cgenerally noted\u201d that the cationic surfactants include the organic amines, \u201cfor example, long chain aliphatic amines and polyamines, quaternary amine bases and salts, imidazolines, and other organic amines * * * broadly defined as those compounds which when contacted with a finely divided solid such as carbon black or ben-tonite clay provide said finely divided solid with a substantially improved receptiveness for, and ability to fixedly bond or attach with, other organic and/or inorganic substances.\u201d In addition to coloring materials, appellant contemplates attaching to the solid particles such materials as optical brighteners, ultraviolet absorbers, and even antibiotics, antiperspirants, and deodorants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">\n<em>The Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Claim 59 is illustrative and reads, with paragraphing added by us, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-7\">The method of forming an improved pigment by fixing a suitable colorant to finely divided solid particles, said method comprising the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">dispersing finely divided solid particles selected from the group consisting of clay minerals and oxides, carbonates, sulfates and silicates of aluminum, barium, calcium, magnesium, silicon, titanium and zirconium in a liquid medium in which said solid particles are insoluble, said liquid medium being present in an amount sufficient to enable the formation of a suspension of said finely divided solid particles in said liquid medium, mechanically agitating said finely divided solid particles and liquid medium to uniformly distribute and suspend said solid particles in said liquid medium,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-10\">adding an effective amount of a cationic surfactant to said suspension, adding an effective amount of a colorant selected from the group consisting of natural dyes, synthetic dyes and color intermediates to said suspension, said effective amounts of said cationic surfactant and colorant respectively being amounts which are sufficient to coat substantially the entire surface area of said finely divided solid particles,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-11\">mechanically agitating said suspension to uniformly contact said finely divided solid particles with said cationic surfactant and colorant, and fixing said cationic surfactant and colorant to said finely divided solid particles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Claims 60-63 depend from claim 59 and appellant says that their patentability can be resolved by considering only claim 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">Claim 64 is directed to an improved pigment product comprising particles from the same group as in claim 59, \u201chaving affixed thereto a cationic surfactant and a colorant selected from the group consisting of natural dyes and synthetic dyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">Claim 65 is to a method of bonding an optical brightener or UY light absorber onto a pigment particle, the method steps corresponding to those in claim 59 except that the particles are more broadly claimed as \u201cfinely divided pigment particles\u201d and the \u201cfixing\u201d is done \u201cby adjusting the pH.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Claim 66 is directed to a pigment composition comprising finely divided particles coated with a cationic surfactant and an optical brightener or an ultraviolet light absorber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The following two references are relied on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">Ratcliffe 2,622,987 Dec. 23, 1952</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM3P\">Bal\u00f3n et al. 2,755,202 July 17, 1956</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">According to the examiner, the basic difference between the invention claimed and the disclosure of Bal\u00f3n et al. resides in the sequence of adding the materials. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">For example, Appellant treats the clay with a cationic material and then adds the coloring agent; whereas Bal\u00f3n et al treats the coloring agent with a cationic material and then adds the clay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-9\">The overall result is the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">However, treating the clay with the cationic material and then the coloring agent is known, as taught by Rat-cliffe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-11\">* * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">Claims 60 to 64 differ from claim 59 in scope only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-13\">* * . * Although not identical to the ones disclosed by Appellant, Bal\u00f3n et al use oxidizing agents or other special agents. Oxidizing agents are known to be optical brighteners (claims 65 and 66).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">Accordingly, the examiner rejected all claims as obvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">In affirming the \u00a7 103 rejection, the board stated that \u201cIt would be obvious in view of Ratcliffe to disperse finely divided solids in a liquid vehicle, to add a cationic surfactant and thereafter to add a colorant or pigment.\u201d The board added that \u201cit would be obvious to employ the same process to coat clay particles with a brightening agent or a UV absorber\u201d since they \u201care normally considered as adjuvants in the dyeing and printing field\u201d; and that the \u201caddition of metal salts such as aluminum chloride to a dyeing bath as a fixing agent would be obvious to one skilled in this art.\u201d Noting that \u201cBal\u00f3n et al. teach the combination of leuco base dyestuffs with cationic agents, including organic amine surfactants,\u201d the board stated that \u201cIt would be obvious to substitute a leuco base dye in the Ratcliffe process with provision for subsequent development of the color using an oxidizing agent and an acidic material as the color producing reagent in the manner taught by Bal\u00f3n et al.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">There was also a rejection by the examiner under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 on several grounds, affirmed by the board on only one ground, namely, double inclusion of elements in naming the finely divided solid material which the examiner thought rendered the claims vulnerable under \u00a7 112, second paragraph, on the ground of indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">In view of our affirmance on the \u00a7 103 rejection we find it unnecessary to consider the \u00a7 112 rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">As to the \u00a7 103 rejection, appellant emphasizes in his brief, as he does throughout his specification, that the essential feature of his invention is the utilization of a cationic surfactant for fixing colorant to solid particles. In spite of excessive loquaciousness in claim 59, that is essentially its subject matter; clay particles are made into a slurry, a cationic surfactant and a colorant are added and stirred, and the colorant adheres to the solid particles because of the action of the surfactant. Unlike appellant\u2019s specification, which sets forth in considerable detail, including 23 specific examples, many printing ink and dye formulations to illustrate the adhering of the colorants to the solid particles, claim 59 is directed to the broadest aspect of the process of causing adhesion by use of a surfactant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-23\">Appellant is compelled to admit in his brief that the Ratcliffe reference discloses, in a printing ink or paint composition, in combination, clay treated \u201cwith a cationic base, including amines and quaternary ammonium compounds, which would be classed as cationic surfactants.\u201d This \u201cmodified clay\u201d is admittedly used \u201cin conventional paints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>and inks.\u201d These, of course, contain colorants. Appellant argues that \u201cthe reference does not suggest that the cationic modified clay interacts with any pigment or other colorant that is present in the completed paint or ink.\u201d The Patent Office position, on the other hand, is that Ratcliffe specifies that his paint or ink may contain \u201corganic toners and dyes, carbon black, bone black\u201d and that its presence would obviously and inherently result in a coating or bonding of the modified clay with the colorant. Further, the Patent Office contends, relative to claims 65 and 66, that \u201cJust as a dye would be expected to coat surfactant modified clay, so would a brightening agent or a UV absorber be expected to do the same for the modified clay with or without colorant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief concedes that brightening agents and UV absorbers were previously known in this art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">It thus appears clearly to us that the combinations of ingredients comprehended by appellant\u2019s product claims are found in the prior art and, assuming the validity of his theories of operation, the surfactants will inherently cause adhesion of the colorants to the \"finely divided solid particles\u201d coated therewith and bring about the advantages he claims for his invention. With respect to the method claims (59-63 and 65), we agree with the board that they do not present anything unobvious in their various limitations as to adding, agitating, fixing, and relative amounts. As to the order of adding surfactant, colorant, and solid particles, appellant himself points out in his Examples 16, 19, and 23 that he gets the same results when adding the dye to the slurry before, simultaneously with, or after the addition of the surfactant. As to \u201cfixing,\u201d this is claimed, in claims 60 and 65, as done \u201cby adjusting the pH.\u201d In the specification it is shown that this is done by adding acid to basic solutions and base to acidic mixtures; it is also shown that in some mixtures nothing whatever has to be done \u2014 fixing is automatic. The board thought the manipulations would be obvious and appellant has not argued this point. As to amount, the claims say using enough solid particles to make a suspension, \u201ceffective\u201d amounts of surfactant and colorant, and sufficient colorant to coat substantially the entire surface areas of the particles. We agree that unobviousness cannot be predicated on these limitations. Given the desire to coat the particles it would be obvious to use enough for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">We have fully considered appellant\u2019s arguments but they do not persuade us of error in the rejection of all claims under \u00a7 103 on the references and that rejection is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">.
