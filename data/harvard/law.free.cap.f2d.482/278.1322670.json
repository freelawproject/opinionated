The court imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment on each substantive count, but suspended all of these sentences and placed the defendant on probation for five years for each count with the probation periods to run concurrently. The court also imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment and a 10,000 dollar fine on the conspiracy count. The imprisonment on this count was likewise suspended and Beekelhy-mer was placed on probation conditioned on the payment of the fine in monthly installments. On this appeal the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support any of the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\"> The record contains ample evidence from which the jury could properly have found that Beckelhymer conspired to violate the provisions of this Act. The concurrent sentence doctrine makes it unnecessary to examine the defendant\u2019s claims that the jury verdicts on the substantive counts were unsupported by evidence. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Stone, 472 F.2d 909 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Payne, 467 F.2d 828 (5th Cir. 1972). The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-14\">. Specifically, three violations of 18 U.S.O. \u00a7 922(b)(3) and three violations of 18 U.S.O. \u00a7 922 (m).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
