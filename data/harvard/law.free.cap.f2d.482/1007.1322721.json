Talbot Smith, United States Senior District Judge, Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1060-18\">TALBOT SMITH, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1060-19\">The controversy before us arises out of damages suffered by a train of the plaintiff Chicago and North Western Railway Company (hereafter the railroad) due to a washout of its tracks and subsequent derailment of its train.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-20\">On the night of June 9, 1971, the area involved suffered, in a short period, an extremely heavy downpour of rain. It was of such intensity that it was characterized by. one witness as the \u201chardest rain he had ever seen\u201d in a lifetime in South Dakota<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by another as one that might occur in a period from once in a hundred years to once in a thousand, depending upon the accuracy of the measurements made of the quantity of the downpour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result there was a widespread flooding of the area with water from many sources,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including the Tyler dam, which breached. This dam had been built by Mr. Tyler on his ranch for the control of erosion and was located north of the line of the railroad. The train involved, traversing the flooded area, was derailed, a bridge torn out, and cars and locomotives severely damaged. The railroad brought this action against Mr. Tyler for damages to the extent of over $147,000. A jury verdict in defendant\u2019s favor resulted, with subsequent appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-21\">The issues presented to us by the appellant relate solely to the court\u2019s instructions, and they, in turn, relate to the substantive law of South Dakota respecting absolute liability (the so-called rule of Rylands v. Fletcher<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>), nuisance, and so-called \u201cActs of God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>It was the theory of the railroad that there was absolute liability on defendant Tyler\u2019s part under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the dam was negligently constructed and maintained, and (independently thereof) that it was a nuisance, making it unnecessary for the railroad to prove Tyler\u2019s negligence, thus coming in full circle back to the theory upon which <em>Rylands </em>is based.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant, for his part, denied the applicability of the <em>Rylands </em>rule, under South Dakota law, to the facts at bar, denied his own negligence, asserted contributory negligence in the operation of the train, rejected the nuisance theory, and argued that an Act of God was solely responsible for the situation presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">The District Court denied the applicability of the <em>Rylands </em>rule upon plaintiff\u2019s motion for directed verdict, holding that although the South Dakota Supreme Court had considered the <em>Rylands </em>rule in two cases'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it had neither adopted nor rejected such rule and, in any event, that the <em>Rylands </em>rule urged by the railroad was \u201cnot applicable to the facts in this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">We agree. Although it has been said with respect to the English cases involving the <em>Rylands </em>rule that from such \u201cwelter of eases it is impossible to extract any consistent principle\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the American view has, according to a distinguished student, reached the position that the rule is applied \u201conly to the thing out of place, the abnormally dangerous condition or activity which is not a \u2018natural\u2019 one where it is.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the storage of water in an area of sparse rainfall was held, in Turner v. Big Lake Oil Co., 128 Tex. 155, 96 S.W.2d 221 (1936) to be \u201ca natural or necessary and common use of the land\u201d and we note, as well, the use of this concept by the South Dakota court in Midwest Oil Co. v. City of Aberdeen, <em>supra, </em>where, in denying absolute liability sought to be imposed upon the city as a result of a break in a water main, the court pointed out that \u201cWater mains are in universal use in cities.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly here. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>land owner did no more than construct a dam, normally empty, across a dry watercourse for erosion purposes. The record discloses that the construction of dams in this area for similar purposes is, if not a common practice, certainly not unusual. \u201cI am a soil conservation technician,\u201d testified one witness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cMy job is concerned with dams, drainage, irrigation dams, stock dams and the like, in Stanley and Hughes [site of the Tyler dam] counties. In the last few years we\u2019ve built about 10 or 12 dams, up to as high as 100 to 150 dams a year.\u201d Our review of the cases cited to us by both parties, as applied to the facts in the record before us, confirms the conclusion of the trial court that the <em>Rylands </em>rule as urged by the appellant, is not applicable hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s theory of nuisance is no more helpful to it. Plaintiff complains that the court erred in instructing the jury that the \u201cmaintenance or rebuilding of a dam across a natural drainway is not a nuisance which renders the owner absolutely or strictly liable and that liability depends upon negligence.\u201d Corollary thereto were additional instructions set out in the margin hereof.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">The term \u201cnuisance\u201d is a sort of legal grab bag.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It was Thayer<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> who said, with ample support, that \u201c \u2018Nuisance\u2019 is a good word to beg a question with. It is so comprehensive a term, and its content is so heterogeneous, that it scarcely does more than state a legal conclusion that for one or another of widely varying reasons the thing stigmatized as a nuisance violates the rights of others.\u201d We see no need to attempt the exploration of the ramifications of the various \u201ckinds\u201d of nuisance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Suffice for our purposes that what is being urged by the railroad is that facet of nuisance described by Mr. Justice Cardozo, among others, as \u201cabsolute nuisance,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the situation where one acts at one\u2019s peril, such as \u201cone who digs a hole in a highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>But the difficulty with the plaintiff railroad\u2019s attempt to impose under the \u201cabsolute nuisance\u201d doctrine the liability denied under the <em>Rylands </em>doctrine of \u201cabsolute liability\u201d is that both legal theories rest upon essentially the same doctrinal foundation. As we have seen, the absolute liability of <em>Rylands </em>rests upon an abnormal use in an inappropriate place. Similarly, it is clear that strict liability under the doctrine of absolute nuisance exists where an unnatural use of the land is made, involving an extreme hazard to the safety of the plaintiff in the use of his land. We are cited to no South Dakota cases as precedent but the principle is well illustrated by the Kansas case of Gilbert v. Davidson Const. Co., 110 Kan. 298, 203 P. 1113 (1922) wherein the defendant operated a rock crusher in the street close to plaintiff\u2019s home, resulting in injury to and destruction of plaintiff\u2019s household goods, clothing, and food. A jury verdict for damages was sustained on appeal, despite the lack of showing of negligence on defendant\u2019s part, defendant insisting that it was merely \u201can ordinary rock crusher, operated in the ordinary way, and with the appliances usually employed.\u201d In affirming, however, the court pointed out that from its location alone its operation constituted a nuisance and \u201cThe fact that the business itself is lawful, and the machine skillfully operated, did not give the defendant a right to put and use it in front of a residence where is [sic] necessarily would cause injury and loss.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The principle here involved was well expressed, with numerous citations of authority, in Prosser on Torts, 4th Ed. (1971) \u00a7 87: \u2014 \u201c [A] nuisance may arise where the defendant carries on in an inappropriate place an abnormally dangerous enterprise,\u201d where it \u201cnecessarily involves so great a risk to its surroundings that its location may be considered unreasonable, and a strict liability may be imposed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> From what we have pointed out heretofore with respect to abnormal use under the <em>Rylands </em>doctrine it is clear that there was no more justification upon these facts for the court\u2019s application of the absolute nuisance theory and the court did not err in the instruction given or in its denial of the requested instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">We find no error, under the facts before us, of the court\u2019s instruction on Acts of God. The instruction given followed substantially that in Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Henry Carlson Co., 165 N.W.2d 346 (1969) and correctly stated the South Dakota law applicable under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Under the view we have taken of the case, namely, that in consideration of the entire record, and the body of instructions taken as a whole, and in context, there was no error in the instructions given or refused, we find it unnecessary to discuss appellee\u2019s argument that, in any event, the jury\u2019s verdict might well have been grounded either upon the railroad\u2019s own negligence in the operation of the train, or its failure to prove that defendant\u2019s acts proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury in view of the unusual weather conditions existing on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Auet\">.

As presented to the trial court the rule suggested was phrased in the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">\u201cYour Honor, at this time the plaintiff moves the Court to direct the jury to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on tile issue of liability, reserving only the question of the amount of damages that might be awarded, for the reason and upon the grounds that in essence, the doctrine of the old case of Rylands v. Fletcher should here apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">In other words, that one who keeps upon his premises a dangerous instrumentality such as was involved in this case, in such location that it could, and apparently in all probability would, in some instances, get out of his control and cause damage, is absolutely liable therefor, and that he must so use his own property and instrumentalities as not to damage others, and that failing to do so, he becomes liable for all damages ensuing such failure, or in this instance, the breach of the dam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">Consonant therewith the plaintiff asserts error on the part of the court:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">\u201cIn Refusing to Instruct That One Who So Collects and Keeps on His Land Anything Likely to Do Mischief if It Escapes Does So at His Peril and Is Answerable for All Damage Which Is the Natural Consequence of Its Escape.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">.

The court was here commenting upon Section 520 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts, the Section accepting the principle of <em>Rylands </em>but limiting it to an \u201cultrahazardous activity\u201d of the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-20\">\u201cThe present facts disclose water being sent through a ten-inch main in the manner now generally accepted for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>pose of furnishing a water supply to city dwellers. We think it clear that such a distribution of water does not constitute an ultrahazardous activity. The definition of an ultrahazardous activity as set forth in Section 520 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">\u2018An activity is ultrahazardous if it (a) necessarily involves a risk of serious harm to the person, land or chattels of others which cannot be eliminated by the exercise of the utmost care, and (b) is not a matter of common usage.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Water mains are universally in use in cities, and to hold that a proper and reasonable use of such mains \u2018necessarily involves a risk of serious harm to the person, land or chattels of others\u2019 would be contrary to the experience of at least several generations.\u201d 10 N.W.2d at 701-702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">.
