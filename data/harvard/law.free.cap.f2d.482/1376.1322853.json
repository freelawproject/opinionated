Taylor complains that the government\u2019s evidence against him was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilty. We find no merit in this contention and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-27\"> The standard in this Circuit is that a guilty verdict \u201cmust be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>ment, to support the findings of guilt.\u201d United States v. Sherman, 421 F.2d 198, 199 (4 Cir. 1970). Contrary to Taylor\u2019s belief, it is also well settled in this Circuit that circumstantial \u201cevidence may support a verdict of guilty, even though it does not exclude every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence.\u201d United States v. Chappell, 353 F.2d 83, 84 (4 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Applying these standards, we cannot agree that the evidence, although circumstantial, was insufficient to sustain Taylor\u2019s conviction. An examination of the transcript of the trial indicates that there was substantial evidence from which the jury could have found that Taylor had possession of stolen money orders, knew that they were stolen and intended to convert them to his own use. We therefore find that this evidence established an evidentiary basis from which the jury could have concluded that the government had carried its burden of proof of all essential elements of the crime charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">Accordingly, we dispense with oral argument and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
