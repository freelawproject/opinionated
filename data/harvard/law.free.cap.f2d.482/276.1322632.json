The Supreme Court has, however, by its recent decision in Colgrove v. Battin, \u2014 U.S. -, 93 S.Ct. 2448, 37 L.Ed.2d 522 (1973) (filed June 21, 1973), resolved such doubts as to the propriety of a district court\u2019s unilateral reduction in the size of the 12-man jury, and plaintiff\u2019s challenge is thus foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Plaintiff also claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury were inadequate on the theory of strict liability, \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.
