Richardson, 440 F.2d 1144 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 985, 92 S.Ct. 443, 30 L.Ed.2d 369 (1971), and ultimately decided in Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 92 S.Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971). These cases concerned a due process attack upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a (1970), wherein Congress provided an offset against Social Security disability payments of the amount of any payments for disability then being made under a state workmen\u2019s compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-14\">In the instant case plaintiff Grant suffered the amputation of his arm in the course of his employment at the Lakey Foundry Corporation. The employer paid the sums provided by the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act <em>(see </em>M.S.A. 17.237 (361) (Cum.Supp. 1972)), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 418.361. This provision provides in part that the \u201cdisability . . . shall be deemed to continue for the period specified. arms, 269 weeks . . .\u201d (M.S.A. 17.-237(361) (i) (Cum.Supp.1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-17\">The administrative decision and that of the Hearing Examiner and the appeals council was that the payments provided for the loss of the arm must be offset against Social Security disability payments. On petition to review that decision before the District Judge, the Judge recognized that Richardson v. Belcher, <em>supra, </em>and Lofty v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>were controlling on the constitutional issue pertaining to due process, but held that Michigan case law, particularly Jones v. Cutler Oil Co., 356 Mich. 487, 97 N.W.2d 74 (1959), demonstrated that specific loss benefits under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation statute are not dependent upon actual (as opposed to presumed) disability, but really amount to arbitrarily determined amounts paid for the loss of a specific portion of the body. <em>See </em>Magreta v. Ambassador Steel Co., 378 Mich. 689, 148 N.W.2d 767 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">The decision of this court in <em>Lofty, supra, </em>and that of the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson, supra, </em>apply an arguably harsh result because it seemed obvious to the courts concerned that Congress intended the offset and that its legislative decision was well within its legislative powers. In this case the harshness of the Congressional enactment is even further illustrated. The loss is permanent and in the instance of this totally disabled plaintiff, it will not result in any benefit at all in excess of what he would have received (without Workmen\u2019s Compensation) from Social Security total disability benefits alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">The purpose of the offset amendment, as well as its method of operation, seems plain to us from the face of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap-5\">\u00a7 <em>424a. R\u00e9duction of disability benefits through receipt of workmen\u2019s compensation</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-6\">(a) If for any month prior to the month in which an individual attains the age of 62\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-7\">(1) such individual is entitled to benefits under section 423 of this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-8\">(2) such individual is entitled for such month; under a workmen\u2019s compensation law or plan of the United States or a State, to periodic benefits for a total or partial disability (whether or not permanent), and the Secretary has, in a prior month, received notice of such entitlement for such months,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-9\">the total of his benefits under section 423 of this title for such month and of any benefits under section 402 of this title for such month based on his wages and self-employment income shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-11\">(3) such total of benefits under sections 423 and 402 of this title for such month, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-12\">(4) such periodic benefits payable (and actually paid) for such month to such individual under the workmen\u2019s compensation law or plan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-13\">exceeds the higher of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-14\">(5) 80 percentum of his \u201caverage current earnings\u201d, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-15\">(6) the total of such individual\u2019s disability insurance benefits under section 423 of this title for such month and of any monthly insurance benefits under section 402 of this title for such month based on his wages and self-employment income, prior to reduction under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-16\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a. (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-17\">We note, of course, the District Judge\u2019s reliance upon state law holdings that under the Michigan Compensation law specific benefits are not dependent upon proof of incapacity for work. <em>See </em>Magreta v. Ambassador Steel Co., 378 Mich. 689, 696, 148 N.W.2d 767 (1967). This fact, however, does not serve to remove these benefits from the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation plan or to demonstrate any Congressional intent to exclude them under \u00a7 424a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-18\">Since the benefits for specific loss which are the subject of this dispute are provided for the months concerned \u201cunder a workmen\u2019s compensation law or plan ... of ... a State\u201d the offset mandated by the statute must be given effect. Richardson v. Belcher, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 84, 92 S.Ct. at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-19\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
