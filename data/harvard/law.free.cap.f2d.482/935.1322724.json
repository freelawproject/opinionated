We are in agreement with the District Judge that Appellant\u2019s challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault does not raise an issue cognizable in this federal habeas corpus proceeding. See 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2241. We also agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s question to Appellant during cross-examination concerning Appellant\u2019s refusal to answer questions posed by a detective was an isolated remark cured by the trial Judge and constituted harmless constitutional error in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented. See Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">We finally note that Appellant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments since he was not offered the benefit of or represented by counsel during his 1958 trial for aggravated assault which was mentioned before the jury during the course of his recent trial also presents an instance of harmless constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The order dismissing the petition for the writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
