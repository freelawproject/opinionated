Gillette, together with a facsimile signature of King C. Gillette, used on razors and razor blades, registered October 23, 1906, registration No. 56,921, renewed; and the word \u201cGillette,\u201d for use on safety razors and safety razor blades, registered August 24, 1920, registration No. 134,317. It was further alleged that the mark of appellant was confusingly similar to each of those of appellee, and that therefore appellee would be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">The case was submitted to the tribunals of the Patent Office upon an agreed statement of facts. It appears therefrom that the word \u201cGillette\u201d is the surname of appellant, Lewis W. Gillette; that appellant first used his alleged trade-mark on shaving cream on June 10, 1029; that his shaving cream is sold in collapsible soft-metal tubes \u201ccovered with alternate red, white and blue diagonal stripes except for two blue and one white panel\u201d; that the tubes containing the shaving cream are inclosed in rectangular pasteboard ear-tons marked substantially the same as the tubes; and that the name \u201c\u2018Gillette\u2019 is a common surname of persons living in various cities and is also geographical in that it is the name of several cities and/or towns in the United States.\u201d It further appears therefrom that appellee has been selling shaving sticks under the name \u201cGillette Shaving Stick,\u201d and under its trade-mark,-registration No. 70,758, since 1908; that it has sold large quantities' of those articles throughout the United States; that it has also sold large quantities of its other products, such as shaving brushes, safety razors, and safety razor blades, under its registered trade-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the marks were used on goods of the same descriptive properties; that they were confusingly similar; and that therefore appellant was not entitled to register his mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">It is conceded by counsel for appellant that the goods of the respective parties possess the same descriptive properties. He contends, however, \u201cthat every individual has the right to use his own name in connection with his business so long as it is a bona fide use of his name and so long as the use is such as to elearly designate origin of the goods with him and is not intended to deceive the public\u201d; and that appellant\u2019s mark is displayed in an arbitrary and faneiful way, and is entirely dissimilar to any of appellee\u2019s marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> Although the -name of an individual may be registered as a trade-mark, if it is \u201cwritten, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner,\u201d it nevertheless is not entitled to registration if it is identical with \u201ca registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties,\u201d or if it so nearly resembles \u201ca registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.\u201d Section 5 of the TradeMark Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85); J. B. Williams Co. v. Ernest W. Williams, 48 F.(2d) 398, 18 C. C. P. A. 1133; George H. Ruth Candy Co., Inc., v. Curtiss Candy Co., 49 F.(2d) 1033, 18 C. C. P. A. 1471.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">We are unable to agree with counsel for appellant that appellant\u2019s trade-mark, used, as it is, on goods of the same descriptive properties, is not confusingly similar to the trade-marks of appellee, which have been extensively used throughout the United States since long prior to the first use by appellant of his mark. The dominant feature of each of the involved marks is the word \u201cGillette,\u201d and it would seem to be obvious that, considering the marks as a whole, the use by appellant of his alleged trade-mark on shaving cream woufd be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the purchasing public as to the origin of his product.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The statute was intended to prevent, not to promote, confusion and deceit, and, in our opinion, the_ registration of appellant\u2019s mark would be in plain violation of its terms. We think the involved issues are controlled by our decisions in the cases of J. B. Williams Co. v. Ernest W. Williams, and George H. Ruth Candy Co., Inc., v. Curtiss Candy Co., supra. Nor does the fact that appellant has disclaimed the words \u201cGillette,\u201d \u201cshaving,\u201d and \u201ccream,\u201d apart from the mark as shown, alter the situation. Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Manufacturing Co., 58 F.(2d) 457, 19 C. C. P. A. 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">For the reasons stated, the decision o\u00a3 the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
