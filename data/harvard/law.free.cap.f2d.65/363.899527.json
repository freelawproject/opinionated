HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">Neyland sued the defendant at law in the state court for damages under section 51 of the New York Civil Rights Law (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 6), as amended by Laws 1921 e. 501, which forbids any one to use another\u2019s name or portrait for \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201cpurposes of trade.\u201d The defendant removed the cause to the federal court and the action was tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence the judge took a special verdict on a limited issue of fact, and directed a general verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. The facts, which were undisputed except as found by the special verdict, were as follows: Neyland was a painter of reputation, especially of ships. One of his paintings was of a whaling brig, under sail in a snowstorm, full and by, which he signed, and which became known as \u201cThe Huntress of the North.\u201d This was photographically reproduced, without the signature, by a magazine, known as \u201cArts and Decoration,\u201d which used it, along with others of Neyland\u2019s paintings, in a copyrighted article describing his work, and of course using his name. To all this he consented, though not in writing, and of it he does not complain. The defendant published magazines of various sorts, among others one known as \u201cThe Ladies Home Journal.\u201d In an issue of this appeared several maritime designs for embroidered sofa and pillow cushions, among which was a very crude reproduction taken from \u201cArts and Decoration,\u201d of Neyland\u2019s painting of the brig, with the snow left out and a rough circle in the sky for the moon. At one side appeared this legend: \u201cThe O. W. Morgan,- on the pillow to the left, comes straight from the painting by Harry Neyland.\u201d In the text was the following: \u201cIn the C. W. Morgan, the square-rigged bark\u201d (sic) \u201cat top of page, vertical long and short stitches are used for foremast and mainsails, and long, slanting satin stitches for jibs. Spars, masts, top of hull and white-caps are in satin stitch; lower part and sides of hull, jib-boom, rugging waves and moon are outlined.\u201d At the bottom of the page appeared the following: \u201cPatterns may be secured from stores selling \u2018Ladies Home Journal,\u2019 or by mail from Home Pattern Co., 18 East 18th St., N. Y. C. Boats Transfers 25 cents; Dresses 45 cents.\u201d The other defendant, Home Pattern Company, made patterns corresponding to those appearing in the Ladies Home Journal, which were kept on sale at various places for the benefit of readers of that magazine at the priees stated above. Among these was the pattern of Ney-land\u2019s painting, though it does not definitely appear whether any were sold. The action was first, for infringement of Neyland\u2019s right of artistic property in the painting, and, second, for the use of his name under section 51 of the N. Y. Civil Rights Law (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 6), as amended by Laws 1921, e. 501 which is copied in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon the ar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>gumen't and in <em>the </em>brief the appellant does not press the cause of action for infringement of bis artistie property, and we do not understand that it is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Upon the second cause of action two questions arise; first, whether the defendant used Neyland\u2019s name \u201cfor purposes of trade\u201d; second, if so, whether that use was excused by the last sentence of section 51. As to the first, we shall assume without deciding that merely to publish a reproduction of the painting, coupled with Neyland\u2019s name, would not violate the right conferred by section 51, though it might be an infringement of his artistic property. However, to sell patterns of his \u201cpainting was plainly \u201ctrade,\u201d and if his name was used to further sueh sales, that use was either \u201cadvertising\u201d or an incident to \u201ctrade\u201d in the patterns. To escape the defendant must bring itself within the excuse, granted upon the statute by the amendment of 1921 (Laws 1921, c. 501); that is, the passage in the last sentence, following the semicolon.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The pertinent words are these: \u201cNothing contained in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any person * * * from using the name * * * of any * * * artist in connection with his * * * artistie productions which he has sold or disposed of with sueh name * * * used in connection therewith.\u201d The second condition was fulfilled; Neyland used his name \u201cin connection\u201d with the painting, for he signed it. We may assume that if he had sold it, the purchaser, and those who succeeded him, could have advertised it as a genuine Neyland and sold it as such, or made copies of it and similarly sold these. Had Neyland wished to preserve his anonymity, he must have abstained from affixing his name to his \u201cproduction\u201d; that at least was a use of it \u201cin connection therewith.\u201d No doubt there are other sufficient uses; for example, he might \u2022 have tried to enhance its sale <em>value </em>by its attribution to himself. But the other condition does not seem to us to have been met; he had not \u201csold,\u201d and he had not \u201cdisposed of\u201d the painting. To construe that phrase we <em>look </em>to what just precedes in the amendment, which refers to a \u201cmanufacturer or dealer,\u201d and to the \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise manufactured, produced or dealt in by him.\u201d An implied license arises to use the name to sell the goods, if they have been \u201csold or disposed of,\u201d and if the name has been previously \u201cused in connection\u201d with <em>them </em>by the maker. In such cases the meaning is plainer; it is that when a man labels his wares with his name, or has used it to sell them, the buyer and the buyer\u2019s buyers may sell them as the maker\u2019s, and otherwise make use of the name to trade in them. Steinway may not object that his pianos are sold and advertised as Steinways; Gillette, that the( wrapping bears his unforgettable effigy; Ford, that his cars are called by that momentous name. Just how far the maker need associate his name with the sale we need not say; \u201ctherewith\u201d may be more extensive than \u201cwith the sale or disposition thereof.\u201d But the critical point is that the licensee is the buyer, or the person to whom the goods are otherwise disposed of; and their successors, at least in possession; if one would get leave without coming within either class, it must be written.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Similarly of \u201cliterary, musical or artistic\u201d property. To exist at all, sueh property must be incorporated in a chattel, and the situations become parallel. The license goes to the person to whom the chattel is \u201csold or disposed of,\u201d and to those who succeed him. It is an incident, if not of title to, at least of possession of, the \u201cproduction\u201d itself. The man who gets a book written under the author\u2019s name, or a musical score, or a painting or statue or design, to which he has attached his name, directly or not, may sell it by that name; we may assume that he may reproduce it and sell the copies as the author\u2019s. But one who merely copies it, even with leave, does not obtain the \u201cproduction\u201d; he is indeed free to nse the name except for \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201ctrade,\u201d bnt those uses he must eschew. The author who allows him to copy it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>does not license him to hawk his name; to do that he must get the chattel, or a written consent. Such appears to us to be the import of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Possibly it is not necessary to go so far. Even were oral consent enough, Neyland gave none to the defendant; at most he allowed \u201cArts and Deeoration\u201d to use his name in the magazine. That license did not cover the defendant; indeed it did not include \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201ctrade\u201d at all, even though the magazine was sold for money. The statute does not prohibit publication of a man\u2019s doings, whatever they may be. D\u2019Altomonte v. N. Y. Herald Co., 208 N. Y. 596, 102 N. E. 1101. He must look to the law of libel. But the defendant\u2019s use was within the statute, not being so confined. However, we prefer to rest our decision on the first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judgment reversed; new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-21\"> \u201c\u00a7 51. <em>Action for injunction and for </em>damages.\u2014 Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>within this state for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without the written consent first obtained as above provided may maintain an equitable action in the supreme court of this state against the person, firm or corporation so using his name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof; and may also sue and recover damages for any injuries sustained hy reason of such use and if the defendant shall have knowingly used such person's name, portrait or picture in such manner as is forbidden or declared to be unlawful by the last section, the jury, in its discretion, may award exemplary damages.
