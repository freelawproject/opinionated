We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Carrera-Reyes contends that the district court erred when it increased his base offense level by 16 points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A) (1998) because the prior conviction was not charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He further contends that <em>Apprendi </em>overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). CarreraReyes\u2019 contentions lack merit in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>our recent decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We review de novo the legality of a sentence and the purely legal question of whether <em>Apprendi </em>requires that CarreraReyes be resentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 412-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains precedential law, the district court did not err by considering the prior aggravated felony convictions in sentencing Carrera-Reyes for illegal reentry without proof of the prior aggravated felony beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 414 (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>carved out an exception for prior convictions, specifically preserving the holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Additionally, Carrera-Reyes\u2019 contention that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>requires that he admit guilt of the prior aggravated felony at the change of plea hearing is without merit because <em>\u201cApprendi </em>held that all prior convictions-not just those admitted on the record \u2014 [are] exempt from <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>general rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-24\">.
