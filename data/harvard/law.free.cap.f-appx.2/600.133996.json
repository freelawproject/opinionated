Specifically, he argues that the Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), violates his right to equal protection by allowing nonpermanent residents convicted of aggravated felonies to apply for waiver relief and not allowing permanent residents the same opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">Mr. Marquez-Perez is not entitled to consideration under section 1182(h) on account of his undisputed cocaine conviction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (alien convicted of violation of controlled-substance law is inadmissible), (h) (Attorney General has discretion to waive application of, inter alia, \u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i) (II) relating to \u201csingle offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana\u201d). Therefore, we will not consider his argument any further. <em>See Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat\u2019l Union, </em>442 U.S. 289, 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>no case or controversy exists when allegedly unconstitutional situation is \u201chypothetical or abstract\u201d; plaintiff must show realistic danger of direct injury due to statute\u2019s operation or enforcement); <em>Missouri ex rel. Mo. Highway and Transp. Comm\u2019n v. Cuffley, </em>112 F.3d 1332, 1337 (8th Cir.1997) (court may not render opinion advising what law would be on hypothetical set of facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
