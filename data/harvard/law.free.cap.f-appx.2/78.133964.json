Patterson, Jr., <em>Judge) </em>issued in the exercise of the district court\u2019s ancillary jurisdiction. These six related judgments and orders included the adjudication of legal fees owed to Proskauer Rose LLP (\u201cProskauer\u201d) growing out of its representation of Galaxiworld in <em>Silva Run Worldwide Ltd. v. Gaming Lottery Corp., </em>no. 96 Civ. 3231, 2000 WL 502864 <em>(\u201cSilva Run </em>\u201d), and <em>In re Gaming Lottery Securities Litigation, </em>no. 96 Civ. 5567, 2000 WL 702978 <em>(\u201cIn re Gaming\u201d). </em>Galaxiworld and Banks filed several appeals relating to the adjudication of Proskauer\u2019s fees: in <em>In re Gaming, </em>Galaxiworld and Banks appealed from the January 26, 2000 order and judgment for $569,536.48, the March 6, 2000 amended judgment for $654,412.58, the April 24, 2000 order identifying Proskauer\u2019s claim as plenary and severable, and the May 3, 2000 second amended judgment for $654,412.58. In <em>Silva Run, </em>Galaxiworld, but not Banks, appealed from the March 6, 2000 judgment for $10,731.72, and the April 27, 2000 revised opinion and order denying its motion to vacate paragraph (4) of the March 6, 2000 order. Appellants treat the six appeals as a unit that raise three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Appellants assert that the district court erred when it entered a money judgment in favor of Proskauer Rose. Appellants also claim that the district court erred when it ordered Jack Banks, president of Galaxiworld, to \u201ccause\u201d Galaxiworld to pay its debts. Lastly, appellants argue that the district court erred when it conditioned appellants\u2019 ability to move forward with its cross-claims and counterclaims in <em>Silva Run </em>on payment of an outstanding judgment from <em>In re Gaming.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">As for the first two arguments made by appellants, we affirm for substantially the same reasons as stated in the district court\u2019s revised opinion and order of April 27, 2000. <em>See Silva Run Worldwide Ltd. v. Gaming Lottery Corp., </em>2000 WL 502864 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it conditioned Galaxiworld\u2019s ability to move forward with claims in <em>Silva Run </em>on payment of fees owed in <em>In re Gaming. </em>This Court has held \u201cthat the district court has a responsibility to protect its own officers in such matters as fee disputes.\u201d <em>Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. Russian Kurier, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 442, 444 (2d Cir.1998) (citations omitted) <em>{Pollack, </em>Winter, Meskill). In addition, this Court has held that \u201ca federal district court may condition the substitution of attorneys in litigation pending before it upon the client\u2019s either paying the attorney or posting security for the attorney\u2019s reasonable fees and disbursements.\u201d <em>National Equip. Rental Ltd. v. Mercury Typesetting Co., </em>323 F.2d 784, 786 (2d Cir.1963) <em>(Lumbard, </em>Friendly, Smith). The practical effect of the language in <em>National Equipment Rental, </em>in the context of a corporation, is to prevent the corporation from proceeding with its litigation until it pays the fees owed to the outgoing attorney. The language in paragraph four of Judge Patterson\u2019s March 6, 2000 order comports with the law as stated in <em>National Equipment Rental </em>because its practical effect is the same. Therefore, Judge Patterson\u2019s decision to halt Galaxiworld\u2019s ability to progress in an effort to make sure that Proskauer was paid is consistent with the law of this Court as explained in <em>National Equipment Rental </em>and <em>Itar-Tass Russian News Agency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
