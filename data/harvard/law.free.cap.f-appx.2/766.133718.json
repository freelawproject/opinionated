The attached disposition will be filed forthwith in its stead. Judge Fernandez would adhere to the previous disposition and, therefore, dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">Appellant\u2019s petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-24\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-25\">Washington state prisoner Dan Hart appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Duhaime v. Ducharme, </em>200 F.3d 597, 600 (9th Cir.2000), and vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability on the sole issue of whether Hart\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. Subsequently, in <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), the Supreme Court expressly set forth the factors to consider in determining whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel when no notice of appeal was filed on his behalf. <em>See id. </em>at 1035-38 (concluding that the district court must determine whether counsel failed to follow the defendant\u2019s express instructions concerning an appeal, whether counsel consulted or reasonably chose not to consult with the defendant regarding an appeal, and whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant would have timely appealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Because the district court\u2019s findings in this case do not address these particular criteria and the record is insufficient to allow us to do so, we vacate the denial of Hart\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as to this claim only and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Roe. See id. </em>at 1040.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-27\">.
