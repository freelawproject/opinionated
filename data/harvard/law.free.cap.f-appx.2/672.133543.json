Underwood appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion to depart downward based on the effect his incarceration would have on his two minor children. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">At sentencing, Underwood presented testimony that he had been awarded custody of the two children following his divorce from their mother, he was highly involved in them lives, and the children\u2019s mother did not visit the children regularly, had inflicted corporal punishment on them, and had \u201can uncontrollable temper.\u201d Noting that \u201cthe Guidelines expressly forbid\u201d consideration of family circumstances, the district court denied Underwood\u2019s motion to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from the Guidelines. When a district court believes it lacks power to exercise discretion, however, we have \u201cjurisdiction either to confirm or reject the sentencing court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Evidente, </em>894 F.2d 1000, 1005 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 922, 110 S.Ct. 1956, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>L.Ed.2d 318 (1990). Given the district court\u2019s references to being forbidden from departing, we conclude that the court believed it lacked authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">While the Guidelines do not altogether forbid departure based on family circumstances, the Commission has instructed in its policy statements that \u201c[flamily ties and responsibilities and community ties are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5H1.6, p.s. After carefully reviewing the record, we are convinced that the circumstances here would not support a downward departure because Underwood has not presented the type of exceptional family circumstances that would make his case different from the ordinary circumstances facing a family in which a parent is about to be incarcerated. <em>See United States v. Koon, </em>518 U.S. 81, 96, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>United States v. Kapitzke, </em>130 F.3d 820, 822 (8th Cir.1997) (reversing downward departure to defendant who argued his incarceration would place financial burden on wife to support their children and would cause wife to divorce him; defendant did not show his family\u2019s circumstances were substantially different from those facing family of any other defendant about to be incarcerated); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>970 F.2d 444, 447-48 (8th Cir.1992) (downward departure not permissible even though defendant\u2019s incarceration would result in her grandchild, whom she had adopted and for whom she alone had been caring, being put in custody of defendant\u2019s adult daughter who allegedly abused drugs and alcohol).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of .the district court. We also grant the government\u2019s motion to strike the supplemental appendix, and we deny Underwood\u2019s pending pro se motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\">.
