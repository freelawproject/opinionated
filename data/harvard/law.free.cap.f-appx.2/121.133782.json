R.Civ.P. 12(c) their claims alleging principally that defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>by failing to make contractually required payments to the funds, and (b) awarded defendants $18,524 in attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">We affirm the dismissal substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Rakoff s Memorandum Order dated September 27, 1996 (\u201cMerits Order\u201d), which found it unclear that defendant PCM Development Company (\u201cPCM\u201d) was an employer within the meaning of ERISA, and ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in any event, the agreement signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>by PCM did not, under ERISA, obligate it to make contributions to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We reverse, however, so much of the judgment as awards attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants pursuant to ERISA. First, a party who succeeds in defeating a claim that ERISA is applicable is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA for defending that claim. <em>See Trans World, Airlines, Inc. v. Sinicropi, </em>84 F.3d 116, 116 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>affirming 887 </em>F.Supp. 595, 617 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (denying award of fees requested pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g)(1) where the \u201caction d[id] not arise under ERISA. Defendants prevailed because of the [Railway Labor Act], and the rights provided by ERISA had no bearing on this case.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 949, 117 S.Ct. 360, 136 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Second, even if \u00a7 1132(g)(1), which gives the court discretion to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to either party in an ERISA action, were applicable, we would conclude that an award in favor of defendants here was inappropriate. The factors to be taken into account in determining how to exercise that discretion are generally</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201c(1) the degree of the offending party\u2019s culpability or bad faith, (2) the ability of the offending party to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees, (3) whether an award of fees would deter other persons from acting similarly under like circumstances, (4) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions, and (5) whether the action conferred a common benefit on a group of pension plan participants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUh\"><em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>222 F.3d 19, 27-28 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Chambless v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan, </em>815 F.2d 869, 871 (2d Cir.1987) <em>(\u201cChambless\u201d)). </em>These factors are applicable regardless of which party seeks attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>222 F.3d at 28; <em>Anita Foundations, Inc. v. ILGWU National Retirement Fund, </em>902 F.2d 185, 188-89 (2d Cir.1990) (upholding a fee award to defendants where, <em>inter alia, </em>the plaintiffs \u201cdid not demonstrate a colorable legal position\u201d and their suit \u201cwas in direct contravention of settlement agreements that were several years old\u201d); but, given that this test is designed to further \u201cERISA\u2019s essential remedial purpose [of] protecting] beneficiaries of pension plans,\u201d <em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>222 F.3d at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted), application of the <em>Chambless </em>factors \u201cvery frequently suggests] that attorney\u2019s fees should not be charged against ERISA plaintiffs,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Application of most of these factors to the present controversy requires the denial of a fee award to defendants. For example, in ruling on the fee application, Judge Jones \u201cf[ou]nd no bad faith on the part of the plaintiffs.\u201d Order Adopting Report and Recommendation, dated May 8, 2000 (\u201cFee Order\u201d), at 2. Further, for many of the reasons discussed in <em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>which was decided several months after the fee award in this case, other factors likewise militated against an award of fees to these defendants. For example, although the district court here stated that the Trustees had \u201ca higher degree of culpability than defendants,\u201d Fee Order at 2, we noted in <em>Salovaara</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">that the culpability of a losing plaintiff significantly differs from that of a losing . defendant: A losing defendant must have violated ERISA, thereby depriving plaintiffs of rights under a pension plan and violating a Congressional mandate. A losing plaintiff, on the other hand, will not necessarily be found \u201cculpable,\u201d but may be only in error or unable to prove his case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">222 F.3d at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also id. </em>at 30 (reversing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ERISA fee award to the defendant where the ERISA claims asserted by the plaintiff \u201cwere not entirely devoid of merit,\u201d and noting that the plaintiff-had prevailed in a state-court action that was related to his unsuccessful ERISA suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In the present case, while the Trustees failed to prove a claim under ERISA, we cannot uphold the finding that they were more \u201cculpable\u201d than the defendants. There seems to be no dispute that in January 1992, the defendant subcontractor was four months delinquent in making required contributions to the various employee benefits funds in connection with the project in question; that, as a consequence, the local union balked at continuing to supply electricians for the project; that the Trustees then entered into a multi-party contract in which the union agreed to supply the necessary electricians, the subcontractor acknowledged its obligation to make contributions to the funds, and PCM, the developer, agreed to make its payments to the subcontractor in the form of checks payable jointly to the subcontractor and the Trustees; and that PCM thereafter failed to include the Trustees as payees on those checks. In bringing the present action, the Trustees were clearly seeking to recover moneys owed to the funds, and they invoked ERISA on the theory that PCM\u2019s entering into the agreement requiring that its checks to the subcontractor list the Trustees among the payees brought PCM within ERISA\u2019s definition of an employer and in effect obligated it to make the contributions. The Trustees argued that that view was warranted by the statutory definition and an opinion of this Court, both of which state that the term \u201cemployer\u201d includes an entity acting \u201cindirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee benefit plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(5).\u201d <em>Greenblatt v. Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>68 F.3d 561, 575 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that a surety was not an employer). While we agree with the district court\u2019s ruling in the Merits Order that PCM\u2019s agreement to list both the subcontractor and the Trustees as payees did not obligate PCM to make contributions, and hence there was no cause of action under ERISA, the Trustees\u2019 position \u201cw[as] supported by ... good faith arguments to extend, modify, or reverse the law of this Circuit,\u201d <em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>222 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks omitted), and their reading of the statute was neither \u201cfrivolous\u201d nor \u201centirely devoid of merit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In its Fee Order in the present case, the district court found that the Trustees had \u201ca higher degree of culpability than defendants\u201d based on findings that \u201cthe plaintiffs permitted unpaid ERISA benefit fund contributions to accumulate,\u201d that the joint-payee agreement they entered into did not in fact secure payment and was ineffective to create liability under ERISA, and that they litigated their ERISA claims until the defendants moved to dismiss. Fee Order at 2. It is, however, incompatible with the <em>Chambless </em>test \u2014 and with ERISA\u2019s essential purpose of protecting plan beneficiaries \u2014 to conclude that, because the Trustees\u2019s efforts to collect unpaid employee benefit fund contributions were ineffective to secure payment or to create liability under ERISA, the Trustees were more culpable than the persons who breached their contractual obligations to make or facilitate those contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">At oral argument of this appeal, defendants argued that, rather than asserting claims under ERISA, the Trustees should have brought an action in state court for breach of contract. We cannot accept the view that plan fiduciaries should be deemed more culpable than delinquent or breaching defendants merely because the fiduciaries\u2019 attempt to recover moneys to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>which the funds appear to be entitled was pursued under the wrong legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In addition, the district court\u2019s view that the fifth <em>Chambless </em>factor favored an award of fees \u201cbecause no common benefit to a group of pension plan participants occurred,\u201d Fee Opinion at 3, was erroneous. The lack of a common benefit is a reason to deny fees, not a reason to award them. Given ERISA\u2019s essential purpose of protecting plan beneficiaries, plan fiduciaries should not be discouraged \u201cfrom bringing suits in good faith,\u201d <em>Salovaara v. Eckert, </em>222 F.3d at 31 (\u201cCongress intended the fee provisions of ERISA to encourage beneficiaries to assert their rights without fear of being responsible for the fees and costs of their opponent\u2019s attorneys if they failed to prevail.!] This consideration is even more significant in a case such as this, where the plaintiff is a fiduciary under ERISA.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also id. </em>(where the plaintiffs are ERISA fiduciaries and \u201cha[ve] pursued a colorable (albeit unsuccessful) claim, the third <em>Chambless </em>factor <em>[ie., </em>deterrence] ... weighs strongly <em>against </em>granting fees to the prevailing defendant\u201d (emphasis in original)). The district court noted in the present case that the fee award would have little deterrent effect on the Trustees themselves because the award would be paid out of the benefit funds. Thus, far from conferring a common benefit or protecting fund beneficiaries, the award of fees here would decrease the common fund in order to pay fees to parties who apparently ignored their contractual obligations to make or facilitate contributions to the funds. In all the circumstances, we conclude that an award of fees to these defendants pursuant to \u00a7 1132(g)(1), was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We have considered all of the parties\u2019 contentions on this appeal, including plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 <em>et seq., </em>and, except to the extent indicated above, have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed insofar as it dismissed the action, and is reversed insofar as it awarded defendants attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
