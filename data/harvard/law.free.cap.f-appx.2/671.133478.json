Ms. White claims the Court erred in imposing sentence under 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) rather than \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Ms. White argues that drug quantities triggering \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) are elements of the statutory offense because this provision imposes a mandatory minimum sentence. Therefore, she says, the indictment must have specified drug quantity and the government must have proved that quantity to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the quantity of methamphetamine involved in the charge here was not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury, she argues that she should have been sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which has no mandatory minimum. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We have held that where a defendant is sentenced within the statutory range of the basic crime for which she was convicted, drug quantity does not have to appear in the indictment or be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). Here, Ms. White\u2019s sentence of 60 months (5 years) imprisonment is within the statutory range of 0 to 20 years provided by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which does not reference a specific drug quantity for methamphetamine. Thus, there was no error in Ms. White\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-26\">. The Hon. Andrew W. Bogue, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
