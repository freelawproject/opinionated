Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s conduct of voir dire, which we review for abuse of discretion. Un<em>ited States v. Padilla Mendoza, </em>157 F.3d 730, 733 (9th Cir.1998). Specifically, Defendant argues that the court should have submitted to the jury panel his proposed questionnaire and that the court should have asked the jurors about the appropriateness of using a deadly weapon in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-25\">Although the court declined to use the proposed questionnaire, the court did agree to ask appropriate questions contained in it. The court then conducted voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>dire. After that the court asked counsel whether any questions that should be asked had been overlooked. Defense counsel requested inquiries in four more areas. The court agreed to ask all but the last of those questions, the one that concerned the use of weapons in self-defense. As to that question the court said that it was \u201ctoo complicated under the facts and the iaw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The voir dire that the court conducted was \u201creasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias or partiality.\u201d <em>Paine v. City of Lompoc, </em>160 F.3d 562, 564-65 (9th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). So long as the court\u2019s voir dire is adequate, rejection of a defendant\u2019s specific proposed questions is not error. <em>United States v. Giese, </em>597 F.2d 1170, 1182-83 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The defense of self-defense is not in one of the categories as to which the possibility of jurors\u2019 prejudice is so high that specific questioning is required. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>722 F.2d 528, 529-30 (9th Cir.1983) (listing categories and holding that the defense of coercion, like self-defense, does not fall within them). Defendant\u2019s theory of potential prejudice is speculative. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b920-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
