Davage also asks that the district court judge recuse himself from any of Davage\u2019s future actions. Because Davage appears dissatisfied merely with the judge\u2019s rulings in his cases and has not established any extrajudicial bias, recusal is not warranted. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1987) (holding that nature of alleged bias must be personal and not arising out of litigation). Finally, we decline to vacate the judge\u2019s prior orders because Davage appealed from those rulings, and we upheld them on appeal. <em>See In re United Steelworkers of Am., </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979) (noting that mandamus may not be used as substitute for appeal). Although we grant Davage leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
