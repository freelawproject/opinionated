Thirty-four days following entry of final judgment, Wells moved the district court for an extension of time to file an appeal. She was therefore required to provide notice of her motion to the opposing parties. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(B). Because she failed to do so, the district court lacked authority to grant the motion and Wells\u2019s ensuing notice of appeal was untimely. <em>See Hable v. Pairolero, </em>915 F.2d 394, 394-95 (8th Cir.1990) (district court lacked jurisdiction to order extension where party filed motion more than 30 days after judgment and failed to notify opposing parties; filing requirements for appeals are mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
