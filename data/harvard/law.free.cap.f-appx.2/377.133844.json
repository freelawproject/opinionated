The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, and Freyesleben appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-27\">We agree with the district court that the facts as asserted by Freyesleben do not support the claim that his constitutionally protected right of association was violated. The association in question clearly was not one of an intimate and thus protected nature, <em>see Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 619, 104 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984); nor was the association for an expressive purpose protected by the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 622. Contrary to Freyesleben's assertion in his reply brief, the Constitution does not recognize a general right of social association. <em>See City of Dallas v. Stanglin, </em>490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989). The freedom of belief Freyesleben asserts is essentially his belief that his conduct was appropriate. This assertion entitles him to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We grant Freyesleben\u2019s motions to file a supplemental appendix and to file additional materials. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
