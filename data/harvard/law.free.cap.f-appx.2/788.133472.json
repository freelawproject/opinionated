Norman appeals pro se the district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to comply with a court order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-23\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). <em>See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-24\">The district court adequately explained the deficiencies in Norman\u2019s complaint, afforded him time to amend, and explicitly warned him that failure to amend would result in dismissal. <em>See id. </em>at 1261-62. Because Norman failed to amend his complaint, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his action with prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 1260-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-25\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to comply with a court order, Norman may not challenge the district court\u2019s interlocutory order setting aside the entry of default. <em>See Al-Torki v. Kaempen, </em>78 F.3d 1381, 1386 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Because Norman\u2019s claim of bias and prejudice was based solely on the district court\u2019s prior adverse rulings, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for recusal. <em>See Taylor v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., </em>993 F.2d 710, 712-13 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-26\">.
