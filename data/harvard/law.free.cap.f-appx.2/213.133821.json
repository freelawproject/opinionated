Fronczak appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Richard J. Arcara, <em>Judge) </em>granting summary judgment for defendant-appellee New York State Department of Correctional Services (\u201cDOCS\u201d) with respect to Fronczak\u2019s claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112-12117, and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for retaliatory adverse employment actions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In 1993, Fronczak was a correctional officer employed by DOCS at the Wyoming Correctional Facility (\u201cthe facility\u201d). He became critical of the facility\u2019s handling of hazardous waste materials and filed several grievances concerning the matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also began \u201cexhibiting both bizarre and threatening behavior.\u201d On or about March 15, 1993, DOCS Assistant Personnel Administrator Terry Baxter requested that Fronczak undergo a psychiatric examination to determine his ability to perform the duties of his job. Doctors Jeffrey Bernstein and Richard Ciulla examined Fronczak for the Employee Health Service (\u201cEHS\u201d) on March 29, 1993. During Dr. Bernstein\u2019s examination, Fronczak \u201creadily aeknowledge[d]\u201d that he had engaged in such behavior as \u201chaving loud conversations with himself, slamming doors, punching walls, and throwing things at work.\u201d Dr. Bernstein determined that Fronczak was \u201cin need of psychiatric care.\u201d And he concluded that \u201c[Fronczak] was a risk for not being able to manage the inmates, possibly even losing control, further control of his emotions and his temper, and having difficulty working with co-workers .... [t]hat he was unable from a psychiatric perspective to continue his duties as a corrections officer.\u201d On April 1, 1993, Fronczak was informed of this determination, and he was placed on an involuntary leave of absence. Fronczak unsuccessfully appealed the determination to the Civil Service Commission. At an administrative hearing held in conjunction with that appeal, Fronczak, according to the hearing officer\u2019s report, again did not deny the alleged behaviors.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">In 1996, Fronczak requested a reevaluation and consideration for a return to active duty employment with DOCS. Three EHS doctors examined Fronczak and found that, despite some idiosyncratic behavior, he was fit to perform the duties of a corrections officer. .Pursuant to a DOCS policy applicable to individuals absent from active employment for over one year, Fronczak was required to undergo seven weeks of retraining prior to resuming active employment. On August 18, 1996, shortly after Fronczak arrived for retraining at the DOCS academy, he had an altercation with an instructor. In response to Fronczak\u2019s refusal to hem his pants, the instructor told him that he was free to leave if he did not want to follow the rules of the academy. Fronczak responded with profanity, gathered his belongings, and departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">A few days later, DOCS sent Fronczak a letter warning him that an absence of ten days would be considered, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, a constructive resignation. Eleven days after he left the academy, Fronczak contacted DOCS regarding the letter, and he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>duly informed of its meaning. A few days later, DOCS notified Fronczak by mail that his ten-day absence had been construed as a constructive resignation, and that his employment with DOCS was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">After pursuing state administrative remedies through the Civil Service Commission and federal administrative remedies through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), Fronczak filed suit in the district court. A liberal reading of his complaint reveals the following alleged causes of action: (1) by placing Fronczak on involuntary leave in 1993 and terminating him in 1996, DOCS retaliated against Fronczak\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for his complaints concerning its waste management; (2) the same 1993 involuntary leave and 1996 termination resulted from discrimination on the basis of a perceived mental disability in violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott, and DOCS moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge found that Fronczak failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that he had been discharged either as the result of discrimination on the basis of a perceived disability or of retaliation. Rather, the judge concluded, \u201c[t]he undisputed record reflects that ... plaintiff was discharged because he failed to show up for work.\u201d Finding evidence of neither discrimination on the basis of a perceived mental disability nor retaliation for Fronczak\u2019s waste complaints, the magistrate judge recommended granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the suit. That court also noted that Fronczak produced no evidence in the record of any New York State Supreme Court action regarding the facility\u2019s handling of waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Fronczak appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Holt v. KMI-Continental, Inc., </em>95 F.3d 123, 128-29 (2d Cir. 1996). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">In order to state a claim of retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights, plaintiff must demonstrate: \u201c[1] that the speech at issue was protected, [2] that he suffered an adverse employment action, and [3] that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>See Diesel v. Town of Lewisboro, </em>232 F.3d 92, 107 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original). In light of Fronczak\u2019s admission of bizarre and threatening behavior, there is no genuine factual dispute regarding his incapacity to perform the duties of a correctional officer in 1993. As a result, there is no evidence of a causal connection between Fronczak\u2019s hazardous waste complaints and his placement on involuntary leave at that time. Moreover, as to the 1996 termination, we agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that there is no evidence that Fronczak was discharged for any reason other than his ten-day absence from the training academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">In assessing ADA claims, we apply the familiar burden-shifting analysis set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny. <em>See Heyman v. Queens Village Comm. for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Mental Health, </em>198 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1999). Under that framework, a plaintiff must satisfy the minimal burden of making out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination; the burden then shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions; and the final burden rests on the plaintiff to prove that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual and that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the ADA, plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability.\u201d <em>Id, </em>One definition of \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA is \u201cbeing regarded as having ... an impairment\u201d that \u201csubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(C); <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\u00a9 (defining major life activities as \u201cfunctions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">At the moment, states are subject to the ADA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so Fronczak has established the first element of a <em>prima facie </em>claim as to both the 1993 involuntary leave and the 1996 termination. Because, however, there is no evidence that Fronczak\u2019s 1996 termination was for any reason other than his absence from the training program, plaintiff has not fulfilled his initial burden as to that employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The 1993 involuntary leave requires somewhat more extended discussion. As to the second element \u2014 that Fronczak was disabled within the definition of the ADA \u2014 the inability to perform a particular job or class of jobs does not qualify as a substantial limitation on the major life activity of work. <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 491-92, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). DOCS\u2019 determination that Fronczak was \u201cunable to perform the essential duties of a Correction Officer\u201d indicates that it considered him unfit for only that particular job and hence does not meet the ADA standard. Moreover, even if we allow that DOCS\u2019 recognition that Fronczak required psychiatric care might indicate a perception that he was disabled within the definition of the ADA, Fronczak did not establish the final two elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case. The \u201cbizarre and threatening behavior\u201d that he concedes he exhibited is inappropriate in a corrections officer- \u2014 one responsible for the safety and well-being of inmates. By his acknowledgment of such behavior, Fronczak is unable to demonstrate that he was \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d to perform the duties of a corrections officer or that he was placed on leave as a result of an ADA disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">In any event, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Fronczak has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the basis of a perceived mental disability in 1993, DOCS has come forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation for placing him on involuntary leave at that time, namely that he was not capable of performing the essential job duties of a corrections officer. And Fronczak has not presented any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>dence, in reply, indicating that DOCS\u2019 proffered explanation was a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We have considered all of Fronczak\u2019s claims and find them without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. Fronczak also claims that he filed suit in the New York State Supreme Court complaining of DOCS\u2019 handling of hazardous wastes. There is no evidence in the record, however, of such a suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in a case that raises the issue of whether the ADA is a valid abrogation of the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity to private damages actions in federal court. <em>See Garrett v. University of Alabama, </em>193 F.3d 1214 (1999), <em>cert. granted, </em>529 U.S. 1065, 120 S.Ct. 1669, 146 L.Ed.2d 479 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-16\">. Fronczak has also made a retaliation claim under state law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b(2). The district court did not discuss that claim in granting summary judgment and dismissing the suit in its entirety. Under the circumstances, we treat the state claim as dismissed without prejudice to be brought in state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Castellano v. City of New York, </em>142 F.3d 58, 74 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
