Accordingly, we deny Murdock\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny his motion for a certificate of appeal-ability, and dismiss on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>No. CR-92-301-S (D.Md. Aug. 10, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-33\"> Final judgment was entered in Murdock\u2019s case in 1993. Therefore, the district court construed Murdock\u2019s notice of appeal, filed July 31, 2000, as a motion for extension of time to file an appeal,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
