For reversal, Owens-El argues the pre-service dismissal was improper and his action was timely. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Owens-El alleged that the United States Parole Commission, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, beginning in 1972, conspired to conceal from him the fact that he might be able to have 1968 Maryland convictions overturned. Even if Owens-El\u2019s action could be deemed timely, his allegations are frivolous, and dismissal therefore was appropriate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 (court shall dismiss case at any time if it determines action or appeal is frivolous); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (frivolous complaints lack arguable basis either in law or in fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\">. The Honorable Russell G. Clark, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable James C. England, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
