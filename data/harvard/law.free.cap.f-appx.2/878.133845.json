But that issue has not yet been reached because the district court abstained. The issue before us is the applicability of <em>Pullman </em>abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">The district court based its decision to abstain solely on the parties\u2019 pleadings which allege the following facts. Three plaintiffs sued the San Francisco Airport Commission, the director of the airport, and the municipality, for discriminating against them on account of their sex and race. Their complaint states that each of them applied for a promotion available to the next highest position, and each got past the first cut, to twelve applicants, and the second cut, to seven. But when the pool was narrowed to four, and they all turned out to be white, the process was started all over again because their race made them not sufficiently \u201cracially diverse.\u201d Different finalists were then selected. The process was pursuant to the airport\u2019s \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity and Diversity Plan\u201d (the Plan). Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that the Plan violated the federal and state constitutions, injunctions against implementing it, injunctions requiring that they be promoted, and money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">The Plan says that the airport\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d is \u201cto provide equal employment opportunity without regard\u201d to ethnicity, sex, and numerous other characteristics. The plan has other provisions which may require that employment opportunities be allocated with regard to ethnicity and sex. The Plan says that management \u201cstrives for an employee population reflective of the cultural diversity\u201d of the municipality and the traveling public. The Plan lays out a matrix of airport employees, sorting them by ethnicity and job category, and comparing their ethnic percentages with labor force availability and population in San Francisco and the Bay Area, in order to compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>the employee population with ethnic and sex percentages \u201creflective of the cultural diversity\u201d of the municipality and surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The Plan says that \u201cthe Airport is above parity with respect to African American, Asian and Filipino employees,\u201d i.e., African Americans constitute 10.3% of the airport workers but only 8.2% of San Francisco and 9.1% of Bay Area labor force participants. The airport was short of its \u201cgoal\u201d for Hispanics, American Indians and women. The numerical charts are not clear as to whether white males were over or under the airport goals, because \u201cEuropean Americans\u201d of both sexes are lumped together, and are 38.4% of the airport employees but 52.2% and 62.4% of the San Francisco and Bay Area labor forces. Following the numerical breakdown of all 1441 airport employees, the Plan sorts out by sex and ethnicity the employees in each division. To meet its \u201cgoal,\u201d the Plan says that the airport will \u201censure\u201d the hiring of qualified \u201cwomen, people of color and individuals with disabilities into many of its vacant positions,\u201d to meet \u201cquantitative objectives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The \u201cquantitative objectives\u201d are to be sought in part by \u201ctargeted recruitment and outreach activities,\u201d such as attending community-based job fairs. Plaintiffs do not challenge any of the recruitment and outreach activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In addition the Plan requires that an \u201cEEO and Diversity Programs office\u201d collect \u201cdata on all employees\u201d in each department and \u201creport this information to top management.\u201d The Plan directs that \u201cManagement and supervisors will be evaluated on performance in this area.\u201d \u201c[Sjuecess in implementing diversity staffing\u201d is a \u201cfactor in evaluating the performance of managers and supervisors.\u201d Recommendations regarding promotions are to be made \u201cin light of the Airport\u2019s Diversity Staffing Plan.\u201d Managers and supervisors are required to work with the EEO and Diversity Programs director in meeting the hiring objective by \u201ctaking into account the utilization analysis, and the estimated availability of under-represented groups in the Airport\u2019s labor market.\u201d The EEO and Diversity Programs director is required, when personnel decisions arise, to \u201cmake recommendations in light of the Alport\u2019s Diversity Staffing Plan and employment good faith hiring efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">To achieve its goal of an \u201cemployee population reflective of the cultural diversity\u201d of the locality, the Plan includes about 40 pages of tables providing the sex and ethnicity for each job classification at the airport. The Plan then determines if a particular sex or race is \u201cunder-utilized\u201d in a given occupational category. For example, there are 184 employees assigned to the airport operations division. Of these 184 employees, 20 (10.9%) are Hispanics. The Plan says that the Hispanic percentage of the workforce population is 12.8%, so Hispanics are \u201cunder utilized\u201d in the airport operations category by 2%, or 4 people. Thus a Plan goal is to employ 4 more Hispanics. Similarly, the Plan says that the design and construction division employs 40 people, but only 9(23%) women, compared to a 45.7% female workforce in the By Area. Thus the Plan concludes that women are \u201cunderutilized\u201d in this category by 22.7%, or 9 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">The district court abstained pursuant to <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from deciding the federal claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the airport Diversity Staffing Plan violated the California Constitution was dismissed without prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>to filing it in state court. The district court stayed all further proceedings pending final resolution of the California State Constitution claim in state court. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction was \u201cstricken from the Court\u2019s calendar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Pullman Abstention</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to abstain under <em>Pullman </em>for abuse of discretion, though the discretion is narrow.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Pullman </em>abstention is a \u201cnarrow exception to the district court\u2019s duty to decide cases properly before it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have relied upon <em>Canton v. Spokane School District No. 81</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which states that <em>Pullman </em>abstention is appropriate when: (1) the complaint touches a sensitive area of social policy; (2) such constitutional adjudication plainly can be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy; and (3) the possibly determinative issue of state law is uncertain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review de novo whether the <em>Canton </em>requirements have been met.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All three factors must be present before abstention is allowed under <em>Pullman.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If the factors are satisfied, then the district court\u2019s decision to abstain is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">The California Constitution says that \u201c[t]he state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One of the district court\u2019s grounds for abstention was that a California appellate decision<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applying this constitutional provision to a similar government hiring program was before the California Supreme Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since this case was submitted, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This ruling may alter the third <em>Canton </em>factor, uncertainty of state law. We therefore remand this case to the district court to reconsider its abstention ruling in light of the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hi-Voltage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">Supplemental Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Appellants argue that the district court should have exercised its supplemental jurisdiction over its claim under the state constitution. That would defeat the purpose of abstaining on the federal constitutional claim while the California Supreme Court decided the state constitutional claim. <em>Cedar Shake </em>establishes that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>this circumstance, dismissal without prejudice of the state law claim and abstention on the federal claim was a proper exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, since we remand for the district court to reconsider its decision to abstain on the federal claim in light of <em>Hi-Voltage, </em>the district court may also wish to reconsider its discretionary dismissal of the state law claim in the same light.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Appellants argue that we should review the district court determination as a denial of a preliminary injunction. But we read the record as a stay rather than a denial. The district court \u201cstruck\u201d the motion for preliminary injunction \u201cfrom the court\u2019s calender,\u201d not on the merits, so that the motion could be revived if necessary after \u201cfinal resolution of plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional claim in state court\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">[A]ll further proceedings in this action shall be stayed pending final resolution of Plaintiffs Proposition 209 claim by the state courts. Defendants shall have no obligation to answer the first amended complaint until such further order by this court. Plaintiffs pending motion for a preliminary injunction is stricken from the Court\u2019s calendar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The district court never ruled either way on the preliminary injunction, so we do not reach the merits. It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to stay consideration of the preliminary injunction under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AX_\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-14\">.
