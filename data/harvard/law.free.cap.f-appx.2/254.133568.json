The district court construed Boone\u2019s pleading as a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2000), and denied it as time-barred. Because Boone\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was a successive motion and Boone did not obtain authorization from this court to file it in the district court, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2255; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) (West Supp. 2000), the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider it. <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
