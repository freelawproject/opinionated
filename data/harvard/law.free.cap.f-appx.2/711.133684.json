After Edward Bendocchi\u2019s prosthetic knee failed and had to be replaced, the Bendocchis sued Howmedica, the manufacturer of Edward Bendocchi\u2019s prosthetic knee, asserting a variety of claims including strict liability and negligence. The jury returned a verdict against Howmedica limited to negligent failure to warn Bendocchi of the dangers associated with the knee replacement. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not restate them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The Bendocchis\u2019 principal argument is that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when, after the close of the evidence, it refused to allow the jury to consider an award of punitive damages. They contend that the court committed error when, in its oral ruling denying their motion to amend the pleadings to allow a claim for punitive damages, it stated that \u201cthe Plaintiffs in the Court\u2019s judgment have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an award of punitive damages meets [the applicable standard].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Idaho law provides that no claim for punitive damages shall be filed unless the court, pursuant to pretrial motion, permits an amendment to include a prayer for punitive damages. Such a motion shall be granted \u201cif the moving party establishes at such hearing a reasonable likelihood of proving facts at trial sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 6-1604(2). The Bendocchis argue that by reserving its ruling until the close of the evidence the district court erroneously required them to prove their entitlement to punitive damages rather than to simply establish the likelihood of proving sufficient facts at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">While section 6-1604(2) controls the disposition of a motion to amend pleadings to state a punitive damages claim-normally, as the statute contemplates, in the pretrial eontext-it does not address the central issue before us: the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion whether to instruct a jury on punitive damages after the close of evidence. On that issue, Idaho courts have consistently held that \u201c[t]he decision of whether to instruct on punitive damages is within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Walker, </em>121 Idaho 589, 826 P.2d 1301, 1305 (Idaho 1992); <em>see also Soria v. Sierra Pac. Airlines, </em>111 Idaho 594, 726 P.2d 706, 723 (Idaho 1986). \u201cAn abuse of discretion will be found only when there is not substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>826 P.2d at 1305; <em>see also General Auto Parts Co. v. Genuine Parts Co., </em>132 Idaho 849, 979 P.2d 1207, 1210 (Idaho 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Reading the court\u2019s ruling in context, we . find it consistent with Idaho law. A plaintiff seeking to amend the complaint to include a claim for punitive damages must show only a reasonable likelihood of proving facts at trial sufficient to support an award for punitive damages. But once all the evidence has been submitted to the jury at trial, the proper inquiry is whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for any reasonable jury to conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages. <em>Cf. Garnett v. Transamerica Ins. Servs., </em>118 Idaho 769, 800 P.2d 656, 668 (Idaho 1990) (\u201cIn addressing whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to consider punitive damages, [Idaho precedent] focus[es] on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s award\u201d). In ruling on the Bendocchis\u2019 motion to instruct the jury on punitive damages, the court correctly noted that under Idaho law, \u201c[t]he facts at trial ... must establish in order to award punitive damages ... that the claimant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence, suppressive [sic, oppressive], fraudulent, wanton, malicious or outrageous con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>duct.\u201d The court then found that \u201cthe plaintiffs ... have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an award of punitive damages meets the extreme [sic] harmful state of mind standard, or an extreme deviation from reasonable standards, and would be inappropriate to submit to the jury.\u201d The district court\u2019s statement may be ambiguous, but a reasonable contextual interpretation is that the court found that, based on the evidence the Bendocehis presented at trial, no reasonable jury could conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Howmedica\u2019s conduct satisfied Idaho\u2019s requirements for an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The Bendocehis also complain of the court\u2019s statement, in the course of its ruling, that their strict liability claim was \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d However, their argument that the court relied on evidence of Howmedica\u2019s PCA knee, rather than Howmedica\u2019s conduct, is refuted by the court\u2019s next sentence in which it focused on the required proof of malicious or outrageous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Thus, our review is limited to the question whether substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury on punitive damages. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>826 P.2d at 1305. We are not to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court in deciding whether the evidence would have been sufficient to support a verdict. <em>Id. </em>It is sufficient that substantial evidence exists to support the court\u2019s decision not to instruct on punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>As to Howmedica\u2019s alleged bad acts, the Bendocehis\u2019 own expert admitted that he was not an expert in testing protocol and that there were no established industry standards by which to determine whether Howmedica\u2019s testing procedures were an unreasonable deviation. As to Howmedica\u2019s alleged bad state of mind, much of the evidence the Bendocehis point to regarding Howmedica\u2019s pre-1987 knowledge consists of studies that were either preliminary or published after that date. The worst that can be said of the 1985 internal memoranda is that Howmedica failed to actively research and respond to possible failures. The Bendocehis\u2019 assertion that Howmedica actively concealed \u201cthousands of premature failures associated with the tibial component of the PCA Knee\u201d is not borne out by the record. Taking into consideration the fact that Idaho does not favor punitive damages and that Idaho courts award them cautiously and only under the most compelling and unusual circumstances, <em>see Manning v. Twin Falls Clinic &amp; Hosp., </em>122 Idaho 47, 830 P.2d 1185, 1190 (Idaho 1992); <em>Jones v. Panhandle Distribs., Inc., </em>117 Idaho 750, 792 P.2d 315, 320 (Idaho 1990); that the \u201cjustification for punitive damages must be that the defendant acted with an extremely harmful state of mind,\u201d <em>Manning, </em>830 P.2d at 1190; and that the defendant\u2019s conduct must constitute an extreme deviation from reasonable standards of conduct, <em>Cheney v. Palos Verdes Inv. Corp., </em>104 Idaho 897, 665 P.2d 661, 669 (Idaho 1983), we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit the jury to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Bendocehis also argue that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on their entitlement to accelerated damages for Mr. Bendocchi\u2019s 1994 revision surgery as well as for possible future surgeries. They further argue that the jury\u2019s failure to award them special damages, despite ample evidence, was against the weight of the evidence and shows that they were prejudiced by the court\u2019s inadequate instruction on the issue of damages. However, Jury Instruction No. 36 provided that the Bendocehis could recover \u201c[t]he reasonable value of necessary medical care and the present cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>value of similar items reasonably certain and necessary to be required in the future\u201d if such damages were \u201cprove[n] by the evidence to have been proximately caused\u201d by Howmedica\u2019s actions. Because these instructions correctly stated Idaho law, <em>see Swanson v. Veterans Admin., </em>557 F.Supp. 1041, 1046 (D.Idaho 1983), and cannot be said to have misled or inadequately instructed the jury on the damages available to the Bendocchis, the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting their proposed instruction. <em>See Chuman v. Wright, </em>76 F.3d 292, 294 (9th Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 597 (9th Cir.1992) (holding court does not err in refusing supplemental jury instruction if other instruction adequately covers theory). Similarly, given the varied evidence on damages presented at trial, the jury\u2019s decision to decline to award special damages for future surgeries or lost wages cannot be said to be contrary to the weight of the evidence. <em>See Sanchez v. Galey, </em>112 Idaho 609, 733 P.2d 1234, 1240 (Idaho 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. <em>See Berns v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 826, 831 (9th Cir.1982) (decision not to grant).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
