The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Battinelli first contends that the district court erred in admitting part of Kearns\u2019s testimony, a deceased witness, before the Office of Thrift Supervision under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3). Battinelli argues that the admission of Kearns\u2019s testimony violated his right under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We need not get to that question if our review of the entire record persuades us that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Brennan, </em>994 F.2d 918, 927 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We review Confrontation Clause violations under the harmless error standard set forth in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), which requires that we reverse the conviction unless the government can prove that the constitutional error complained of was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mulinelli-Navas, </em>111 F.3d 983, 992 (1st Cir.1997). \u201cUnder this standard, we may not declare a constitutional error harmless if there is a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that the error influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In this case, Kearns\u2019s testimony was not central to the government\u2019s case, which would not have been significantly less persuasive had the Kearns evidence been excluded. The testimony was brief (less than two pages long), and was cumulative of Pitcher\u2019s more detailed and thorough testimony. There was an abundance of documentary evidence introduced at trial from which the jury could have inferred that Battinelli knew of and participated in the fraud against the banks, including falsified loan applications and employment and income verifications. Two officials from the banks that issued the loans testified that if certain information revealed to Battinelli prior to submitting the loan applications had been disclosed to the banks as required, the loans w'ould have been denied. The government introduced the testimony of a United States Secret Service document examiner, who testified there was a strong probability that the false information contained in two of the loan applications submitted by Battinelli on behalf of Kearns and Pitcher was written in Battinelli\u2019s handwriting. Finally, the government did not rely heavily on Kearns\u2019s testimony in its closing argument; rather, it primarily emphasized the documentary evidence, Pitcher\u2019s testimony, and the testimony of the bank officials. We hold that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury \u201cwould have reached the same verdict without having received the [Kearns] evidence.\u201d <em>Brennan, </em>994 F.2d at 927 (internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Salimonu, </em>182 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir.1999) (harmless error when it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Next, Battinelli contends that the district court erred in admitting Pitcher\u2019s grand jury testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B). Battinelli argues that the grand jury testimony, admitted to rehabilitate Pitcher, is inadmissible as a prior consistent statement because the testimony did not predate Pitcher\u2019s motive to fabricate. Unfortunately for Battinelli, he did not object to the admission of the grand jury testimony on this basis before the district court. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>Mulinel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>li-Navas, </em>111 F.3d at 989. Because the portions of the grand jury testimony that were admitted were cumulative of Pitcher\u2019s testimony on direct examination and, therefore, added nothing new to the government\u2019s case, the district court did not commit error \u201cso shocking that [it] seriously affectfed] the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We hold that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Lastly, Battinelli contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the intent required for a bank fraud conviction. Because he failed to raise this objection before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Kenrick, </em>221 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.2000) (en banc). Relying on the panel decision in <em>United States v. Kenrick, </em>No. 98-1282 (1st Cir. Feb. 22, 2000) (withdrawn), Battinelli argues that intent to defraud necessarily includes an \u201cintent to harm\u201d the bank. However, after rehearing <em>Kenrick </em>en banc, we held that \u201cthe intent element of bank fraud ... is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. \u2018Intent to harm\u2019 is <em>not </em>required.\u201d <em>Kenrick, </em>221 F.3d at 29 (emphasis added). The instructions given in this case are identical to the instructions at issue in <em>Kenrick. </em>Therefore, as we held en banc in <em>Kenrick, </em>there was no plain error in the district court\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
