On December 1, 1999, the district court entered an order denying the motion. Pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(a), a timely notice of appeal had to be filed by January 31, 2000. McLaughlin\u2019s notice of appeal was dated December 15, 1999, postmarked on May 5, 2000, and filed in the district court on May 25, 2000, 114 days after the expiration of the appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">Under Fed.R.App.P. 4(c), which was amended in 1993 to incorporate the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), an inmate\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed filed on the day it is \u201cdeposited in the institution\u2019s internal mail system.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 4 advisory committee\u2019s note; <em>see Houston, </em>487 U.S. at 276 (notice of appeal is filed at the moment it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing). McLaughlin\u2019s notice of appeal contains a certificate of service. While it is dated December 15, 1999, McLaughlin does not declare under penalty of perjury that the information in his notice is true and correct, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 (1994). Nor does his certificate of service include a notarized statement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-22\">The nearly five-month period that elapsed between the date on the notice of appeal and the postmark date on the envelope weighs against a blind acceptance of the date McLaughlin affixed to his notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of appeal. We therefore remand to the district court for a determination of when McLaughlin deposited his notice of appeal in the institution\u2019s internal mail system. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
