We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Garcia\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s February 3, 1998 decision was due on or before March 5, thirty days after the decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.38(b) (1997). Garcia submitted his notice of appeal to the BIA on March 2, but the notice was rejected due to filing defects. The BIA\u2019s rejection notice indicated Garcia had until March 20 to file a corrected notice of appeal but he did not file it until March 25, well after both the thirty-day period provided in the regulations and the rejection notice\u2019s fifteen-day extension. The notice of appeal was thus untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">We also reject any argument that the untimeliness should be excused under the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine. <em>See Atiqullah v. INS, </em>39 F.3d 896, 898 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (generally time limit for filing notice of appeal to BIA is mandatory and jurisdictional; in unique circumstances if party is misled by words or conduct of court, appellate tribunal may have jurisdiction to hear otherwise untimely appeal). As the BIA lacked jurisdiction to hear Garcia\u2019s appeal, we may not review the merits of his petition. <em>See Margalli-Olvera v. INS, </em>43 F.3d 345, 350 (8th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
