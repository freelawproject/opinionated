R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), (4)(A)(vi) (notice of appeal (NOA) must be filed with district clerk within thirty days of entry of judgment or order appealed from; time for filing is tolled when Rule 60(b) motion is filed within ten days of judgment\u2019s entry). However, his NOA was filed on February 23, and thus was timely only as to the February 15 denial of his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the January 12 dismissal order. <em>See Burgs v. Johnson County, Iowa, </em>79 F.3d 701, 702 (8th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (holding that timely NOA is mandatory and jurisdictional); <em>Gaines v. Nelson (In re Gaines), </em>932 F.2d 729, 731 (8th Cir.1991) (\u201cEvery federal court has the inherent power to determine as a preliminary matter its own subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Sanders v. Clemco Indus., </em>862 F.2d 161, 169 (8th Cir.1988) (finding that appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) motion does not raise underlying judgment for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Because Rafaeli asserted none of the enumerated grounds for granting Rule 60(b) relief and failed otherwise to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>exceptional circumstances justifying such relief, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rafaeli\u2019s reconsideration motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); <em>Sanders, </em>862 F.2d at 169 <em>&amp; </em>n. 14 (setting out standard of review and summarizing grounds for' granting Rule 60(b) relief). We also find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of his simultaneous motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Rayes v. Johnson, </em>969 F.2d 700, 703 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1021, 113 S.Ct. 658, 121 L.Ed.2d 584 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We deny Rafaeli\u2019s motion for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\">. The Honorable Terry I.
