ARNOLD and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b663-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">This suit arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623 <em>et seq. </em>and the Missouri Human Rights Act, Chapter 213, Mo.Rev.Stat. Dennis Calhoun appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grant of summary judgment in favor of Brooks Fiber Properties, Inc. Mr. Calhoun asserts that he established a prima facie case, and that there were factual disputes as to material issues. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Mr. Calhoun worked as the Director of Right of Way and Real Estate. He supervised five regional managers throughout the country, a job which necessitated frequent travel. When Mr. Calhoun was not traveling, and except on Fridays, Brooks Fiber allowed him to work from his home in Brookfield, Missouri. On Fridays, Mr. Calhoun went to Brooks Fiber\u2019s home office in St. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Mr. Calhoun\u2019s supervisor, Ines LeBow, requested that he cease working out of his home and work out of St. Louis when he was not traveling. In her affidavit, Ms. LeBow testified that she learned that Mr. Calhoun reported to St. Louis only one day a week, and that there were complaints he was not reachable. Mr. Calhoun asked whether Brooks Fiber would give him moving expenses or pay for his housing accommodations if he worked out of the St. Louis office. Ms. LeBow replied that Brooks Fiber would offer no financial compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">A week later and after consulting with his wife, Mr. Calhoun informed Ms. LeBow that for personal and financial reasons relocating to the St. Louis office \u201cwas not an option\u201d for him. Ms. LeBow terminated Mr. Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Mr. Calhoun then filed this suit against Brooks Fiber alleging age discrimination in violation of the ADEA and the Missouri Human Rights Act. We have considered the record and briefs and heard oral argument. We find no substantial evidence that what happened to Mr. Calhoun had anything to do with his age. Accordingly, it was proper for the District Court to grant summary judgment, the reasons for which are fully explained in that Court\u2019s opinion. Thus, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-17\">. The Hon. Mary Ann L. Medler, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AUC\">. It seems undisputed that Mr. Calhoun\u2019s salary, duties, benefits, and position would have been unaffected by the relocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
