At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> concluded Farhat\u2019s earlier bank fraud conviction was an aggravated felony and enhanced Farhat\u2019s sentence for that reason under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). On appeal, Farhat argues his earlier bank fraud conviction was not an aggravated felony at the time of the crime or the conviction because the loss amount did not exceed $10,000, as the \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition requires. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). According to Farhat, the district court should have found the amount of loss was $7000, the amount charged in the fraud indictment, rather than the amount of restitution ordered, $21,353.31. We disagree. The bank fraud indictment detailed a wide-ranging scheme and artifice to defraud sufficient to encompass the $21,353.31 loss. Farhat also appears to argue the retroactive application of the $10,000 threshold in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), which was $200,000 at the time of his bank fraud conviction, constitutes an ex post facto violation. We rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Baca-Valenzuela, </em>118 F.3d 1223, 1231 (8th Cir.1997). Last, relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Farhat contends for the first time on appeal that his earlier aggravated felony conviction is an element of his offense, not just a sentencing factor, and under the facts of this case, Farhat\u2019s conviction and sentence violated the Fifth Amendment. There was no <em>Apprendi </em>error because Farhat admitted he had an earlier felony conviction and his sentence on the earlier conviction did not exceed the ten-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). We thus affirm Farhat\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AA_\"> The Honorable Robert T.
