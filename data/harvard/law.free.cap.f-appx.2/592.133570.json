We conclude that the court properly vacated an earlier order granting default judgment against some of the defendants, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and that summary judgment was warranted because Mr. Turner did not show he faced a substantial risk of serious harm which defendants knew of and disregarded, <em>see Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Prater v. Dahm, </em>89 F.3d 538, 541 (8th Cir.1996) (noting it is well settled that Eighth Amendment imposes duty on part of prison officials to protect prisoners from attacks; duty to protect inmate requires only that prison officials take reasonable measures to abate substantial risks of serious harm of which they are aware).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Accordingly, w'e affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-21\">.
