BATTEY, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b650-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Kim Britt applied for supplemental security income benefits on behalf of his school-age son, Timothy Britt, under sub-chapter XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>Britt alleged that Timothy was disabled by one or more severe behavioral disorders. After the application was denied at the initial and reconsideration levels, the Commissioner\u2019s administrative law judge held a hearing and issued an adverse decision. The ALJ found that Timothy has severe mental impairments but denied the application because Timothy \u201cdoes not have an impairment or impairments that so interfere with his ability to function effectively, appropriately, and independently in an age-appropriate manner that they are comparable to ones that would prevent an adult from performing substantial gainful activity.\u201d Britt then sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s adverse decision, arguing that the ALJ failed to give proper weight to treating physician reports, improperly discredited Britt\u2019s testimony describing his son\u2019s behavioral problems, and erred in finding Timothy not disabled under the applicable regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The court first noted that this claim is governed by a more stringent standard for determining the disability of a child enacted by Congress after the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382e(a)(3)(A) (1994), <em>with </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i) (Supp. II 1996). However, the new standard need not be analyzed if the claim was properly denied under the prior, more lenient standard. <em>See Briggs v. Callahan, </em>139 F.3d 606, 608 (8th Cir.1998). The court then determined that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports (i) the relative weight the ALJ gave to the testimony of the treating physicians, the consulting physician, and Timothy\u2019s second-grade teacher, and (ii) the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit, at least in part, Britt\u2019s testimony. Therefore, the district court concluded that the factual record supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Timothy is not limited in his developmental and functional \u201cdomains\u201d to the extent necessary for the \u201ccomparable severity\u201d deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>mination that was necessary to a finding of child disability under the prior statute and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Britt appeals, raising the same issues considered by the district court. After careful review of the administrative record as a whole, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough Order dated March 13, 2000. <em>See </em>8th Cir. Rule 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-15\">. The HONORABLE JOSEPH F. BATAILLON, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
