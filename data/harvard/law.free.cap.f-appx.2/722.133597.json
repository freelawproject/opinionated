Under California law, conflicting \u201cexcess insurance\u201d clauses cancel each other out, and the insurers are forced to prorate the loss between them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, two recent California Court of Appeal decisions indicate that the rule of proration between insurers only governs the rights of an insurer, which has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured, to seek contribution from a co-insurer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and does not limit the insurer\u2019s liability to its insured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">Applying California law, we find that First National was hable to the FDIC for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the full amount of its policy limit, which was $1 million. Therefore, the district court erred in concluding that First National\u2019s $1 million payment to the FDIC exceeded its liability under the policy, and its judgment ordering restitution on that basis must be reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">B. <em>First National\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">1. <em>Breach of Contract Claim (No. 99-56689)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The clear and explicit language of the 1992 agreement obligated the FDIC to reimburse First National only if the FDIC recovered from General, and we go no further in our interpretation of that agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the FDIC did not recover from General, the FDIC owed nothing under the 1992 agreement, and summary judgment for the FDIC on First National\u2019s breach of contract claim was proper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">2. <em>Claim in Intervention (No. 98-56788)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Even if the FDIC\u2019s refusal to cooperate with General\u2019s investigation did not extinguish First National\u2019s right to seek contribution from General, First National did not assert this right when it was an intervenor in the <em>General v. FDIC </em>action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, First National sought to intervene to enforce its subrogation rights under the 1992 agreement, which all parties agree were extinguished by our previous order in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under California law, the right of contribution from a coinsurer is distinct and independent from the right to subrogation,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and thus, the district court did not err in granting General\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings to dispose of First National\u2019s claim in intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">COSTS TAXED AGAINST FIRST NATIONAL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-11\">.

Lansing Sound, Inc. v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, PA </em>controls here. Although in that case we did apply California\u2019s rule of proration between insurers to limit the liability of an insurer to its insured, we explicitly did so in the absence of contrary authority in California law. 801 F.2d 1560, 1568 (1986). In light of <em>Armstrong World Industries, Inc. </em>and <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>we could not today decide <em>James B. Lansing Sound, Inc. </em>as we did in 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">. As a result, there is no need to address First National\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s award of attorney's fees, denial of prejudgment interest, and dismissal of the FDIC in its corporate capacity, nor do we address the remaining issues in the FDIC\u2019s appeal, which is rendered moot by our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">. Under California law, a court can go no further than the clear and explicit language of the agreement. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.App.4th 21, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 113, 117 (Cal.Ct.App. 1998). We also agree with the district court that the FDIC\u2019s refusal to cooperate with General\u2019s investigation could not have breached the 1992 agreement, because any uncooperative conduct occurred prior to the parties entering into the 1992 agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-24\">. On appeal, First National has abandoned its claim that the FDIC\u2019s failure to cooperate with General\u2019s investigation breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the FDIC and First National.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b755-25\">. As a result, we do not decide whether, under California law, the FDIC\u2019s forfeiture of coverage under General\u2019s policy also bars First National\u2019s right to seek contribution from General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b755-26\">. <em>General Accident Ins.
