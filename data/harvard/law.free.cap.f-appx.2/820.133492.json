The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Pedro Perez-Vega appeals his jury conviction and sentence for a single count of reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and 1326(b)(2). Perez-Vega\u2019s counsel has filed a brief, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he finds no meritorious issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Defendant has filed a supplemental pro se brief, contending that he received ineffective assistance from his trial and appellate counsel. Because the record on appeal is inadequate, we decline to entertain Perez-Vega\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this time. <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir.2000) (generally, ineffective assistance of counsel claims \u201care inappropriate on direct appeal and should be raised, instead, in habeas corpus proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">We note that, in addition to \u00a7 1326(a), the district court\u2019s judgment references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), which does not define a separate crime. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Alviso, </em>152 F.3d 1195, 1199 (9th Cir.1998). We therefore, AFFIRM the judgment, but REMAND with directions to correct the written judgment by striking the reference to \u00a7 1326(b) so that the judgment will unambiguously re-fleet that Perez-Vega was convicted of only one punishable offense pursuant to \u00a7 1326(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>United States v. Riverar-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d at 1063 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no further issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel of record is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">AFFIRMED. REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">.
