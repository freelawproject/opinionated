Young\u2019s petition is barred by the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(d) (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000). Young\u2019s conviction became final in 1995, but she did not file her \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court until December 1998, long after the limitations period expired. <em>Harris v. Hutchinson, </em>209 F.3d 325, 327 (4th Cir.2000) (rejecting habeas petitioner\u2019s argument that limitations period did not begin until termination of state post-conviction proceedings, and holding that period instead commences \u201cupon conclusion of direct review of a judgment of conviction\u201d); <em>see Hernandez v. Caldwell, </em>225 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir.2000) (establishing April 24, 1997, as the cut-off date for petitioners to seek habeas relief from state convictions that had become final prior to the April 24, 1996 effective date of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
