The court has ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>corded the arguments full consideration and has determined the issues presented occasion no need for a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the accompanying memorandum, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">ORDERED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Appellant Crawford Ellerbe appeals the district court\u2019s post-verdict judgment as a matter of law in his Title VII gender discrimination suit against the Department of Transportation (Department). Because Ellerbe failed to prove discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Since 1983 Ellerbe has worked as a GS-13 \u201cFederal Academy Program Analyst\u201d in the Office of Maritime and Labor, Training and Safety of the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation. In this position he monitors graduates of the United States Merchant Marine Academy to ensure they fulfill their service obligations and he handles waiver and deferment requests. He brought this action alleging that Taylor Jones, Director of the Office of Maritime and Labor, Training and Safety since 1994, should have reclassified his position as GS-14 but did not on account of Ellerbe\u2019s gender. He also alleged Jones denied an annual leave request Ellerbe made in December 1995 and later refused to restore leave in retaliation for Ellerbe\u2019s deposition testimony in <em>Harrison v. Lewis, </em>559 F.Supp. 943 (D.D.C.1983), an employment discrimination suit against the Department, and for his having filed an EEOC discrimination complaint in 1995. At the close of a ten-day trial in May 1999 the jury returned a verdict in Ellerbe\u2019s favor, awarding him compensatory damages of $75,000. In a memorandum opinion and order filed February 4, 2000 the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed the complaint. Ellerbe appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">First, the district court correctly held that Ellerbe failed to produce evidence of discriminatory animus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ellerbe maintains discrimination can be inferred from Jones\u2019s disparate treatment of a \u201csimilarly situated\u201d female employee, Martha Johnson, whom Jones reclassified from a GS-12 to a GS-13. Not so. Assuming Johnson and Ellerbe were similarly situated, meaning that \u201call of the relevant aspects of [their] employment situation were nearly identical,\u201d <em>Neuren v. Adduci, Mastriani, Meeks &amp; Schill, </em>43 F.3d 1507, 1514 (D.C.Cir.1995) (internal quotation omitted), there was no disparate treatment because each was appropriately classified at the same grade, GS-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">Ellerbe also argues discriminatory intent from Jones\u2019s refusal to obtain a \u201cdesk audit\u201d of Ellerbe\u2019s position to determine whether it should be upgraded to a GS-14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The record reveals, however, that the audit process, which was initiated upon Ellerbe\u2019s request, was terminated not by Jones but by the Director of Personnel at the behest of the Department\u2019s Chief Counsel after, and apparently because, Ellerbe filed this action. While the decision to cancel the audit may have been irregular, it does not demonstrate discriminatory intent by Jones who had no part in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Finally, with regard to Ellerbe\u2019s retaliation claim, the time lapse between Jones\u2019s denial of leave and Ellerbe\u2019s testimony in Harrison-at least 12 years-is simply too long to support an inference of retaliatory motive. <em>See Mitchell v. Baldrige, </em>759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\u201cThe causal connection component of the <em>prima facie </em>case may be established by showing that the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s protected activity, and that the adverse personnel action took place <em>shortly </em>after that activity.\u201d) (emphasis added). Nor was there evidence that Jones was even aware of Ellerbe\u2019s 1995 EEOC complaint, in which Jones was not involved, when he denied Ellerbe\u2019s leave request.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">. Ellerbe asserts that because his suit persisted through trial it was error for the court to rely on his failure to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case. It is true that when a \"case has been tried, ... the question whether [the plaintiff] established a <em>prima facie </em>case is ... irrelevant.\u201d <em>Barbour v. Browner, </em>181 F.3d 1342, 1347 (D.C.Cir. 1999) (citing <em>United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 715, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983); alteration and elipses added). \"This does not mean, however, that in our analysis of 'the ultimate question of discrimination <em>vel non,\u2019 </em>[460 U.S.] at 714, 103 S.Ct. 1478, we are obliged to pretend that there is evidence supporting a <em>prima facie </em>case when in fact there is not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
