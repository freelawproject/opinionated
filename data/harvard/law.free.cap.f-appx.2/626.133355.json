Pye has moved for preparation of the trial transcript at government expense and for oral argument. We deny the former motion because Pye has not satisfied his burden of demonstrating that the appeal presents a substantial question. In particular, the trial evidence he points to is not contrary to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Rhodes v. Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>589 F.2d 358, 359-60 (8th Cir.1978) (per curiam) (denying transcript prepared at government expense where in forma pauperis appellant made only conclusory allegations that trial court erred in ruling against her). Because we are unable to review the issues Pye raises without a transcript, we deny Pye\u2019s motion for oral argument and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\">. The Honorable Charles A.
