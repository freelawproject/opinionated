He challenges on appeal, as he did below, the application of an enhancement for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing irom a'law enforcement officer, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">As part of his plea agreement, Earl waived his right to appeal his sentence unless the district court departed upward from the Sentencing Guidelines range, imposed a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum sentence, or violated law other than the Guidelines. We conclude that Earl\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Earl was assisted by counsel at the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings, and counsel reminded Earl of the appeal waiver when they reviewed the plea agreement at the change-of-plea hearing. <em>See United States v. Michelsen, </em>141 F.3d 867, 871 (8th Cir.1998) (appeal waiver is enforceable so long as it resulted from knowing and voluntary decision); <em>United States v. Greger, </em>98 F.3d 1080, 1081-82 (8th Cir. 1996) (waiver was knowing and intelligent where it was included in plea agreement and it was discussed at change-of-plea hearing). The court\u2019s statement at the sentencing hearing that Earl could appeal his sentence doesn\u2019t invalidate Earl\u2019s appeal waiver. <em>See Michelsen, </em>141 F.3d at 871-872 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Because Earl\u2019s sentence was not an upward departure from the Guidelines range, did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence, and did not violate any other non-Guidelines sentencing law, we enforce his promise not to appeal by dismissing his appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-27\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
