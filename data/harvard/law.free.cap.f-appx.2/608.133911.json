After de novo review, <em>see Buckley v. Rogerson, </em>133 F.3d 1125, 1126 (8th Cir.1998), we agree with the District Court that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the unsanitary-conditions claim, <em>see id. </em>at 1128 (explaining that government officials have qualified immunity from suit unless their actions violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which reasonable person would have known); <em>Whitnack v. Douglas </em>County, 16 F.3d 954, 957-58 (8th Cir.1994). We conclude that the force Mitchell alleged was used did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See Jones v. Shields, </em>207 F.3d 491, 494-95, 497 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We deny Mitchell\u2019s motion to strike portions of appellees\u2019 brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-23\">. The Honorable Richard G.
