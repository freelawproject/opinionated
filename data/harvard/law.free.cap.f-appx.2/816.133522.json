Craft, </em>157 F.3d 697, 701 (9th Cir.1998). Because Jenkins failed to rebut the Secretary\u2019s evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision, the district court properly found in favor of the Secretary on the disparate treatment and age discrimination claims. <em>See Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., </em>840 F.2d 667, 672-74 (9th Cir.1988). Because Jenkins failed to present evidence of a policy or pattern of discriminatory hiring, the district court did not err by rendering judgment in favor of the Secretary on the disparate impact claims. <em>See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, </em>490 U.S. 642, 650, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Jenkins\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit. We have not considered issues raised for the first time in Jenkins\u2019 reply brief. <em>See Eberle v. City of Anaheim, </em>901 F.2d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1990). We grant Jenkins\u2019 motion to include additional excerpts of record; we have considered the excerpts in concluding this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">.
