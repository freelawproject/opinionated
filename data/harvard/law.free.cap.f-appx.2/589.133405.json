Bueno-Espinoza contends the govemment violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing timely to disclose his codefendant\u2019s plea agreement, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2) by entering into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>plea agreement with the same codefendant in exchange for his testimony. Like the district court, we reject both arguments. Bueno-Espinoza has not shown how earlier disclosure of the plea agreement would have materially affected the outcome of his case, <em>see United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 674, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), and the government does not violate \u00a7 201(c)(2) by treating codefendants with leniency in exchange for their testimony, <em>see United States v. Albanese, </em>195 F.3d 389, 394 (8th Cir.1999) (Eighth Circuit has \u201clong history\u201d of allowing government to compensate witnesses for their participation in criminal investigations).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to grant Bueno-Espinoza a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Saelee, </em>123 F.3d 1024, 1025 (8th Cir.1997) (discretionary decision not to depart from Guidelines is unreviewable absent unconstitutional motive or legally erroneous determination that court lacked authority to consider mitigating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We affirm the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
