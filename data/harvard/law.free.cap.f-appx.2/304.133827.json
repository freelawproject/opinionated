Because McDermott failed to allege any partiality arising from an extrajudicial source, <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1987), we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Appeal No. 00-2034 is McDermott\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order entering a final decree and dismissing Andrew Moore\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>McDermott v. Moore, </em>No. CA-00-190PJM; BK-88-42746 (D.Md. July 24, 2000). We deny McDermott\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and his motion to recuse three judges from this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
