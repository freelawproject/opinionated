Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">On appeal, Faulk claims that she is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor made improper remarks during his rebuttal closing argument. Because our review of the record reveals that any such prosecutorial misconduct did not \u201cso infect[] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process,\u201d we find that this claim is without merit. <em>United States v. Morsley, </em>64 F.3d 907, 913 (4th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Faulk\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
