We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">The BIA found that Singh\u2019s testimony was not credible because of a material inconsistency between his asylum application and his testimony at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. It also found that Singh did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the inconsistency. Because we hold that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence and that the BIA gave adequate consideration to Singh\u2019s explanation, we do not consider the BIA\u2019s alternative holdings that the conduct to which Singh was allegedly subjected did not rise to the level of persecution, and that the \u201cpersecution\u201d was not on account of a statutory ground for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">.
