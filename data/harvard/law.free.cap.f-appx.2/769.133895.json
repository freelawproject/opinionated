Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Civil Procedure 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Garcia did not establish the existence of a defect in the lock or proximate cause, which he would have to prove at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Garcia is a very sympathetic plaintiff, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, does not establish a jury question on whether there was something wrong with the lock, and that the defect was a proximate cause of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Garcia also argues that a material issue of fact exists concerning the credibility of Folger and Security\u2019s witnesses. However, it is not enough for the non-moving party to state that it will discredit the moving party\u2019s evidence at trial because \u201cit must produce at least some \u2018significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.\u2019 <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Garcia further argues that a default judgment should have been entered automatically against Security. The court did not abuse its discretion in declining to enter a default judgment. Security has a meritorious defense, its conduct was not culpable, and setting aside the judgment, had one been entered, would not prejudice Garcia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-28\">.
