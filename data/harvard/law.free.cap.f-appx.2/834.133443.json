Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Whiteford\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that she finds no meritorious issues and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Whiteford has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">The <em>Anders </em>brief identifies three potential issues. The first issue concerns whether the district court complied with the provisions of Rule 11 in accepting Whiteford\u2019s guilty plea. A review of the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s plea colloquy substantially satisfied the rule\u2019s requirements, and that the plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11; <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, 156 F.3d </em>974, 976-77 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing the Rule 11 requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">The second potential issue involves whether the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement based on its finding that Whiteford was a supervisor of the criminal enterprise for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). We review a district court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 3B1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>908 F.2d 1443, 1447 (9th Cir.1990). Our review of the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial competent evidence, including testimony that Whiteford hired, fired, and trained other participants in the mail fraud scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">The third potential issue involves whether the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement based on its finding that Whiteford\u2019s victims were unusually vulnerable for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b). We review a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant\u2019s victims were unusually vulnerable for clear error. <em>United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 950 (9th Cir.1999). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Whiteford\u2019s victims were unusually vulnerable based on substantial competent evidence that, inter aha, at least one elderly victim was openly concerned about the safety of the proposed investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">Our examination of counsel\u2019s brief and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), disclose no further issues for review. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel of record is GRANTED and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
