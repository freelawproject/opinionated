The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Martinez-Acosta contends that the fact of a prior felony conviction, which he did not admit at his plea, is an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We are affirming because Martinez-Acosta\u2019s contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. PachecoZepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.2000) (con-eluding that <em>Apprendi </em>preserves the rule in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that prior convictions are sentencing factors and not elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">Martinez-Acosta further contends that the district court erred: (1) in determining that he suffered no \u201clost opportunity\u201d to serve his federal sentence concurrently with a prior state sentence due to the government\u2019s alleged one-year delay in prosecuting him for the instant offense, and (2) in failing to impose a concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Martinez-Aeosta\u2019s waiver of appeal forecloses these contentions. Because the record here indicates that (1) Martinez-Acosta\u2019s waiver is knowing and voluntary; (2) these contentions do not fall within any of the limited exceptions to the waiver; and (3) his sentence was otherwise imposed in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement, his waiver is enforceable, <em>see United States v. Bolinger, </em>940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1991), and the appeal of this issue is therefore dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-13\">. To the extent that Martinez-Acosta contends that the government breached the plea agreement because the government argued against his request for a concurrent sentence at sentencing, this contention fails because neither the plea agreement nor the record supports this argument. <em>See United States v. Schuman, </em>127 F.3d 815, 818 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that waiver of appeal is enforceable where plea agreement is not breached).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
