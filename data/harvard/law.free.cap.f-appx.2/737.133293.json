The district court imposed a sixteen point offense level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (commission of an aggravated felony prior to reentry). Parada-Molina appeals the sentencing enhancement because he contends that his prior offense, possession of narcotic drugs, was not an aggravated felony. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-24\">Parada-Molina\u2019s prior offense constitutes an aggravated felony if Arizona law denominates the offense a felony. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>United States v. Ibarra-Galindo, </em>206 F.3d 1337, 1339 (9th Cir.2000). Parada-Molina concedes that in 1994, when he was arrested for possession of narcotic drugs under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408, the crime was a felony-under Arizona law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Parada-Molina asserts, however, that this crime is no longer a felony under Arizona law due to the passage of Proposition 200 in 1996, later codified as A.R.S. \u00a7 13-901.01. Proposition 200 prohibits judges from imposing any incarceration on certain drug possession offenders. Parada-Molina argues that since an offender of his same crime can no longer be sentenced \u25a0 to at least one year of incarceration, the crime itself is no longer a felony under Arizona law. <em>See </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(16) (West 2000) (general definition of a felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, Arizona courts apply that language. <em>See Calik v. Kongable, </em>195 Ariz. 496, 990 P.2d 1055, 1057 (Ariz. 1999)(en banc). Even after the passage of Proposition 200, the plain language of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408 expressly continued to classify possession of narcotic drugs as a class four felony. <em>See </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408 (West 2000). Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 13-901.01 did not purport to change the classification of possession of narcotic drugs to a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-901.01 (West 2000). Nor did it address the maximum possible fine or the maximum possible length of probation. By its express terms, it dealt only with incarceration. Arizona employs, in the interpretation of criminal statutes, the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius. <em>Champlin v. Sargeant, </em>192 Ariz. 371, 965 P.2d 763 (Ariz.1998). It follows, therefore, that after Proposition 200, possession of narcotic drugs remained a class four felony, albeit one for which a felony fine and felony probation but no incarceration is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Arizona cases decided after Proposition 200 was enacted in 1996, show that Arizona courts continue to treat possession of narcotic drugs as a class four felony. <em>See e.g., Calik, </em>990 P.2d at 1056 (\u201cIn 1997, David Peter Calik pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine weighing less than nine grams, a class 4 felony.\u201d), <em>State v. Jones, </em>196 Ariz. 306, 995 P.2d 742, 743 (Ariz.Ct.App.2000)(\u201cIn 1998 Tyrus Jones pled guilty to possession of narcotic drugs, a class four felony, .... \u201d); <em>Goddard v. Superior Court, </em>191 Ariz. 402, 956 P.2d 529, 530 (Ariz.Ct.App.1998) (\u201cOn November 19, 1997, Petitioner Cicero Goddard pled guilty to possession of narcotic drugs, a class 4 felony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Because possession of narcotic drugs was and is a felony under Arizona law, the district court did not err in granting a sixteen level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-26\">.

Moreover, I believe that in order to impose a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the prior offense must have been an aggravated felony both at the time the act was committed and at the time of the illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Gomez-Rodriguez, </em>96 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir.1996), holds only we do not consider a prior conviction an \u201caggravated felony\u201d if it was not defined as an aggravated felony at the time the act was committed. <em>Gomez-Rodriguez </em>does not address whether an offense that was defined as a felony at the time of conviction, but not at the time of the illegal reentry, may be treated as a felony under \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, I would hold that the district court erred in applying the sentence enhancement for ParadaMolina\u2019s prior drug possession conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>LEAVY, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AxO\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I concur in the result reached in the memorandum affirming the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (commission of an aggravated felony prior to reentry). However, I believe that our analysis should focus only upon whether the defendant was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d prior to his deportation. This defendant was. Our court has previously rejected the argument that we should look to the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d as it existed on the date of reentry. <em>United States v. Gomez-Rodriguez, </em>96 F.3d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir.1996) (when conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was not defined as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d at the time of conviction, this conviction does not constitute a necessary element of a crime under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2)). Any change in Arizona law after Parada-Molina\u2019s felony conviction is of no consequence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
