Having reviewed the record of the evidentiary hearing, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding that White authorized his attorney to enter into the settlement agreement at issue is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Mueller v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>143 F.3d 414, 416 (8th Cir.1998) (district court finding plaintiff had given his attorney express authority to settle case not clearly erroneous in light of district court\u2019s credibility determinations, evidence supporting its findings, and reasonable inferences drawn from evidence); <em>Turner v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>771 F.2d 341, 345-46 (8th Cir.1985) (once attorney enters into settlement agreement, client seeking to disavow agreement has the burden of proving the attorney lacked authority to make the agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
