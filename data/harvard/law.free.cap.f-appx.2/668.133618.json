The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 151 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, Vibanco-Sanchez\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising only the issue whether the district court erred in granting Vibanco-Sanchez a 2-level rather than 3-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. Vibanco-Sanchez has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Vibanco-Sanchez stipulated at sentencing to a total offense level of 34, <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995); and in any event, the district court did not clearly err in denying the additional 1-level reduction, <em>see United States v. Holt, </em>149 F.3d 760, 762 (8th Cir. 1998) (standard of review), despite the government\u2019s plea-agreement stipulation indicating that Vibanco-Sanchez had timely notified authorities of his intent to plead guilty, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(b), 6B1.4(d), p.s.; <em>United States v. Nunley, </em>873 F.2d 182, 187 (8th Cir.1989) (plea-agreement stipulation that defendant timely accepted responsibility does not bind sentencing court).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Having found no non-frivolous issues upon our review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we now affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. The HONORABLE JOSEPH F.
