Allen appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court found that Allen was not \u201cin custody\u201d when he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Allen contends that the district court erred in finding that his \u00a7 2255 motion was filed on February 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>2000 instead of February 1, 2000. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2255 motion, and we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Guess, </em>203 F.3d 1143, 1145 (9th Cir.2000). The district court found that Allen completed his sentence, including supervised release, on February 1, 2000. The district court also found that Allen filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on February 3, 2000. Allen contends that this latter finding was erroneous because the clerk received his \u00a7 2255 motion on February 1, 2000. In support of this contention, Allen offers for the first time on appeal a \u201cCertified Mail\u201d receipt bearing what purports to be a stamped signature of the \u201cUS District Court\u201d and a delivery date of February 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Though Allen has not moved this court to supplement the record, the evidence he offers was never filed with the district court. Only in \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d will we permit \u201cthe record on appeal [to] be supplemented with material that was not before the district court.\u201d <em>Barilla v. Ervin, </em>886 F.2d 1514, 1521 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing <em>Ross v. Kemp, </em>785 F.2d 1467, 1474 (11th Cir.1986)), <em>overruled on other grounds, Simpson v. Lear Astronics Corp., </em>77 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir.1996). Allen has not made a showing of excusable neglect, nor has he demonstrated that any \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances support supplementing the record on appeal. Accordingly, Allen\u2019s alleged new evidence is ordered stricken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The only evidence in the record regarding the filing date of Allen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is the clerk\u2019s date-stamp on the document. Allen never offered the district court any evidence of an earlier filing date, and only asserted an earlier filing date after the court dismissed his \u00a7 2255 motion. On this record, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Allen filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on February 3, 2000, two days after he was released from custody. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Agu\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
