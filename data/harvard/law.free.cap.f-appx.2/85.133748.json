Arcara, <em>Judge), </em>it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Ruby Williams, <em>pro se, </em>appeals from an order of the district court granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment of Williams\u2019 civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims are without merit. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Regarding Williams\u2019 state law claim for false arrest which the District Court found to be time-barred, we note that the same elements are sufficient to plead a cause of action arising under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir .1996) (\u201cA \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest, resting on the Fourth Amendment right of an individual to be free from unreasonable seizures, including arrest without probable cause, is substantially the same as a claim for false arrest under New York law.\u201d) (internal citation omitted). This being the case, the better practice would be to construe the complaint as making out the parallel federal claim as well, in light of the fact that we liberally construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>litigant to \u201craise the strongest arguments that they suggest.\u201d <em>McPherson v. Coombe, </em>174 F.3d 276, 280 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). A federal claim for false arrest necessarily fails, however, when, as here, the facts justify a finding, as a matter of law, that Williams\u2019 arrest was supported by probable cause. <em>See Weyant, </em>101 F.3d at 852 (\u201cThe existence of probable cause to arrest ... is a complete defense to an action for false arrest.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>People v. Singleton, </em>195 A.D.2d 339, 340, 600 N.Y.S.2d 24, 25 (1st Dep\u2019t) (exercise of dominion and control over apartment and drugs therein sufficient to sustain drug conviction), <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>82 N.Y.2d 903, 632 N.E.2d 480, 610 N.Y.S.2d 170 (1993). <em>Cf. McCall v. Pataki, </em>232 F.3d 321, 323 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cThis Court ... is free to affirm an appealed decision on any ground which finds support in the record, regardless of the ground upon which the trial court relied.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
