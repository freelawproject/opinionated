We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition de novo, <em>Bribiesca v. Galaza, </em>215 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Logan first contends that the admission of his statements to law enforcement officers violated his due process rights because he made the statements in reliance on promises of immunity. We find that the state courts\u2019 rulings that Logan\u2019s statements were voluntary were neither \u201ccontrary to, [n]or involved an unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal law,\u201d as is required for relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">\u201c[Cjoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.... \u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). \u201c[I]n most circumstances, speculation that cooperation will benefit the' defendant or even promises to recommend leniency are not sufficiently compelling to overbear a defendant\u2019s will.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>34 F.3d 886, 891 (9th Cir.1994). Therefore, because Logan\u2019s claim is solely that the police officers induced his cooperation through false promises of leniency and immunity, we cannot conclude that the state courts\u2019 rulings were contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>Cf. United States v. Byram, </em>145 F.3d 405, 408 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Cir.1998) (finding statements voluntary in a similar factual situation because, after <em>\u201cConnelly, </em>it would be very hard to treat as coercion a false assurance to a suspect that he was not in danger of prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Second, Logan claims that the admission of victim Sandra Soh\u2019s testimony that he sexually assaulted her so prejudiced the jury as to deny him a fair trial in violation of his constitutional due process rights. Under AEDPA, \u201c[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that ... the applicant has exhausted all the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1), (b)(1)(A). \u201cAEDPA disfavors a state waiver of exhaustion,\u201d <em>Lurie v. Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 123 (2nd Cir.2000), and the apparent inconsistencies in the State\u2019s brief are insufficient to constitute the \u201cexpress[] waive[r]\u201d required by AED-PA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(3). Logan did not \u201cmake [any] federal basis of the claim explicit\u201d in his petitions to the state courts. <em>Lyons v. Crawford, </em>232 F.3d 666, 668 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Shumway v. Payne, </em>223 F.3d 982, 987 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1106 (9th Cir. 1999). Therefore, Logan failed to exhaust the claim, and we do not consider it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\">.
