Alberto BECERRA-SANDOVAL, aka Alberto Becerra, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b751-8\">No. 00-50167.</docketnumber>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b751-9\">D.C.

Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-26\">Assuming the district court erred during the plea colloquy by fading to inform Becerra-Sandoval of the \u201cfound in\u201d element of the charged offense, the error was harmless as Becerra-Sandoval had previously indicated his awareness of that element. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-27\">The requirement that BecerraSandoval report to a probation officer upon reentry to the United States does not violate the Fifth Amendment. The privilege against self-incrimination \u201cprotects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 761, 86 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The conditions of Becerra-Sandoval\u2019s supervised release do not compel him to provide testimonial evidence, so the Fifth Amendment is not implicated. Whether specific information obtained by a probation officer as a result of compliance with the reporting requirement could be used against Becerra-Sandoval in a future prosecution is a question to be resolved should such a prosecution occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Finally, the district court did not err by considering Becerra-Sandoval\u2019s pri- or felony convictions during sentencing, notwithstanding that such conduct was not charged in the indictment. <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413-14 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
