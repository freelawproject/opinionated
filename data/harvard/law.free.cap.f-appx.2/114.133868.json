The complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted, for \u201c[t]he antitrust laws ... were enacted for \u2018the protection of <em>competition, </em>not <em>competitors.\u2019 \u201d Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977) (quoting <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962) (emphasis in <em>Brown Shoe)). </em>The complaint- here indicated that defendant\u2019s conduct actually caused an increase in competition, alleging that as a result- of that conduct, new competitors of defendant entered the marketplace. <em>(E.g., </em>Complaint it 34; <em>see also </em>Plaintiffs brief on appeal at 6 (\u201c[Cjompetitors of Agway, who previously had lacked the marketing power to compete with Agway in Appellant\u2019s Local Marketing Area \u2014 due to Agway\u2019s strategically placed local Distribution Centers in each Local Marketing Area \u2014 were given an opportunity to move in and take over the supply to Appellant and the other \u2018cut off Representatives, who needed to buy Agricultural Products at wholesale in order to compete with Agway for retail sales to their Farmer customers.\u201d)). The complaint failed to allege facts indicating either harm to competition or a dangerous probability that the alleged attempted monopolization by defendant would succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
