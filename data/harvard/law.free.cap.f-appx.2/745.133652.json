Karlton, District Judge, Presiding</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Appellant McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., dba <em>The Sacramento Bee (\u201cThe Bee\u2019\u2019), </em>a non-party in interest to the underlying criminal proceeding, seeks a writ of mandamus to reverse the final post-judgment order entered by the district court in response to <em>The </em>Bee\u2019s request that the district court unseal three documents relating to a 1994 Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 35 motion that it had informally sealed. We grant the writ, vacate the order, and remand the case to the district court to make factual findings in consideration of whether privacy interests alone justify the redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">At a hearing on December 7, 1999, the district court ordered that one of the three documents be unsealed in its entirety and that the other two documents be unsealed after the names of certain individuals were redacted. These latter two documents are proffer letters that defendant Mark Nathanson submitted to the government demonstrating his alleged cooperation with and assistance to the government. Nathanson attached these letters to support his August 24, 1994 Rule 35 motion to reduce his sentence. At the December 7, 1999 hearing, the district court adopted the redactions proposed by the government and by Nathanson.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\"><em>The Bee </em>has a presumed constitutional right of access to the. proffer letters that were filed with Nathanson\u2019s Rule 35 motion. In <em>CBS, Inc. v. U.S. District Court for the Central District of California </em>we recognized a constitutional right of access to \u201cdocuments filed in support of motions for reduction of sentence,\u201d holding that because \u201cnothing in [Rule 35]\u2019s language, history, or judicial interpretation\u201d suggests a presumption of confidentiality, \u201cthe general presumption of openness will prevail.\u201d 765 F.2d 823, 826 (9th Cir.1985). The government\u2019s attempt to characterize the proffer letters as atypical Rule 35 documents, likening them to confidential grand jury materials, is unpersuasive. Because the presumption of openness attached to the proffer letters when Nathan-son filed them in support of his Rule 35 motion, the district court\u2019s order unsealing redacted versions of the proffer letters must survive a strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>In reviewing an order denying access to presumptively open court documents, we require the satisfaction of \u201cboth the procedural and the substantive requirements of the first amendment.\u201d <em>Oregonian Publishing Co. v. U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, </em>920 F.2d 1462, 1466 (9th Cir.1990). Presumptively open court records can be closed only if: (1) closing them serves a compelling interest; (2) there is a substantial probability that, in the absence of closing them, this compelling interest would be harmed; and (3) there are no alternatives to closing them that would adequately protect the compelling interest. <em>Oregonian Publishing, </em>920 F.2d at 1466 (citing <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California for the County of Riverside, </em>478 U.S. 1, 13-14, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)). \u201cThe court may not base its decision on conclusory assertions alone, but must make specific factual findings .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>478 U.S. at 13-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Here, the district court\u2019s findings, stated in their entirety, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">The interest to be preserved, among other things, are the safety of the defendant, his well-being. And also the reputation of other people that the government has concluded there is no evidence to suggest were guilty of crimes but were nevertheless accused of crimes. Both of those, it appears to me, to be sufficient to justify the redaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The district court\u2019s reliance on the first interest was in error since the government concedes that it is unable to identify specific facts indicating that Nathanson\u2019s safety would be in greater jeopardy should each of the proffer letters be unsealed in its entirety. Nor did the district court identify any facts. Indeed, the district court did not identify any facts whatsoever to support its redactions under either allegedly compelling interest. Thus, whether the reputational interest cited by the district court is a compelling interest that overcomes the presumed right of access and justifies the redactions is a question that we cannot answer because the district court failed to \u201cmake specific factual findings\u201d capable of appellate review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Mandamus is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that should be invoked only in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1464. The guidelines for determining whether mandamus relief is appropriate are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">(1) whether the petitioner has no other adequate means, such as direct appeal, to obtain the requested relief;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">(2) whether the damage or prejudice to the petitioner is such that it will not be correctable on appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-13\">(3) whether the district court\u2019s order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">(4) whether the district court\u2019s order is an oft-repeated error or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-15\">(5) whether the district court\u2019s order raises new and important problems or issues of first impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-16\"><em>Bauman v. U.S. District Court, </em>557 F.2d 650, 654-55 (9th Cir.1977). \u201c[R]arely if ever will a case arise where all the guidelines point in the same direction or even where each guideline is applicable. The considerations are cumulative and proper disposition will often require a balancing of conflicting indicators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. However, although all five factors need not be satisfied in order for mandamus to issue, \u201cit is clear that the third factor, the existence of clear error as a matter of law, is dispositive.\u201d <em>Calderon v. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, </em>134 F.3d 981, 983-84 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">Here, because <em>The Bee </em>as a non-party-in-interest intervenor lacks standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to appeal the district court\u2019s order, the first and second factors are satisfied. The third factor is also satisfied. The district court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply the evidentiary requirements of <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We grant <em>The </em>Bee\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus and remand the case for the district court to consider whether the privacy interest of third parties, by itself, justified the redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The order of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this memorandum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\">.
