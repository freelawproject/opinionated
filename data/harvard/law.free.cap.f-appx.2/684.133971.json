Plaintiff alleged that defendants violated his constitutional rights and state law by terminating him based on false charges without a fair hearing. Upon de novo review of the record before the District Court, we agree with the Court that, as an at-will employee, see <em>Ball v. Ark. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Punishment, </em>178 Ark. 230, 10 S.W.2d 873, 876 (Ark.2000), plaintiff did not have a liberty or property interest in his employment and thus could not state a section 1983 claim against defendants, see <em>Rogerson v. Hot Springs Adver, and Promotion Comm\u2019n, </em>237 F.3d 929, 930-32 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Roark v. City of Hazen, </em>189 F.3d 758, 761 (8th Cir.1999). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims, but we modify the dismissal of those claims to be without prejudice. See <em>Labickas v. Ark. State Univ., </em>78 F.3d 333, 334 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\">.
