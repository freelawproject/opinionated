The government\u2019s motion to submit this appeal without oral argument is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">Jose Hernandez-Gomez appeals the 120-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute schedule II narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">Hernandez-Gomez argues for the first time on appeal that his indictment fails to set forth the specific penalty provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) under which he was charged, and is therefore in contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is without merit for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">First, the district court sentenced Hernandez-Gomez in accordance with the sufficiently pled indictment. <em>United States v. Wuco, </em>535 F.2d 1200, 1202, n. 1 (9th Cir. 1976) (\u201cIt is the statement of facts in the pleading rather than the statutory citation, that is controlling, and if an indictment or information properly charges an offense under the laws of the United States it is sufficient .... \u201d). The indictment charged Hernandez-Gomez with, <em>intra alia, </em>conspiracy to distribute \u201ca mixture and substance weighing at least 500 grams and containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. The district court, relying on the amount of drugs stated in both the indictment and the plea agreement, sentenced Hernandez-Gomez to ten-years of incarceration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii) (applicable to distribution of 500 grams or more of methamphetamine).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">Second, and more importantly, Hernandez-Gomez\u2019 sentence does not run afoul of <em>Apprendi </em>because it falls substantially below the statutory maximum applicable where an indictment fails to state any amount of narcotics involved. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (prescribing \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>more than twenty years for distribution of a detectable amount of a schedule II narcotic, including methamphetamine\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>227 F.3d 1125, 1129-30 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by, </em>234 F.3d 483, 487-90 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require reversal when defendant\u2019s sentence is less than the statutory maximum for the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-24\">.
