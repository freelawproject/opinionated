We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-23\">We review de novo a grant of summary judgment. <em>See Warren v. City of Carlsbad, </em>58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-24\">Because Vallejo City Unified School District is a state agency, <em>see Belanger v. Madera Unified Sch. Dist., </em>963 F.2d 248, 254 (9th Cir.1992), and Bankston has not established a waiver of sovereign immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>or consent to suit, the district court did not err by granting Vallejo City Unified School District\u2019s motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>see Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 99-100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Because Bankston failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truth of defendants\u2019 proffered reasons for her dismissal, the district court did not err by dismissing her section 1981 and 1983 claims. <em>See Peters v. Lieuallen, </em>746 F.2d 1390, 1393 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Because Bankston is a probationary teacher, the district court did nor err by dismissing her due process claim. <em>See Clements v.

Round Valley Teacher\u2019s Assoc. </em>13 Cal.4th 269, 52 Cal.Rptr.2d 115, 914 P.2d 193, 202-03 (Cal.1996) (a probationary teacher does not have a property interest protected by the due process clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Because Bankston failed to provide evidence of a race, class-based or invidiously discriminatory animus, the district court did not err by dismissing her section 1985 claim. <em>See Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102-03, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Because Bankston\u2019s federal claims were dismissed before trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state claims. <em>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">We decline to consider the harassment and defamation claims raised by Bankston for the first time on appeal. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Because a frivolous argument is insufficient to support an award of sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, we deny defendants\u2019 request. <em>See Estate of Blas v. Winkler, </em>792 F.2d 858, 860 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Appellees\u2019 request for attorney fees and cost under Fed.
