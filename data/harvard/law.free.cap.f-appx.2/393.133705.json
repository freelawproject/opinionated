Phillips contends that the ALJ did not use the proper legal standard in determining that he did not suffer from pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision if it correctly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. <em>Doss v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 58 </em>F.3d 654, 658 (4th Cir. 1995). Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. The ALJ\u2019s finding that the x-ray evidence did not establish pneumoconiosis was supported by substantial evidence. Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s finding that the medical opinions were in equipoise was also supported by substantial evidence. In addition, the ALJ\u2019s review of the record was not in conflict with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Phillips v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Corp., </em>BRB No. 99-1017-BLA (B.R.B. June 29, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
