We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and will uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits if it is based upon the proper legal standards, and is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moncada v. Chater, </em>60 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Based on the medical evidence, the findings of treating and examining physicians, Oden\u2019s testimony about his daily activities, and the testimony of the vocational expert, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 523-24 (finding substantial evidence in a treating physician\u2019s report, medical examinations, and the testimony of a vocational expert).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Oden\u2019s new evidence brought in the district court regarding a rehabilitation plan for reemployment is not material because there is no reasonable possibility that it would have changed the Commissioner\u2019s determination. <em>See Booz v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1380 (9th Cir.1984). Because Oden\u2019s new evidence is not material, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to remand on the basis of new evidence. <em>See Clem v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Because Oden has not shown exceptional circumstances, we decline to consider the issue of whether his disability reviews were scheduled too close together raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Matney v. Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aap\">.
