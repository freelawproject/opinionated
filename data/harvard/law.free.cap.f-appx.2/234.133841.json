Kimberlin appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) petition. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Kimberlin v. Dewalt, </em>No. CA-99-1547-2 (E.D.Va. July 12, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In addition, we decline to consider the claims Kimberlin raises for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that issues raised for first time on appeal generally will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justice). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-16\"> Although the district court\u2019s order is marked as \"filed\u201d on July 11, 2000, the district court\u2019s record shows that it was entered on the docket sheet on July 12, 2000. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the judgment or order was entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court's decision. <em>Wilson v. Murray, </em>806 F.2d 1232, 1234-35 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
