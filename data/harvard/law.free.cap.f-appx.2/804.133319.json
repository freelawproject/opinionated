We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">Saldana-Mendoza contends that his 57-month sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the district court enhanced his sentence based on prior convictions for aggravated felonies which were not charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt, nor did Saldana-Mendoza admit the fact of his prior felony convictions. We review the question of whether <em>Apprendi </em>requires that Saldana-Mendoza be resentenced for plain error. <em>See United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">Saldana-Mendoza\u2019s contention is foreclosed by our ruling in <em>United States v. Packeco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that under <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>recidivism increasing the maximum penalty need not be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-20\">.
