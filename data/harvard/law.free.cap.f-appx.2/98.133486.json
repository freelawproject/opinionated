Estate of Albert B. Grossman, </em>206 F.3d 172, 177-78 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 824, 121 S.Ct. 68, 148 L.Ed.2d 33 (2000), we see no abuse of discretion in the transfer, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 179 (transfer of venue renewable only for abuse of discretion); <em>Red Bull Associates v. Best Western International, Inc., </em>862 F.2d 963, 967 (2d Cir.1988), and we affirm that ruling substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Droney\u2019s Ruling and Order dated February 3, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
