The BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that property fraudulently transferred by Kenneth Poole, the debtor in the underlying case, actually belonged in his bankruptcy estate, but reversed the court\u2019s finding that the statute of limitations for the avoidance of one of the fraudulent transfers was equitably tolled. We have jurisdiction over appeals from the BAP pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">Decisions of the BAP are subject to de novo review. <em>Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Bd. (In re Mitchell), </em>209 F.3d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir.2000). We therefore independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>The bankruptcy court did not err in including various assets transferred to other entities in Poole and Poole, Inc.\u2019s estates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Poole\u2019s use and enjoyment of items of property nominally owned by others, his active involvement in running Delta Marine, and Brix\u2019s understanding that Delta Marine and Poole, Inc. were essentially the same company support the court\u2019s conclusion that Poole had \u201cat least equitable interest\u201d in the numerous items of property, including the revenue earned under the Brix/Delta Marine contract. Accordingly, we affirm the decision to include all the disputed items of property in the bankruptcy estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Moreover, the bankruptcy court\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cequitable interest,\u201d indicates that the court included the property under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1), which includes in the bankruptcy estate \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d We therefore reject Hannah\u2019s argument that the court relied only on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(3) in order to include the fraudulently transferred property in the estates. Because the property was properly included in the bankruptcy estates under \u00a7 541(a)(1), the issue of whether the statute of limitations in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546, for bringing an action to avoid a fraudulent transfer, was equitably tolled does not affect the conclusion that the assets are property of the bankruptcy estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s money judgment against Poole and Hannah was predicated on revenue generated by the Brix contract, minus the proceeds from the sale of items purchased with that revenue <em>(e.g., </em>the Ken-worth truck, the yacht, and the airplane), and minus money in the Smith Barney accounts. The BAP reversed that money judgment because it concluded that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in tolling the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations, however, was inapplicable because the proceeds that comprised the money judgment were generated from the Brix contract and those proceeds remained property of the bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(a)(1); thus, it was unnecessary to bring them back into the estate by pursuit of fraudulent transfers under \u00a7 501(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Accordingly, the BAP\u2019s reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s money judgment is REVERSED and the judgment of the bankruptcy court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
