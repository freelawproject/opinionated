We lack jurisdiction and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Felix-Contreras contends that his written waiver of appeal is unenforceable because the district court\u2019s comments at his change of plea hearing reinstated his right to appeal. We review the validity of his waiver of appeal de novo, <em>see United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998), and conclude that the waiver is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">Felix-Contreras entered into a plea agreement stating that he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waive[d] his right to file an appeal in this case.\u201d At the change of plea hearing, the district court reminded him of this waiver and stated that, \u201cas long as you receive a sentence that is within your guidelines you would not have the right to appeal this case.\u201d We disagree with Felix-Contreras\u2019 contention that these comments reinstated his right to appeal. <em>See Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d at 977 (distinguishing <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir.1995), because the district court did not advise defendant of the right to appeal but rather that he waived some or all of his statutory rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-18\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-22\">.
