Counsel has filed a brief stating that he can identify no issues for review under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Sterioti has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">Because Sterioti has served his term of incarceration upon revocation, the appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Palomba, </em>182 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that defendant\u2019s challenge to his completed sentence was moot). We therefore lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 15, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Palomba, </em>182 F.3d at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">The motion of counsel to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-18\">.
