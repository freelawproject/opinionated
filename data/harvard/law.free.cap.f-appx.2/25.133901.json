We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">Debra Sellers (who dated D\u2019Amario once or twice) obtained an abuse prevention order against D\u2019Amario from a Massachusetts state court, on the ground that D\u2019Amario was harassing her. Thereafter, she received two printed anonymous cards which she believed were sent by D\u2019Amario. In February 1999, Attleboro, Massachusetts police obtained a search warrant for evidence that D\u2019Amario had produced the cards, i.e., \u201cany typewriter, computer, word processor, printer, typewriter ribbons, computer ribbons, computer discs, computer software, hard drive computer components or any other component or part of any instrument or machine capable of producing a printed document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-19\">D\u2019Amario lived in Smithfield, Rhode Island and the search was conducted by both Attleboro, Massachusetts and Smithfield, Rhode Island police. The police seized a typewriter and ribbons and, thereafter, while searching in a dresser drawer, found a firearm and ammunition. One of the officers knew at that time that D\u2019Amario had previous convictions in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and that at least one of those convictions resulted in a sentence longer than one year. The officers seized the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-20\">At the time of this search, D\u2019Amario was on probation from both the Massachusetts and Rhode Island convictions and he was arrested a few days after the search and held on Rhode Island state charges of violating his probation. Eventually, he was charged in federal court with being a felon-in-possession, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). D\u2019Amario and the government stipulated that (1) he had a prior felony conviction; (2) the weapon met the definition of a firearm; and (3) the gun had traveled in interstate commerce prior to his possession. Nonetheless, D\u2019Amario went to trial before a jury. In essence, he apparently hoped for jury nul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>lification. Although the element of \u201cknowing possession\u201d of the firearm meant that the government only had to prove that D\u2019Amario knew that the weapon was a firearm and voluntarily and intentionally possessed it \u2014 something that D\u2019Amario did not contest \u2014 D\u2019Amario sought to show that the firearm was legally purchased in 1987, i.e., before his felony conviction, and that he thereafter simply failed to dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">D\u2019Amario was convicted and sentenced to 18 months. The sentence reflected a downward departure of one level, giving consideration to the fact that D\u2019Amario\u2019s possession of a weapon, unloaded, in a drawer for twelve years appeared to have been passive, i.e., there was no indication that D\u2019Amario had ever used or brandished the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We discuss D\u2019Amario\u2019s appellate issues in the same order in which he has presented them.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">1. <em>Entitlement to judgment of acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Whether or not, for purposes of precluding the possession of firearms, Rhode Island law makes a distinction between felons convicted of violent versus nonviolent felonies is irrelevant. Section 922(g)(1), which prohibits previously convicted felons from possessing a firearm, makes no such distinction between defendants convicted of violent versus nonviolent felonies. <em>See United States v. Chamberlain, </em>159 F.3d 656, 660 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Tavares, </em>21 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (en banc). The government did not need to prove that D\u2019Amario knowingly violated the law; it only needed to prove that D\u2019Amario knowingly possessed the firearm, which D\u2019Amario effectively conceded in his testimony. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>940 F.2d 710, 713 (1st Cir.1991). Moreover, we have previously rejected a theory of defense in a \u00a7 922(g)(1) prosecution based on a defendant\u2019s claim that he had not been advised that he could not possess firearms under federal law and believed that a state\u2019s issuance of a Firearms Identification card, allowing the possession of a firearm under state law, gave him the right to possess firearms. <em>See United States v. Caron, </em>64 F.3d 713, 714-17 (1st Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1027, 116 S.Ct. 2569, 135 L.Ed.2d 1085 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">2. <em>Request for a continuance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">There was no abuse of discretion, much less \u201ca manifest abuse of discretion,\u201d in the district court\u2019s denial of D\u2019Amario\u2019s request for a continuance. <em>See United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, </em>229 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.2000) (reciting standard). The request was tardily filed and no issue regarding a continuance was even mentioned when D\u2019Amario had the opportunity to do so at a telephonic conference held the week before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">3. <em>The competency examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">D\u2019Amario\u2019s complaints regarding the competency examination appear baseless as well as moot. Moreover, this court has already reviewed and rejected these complaints. <em>See In re D\u2019Amario, </em>No. 99-1724 (1st Cir. July 23,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">4. <em>Jury instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">By failing to reassert his objection after the instructions were given, D\u2019Amario has waived consideration of it. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, </em>950 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991). And, there was no plain error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as requested. Contrary to his contention, the Ninth Circuit, in fact, has <em>rejected </em>the assertions proffered by D\u2019Amario with respect to the interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>transportation of firearms, both as to the requirement that the movement have \u201crecently\u201d occurred and the subsumed assertion that the issue of time is a jury question. <em>See United States v. Casterline, </em>103 F.3d 76, 77 (9th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 835, 118 S.Ct. 106, 139 L.Ed.2d 60 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">5. <em>The motion to suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">D\u2019Amario reasserts his contentions that the evidence of the gun should have been suppressed because the search warrant lacked probable cause and the gun was outside the scope of the warrant. We review, de novo, a district court\u2019s determination that a given set of facts constituted probable cause, but defer to the court\u2019s findings of fact, unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 272, 148 L.Ed.2d 198 (2000). Upon our review, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of D\u2019Amario\u2019s motion to suppress. We need say little beyond that said by the district court in its order of November 3, 1999. The so-called \u201cCat-low report\u201d does not contradict Sergeant Collins\u2019s statements of what he knew at the time of the search and does not warrant overturning the district court\u2019s refusal to reopen the suppression matter on the basis of that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">6. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">A district court is not authorized to award credit at sentencing; it is the Attorney General who computes the amount of credit <em>after </em>a defendant begins his federal sentence. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). D\u2019Amario\u2019s course of relief is to exhaust administrative remedies with the Bureau of Prisons and, if dissatisfied, to seek judicial review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>at 335, 112 S.Ct. 1351; <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>180 F.3d 349, 357-58 (1st Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1126, 120 S.Ct. 958, 145 L.Ed.2d 831 (2000). Contrary to D\u2019Amario\u2019s assertion, <em>United States v. Benefield, </em>942 F.2d 60 (1st Cir.1991), is not a \u201cvirtually identical situation,\u201d and, in any event, the Sixth Circuit opinion, upon which we relied, was subsequently reversed in <em>Wilson. </em>D\u2019Amario\u2019s suggestion that his counsel was ineffective in not getting his state sentence imposed prior to the federal sentencing is no more than a passing reference, was not presented below, and would require further factual exposition. As such, it is not sufficiently developed for consideration on this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>69 F.3d 1215, 1225 (1st Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1115, 116 S.Ct. 1343, 134 L.Ed.2d 492 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">D\u2019Amario argues error by the district court in denying his request for a two level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Contrary to D\u2019Amario\u2019s contention, however, the district court did not erroneously believe that D\u2019Amario was ineligible for such a reduction because he elected to go to trial. Rather, it is evident that the court did not find this to be one of the \u201c \u2018rare situations\u2019 [in which] a defendant may elect to exercise his right to trial and still be eligible for a reduction\u201d for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>168 F.3d 558, 564 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, application (n.2)). We review the district court\u2019s refusal to award a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>See United States v. Carrington, </em>96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1150, 117 S.Ct. 1328, 137 L.Ed.2d 489 (1997). D\u2019Amario has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">7. <em>Allegedly \u201cnewly available\u201d evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">This claim, presented in cursory fashion, in any event, is not properly be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>fore this court. <em>See United States v. Graciani, </em>61 F.3d 70, 77 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">While this appeal has been pending, D\u2019Amario has filed several miscellaneous motions. In light of our disposition of this appeal, we <em>deny </em>the motions for release pending appeal and for summary reversal. We also <em>deny, </em>as moot, the motion to expedite this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>The conviction and the sentence are affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
