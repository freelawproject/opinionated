Hitz pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 168 months im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>prisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, Mr. Hitz challenges the court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with the offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and a three-level enhancement for being a manager or supervisor of the criminal activity that involved five or more participants, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B.l.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We conclude the district court did not clearly err in determining Mr. Hitz possessed a firearm in connection with the offense, given the testimony at sentencing that he provided a gun as payment for drugs. <em>See United States v. Womack, </em>191 F.3d 879, 885 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Newton, </em>184 F.3d 955, 957-58 (8th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Likewise, we conclude the court did not clearly err in applying the aggravating-role enhancement, given the testimony at sentencing that Mr. Hitz regularly had people drive him around during his drug transactions, that he provided for his drivers\u2019 living expenses and gave them drugs without charging, that he provided money to others to rent hotel rooms where drug deals occurred, and that he directed one of his drivers to hold some drugs because police officers were near. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (nn.1-2); <em>United States v. Hyatt, </em>207 F.3d 1036, 1038 (8th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>47 F.3d 272, 277 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-17\">. The Honorable Warren K.
