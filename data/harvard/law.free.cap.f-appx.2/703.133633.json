Halverson filed an application for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, asserting lower back pain disabled him. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Halverson is not disabled. The Appeals Council considered additional evidence and denied Halverson\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s ruling the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. Halverson then filed this action in the district court, which affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Halverson appeals. Contrary to Halverson\u2019s assertions, the ALJ properly formulated Halverson\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ gave the appropriate weight to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions, the ALJ properly found Halverson\u2019s impairments did not meet the Commissioner\u2019s listing for disorders of the spine for twelve consecutive months, the ALJ properly developed the record and evaluated Halverson\u2019s credibility, and the ALJ properly relied on vocational expert testimony to find Halverson is not disabled. Because substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
