Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 submissions, we conclude that Dr. Fuller waived his right to a jury trial by failing to make a timely request for one, that the district court did not \u201camend\u201d his complaint by liberally interpreting it for purposes of reviving his right to request a jury trial, and that the court did not abuse its discretion by declining to order a jury trial on Dr. Fuller\u2019s subsequent motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b), 39(b). We also reject Dr. Fuller\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying him leave to amend, and we find that the partial grant of summary judgment was proper. <em>See Dirden v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>86 F.3d 112, 114 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (\u00a7 1981 plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent); <em>Fitzgerald v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>68 F.3d 1257, 1262-63 (10th Cir.1995) (applying doctrine of respondeat superior to \u00a7 1981 action; employer is responsible only for intentional wrongs of employees committed in furtherance of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-25\">. The Honorable D.
