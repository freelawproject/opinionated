His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1968), raising three issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Williams was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has failed to do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-24\">We find no error in Williams\u2019 Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. We also conclude that we lack authority to review Williams\u2019 sentence, which was at the low end of the properly calculated guidelines range and far below the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). Finally, we are also without authority to review the sentencing court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019 request for a downward departure based upon family ties and responsibilities be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>cause the sentencing court was aware of its authority to depart and simply declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
