Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">McDonald Newkirk, a retired rail janitor for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) who served as an elected board member of the CTA\u2019s union, Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 308, was suspended from his position by Local 308\u2019s president, Jerry Williams. Believing the suspension resulted from his publication of a newsletter critical of Williams\u2019s job performance, Newkirk urged Local 308 to investigate. When the local refused to charge Williams with any wrongdoing, Newkirk brought this suit against Williams and Local 308 alleging various violations of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-531, and the ATU\u2019s constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that the 'local was not governed by the LMRDA. This analysis is correct. The LMRDA governs only \u201clabor organizations\u201d and their officers, and defines a \u201clabor organization\u201d as a group that handles labor disputes with employers, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(i). \u201cEmployer,\u201d as the term is defined by the statute, excludes states and their political subdivisions, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e); the CTA is such a subdivision, 70 ILCS 3605/3. The defendants\u2019 averment that Local 308 includes only CTA employees is uncontradicted. Local 308 is not a labor organization, so the grant of summary judgment for the defendants on the LMRDA claims was proper. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. McCombe, </em>99 F.3d 352, 353 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (labor organizations composed entirely of public sector employees are not \u201clabor organizations\u201d for purposes of LMRDA; collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Newkirk\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint to add a claim that Williams and Local 308 violated the ATU\u2019s constitution. Newkirk did not need the court\u2019s permission to amend his complaint, however, because the defendants had not yet filed a responsive pleading. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (party may amend pleading once as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is served); <em>La Batt v. Twomey, </em>513 F.2d 641, 651 (7th Cir. 1975) (weight of authority indicates that a motion for summary judgment is not a responsive pleading).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
