The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to the trustees. The district court recognized the trust document granted the trustees \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to manage the trust property, including payment of trust income to \u201cany one or more (whether all or less than all) of the members of the group consisting of the Beneficiaries,\u201d and held as a matter of law that the trustees did not breach their fiduciary duty in exercising their discretion. On appeal, the beneficiaries argue the district court committed error in granting summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact and the court denied them meaningful discovery. The beneficiaries also contend the district court should have granted their request for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">We review a grant of summary judgment under a well-established standard. Because this is a diversity action, we review de novo questions of state law. Having considered the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we are satisfied the district court correctly applied the controlling state law, and the record supports the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. We also reject the beneficiaries\u2019 contention that the district court should have granted their request for class certification. Because the parties\u2019 submissions show they are thoroughly familiar with the issues before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>court, we conclude that an extensive discussion in this diversity case would serve no useful purpose. We thus affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned rulings without further discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\"> The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
