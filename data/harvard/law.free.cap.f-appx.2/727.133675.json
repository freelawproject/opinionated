Based on the language of the City\u2019s termination letter and the testimony of the City\u2019s human resources director, Kaplan raised a genuine issue of fact that the City regarded him as unable to perform any peace officer position in the State of Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In Nevada, the term \u201cpeace officer\u201d encompasses a vast array of different jobs, Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 289.150-289.360, involving similar training and skills. Nev. Admin. Code, ch. 289, \u00a7\u00a7 130-160. Although the \u201cinability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working,\u201d the inability to perform a \u201cclass of jobs\u201d as compared to the average person with comparable training, skills and abilities can constitute such a limitation. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i). When comparing the job which Kaplan was regarded as unable to perform versus the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge and skills from which Kaplan would also be disqualified, we find that \u201cpeace officer\u201d describes a sufficiently broad \u201cclass of jobs\u201d under these regulations. <em>See Sutton v.
