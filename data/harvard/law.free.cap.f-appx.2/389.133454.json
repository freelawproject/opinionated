He appeals his conviction and sentence. Daft\u2019s attorney on appeal has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that Daft\u2019s former attorney did not provide effective assistance at trial but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Daft filed a pro se supplemental brief, also asserting that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claim in a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000). <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>See King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. We find that the record in the instant ease does not conclusively establish that Daft\u2019s former counsel was ineffective. Therefore, we do not address this issue on direct appeal. Daft may assert his claim in a \u00a7 2255 habeas motion, if he so chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Therefore, we dismiss this appeal. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion- must state that a copy thereof was sei-ved on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
