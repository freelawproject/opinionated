An administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded Baxter could not return to his past relevant work, but he retained the residual functional capacity to perform other work, and thus was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ\u2019s ruling the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security. Baxter then sought judicial review, and the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> held substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision. On appeal, Baxter contends he is disabled because he meets the criteria in Listing 1.03 for arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint. Having carefully considered the record, we affirm for the reasons given by the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\"> The Honorable Henry L.
