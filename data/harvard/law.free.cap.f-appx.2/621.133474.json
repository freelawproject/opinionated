The state court denied Cota\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause after a hearing in January 1997. A superseding indictment was issued in late February 1997; the state court denied Cota\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of probable cause in October. Trial commenced in February 1998. The court denied Cota\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s evidence. The jury acquitted him on all counts. Cota then brought this civil action against a Polk County Deputy Sheriff, an Agent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and the Bureau, alleging federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and numerous claims under state law. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims. Cota appeals the dismissal of two \u00a7 1983 claims \u2014 that he was arrested without probable cause, and that he was subjected to unconstitutional post-arrest interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The district court dismissed Cota\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim of arrest without probable cause on the ground that \u201ccollateral estoppel bars plaintiff from challenging the state court\u2019s findings with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence used to support probable cause for his arrest.\u201d <em>See generally Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 104-05, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). On appeal, Cota argues that he is challenging the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the evidence supporting probable cause, not the sufficiency of that evidence. But his discussion of the issue belies that contention. After careful review of the sparee record on appeal, we- affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order. <em>See </em>8th Cir. Rule 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The district court dismissed Cota\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim challenging his post-arrest interrogation on the ground that \u201cthe only remedy for a <em>Miranda </em>violation is the exclusion from evidence of any compelled testimony arising therefrom.\u201d That is clearly the law of this Circuit. <em>See Warren v. City of Lincoln, </em>864 F.2d 1436, 1442 (8th Cir.1989) (en banc). To avoid that ruling, Cota argues on appeal that the interrogation violated his Sixth Amendment rights because those rights had \u201cattached\u201d under <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 629-30, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986), and that his due process rights were violated by the unconstitutionally coercive -interrogation. The district court observed that Cota, though represented by counsel, had failed to articulate which of his constitutional rights had been violated. Thus, his new contentions on appeal were not properly presented to the district court. In addition, the record on appeal does not support his conclusory assertions of a Sixth Amendment violation or the use of unconstitutionally coercive interrogation methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\">.
