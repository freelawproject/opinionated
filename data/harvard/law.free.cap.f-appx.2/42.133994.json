In a report and recommendation dated March 8, 2000, Magistrate Judge James Muirhead recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) &amp; (b) (providing for dismissal on preliminary review of prisoner complaints against government officers or employees if the complaints do not state a claim for relief). In an order dated March 20, 2000, District Judge Steven McAuliffe approved the recommendation and dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>On appeal, Michaud argues that his complaint adequately alleged a civil action under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). In his report, Magistrate Judge Muirhead concluded that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to show a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d We agree, as is explained next.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Michaud contends that the complaint alleged acts of mail fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(B) (defining \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to include, in pertinent part, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, pertaining to mail fraud, \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1510, and 1511, pertaining to certain obstructions of justice, and \u00a7 1951, pertaining to extortion). But, even if we construe his complaint in the most generous fashion possible, he has alleged at best one predicate act of mail fraud (the alteration of mail sent to his daughter) with the requisite specificity. <em>Id. </em>(5) (defining \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d to require \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity\u201d within a designated time frame); <em>Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, </em>118 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir.1997) (stating that a RICO complaint alleging mail fraud must, in conformity with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), \u201cstate the time, place and content of the alleged mail ... communications perpetrating that fraud\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1148, 118 S.Ct. 1165, 140 L.Ed.2d 176 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Martin, </em>694 F.2d 885, 889-90 (1st Cir.1982) (noting that \u00a7 1341 extends to persons who \u201ctake or receive\u201d things from the mail and affirming conviction of defendant who had intercepted and altered mailings between insurance companies and purchasers pursuant to scheme to defraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">As for the other alleged acts of mail fraud, the allegations in the complaint either lack the requisite specificity, <em>see Ahmed, supra, </em>or describe unrelated conduct that was unlikely to have continued for very long. <em>See Efron v. Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc., </em>223 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2000) (indicating that RICO plaintiff must show that the requisite racketeering acts are related and \u201camount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity\u201d) (citing <em>H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1228, 149 L.Ed.2d 138 (2001). In addition, the complaint does not allege conduct by the defendants that would be indictable under the relevant extortion or obstruction of justice statutes. <em>See Evans v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 255, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992) (holding that a violation under the \u201ccolor of official right\u201d portion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 would require a showing \u201cthat a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts\u201d); <em>O\u2019Malley v. New York City Transit Authority, </em>896 F.2d 704, 708 (2d Cir.1990) (rejecting RICO claim predicated on obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 where alleged obstruction occurred in state and not federal courts).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-15\">. The district judge issued his order several days before Michaud filed his objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Because the record does not establish when Michaud <em>received </em>the report and recommendation (the date that would trigger the start of the filing period), we cannot evaluate whether the objections were timely. Accordingly, we give Michaud the benefit of the doubt, assume that he timely filed objections to the report, and proceed to evaluate his appellate claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-13\">. The complaint also alleges obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1510 and 1511, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>fails to make any factual allegation suggesting any conduct that would be indictable under the plain language of the relevant statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
