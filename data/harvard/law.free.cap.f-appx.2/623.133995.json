Kim LUCKETT, Chief of Security, Womens\u2019 Unit, Arkansas Department of Correction; Ray Hobbs, Assistant Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; Virginia Wallace, Warden, Tucker Womens\u2019 Unit, Arkansas Department of Correction; Max Mobley, Assistant Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; John Doe, 1-10, Healthcare Providers and/or ADC Employees, Appellees.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b653-8\">No. 99-4237.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b653-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b653-10\">Submitted Jan. 30, 2001.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b653-11\">Decided Feb. 5, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b653-19\">Before BOWMAN, BEAM, and LOKEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b653-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-22\">Arkansas inmate Elizabeth Gammon Brown appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entry of judgment against her, after a jury trial, in her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action in which she had claimed that certain prison officials failed to follow medical orders related to drinking water, winter gear, and other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-23\">Brown essentially challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by arguing that the jury came to an incorrect conclusion about appellees\u2019 knowledge of her medical needs, but we find no plain error in the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Williams v. Kansas City, Mo., </em>223 F.3d 749, 752-53 (8th Cir.2000) (holding that litigant who fails to move for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>judgment as a matter of law at close of evidence cannot later argue, either in post-trial motion or on appeal, that verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence; jury verdict will be reversed only if it results in manifest miscarriage of justice). The jury could have concluded that none of the appellees deliberately and personally interfered with her prescribed medical treatment, or intentionally failed to take reasonable measures to deal with the prison staff\u2019s alleged failure to provide Brown medically prescribed items or other basic necessities. <em>See Morse v. Southern Union Co., </em>174 F.3d 917, 923 (8th Cir.) (explaining that jury\u2019s function is to consider competing evidence), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>527 U.S. 1059, 120 S.Ct. 29, 144 L.Ed.2d 832 (1999); <em>Vaughan v. Lacey, </em>49 F.3d 1344, 1346 (8th Cir.1995) (holding that deliberate indifference may include intentionally interfering with prescribed treatment or medication); <em>Boyd v. Knox, </em>47 F.3d 966, 968 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983 arises if supervisor knowingly facilitated, approved, condoned, or turned a blind eye to unconstitutional conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We also reject Brown\u2019s contentions as to instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">. The Honorable Henry Woods, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
