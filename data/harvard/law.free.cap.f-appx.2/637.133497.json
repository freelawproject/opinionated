New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-19\">In July 1999, Maglothin agreed to buy one pound of methamphetamine (meth) from a confidential government informant. The informant placed a briefcase with a pound of meth in Maglothin\u2019s car at a restaurant in Springfield, Arkansas. When Maglothin left the restaurant, government agents intercepted him at a stop light. Maglothin revved his engine and evaded the agents\u2019 roadblock. A brief high-speed chase ensued; the chase ended when Maglothin crashed his car. He lit the interior of the car on fire with a gas canister, then rolled from the burning car and was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-20\">Maglothin entered into a plea agreement with the government and pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute meth, a violation of 21 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 <em>&amp; </em>846. As part of the deal, the government agreed to move for a downward departure at sentencing if Maglothin fully cooperated by providing agents with information leading to further investigations. In the months before sentencing, Maglothin was twice debriefed by FBI agents, but the agents investigating Maglothin\u2019s leads found them stale and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>unhelpful. Consequently, the government elected not to move for a downward departure at sentencing. After the Probation Office released its Presentence Report (PSR), Maglothin moved to withdraw his guilty plea. He argued that the government had prevented him from providing meaningful cooperation by refusing to release him from jail. Maglothin also objected to substantial portions of the PSR. The district court denied Maglothin\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and overruled each of his objections to the PSR. The court ascertained a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months, and sentenced Maglothin at the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A defendant may not withdraw his guilty plea on a lark, for that would \u201cdegrade the otherwise serious act of pleading guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>520 U.S. 670, 677, 117 S.Ct. 1630, 137 L.Ed.2d 935 (1997). The district court may permit withdrawal if the defendant shows \u201cany fair and just reason.\u201d Fed R.Crim. P. 32(e). \u201cIf a defendant does not present a fair and just reason for withdrawal of a guilty plea, however, there is no need to examine [additional] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Payton, 168 F.3d 1103, </em>1105 (8th Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 843, 120 S.Ct. 113, 145 L.Ed.2d 96 (1999). In this case, the district court determined that Maglothin did not proffer a single \u201cfair and just reason\u201d to withdraw his plea. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1105 (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Maglothin didn\u2019t raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge in the district court, so we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Poulack, </em>236 F.3d 932, 937-38 (8th Cir.2001). Maglothin\u2019s 168-month prison sentence doesn\u2019t violate due process because the statutory maximum sentence for an indeterminate quantity of meth is 240 months. <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, <em>933-34 </em>(8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). Maglothin appears to raise additional challenges under the rubric of <em>Apprendi; </em>we reject these challenges out of hand. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Finally, Maglothin raises four challenges to the calculation of his sentence under the Guidelines. We review the sentencing court\u2019s fact-findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>212 F.3d 441, 445-46 (8th Cir. 2000). Maglothin contends that the court erroneously attributed a pound of meth to him; that the court erred in denying him a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility; that his sentence should have been reduced for playing a diminished role in the offense; and that the court improperly increased his sentence for risking death or serious bodily injury to another person while fleeing from a law enforcement officer. None of Maglothin\u2019s arguments has merit, and thus we affirm the district court\u2019s determinations of these issues. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-21\">.
