Coleman appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits and supplementary security income. See <em>Coleman v. Apfel, </em>No. CA-98-712-5 (S.D.W.Va. Sept. 3, 1999). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order accepting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the hypothetical question posed by the administrative law judge (ALJ) was not in error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>889 F.2d 47, 50 (4th Cir.1989) (stating that the vocational expert\u2019s testimony \u201cmust be in response to proper hypothetical questions which fairly set out all of the claimant\u2019s impairments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-14\">. A question in the case is whether the ALJ properly credited the restriction of Coleman\u2019s treating pulmonary physician, Dr. Juan M. D\u2019Brot, of lifting up to 10 pounds occasionally and never carrying over 5 pounds (sedentary work) in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567 (defining levels of work). Review of the record indicates that there was conflicting evidence. The State Agency medical consultant recommended that Coleman could occasionally lift 50 pounds and frequently lift 25 pounds (medium work). Because the question posed asked whether Coleman could lift no more than 20 pounds and frequently lift or carry 10 pounds (light work), the ALJ must be taken to have resolved the conflicting recommendations. See <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that ALJ makes findings of fact and resolves conflicts in the evidence). Such resolution was not erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
