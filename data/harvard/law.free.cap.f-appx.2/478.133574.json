Bright, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Frederick M. Shea appeals a district court order dismissing his diversity action filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Seeking monetary and injunctive relief, Shea sued the State Farm Insurance Companies and Amy Aidt, alleging that State Farm had not paid him for injuries he suffered in an automobile collision with Aidt. Over Shea\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Shea\u2019s claims, and dismissed the complaint. Shea subsequently filed several time-tolling, post-judgment motions, which the district court denied. Shea has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Shea\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This court renders de novo review of a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). <em>See Beamon v. Brown, </em>125 F.3d 965, 967 (6th Cir.1997). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over a claim. <em>See Whittle v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 1259, 1262 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">The district court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Shea\u2019s claims. Under \u00a7 1332, federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions involving citizens of different states. However, this diversity jurisdiction has been interpreted to require complete diversity between the parties; the plaintiff cannot be a citizen of the same state as any defendant. <em>See Caudill v. North Am. Media Corp., </em>200 F.3d 914, 916 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. City of White House, </em>36 F.3d 540, 545 (6th Cir.1994). The defendants assert that they both are Ohio citizens, as is Shea. In response to the defendants\u2019 assertions, Shea has not presented any arguments or evidence demonstrating that the defendants are not citizens of Ohio. Therefore, he has not met his burden of establishing complete diversity between the parties, and the district court did not have jurisdiction over Shea\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
