We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. Although Barrow has entered a conditional guilty plea and his plea has been accepted by the district court, he has not yet been sentenced. This Court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1993), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292 (West 1993 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000 ); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order denying Barrow\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute Barrow was charged with violating was unconstitutional is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
