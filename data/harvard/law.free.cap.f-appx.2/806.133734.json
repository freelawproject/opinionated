Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Flores-Mariscal\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that she finds no meritorious issues and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. FloresMariscal has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">The <em>Anders </em>brief identifies two potential issues. The first issue concerns whether the district court complied with the provisions of Rule 11 in accepting Flores-Mariscal\u2019s guilty plea. A review of the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s plea colloquy substantially satisfied the rule\u2019s requirements, and the plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11; <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing the Rule 11 requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-20\">The second potential issue involves whether the district court erred by denying Flores-Mariscal\u2019s request for a downward departure on several grounds. Because the district court exercised its discretion in refusing to depart, we lack jurisdiction to review the its denial. <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>108 F.3d 1156, 1158 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-21\">Our examination of counsel\u2019s brief and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), disclose no further issues for review. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel of record is GRANTED and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b836-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-17\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-24\">. The time in which to file a pro se brief has expired, and no brief was filed. Accordingly, we DENY Flores-Mariscal\u2019s pro se motion for an <em>extension of time to </em>file a supplemental opening brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
