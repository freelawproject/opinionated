He argues that his sentence should be corrected to ensure that it runs concurrently with a previously imposed New York State sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">On June 18, 1998, Colon was indicted and charged with participation in a narcotics conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. After a hearing on June 24, he was ordered detained in federal custody pending trial. On September 18, however, he was transferred to the custody of New York State to face state charges. He pled guilty in state court to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, 5th degree (a felony), and on October 19, was sentenced in state court to 1.5 \u2014 3 years imprisonment. After sentencing he was returned immediately to federal custody to face the pending federal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">On November 23, 1998, he pled guilty to the federal narcotics conspiracy charge, and was remanded to federal custody pending federal sentencing. At the sentencing ten months later, on September 10, 1999, Colon\u2019s counsel alerted Judge McAvoy to the undischarged state court sentence, and counsel for the government acknowledged that the incident forming the basis of the state conviction \u201cis a part of [the federal] conspiracy.\u201d Colon\u2019s counsel accordingly requested that the federal sentence \u201crun concurrent with [the state sentence] so my client is not punished twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-20\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) provides that \u201cif a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is,\u201d like Colon, <em>\u201calready </em>subject to an <em>undischarged </em>term of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Section 5G1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cdescribes (a) the circumstances in which the new sentence on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>a defendant must be consecutive [see \u00a7 5G1.3(a)] ... [,] (b) the circumstances in which the new sentence must be concurrent [see \u00a7 5G1.3(b)]; and it gives the court discretion in instances not covered by (a) or (b) [see \u00a7 5G1.3(c)].\u201d <em>United States v. Labeille-Soto, </em>163 F.3d 93, 98 (2d Cir.1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In the sentencing transcript, the district court \u201crecommend[s]\u201d that the sentence \u201crun <em>concurrent </em>to any state time.\u201d The Judgment itself mandates that the sentences <em>\u201cshall run concurrently.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Colon now claims that the United States Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) has (i) treated the district court\u2019s determination regarding concurrent sentences as a mere recommendation, and (ii) rejected it, deciding instead to impose the sentences <em>consecutively.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He believes that his sentence should be corrected to ensure that it runs concurrently with the state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">We cannot decide the merits of this appeal because Colon failed to file a timely notice of appeal. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) requires that a notice of appeal be filed in the district court within ten days after the entry of judgment appealed from. In Colon\u2019s case, the Judgment was entered on September 13, 1999, and his notice was not filed until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>sixteen days later, on September 29, 1999. A defendant may move in the district court for permission to file a late notice of appeal, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.Pro. 4(b)(4), but Colon did not do so. Colon cannot file such a motion at this stage because the rule \u201callows such motions to be entertained' only during a period of thirty days following the expiration of the original ten-day period.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferraro, </em>992 F.2d 10, 11 (2d Cir.1993); <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.Pro. 4(b)(4). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal requires us to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Ferraro, </em>992 F.2d 10, 11 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">At oral argument, Colon pointed out that in January 2000 we dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute and subsequently ordered that it be reinstated and that new counsel be assigned. These facts are not pertinent. Our reinstatement did not cure the jurisdictional defect, of which we were unaware until we received the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This dismissal is without prejudice to Colon\u2019s rights to seek relief through administrative initiatives within the BOP. <em>See State Institution for Service of Federal Sentence, Designation of, </em>Bureau of Prisons Program Statement # 5160.04, at 2 (April 19, 2000) (\u201cWhen a Federal judge orders ... a Federal term of imprisonment to run concurrently with a state term of imprisonment already imposed, the Bureau implements such order ... ordinarily by designating the state facility as the place to serve the Federal sentence.\u201d (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) (permitting the BOP to designate a non-federal facility as \u201cthe place of the prisoner\u2019s imprisonment\u201d))); <em>see also Sentence Computation Manual, </em>Bureau of Prisons Program Statement # 5880.28 \u00a7 3(e), at 1-32A \u2014 1-33 (July 19, 1999) (Where a federal court \u201corders the federal sentence to be served ... concurrently with[ ] the non-federal ... undischarged term of imprisonment, the prisoner shall be returned to the non-federal jurisdiction until the prisoner is released (completes the undischarged term of imprisonment) from the non-federal term.\u201d). The dismissal is also without prejudice to any right to seek judicial relief under Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 36 (\u201c[Ejrrors in the record arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d), see <em>United States v. Burd, </em>86 F.3d 285, 288-89 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Werber, </em>51 F.3d 342, 346-49 &amp; n. 13 (2d Cir.1995); under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, <em>see Werber, </em>51 F.3d at 349 n. 17; or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, see <em>Werber, </em>51 F.3d at 349 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">For the reasons set forth above, this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. The government argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) and Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3 do not apply to Colon\u2019s sentence because \u201cColon was not yet subject to <em>any </em>undischarged sentence of state incarceration ... at. the time he entered federal custody\u201d in June 1998. This contention is incorrect, for Colon's status \u201cat the time he entered federal custody\u201d is irrelevant. The correct time at which to ascertain whether a defendant is \u201calready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) and Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3 is the moment the federal judge imposes the federal sentence. <em>See McCarthy v. Doe, </em>146 F.3d 118, 121 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Phipps, </em>68 F.3d 159, 163 (7th Cir.1995) (Easterbrook, J.). At that stage, Colon indisputably was \"already subject to\u201d the undischarged state sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">. The BOP\u2019s apparent conclusion that the district court merely recommended concurrent sentences may be based on the principle that \" 'where there is a <em>direct conflict </em>between an unambiguous oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment ... the oral pronouncement ... must control.'\u201d <em>United States v. Truscello, </em>168 F.3d 61, 62 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Marquez, </em>506 F.2d 620, 622 (2d Cir.1974) (alteration in original)). It is not clear that the oral pronouncement in this case was \u201cunambiguous,\u201d however. Indeed, the term \"recommendation\u201d appears to be inconsistent with the court's power to <em>\u201corder\" </em>concurrent or consecutive sentences for a defendant who is \u201calready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3(a)-(c) (empowering a district court to <em>\"impose/]\u201d </em>concurrent or consecutive sentences on a defendant already subject to an \"undischarged term of imprisonment\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Moreover, it is not clear that a <em>\"direct conflict\" </em>existed between the transcript and the Judgment in any event. The difference was not whether the district court intended concurrent or consecutive sentences, but whether the court expressed its intention as a recommendation or a directive. Therefore, it is possible that this is a case in which the written judgment \"properly serve[s] the function of resolving ambiguities in [an] orally pronounced sentence!].\u201d <em>United States v. Pagan, </em>785 F.2d 378, 380 (2d Cir.1986); <em>see also Truscello, </em>168 F.3d at 63 (\"[W]e think it clear that the difference between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment did not amount to a conflict, but rather that the latter reflected a clarification of what the oral pronouncement meant____\"); <em>United States v. Pugliese, </em>860 F.2d 25, 30 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding that a Judgment providing for consecutive sentences \u201cproperly clarified\u201d an oral sentence that only referred to a previously imposed sentence, but \"did not state explicitly whether the sentence being imposed was to be consecutive or concurrent with the earlier sentence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
