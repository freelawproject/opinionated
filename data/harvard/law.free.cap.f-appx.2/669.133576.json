The trial court sentenced C\u00e1lmese to life imprisonment, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the denial of post-conviction relief. <em>See State v. Calmese, </em>948 S.W.2d 161 (Mo. Ct.App.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">C\u00e1lmese then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied relief, but granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on whether the exclusion of certain defense testimony denied C\u00e1lmese a fair trial, whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument also denied him a fair trial, and whether appellate counsel was ineffective. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">When claims are adjudicated on the merits in state court \u2014 as were Calmese\u2019s claims challenging the exclusion of evidence and failure to control closing argument, <em>see C\u00e1lmese, </em>948 S.W.2d at 161 \u2014 a writ of habeas corpus issues only if the state-court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Copeland v. Washington, </em>232 F.3d 969, 973 (8th Cir.2000); <em>James v. Bowersox, </em>187 F.3d 866, 869 (8th Cir.1999) (summary nature of state appellate court opinion does not affect standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1143, 120 S.Ct. 994, 145 L.Ed.2d 942 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Following our de novo review, <em>see Forest v. Delo, </em>52 F.3d 716, 721 (8th Cir.1995), we conclude the district court correctly denied relief. The exclusion of evidence concerning the victim\u2019s prior violent acts toward Calmese\u2019s nephew, where the evidence was offered to bolster similar evidence, did not deny C\u00e1lmese a fair trial. <em>See Maggitt v. Wyrick, </em>533 F.2d 383, 385-86 (8th Cir.) (questions related to admissibility of evidence, including evidence concerning reasonableness of defendant\u2019s fear of victim, are matters of state law and generally do not give rise to constitutional errors redressed in habeas proceedings), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 898, 97 S.Ct. 264, 50 L.Ed.2d 183 (1976). In addition, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks questioning whether the victim had committed any violent acts, and whether it mattered, are not grounds for federal habeas relief. <em>See James, </em>187 F.3d at 869 (\u00a7 2254 relief should be granted only if prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was so inflammatory and so outrageous that any reasonable trial judge would have sua sponte declared mistrial).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">The ineffective-assistance argument C\u00e1lmese briefed \u2014 a claim that trial counsel was ineffective \u2014 is not properly before us. <em>See Hunter v. Bowersox, </em>172 F.3d 1016, 1020 (8th Cir.1999) (appellate review limited to issues specified in COA), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1140, 120 S.Ct. 987, 145 L.Ed.2d 936 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">.
