The issues presented no need for a written opinion, though they have been fully considered by this court. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(b). Upon consideration by this court, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the Commission\u2019s order <em>In re Application of Quatron Communications, Inc., </em>15 F.C.C.R. 4749 (2000), is affirmed. The Commission reasonably weighed the written materials presented by both parties, concluding that the statements provided by the petitioner were insufficient because they came from interested witnesses and provided evidence of only sporadic monitoring of the frequency. Further, the Commission\u2019s conclusion to accept unsworn testimony from Quatron was reasonable in light of federal statutes that penalize false statements in federal proceedings. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. We do not set aside the Commission\u2019s factual conclusions when they are reached by a reasonable process and are supported by evidence on the record. <em>See Damsky v. FCC, </em>199 F.3d 527, 533-34 (D.C.Cir.2000); <em>Galaxy Communications, Inc. v. FCC, </em>957 F.2d 873, 878 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">The Commission\u2019s conclusion that Qua-tron\u2019s license had not expired is consistent with its regulations. Those regulations provide that \u201c[a] station license shall cancel automatically upon permanent discontinuance of operations\u201d and that a \u201cstation which has not operated for one year or more is considered to be permanently discontinued.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.157 (1999). Quatron\u2019s license included both the Hinsdale location and the Sears Tower location. Because operations at the Hinsdale location were never discontinued, the Commission concluded that Quatron\u2019s license could not have automatically canceled, regardless of the discontinued operation of the Sears Tower location. The regulatory language does not specifically refer to licenses which permit more than one location and the Commission is free to conclude that a multiple location license does not cancel in whole or in part when only one of the locations remains in operation. <em>See Martin v. OSHRC, </em>499 U.S. 144, 150-51, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991); <em>Buffalo Crushed Stone, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>194 F.3d 125, 128 (D.C.Cir.1999). As Quatron\u2019s license permitting operations from both Hinsdale and the Sears Tower was never canceled, it was unnecessary for the Commission to treat its application for a modified license permitting a location at the nearby Standard Oil Building as a new frequency assignment application. The Commission reasonably concluded that Quatron\u2019s frequency coordination statement was sufficient for Quatron\u2019s requested license modification. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.175 (requiring frequency coordination statement for \u201ceach application for a new frequency assignment.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
