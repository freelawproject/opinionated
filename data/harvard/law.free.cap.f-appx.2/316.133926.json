Morgan Kenyon appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on her several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2000) complaints. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Kenyon v. Nelson County Sheriff, No. </em>CA-98-81-6; <em>Kenyon v. Central State Hosp., </em>No. CA-98-83-6; <em>Kenyon v. Barlow, </em>No. CA-98-93-6; <em>Kenyon v. McMillan, </em>No. CA-99-1-6 (W.D.Va. May 9 <em>&amp; </em>18, 2000). The Appellees in Nos. 00-1757, GO-1759, and 00-1760 have moved this Court <em>to </em>award attorneys fees and costs. Although we deny the Appellees\u2019 motion for fees and costs, we warn Kenyon that her continued pursuit of frivolous claims in this Court may result in the award of damages and costs or other sanctions against her. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
