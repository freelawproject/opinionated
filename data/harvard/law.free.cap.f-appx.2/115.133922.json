On July 29, 1999, a confidential informant, in a conversation recorded by authorities, arranged to purchase crack cocaine from Garner. Garner told the informant that he sold crack in prepackaged quantities known as \u201cpink slabs,\u201d meaning pink plastic bags each containing approximately 90 milligrams of crack. Garner offered to pay the informant to manage a trafficking \u201cspot\u201d in Bridgeport. Garner also said he was an \u201cendless connect\u201d and \u201cnever run[s] out of\u2019 supply; and that he had \u201clike a half a key,\u201d meaning half a kilogram of crack pre-packaged as \u201cpink slabs.\u201d Garner then sold the confidential informant a total of 148 pink slabs, with a total weight of 14.2 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">On August 16, 1999, the confidential informant and an undercover government agent had another monitored conversation with Garner. Garner said that he had recently dealt with a\u201d trafficker \u201cthat still owe[s] me ... 34 grams off a quarter,\u201d which government agents interpreted to mean 250 grams of cocaine. He also said he had recently thrown another \u201c250 of coke\u201d from his car while being chased by police. Garner also boasted about the general popularity of his \u201cpink slabs\u201d and said he was a \u201cproducer\u201d whose operation ran \u201cnon-stop 2/*? around the clock.\u201d Garner sold the agent 375 pink slabs of crack with a net weight of 33.5 grams. Apparently referring to that quantity, he told the agent that \u201cquadruple this amount be made by me, sometimes barely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Garner was arrested on August 24. At the time, he was carrying 300 \u201cpink slabs\u201d weighing a total of 28 grams and $1,238 in cash. A search of Garner\u2019s residence revealed equipment and supplies characteristic of what government agents classified as a \u201cdrug factory,\u201d and a \u201clarge scale trafficking operation.\u201d Among the items recovered were approximately 5,000 pink baggies; an electronic scale, two strainers and a spoon, and plates, pans and bowls used for drying crack, all containing cocaine residue; a heat sealer; an Ml carbine semi-automatic weapon with a shortened barrel; and prepackaged and loose cocaine totaling approximately five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On January 6, 2000, Garner entered a plea agreement and stipulation of offense conduct in which he acknowledged having possessed with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack within 1000 feet of a public elementary school, and having possessed a firearm in connection with his crack possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A presentence investigation report recommended that Garner be sentenced for having possessed with intent to distribute between 150 and 500 grams of crack. Garner objected, and the court held a three-day <em>Fatico </em>hearing ending on May 11, 2000, at the end of which the court adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendation as to the drug weight. The court found that the 80 grams of crack Garner either sold to government agents or possessed upon arrest did not \u201creflect the scale of this offense,\u201d and that the preponderance of evidence showed that he was responsible for at least another 70 grams. Accordingly, the court sentenced Garner to 315 months in prison and five years of supervised release. On appeal, Gainer challenges only the district court\u2019s quantity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cThe quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant at the time of sentencing is a question of fact for the district court, subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Hazut, </em>140 F.3d 187, 190 (2d Cir.1998). Where the sentencing court determines that the weight of the drugs actually seized from a defendant \u201cdoes not reflect the scale of the offense,\u201d it \u201cshall\u201d approximate the actual quantity, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 12.), based upon a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>181 F.3d 206, 213 (2d Cir.1999). Among the factors the court may consider are \u201cthe size or capability of any laboratory involved,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 12), and reliable admissions by the defendant. <em>United States v. Shonubi </em>998 F.2d 84, 89 (2d Cir.1993) <em>(\u201cShonubi II\u201d). </em>Any evidence of additional quantities must be \u201cspecific,\u201d that is, it must \u201cpoint[] specifically to a drug quantity for which the defendant is responsible.\u201d <em>United States v. Shonubi </em>103 F.3d 1085, 1090 (2d Cir. 1997) <em>(\u201cShonubi IV\u201d). </em>Moreover, all quantities on which the defendant is sentenced must be \u201c \u2018part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shonubi II, </em>998 F.2d at 89 (quoting U.S.S.G \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Garner contends that the district court erred in finding that the various quantities of drugs he allegedly possessed were part of the same course of conduct. A defendant is said to have engaged in the same \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d for sentencing purposes if he \u201chas been engaged over time in an identifiable pattern of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Shonubi II, </em>998 F.2d at 89. This standard \u201cdoes not require that a connection be established among the drug trafficking occasions in terms of participants or overall plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As discussed below, we accept the district court\u2019s findings as to the total quantity attributable to Garner. We also conclude that each sub-part of this total weight was part of an \u201cidentifiable pattern\u201d of conduct. By way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of example, Garner sold three batches of \u201cpink slabs\u201d to the confidential informant and undercover agent; he stated in recorded conversations that he possessed approximately 500 kilograms in \u201cpink slabs\u201d; he stated he was a \u201cproducer\u201d of crack; and evidence recovered from his residence indicated he had produced and planned to keep producing crack and package it in pink plastic bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Garner next urges that the district court\u2019s quantity estimates were not based on sufficiently \u201cspecific evidence\u201d as required by <em>Shonubi TV. </em>The court based its estimates on various statements by Garner to the confidential informant and on a calculation of the capacity of the drug laboratory found by police in his home. Garner takes particular issue with the district court\u2019s reliance on the 5,000 empty pink plastic bags recovered from his apartment as an indicator of his manufacturing capacity. Even setting that troublesome issue aside, we affirm because the district court\u2019s estimate was corroborated by at least one sufficiently specific statement by Garner regarding his capacity to produce crack. In connection with the August 16 sale to the agent of 33.5 grams, Garner said he was \u201ca producer\u201d and \u201cquadruple this amount be made by me, sometimes barely.\u201d Garner now characterizes that statement as mere \u201cpuffing\u201d rather than a reliable indication of actual quantities. We conclude that the district court\u2019s contrary finding was not clearly erroneous, particularly in light of the ample physical evidence bolstering Garner\u2019s claim to being a \u201cproducer.\u201d <em>Cf. Moreno, </em>181 F.3d at 214 n. 3; <em>United States v. Colon, </em>961 F.2d 41, 43 (2d Cir.1992). According to the unchallenged testimony of government witnesses, Garner\u2019s residence amounted to a \u201cdrug factory,\u201d of the sort used by \u201ca large scale drug trafficking operation.\u201d We thus agree with the district court that Garner\u2019s drug laboratory could have and likely did produce at least 70 grams beyond the quantities directly seized by government agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The district court\u2019s conclusion is further bolstered by the record as a whole. In less than a month, Garner sold 48 grams of crack to government agents and was arrested with another 28 grams; he attempted to hire the confidential informant to manage sales; he showed an intimate familiarity with the drug trade in recorded conversations; and a search of his home produced strong evidence that he was making significant quantities of crack. He also possessed $1,238 in cash at the time of his arrest, even though his last regular employment was as a part time stock person in a supermarket. In light of this evidence, we agree with the district court that Garner\u2019s own statements were sufficiently credible and specific to support a finding that he possessed a total of between 150 and 500 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
