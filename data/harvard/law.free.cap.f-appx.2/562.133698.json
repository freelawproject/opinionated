A magistrate judge presiding by consent upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision as supported by substantial evidence, and Beck appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-22\">Compliance with Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is a precondition to appellate review. But Beck has not complied with that rule, which requires in part that a brief include an argument with citations to relevant authority. Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Although Beck states generally in his brief that he presented sufficient evidence of disability, he fails to develop any meaningful argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in support of that position. Because Beck has not complied with Rule 28(a)(9), the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
