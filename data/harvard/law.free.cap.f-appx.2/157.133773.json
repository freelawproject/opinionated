She alleges that an agreement she and her former real estate broker-employer signed to settle a discrimination claim brought by prospective tenants was signed by her in the absence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-22\">The complaint, which has never been served upon the prospective tenants, was properly dismissed on the ground that the Federal Housing Amendments Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq., </em>does not create an express or implied cause of action for damages against HUD. <em>See Marinoff v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Housing and Urban Development, </em>892 F.Supp. 493, 496 (S.D.N.Y.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>78 F.3d 64 (2d Cir.1996). We also agree with the District Court\u2019s additional reasons for dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
