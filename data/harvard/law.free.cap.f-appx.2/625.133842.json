On appeal, Clark\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel suggests that, although Clark did not move for a downward departure below, the District Court should have granted one sua sponte under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. Clark has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">We decline to reach counsel\u2019s downward-departure argument because it is presented for the first time on appeal. See <em>United States v. Favara, </em>987 F.2d 538, 540 (8th Cir.1993) (declining to address claim that District Court could have granted \u00a7 5K2.0 downward departure because it was not raised below). Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">.
