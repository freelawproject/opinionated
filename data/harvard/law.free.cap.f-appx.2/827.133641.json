Batke\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Batke has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">Counsel identifies one potential issue, whether the district court abused its discretion by imposing an additional term of supervised release after the defendant had served his sentence upon revocation. We agree that this issue does not provide an arguable basis for appeal because the district court was authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) to impose a new term of supervised release. See <em>United States v. Cade, </em>236 F.3d 463, 465-66 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">Our examination of counsel\u2019s brief and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no other issues for review. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-24\">.
