Munson, <em>Judge), </em>it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Munson, J.) granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgement and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Plaintiffs-appellants Kevin McClain and Stephanie McClain (collectively \u201cMcClain\u201d) sued defendant-appellee Cornell University (\u201cCornell\u201d) alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>42 U.S.C.2000(e), <em>et seq. </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981,1981(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">In a memorandum decision and order entered on March 31, 2000, the district court granted Cornell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, rejecting McClain\u2019s claim that Cornell\u2019s entire course of conduct constituted a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d of the underlying law, finding that the evidence did not support a claim of a hostile work environment, and concluding that \u201c[sjince the arbitration decision disposes of plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] third claim of retaliatory discriminatory discharge, he may not now attempt to present further issues regarding this claim.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., </em>159 F.3d 759, 764 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">The district court erred to the extent that it believed that the adjudication through binding arbitration of contractual rights established under a collective bargaining agreement would limit the availability of the federal courts to adjudicate statutory rights violated by the same conduct. <em>See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974) (\u201cThere is no suggestion in the [Title VII] statutory scheme that a prior arbitral decision either forecloses an individual\u2019s right to sue or divests federal courts of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">We, nevertheless, affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Cornell. <em>See United States v. White, </em>980 F.2d 836, 842 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]e may affirm on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law, including grounds upon which the district court did not rely.\u201d). In this case, McClain has not provided sufficient competent evidence to establish that Cornell\u2019s employment decisions were a pretext for impermissible discrimination or retaliation so as to overcome the substantial proof offered by Cornell that its actions were based on legitimate non-discriminatory considerations. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Comty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (providing that, after a defendant has identified a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for an employment ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tion, a Title VII plaintiff can prove that he was the victim of intentional discrimination \u201cby showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We have considered all of McClain\u2019s other arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
