After he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>successfully moved to vacate his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resentenced him to 211 months imprisonment. Jones appeals, arguing that the Court erred in enhancing his offense level under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing firearms in connection with the drug offense. He also contends that the government breached the 1992 plea agreement by failing to recommend an offense level that did not include the enhancement and a sentence at the low end of the resulting Guidelines imprisonment range. We grant Jones\u2019s request to file a pro se supplemental brief, and we have considered his tendered brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We first conclude that, by bringing a <em>Bailey </em>motion, Jones unbundled his interdependent sentences for multiple convictions, waived whatever expectation of finality he might have had regarding his sentence on the drug counts, and opened the door to the section 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement. <em>See Gardiner v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 734, 736 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 923, 118 S.Ct. 318, 139 L.Ed.2d 246 (1997); <em>Pasquarille v. United States, </em>130 F.3d 1220, 1222-23 (6th Cir. 1997). Second, we conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement based on Jones\u2019s factual stipulation and change-of-plea colloquy. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>169 F.3d 531, 532-33 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-23\">. The Honorable Rodney W. Sippel, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
