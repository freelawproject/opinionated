Matney contends that his due process rights were violated because the State breached the plea agreement. He also claims that the trial court violated the prohibition against double jeopardy by imposing an aggravated sentence based on dismissed allegations related to a prior offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, we review the district court\u2019s denial of a section 2254 habeas corpus petition de novo, <em>see Bribiesca v. Galaza, </em>215 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Because Matney filed his habeas petition on July 28, 1998, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) applies. <em>See Lopez v. Thompson, </em>202 F.3d 1110, 1116 n. 5 (9th Cir. 2000). Thus, we grant habeas relief only if the petitioner demonstrates that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1504, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)); <em>Weighall v. Middle, </em>215 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">Matney first contends that the State breached its plea agreement by arguing for imprisonment based on his violent past and prior felony conviction after it had agreed to dismiss the allegations of dangerousness and prior convictions that it had previously filed with the court. Due process requires that \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Here, the trial court found no evidence that the State promised not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ask for imprisonment or promised not to present evidence of Matney\u2019s prior conviction at sentencing. Because the trial court\u2019s finding is clear, and Matney has not shown it to be incorrect, we adopt this finding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e); <em>Solis v. Garcia, </em>219 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe state court\u2019s factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption with clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). The trial court also concluded that Matney \u201creceived the benefit of the plea agreement because he received the opportunity for probation and a lesser sentence if imprisoned.\u201d We accept this conclusion as a state court\u2019s ruling on a question of state law. <em>See Hartman v. Summers, </em>120 F.3d 157, 161 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cA state court\u2019s ruling on questions of state law should be \u2018accepted\u2019 by the federal court.\u201d). Based on the foregoing, the State fulfilled its promises that may have induced Matney to accept the plea agreement. Thus, Matney has not successfully demonstrated that the state court\u2019s decision regarding alleged breach of the plea agreement was against established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Matney next claims that the sentencing court erred when it considered as an aggravating factor the predatory nature of a prior offense for which he was not convicted. His argument is unavailing. First, due process is not violated when sentencing courts consider a defendant\u2019s past criminal behavior even where no conviction resulted. <em>See Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994); <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Where the ultimate sentence falls within the sentencing range prescribed by statute, a judge may consider a wide variety of factors involving both the current offense and the offender\u2019s past conduct in making a sentencing determination. <em>See Apprendi v. Neiu Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2358, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Here, the trial judge imposed an aggravated sentence as a result of considering Matney\u2019s criminal history as presented in the presentence report and what he found to be an attempt to minimize the prior felony at sentencing. Because the sentence prescribed was within the range imposed by the statute, the state court decision comported with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Second, the judge\u2019s actions did not violate the federal prohibition against double jeopardy. Matney contends that he is receiving additional punishment for his earlier offense. <em>See, e.g., Ohio v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984) (\u201c[The Double Jeopardy Clause] protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d). However, \u201c[b]ecause the substantive power to prescribe crimes and determine punishments is vested with the legislature, ... the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are \u2018multiple\u2019 is essentially one of legislative intent....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499. The state trial court made no finding in this regard. Under a plain reading of the sentencing statute, the Arizona legislature intended to require judges to consider as aggravating factors not only prior felonies, but any other factor the judge deemed \u201cappropriate\u201d to reach a just decision. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-702(C). Here, the judge\u2019s considerations are within this broad mandate. Thus, the trial court did not violate the federal prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Accordingly, the sentencing court\u2019s use of an allegation that was dismissed in a prior plea agreement to enhance Matney\u2019s sentence for the indicted offense did not violate federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\">.

Because we limit our review to those issues for which a certificate of appealability was granted, we decline to address this issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
