Pruess claims the district court abused its discretion in denying his request to withdraw his guilty plea as to the above-referenced counts, and that the district court erred in failing to address the applicability of United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) (1998). We affirm Pruess\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Pruess seeks to set aside his guilty plea because the element \u201cengaged in the business\u201d allegedly was not properly charged and because he was only a collector/hobbyist of weaponry and his sales of firearms, explosives, and ammunition to undercover operatives were not criminally motivated. A guilty plea is invalid if the defendant does not comprehend his constitutional protections and the charges lodged against him. <em>Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976). A defendant must receive adequate notice of the critical elements of his case, and due process requires that a defendant be legally competent to plead guilty. <em>Id.; Roach v. Martin, </em>757 F.2d 1463, 1480 (4th Cir. 1985). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088, 1093 (4th Cir.1993), and the district court\u2019s factual findings in support of its decision to deny the motion will be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Suter, </em>755 F.2d 523, 525 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Our review discloses that the district court\u2019s factual finding that Pruess\u2019s guilty plea to the charges at issue was knowingly and voluntarily entered is not clearly erroneous, and that it is supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>fully by Pruess\u2019s responses during his Fed. R.CrimJP. 11 colloquy and by the evidence presented before the court that established his illegal weapons trafficking. <em>See generally United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-17 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Pruess further seeks vacation of his sentence and remand to address the applicability of USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), again claiming that he possessed the weaponry solely for lawful collection purposes. Even if Pruess properly raised this issue for consideration before the district court, we find that the findings of the district court satisfy Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c). <em>United States v. Walker, </em>29 F.3d 908, 911 (4th Cir.1994). Further, this provision of the guidelines does not apply to Pruess, given his possession of machine guns and his prior felony conviction, which disqualify him from the adjustment he seeks. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B); \u00a7 2K2.1, <em>Application Note </em>6.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We deny Pruess\u2019s motion to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief because he is represented by counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
