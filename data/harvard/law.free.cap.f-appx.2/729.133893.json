Butler brought suit in federal district court against the NCAA, alleging that its academic eligibility criteria violated Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12181-12189. The district court issued a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) and then, after a hearing, issued a preliminary injunction, forbidding the NCAA from enforcing its ineligibility determination against Butler. Before trial, the NCAA entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, under which the NCAA agreed to abide by the requirements of the ADA. Upon the agreement of Butler and the NCAA, the district court dismissed the action. Butler moved the court to grant attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205, the fee provision of the ADA. The district court denied the motion, holding that Butler was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and so not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Butler appealed, and we now reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">Butler\u2019s claim against the NCAA is under the ADA. Thus, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a decision to award attorney\u2019s fees under the ADA for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Fischer v. SJB-P.D. Inc., </em>214 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 states that \u201c[i]n any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to [the ADA], the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, including litigation expenses, and costs.\u201d Butler\u2019s case against the NCAA was an \u201caction ... commenced pursuant to [the ADA].\u201d Thus, whether he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees depends upon whether he qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">As in other circuits, we evaluate \u201cprevailing party\u201d status under \u00a7 12205 within the framework established by the Supreme Court under The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Fischer, </em>214 F.3d at 1118 (citing <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992)); <em>see, e.g., Roe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort, Inc., </em>124 F.3d 1221, 1232 (10th Cir.1997); <em>Pottgen v. Mo. State High Sch. Activities Ass\u2019n, </em>103 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir.1997). The \u201c \u2018touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 111 (quoting <em>Tex. State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989)). It is not essential for a party to have \u201cobtained a favorable \u2018final judgment following a full trial on the merits\u2019 \u201d in order to be a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 756-57, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (per curiam) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1158, at 7 (1976)). Rather, a party prevails if the party \u201csucceeds \u2018on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit [it] sought in bringing suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, </em>205 F.3d 1146, 1160 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)) (alteration in original). If, however, the court awards a party interlocutory relief solely to maintain the status quo, then that party cannot be said to \u201cprevail.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">We have held that a party \u201cprevailed\u201d on the basis of interlocutory relief when that relief materially altered the legal relationship of the litigants and gave the party some of the benefits the party sought. <em>See, e.g., LSO, </em>205 F.3d at 1161. In <em>LSO, </em>for example, the plaintiff obtained a TRO forbidding the government defendant from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s planned convention and art exhibition. Because the TRO allowed the convention and exhibition to take place, we held that it altered the legal relationship between the parties. Because it also gave the plaintiff the benefit it sought in bringing suit, we held that the plaintiff was a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Harris v. McCarthy, </em>we held that because the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction forbade the government defendant from allowing the dissemination of toxic products in the residential areas of a prison and from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable access to communication with counsel, the plaintiffs succeeded on a significant issue in the litigation and were prevailing parties. <em>See </em>790 F.2d 753, 757 (9th Cir.1986); <em>cf. Hanrahan, </em>446 U.S. at 759 (holding that party did not prevail where interlocutory relief merely put the plaintiffs in the same position they \u201cwould have occupied if they had simply defeated the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict in the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">This case falls squarely within this line of precedent. As with the interim relief awarded in <em>LSO </em>and <em>Harris, </em>the district court\u2019s award of interim relief altered the legal relationship between the NCAA and Butler. The TRO and the preliminary injunction prevented the NCAA from enforcing its ruling that Butler was ineligible to receive an athletic scholarship and to play football for the University of Washington. Thus, Butler received all the relief he sought in bringing suit. Moreover, Butler benefitted from the protection of the interim relief from October 21, 1996, until July 22, 1998, when the court dismissed his action. After the court issued the preliminary injunction on November 8, 1996, the NCAA did not appeal or otherwise seek to lift the injunction. <em>Cf. Fitzharris v. Wolff, </em>702 F.2d 836, 838-39 (9th Cir.1983) (noting, in concluding that plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d on the basis of the award of a TRO, that defendants did not seek to dissolve the TRO, which had been in effect for ten months). In obtaining interlocutory relief, Butler succeeded on a \u201c \u2018significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit [he] sought in bringing suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>LSO, </em>205 F.3d at 1160 (quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433). Therefore, Butler is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d and is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 12205.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Butler is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in his action against the NCAA. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the district court for a determination of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that should be awarded to Butler under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\">.

The NCAA argues that it is not subject to the ADA and that, therefore, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Butler\u2019s claim. This argument is without merit. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\"It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction ....\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\"><em>. </em>Section 1988 states, in relevant part: \u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [various civil rights acts], the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs ....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
