His sentence was enhanced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and U .S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because he had previously been deported after being convicted of an aggravated felony. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 78 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Gutierrez-Lopez argues on appeal that because the fact of a prior aggravated-felony conviction was not alleged in the indictment and was neither proven to a jury nor admitted through his guilty plea, the enhanced sentence violates the standards announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We reject this argument because <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which upheld the validity of the section 1326(b)(2) aggravated-felony enhancement for section 1326(a) violators, was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. See </em>120 S.Ct. at 2362; <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 932 n. 4 (8th Cir.) (\u201cIn <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>untouched, although ... [it] expressed a willingness to reconsider it.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
