Pohorelsky, <em>Magistrate Judge) </em>denying its motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">On April 2, 1997, the plaintiff was ordered by the defendant to cut down a tree that was fouling a track a quarter of a mile from a crossing near the defendant\u2019s East Williston station. After the plaintiff removed the tree by himself with some difficulty, he proceeded along a right-of-way and, when his foot became entangled in brush near the track, tripped and injured his right knee. Unequipped with any communication device with which to call for help and unable to stand up, the plaintiff lay on the ground for an hour and a half, periodically lifting himself up to the tracks to make sure that no train was approaching. He was eventually rescued by an ambulance after a brakeman on a passing train noticed him and came to his aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">The plaintiff filed suit under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, <em>et seq., </em>on April 15, 1998. During pretrial discovery, the plaintiff indicated his intent to rely on the defendant\u2019s violations of the Roadway Worker Protection Rule (\u201cRWPR\u201d), 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214, as evidence of negligence. By notice of motion dated October 13, 1999, the defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the plaintiff from referring to or offering testimony about the RWPR. The court responded to this motion by ordering the plaintiff to identify and disclose by November 30, 1999 \u201ceach subpart of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding the Road-worker Protection Statute upon which the plaintiff will rely.\u201d Although the plaintiff complied with that order on November 24, the defendant now argues that the plaintiffs submission was calculated to obscure the issue and hinder its efforts to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">The defendant waited until January 28, 2000, just before jury selection began, to respond to the plaintiffs filing, hand delivering to the court a letter claiming that the plaintiff did not adequately comply with the order and indicating its intent to renew its motion. At the beginning of the trial, the court declined to rule on the motion on the ground that the defendant was too late in responding to the plaintiffs submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The trial, which lasted from January 31 to February 4, 2000, thus proceeded with the plaintiff making frequent reference to the RWPR and to the defendant\u2019s violations of those regulations, not only in his opening statement but also in the direct testimony of his key witnesses. Specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ly, the plaintiffs witnesses testified that the defendant\u2019s employees were confused about the RWPR requirements, that the plaintiff should not have been sent out alone and without a communication device on the night of April 2, 1997, and that the Union representing the employees had made complaints about the implementation of the RWPR rules. The defendant argues that roughly 60% of plaintiffs key witnesses\u2019 testimony centered on the regulations; the plaintiff contends that that figure is an exaggeration but does not deny the important role of the RWPR in its theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">On the fourth day of trial, February 3, 1999, the court ruled that the RWPR was inapplicable to the plaintiffs claims. Citing 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.301, the \u201cPurpose and Scope\u201d provision of the RWPR, the court noted that \u201cthe purpose of [the regulations] is to prevent accidents and casualties caused by moving railroad cars, locomotives or roadway maintenance machines striking roadway workers.\u201d It then observed that \u201c[t]here\u2019s nothing in this case to indicate that this accident was in any way related to a moving railroad car, locomotive, or roadway maintenance machine striking anything\u201d and therefore held that \u201cthese rules and regulations the Court finds inapplicable to this case.\u201d The court instructed the jury accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $212,000, and the defendant promptly moved for a new trial, claiming prejudice stemming from the jury\u2019s erroneous exposure to extensive testimony about the RWPR. Although acknowledging that the defendant\u2019s motion was a \u201cclose case,\u201d the court concluded that it was \u201cunable to say that the jury reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\u201d The court therefore denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The defendant appeals this ruling to us, arguing that the admission of RWPR testimony requires the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u201c[W]e will reverse a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Song v. Ives Labs., </em>957 F.2d 1041, 1047 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u201cA new trial is warranted only where the introduction of inadmissible evidence is a clear abuse of discretion, and where that abuse of discretion is prejudicial to the ultimate result of the trial. We will refuse to grant a new trial unless we are convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Pescatore v. Pan Am. World Airways, </em>97 F.3d 1, 16 (2d Cir.1996). We conclude not only that the jury\u2019s decision in this case was not seriously erroneous or a miscarriage of justice, but also that the testimony presented by the plaintiff about the RWPR was properly admitted by the district court during trial and should have been considered by the jury. Because we therefore cannot say that the introduction of this evidence was an abuse of discretion, we must affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The plaintiffs claim was brought under FELA and alleged that the defendant failed to provide him a safe workplace. This FELA claim is governed \u201cby the common law principles as established and applied in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Urie v. Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163, 174, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282 (1949) (citation omitted). \u2018What constitutes negligence for the statute\u2019s purposes is a federal question, not varying in accordance with the differing conceptions of negligence applicable under state and local laws for other purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>As a matter of federal common law, courts have specifically incorporated the doctrine of negligence <em>per se </em>into FELA claims. <em>See Ries v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1156, 1159 (3d Cir. 1992). In <em>Morant v. Long Island Railroad, </em>66 F.3d 518, 523 (2d Cir.1995), we held that \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the FELA requires a finding of negligence <em>per se </em>when there has been a violation of a safety statute specifically aimed at the railroad industry.\u201d (quoting <em>Ries, </em>960 F.2d at 1159). Moreover, the Supreme Court has defined the contours of that federal common-law doctrine more broadly than has traditionally been the case under state law. In <em>Kernan v. American Dredging Co., </em>355 U.S. 426, 433, 78 S.Ct. 394, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), the Court, noting that \u201cit is clear that the general congressional intent [in FELA] was to provide liberal recovery for injured workers,\u201d said \u201cin FELA cases based upon violations of [statutory duties], the Court has held that a violation of [the] statute creates liability under FELA if the resulting defect or insufficiency in equipment contributes in fact to the death or injury in suit, <em>without regard to whether the injury flowing from the breach was the injury the statute sought to prevent.\u201d Id. </em>at 432-433 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The RWPR was promulgated under \u00a7 8 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20142, and the text of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.301 indicates that the purpose of the regulations is to prevent accidents caused by moving trains or machinery striking workers. In resting its conclusion about the RWPR\u2019s inapplicability on this language and stated purpose, the district court implicitly applied the very common-law formulation of negligence <em>per se </em>that the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Keman. </em>It reasoned that the RWPR \u201cis not relevant in this case ... because those regulations were adopted to prevent accidents caused by moving railroad cars, locomotives and railroad maintenance machines striking persons[,] ... and there is no evidence that ... moving railroad cars had anything to do with this accident or injuries.\u201d That analysis ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u201ca violation of [the] statute creates liability under FELA if [it] contributes in fact to the death or injury in suit, without regard to whether the injury flowing from the breach was the injury the statute sought to prevent.\u201d <em>Kernan, </em>335 U.S. at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Finally, even if violations of the RWPR were therefore relevant to the plaintiffs case of negligence on a theory of negligence <em>per se, </em>there remains the requirement that the plaintiff establish a sufficient causal connection between the violations and the injury. Here, too, however, the standard under the FELA is relaxed. As the Supreme Court held in <em>Crane v. Cedar Rapids &amp; Iowa City Ry. Co., </em>395 U.S. 164, 166, 89 S.Ct. 1706, 23 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), the plaintiff is \u201cnot required to prove common-law proximate causation but only that his injury resulted \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 from the railroad\u2019s violation of the Act.\u201d (quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Based on this framework, the testimony about the RWPR presented in the plaintiffs case was relevant and appropriate. It is clear that an employee stumbling and falling near the railroad tracks is not the type of injury that the RWPR sought to prevent. However, it is equally clear that the jury could have inferred that the defendant\u2019s violation of the \u201clone worker\u201d rules contributed \u201cin whole or in part\u201d to the plaintiffs injury. <em>Crane, </em>395 U.S. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">This is also true of the evidence put forth by the plaintiff about the defendant\u2019s violations of the RPWR\u2019s training provisions. The plaintiff offered testimony indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>eating that the defendant had failed adequately to train and qualify the plaintiff and his supervisors, and that as a result, neither plaintiff nor those who ordered him to clear the tree prior to his injury were fully aware of the RWPR requirements. These shortcomings were a violation of several RPWR regulations, including \u00a7 214.309, \u00a7 214.311, \u00a7 214.315, \u00a7 214.343, and especially \u00a7 214.347 (\u201cTraining and qualification for lone workers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The jury easily could have concluded that these violations contributed in part to the plaintiffs injury: If the plaintiffs supervisor had been aware that the plaintiff was not qualified as a lone worker, the plaintiff would presumably not have been dispatched on the night of April 2, 1997. Similarly, if the plaintiff had known of the regulations, he might have demanded that he be accompanied.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We conclude that the district court erred in removing the plaintiffs testimony about the defendant\u2019s RWPR violations from consideration by the jury. This conclusion requires us also to conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to allow the jury to be exposed to such evidence. We therefore affirm the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
