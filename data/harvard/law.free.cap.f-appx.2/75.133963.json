Riker, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Northern District of New York Syracuse, NY, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-27\">Present OAKES, CARDAMONE and PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b106-28\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the decision of said district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-29\">On December 9, 1998, Mr. Chin was convicted, following a jury trial, of conspiring, to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On June 2, 1999, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifty (50) months.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-30\">Mr. Chin argues that: (1) certain evidentiary admissions violated Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); (2) the court\u2019s limiting instruction was inadequate; (3) the prosecution engaged in improper argument; and (4) the government did not establish drug quantity beyond a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Anglin, </em>169 F.3d 154, 162 (2d Cir.1999). \u201c \u2018An act that is alleged to have been done in furtherance of [an] alleged conspiracy ... is not an \u201cother\u201d act within the meaning of Rule 404(b); rather it is part of the very act charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 79 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Concepcion, </em>983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In addition, there is no requirement that all of the government\u2019s evidence fall within the time period charged in the indictment, providing it is relevant to the charges. <em>See United States v. Bagaric, </em>706 F.2d 42, 65 (2d Cir.1983), <em>abrogated on other grounds, National Org. for Women v. Scheidler, </em>510 U.S. 249, 114 S.Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The court properly admitted the evidence as direct evidence of the conspiracy. Mr. Allen\u2019s testimony was direct evidence of the Greenwood Chin conspiracy, and Mr. Chin\u2019s concealment of the money was relevant to his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the propriety of a jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>198 F.3d 377, 386 (2d Cir.1999). The defendant must show that, viewing the charge as a whole, he was prejudiced. <em>See id. </em>\u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or it does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Abelis, </em>146 F.3d 73, 82 (2d Cir.1998). The court was not instructing the jury on Rule 404(b) or on the defendant\u2019s defense of innocence; rather, it was instructing the jury as to intent. Also, the defendant fails to allege any prejudice as a result of the \u201cwhat have you been offered\u201d conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">This Court will not find a denial of due process warranting reversal, based on summation arguments, unless the arguments constitute \u201cegregious misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Shareef </em>190 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.1999). The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not amount to misconduct. Here, the government responded to defense counsel\u2019s remarks. This Court has held that where the defense summation makes arguments against the government, the prosecutor may respond to them in rebuttal. <em>Bagaric, </em>706 F.2d at 60. In addition, the court asked the prosecutor to preface her statements to make it clear that she was referring to the plea agreements, and the court gave the jury a curative instruction. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Accordingly, the prosecution\u2019s arguments did not amount to a denial of due process warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">A district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity is reviewed for clear error, <em>see United States v. Prince, </em>110 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1997), and that amount need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see United States v. Desimone, </em>119 F.3d 217, 228 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cWhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S .S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12. All transactions entered into by a defendant\u2019s coconspirators may be attributable to him, if they were known to him or reasonably foreseeable by him. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 684 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 1; \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The court found that the evidence as to amounts was credible and reliable, and that there was a substantial amount of drugs involved. Quantity was established by a preponderance of the evidence, and we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
