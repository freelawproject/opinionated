Williams appeals both his conviction and his sentence. The conviction is challenged on the ground that a jury view of the scene of the offense violated Williams\u2019 Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial and his Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation, effective assistance of counsel and presumption of innocence. Concluding that the district court committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>no reversible error in permitting the jury to view the scene without requiring the presence of the defendant, <em>see Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 108, 121, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934), <em>overruled on other grounds, Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), and that no aspect of the manner in which the jury view was conducted prejudiced Williams, <em>see Arnold v. Evatt, </em>113 F.3d 1352, 1361 (4th Cir.1997), we affirm Williams\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Williams\u2019 sentence was properly enhanced under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000) upon a finding by the district court at the sentencing hearing that he obstructed justice by offering perjured testimony at his first trial. <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 95-96, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). The sentence was also properly enhanced under \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A) for use of a firearm in a crime of violence for which he was not convicted. <em>See United States v. Mellerson, </em>145 F.3d 1255, 1257 (11th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Rutledge, </em>33 F.3d 671, 673 (6th Cir.1994). Williams\u2019 reliance on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to challenge these enhancements is misplaced because the enhancements did not increase Williams\u2019 sentence beyond the applicable statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192,---, slip opinion at 14-16 (4th Cir.2000) (published).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
