Slater waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information charging him with bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. In a written plea agreement he admitted defrauding four banks and one finance company out of about $1.5 million. But his plea agreement contained a boo-boo. It said his guideline range would be 27 to 33 months, but that span overlooked a critical fact: Slater\u2019s scheme affected a financial institution, which triggered U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(7)(B), and that increased his range to 46-57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">Three months after Slater entered his guilty plea and a week before he was scheduled to appear for sentencing, an attorney for the government discovered the omission, and a letter was faxed to Slater\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>lawyer telling him that the sentencing range in the agreement was wrong and that a stiffer penalty was called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">When the time for sentencing rolled around (the proceeding was adjourned, but we can ignore that detail), Slater did not contest the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(7)(B) to his case. Instead, he asserted its application constituted a violation of his plea agreement with the government. In response to this assertion, the government offered to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, an offer Slater rejected, saying he was \u201cnot here to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201d Instead, his counsel said the only thing Slater wanted as relief for the alleged breach of the plea agreement was freedom to argue a motion for a downward departure that he had filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Slater\u2019s motion sought an unspecified downward departure \u201cfrom this unforseen application of the guidelines,\u201d citing several grounds, including things like his health, military service, remorse, and family ties. Despite the fact that the plea agreement expressly prohibited the making of a downward departure motion, the government did not assert a procedural bar since the motion was clearly prompted by the mistake in calculating the sentencing range. Without a procedural objection by the government, the district court heard the motion on the merits. The motion was denied and Slater was sentenced to a term of 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Slater\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the government \u201cbreached\u201d the plea agreement. His remedy, it is argued, is specific performance: vacation of his sentence and a remand for resentencing (before a different judge) limited, it seems, to a point within the plea agreement\u2019s original \u2014 and erroneous \u2014 range of 27 to 33 months. This plea fails for a host of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">For one thing, the plea agreement was not \u201cbreached.\u201d Sure, it contained an error, but correcting that error does not a breach make. Besides, the agreement itself described the sentencing range it contained as a \u201cpreliminary calculation,\u201d a clear signal that revisions were possible. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>47 F.3d 198, 202 (7th Cir.1995). Given this scenario, Slater\u2019s only remedy was to ask to withdraw his plea, something he didn\u2019t want to do. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>198 F.3d 988 (7th Cir.1999). Asking to be sentenced under an inaccurate sentencing range is asking way too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">For another thing, Slater cannot seek specific performance because he expressly declined to ask for it in the district court. All he sought there was a chance (which he got) to argue for a downward departure. This election is an unmistakable waiver of any right to seek specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Slater\u2019s second claim on appeal, that he didn\u2019t deserve a 2-level \u201cleadership\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), is meritless. To invoke the enhancement, all the district court had to do was find that Slater directed the actions of at least one other \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d participant in the fraud. As to this point, not only did Slater admit in the plea agreement that he directed other employees to prepare false documents used in his fraud, but the stipulated testimony of two of these employees proved that each knew of the criminal nature of Slater\u2019s scheme and intentionally took actions which furthered it. By knowingly assisting the criminal scheme, both employees were \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for the commission of his offense even though neither was charged with the crime. The leadership enhancement, therefore, was a proper fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
