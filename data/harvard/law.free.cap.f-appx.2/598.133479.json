On appeal, this court reversed the district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding attributing two kilograms of cocaine to Mr. Campbell as relevant conduct, rejected all of his other arguments (including his challenge to the inclusion of seven ounces of methamphetamine), affirmed his convictions and sentences in all other respects, and remanded \u201cfor resentencing. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>150 F.3d 964, 965-67 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Over Mr. Campbell\u2019s objection, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> again attributed the seven ounces of methamphetamine to him as relevant conduct, and sentenced him to an aggregate of 140 months imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal from resentencing, Mr. Campbell\u2019s counsel challenges the inclusion of the methamphetamine, and has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Campbell has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Because we previously affirmed the district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding attributing the seven ounces of methamphetamine to Mr. Campbell, counsel\u2019s attempt to relitigate the issue in this appeal is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Behler, </em>187 F.3d 772, 776 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Bartsh, </em>69 F.3d 864, 866 (8th Cir.1995). Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-17\">.
