The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">Zavala contends that the district court clearly erred by denying her an additional one-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l). We review the district court\u2019s withholding of an additional one-point reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) for clear error. <em>United States v. Hock, </em>172 F.3d 676, 681 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>528 U.S. 913, 120 S.Ct. 265, 145 L.Ed.2d 222 (1999); <em>see also United States v. Hopper, </em>27 F.3d 378, 382 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">\u201cThe primary purpose\u201d of subsection (b) is \u201cpromoting prosecutorial and judicial economy and efficiency.\u201d <em>Hopper, </em>27 F.3d at 384. It is not enough that a defendant provide complete information regarding involvement in the case, rather, the disclosure must be timely enough to \u201cassist[] authorities in the investigation or prosecution of [the defendant\u2019s] own misconduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b); <em>United States v. Stoops, 25 </em>F.3d 820, 822-23 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-23\">By evading arrest for approximately three and one-half years, Zavala can hardly be said to have promoted prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>economy or to have provided assistance regarding her own conduct in the offense. <em>See Hopper, </em>27 F.3d at 385. Therefore, Zavala\u2019s confession did not serve the goals of \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l), and the court district did not clearly err by denying Zavala the additional one-point adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-24\">.
