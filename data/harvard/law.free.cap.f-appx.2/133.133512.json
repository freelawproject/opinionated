Feroz, </em>848 F.2d 359, 360 (2d Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Cano, </em>702 F.2d 370, 371 (2d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Aulet, </em>618 F.2d 182, (2d Cir.1980). Although defendant is correct that the charge did not conform to the requirements of our prior holdings, there was no reversible error for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">First, defendant effectively waived the eiTor. The court distributed its proposed charge among counsel and solicited objections; defendant\u2019s attorney made no objection to the proposed language on conscious avoidance. Had the problem been called to the court\u2019s attention, it would surely have been corrected. After the charge was given, when the court invited exceptions, counsel said only that he recalled a Second Circuit case calling for language about \u201chigh probability.\u201d Counsel did not clarify \u201chigh probability\u201d of what. The exception was so vague that it did not adequately notify the court of its nature. Under the circumstances, defendant\u2019s objection to the charge cannot be considered to have been properly preserved. It was not meaningfully or comprehensibly brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Nor can it be said, considering all the circumstances, that the failure to include this language in the charge was plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Taking account of the charge as a whole, it adequately informed the jury that defendant must be acquitted if he believed his statements were true and cautioned the jury that guilty knowledge could not be established by defendant\u2019s mistake or negligence. Furthermore, any error was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s actual awareness of the falsity of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We have reviewed defendant\u2019s other contentions, including that the evidence did not justify a charge on conscious avoidance, that the evidence did not support defendant\u2019s awareness of a high probability of the falsity of his statements, and that there was no basis for a finding of perjury to justify a sentence enhancement. We find no merit in them. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
