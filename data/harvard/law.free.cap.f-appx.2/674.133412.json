We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-26\">The appellee, First Financial, owned a five-acre lot of commercial property in Springdale, Arkansas. First Financial built its headquarters on the southern three acres, and left open the northern two acres for future development. In early 1997, First Financial was approached by a representative for Mazzio\u2019s, which was interested in buying the lot in order to open an Italian restaurant on the northern site.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-27\">At the time, First Financial\u2019s President Jerry Bullard had owned the property for approximately seven years. He had estimated it to be worth between $300,000 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>$320,000. Bullard based his estimate on a recent appraisal, his knowledge of the property\u2019s past sales price, and real estate prices in the local area.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Mazzio\u2019s extended a written offer to First Financial for $450,000. Mazzio\u2019s original offer contained a 90-day \u201clook-see\u201d period. First Financial rejected the offer, seeking a higher price and a limitation on the \u201clook-see\u201d provision. After a period of negotiations, Mazzio\u2019s and First Financial reached a purchase price of $517,500, with a closing date of August 15, 1997. The contract was signed by Mazzio\u2019s vice-president of finance, who had then authority to bind Mazzio\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On August 1, 1997, Mazzio\u2019s wrote a letter to First Financial seeking to terminate the contract. Mazzio\u2019s stated that the property \u201cis not suitable for our needs due to the amount of site work and preparation .... \u201d Mazzio\u2019s also contended that the \u201cprivate club\u201d provision in the city was \u201coverly burdensome.\u201d First Financial refused to terminate the contract, and filed a civil action for breach of contract under Arkansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">After Mazzio\u2019s termination, First Financial attempted to sell the property. Eventually, it found a buyer for $320,000 for the property. On July 21, 1999, First Financial filed a civil action for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of First Financial on one of Mazzio\u2019s affirmative defenses, and the case went to a bench trial. At trial, the district court made various findings. It rejected the impossibility defense asserted by Mazzio\u2019s, because Mazzio\u2019s never met its affirmative duty of applying for a permit. The district court considered and rejected Mazzio\u2019s interpretation of the \u201ccustomary\u201d language in the contract. It held Mazzio\u2019s liable for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">On the issue of damages, the district court allowed testimony from the land owner, First Financial\u2019s president, on the value of the land at the time of the sale and of Mazzio\u2019s breach. Mazzio\u2019s offered no rebuttal evidence. The district court awarded damages for $197,500 by subtracting the fair market value assessed at the time of breach of $320,000 minus the sale price of $517,5000. The district court also awarded First Financial attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Mazzio\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">A. Partial Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Prior to the bench trial, the district court granted partial summary judgment to First Financial on one of the affirmative defenses asserted by Mazzio\u2019s. Specifically, Mazzio\u2019s sought to argue First Financial was untimely in delivering the survey and title. First Financial argued Mazzio\u2019s waived this defense by its own actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">In granting First Financial\u2019s motion, the district court noted that Mazzio\u2019s never asserted any untimeliness by First Financial until after it filed its civil action. The district court also noted the parties exchanged volumes of paperwork on the closing date, without mentioning any alleged untimeliness. In addition, Mazzio\u2019s continued to demonstrate an intent to close on the contract well after the alleged delivery date. Indeed, Mazzio\u2019s repeatedly confirmed that no extensions would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">In holding that Mazzio\u2019s waived its untimeliness defense, the district court cited a decision that has since been reversed by the Arkansas Supreme Court. <em>Bharodia v. Pledger, </em>66 Ark.App. 349, 990 S.W.2d 581 (Ark.Ct.App.1999), <em>rev\u2019d by </em>340 Ark. 547, 11 S.W.3d 540 (2000). However, we believe First Financial demonstrated Mazzio\u2019s waiver beyond any genuine dispute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and in accordance with the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s more rigorous opinion in <em>Bharodia v. Pledger, </em>340 Ark. 547, 11 S.W.3d 540 (2000). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">B. Mazzio\u2019s Liability Under the Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Mazzio\u2019s appeals the district court\u2019s decision holding it liable under the contract, and rejecting its defense of impossibility. We review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Sherman v. Runyon, </em>235 F.3d 406, 408 (8th Cir.2000). The district court conducted a thorough bench trial. It considered testimony on the meaning of the \u201ccustomary\u201d language in the contract, in light of the license and permit requirements of Springdale, and the premium Mazzio\u2019s paid for the property-</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">13] Mazzio\u2019s argued that it didn\u2019t believe it could obtain the building and liquor permits it would need to operate its restaurant. In addition, Mazzio\u2019s chose not to apply for the licenses because of newfound expenses. However, under Arkansas law, mere inconvenience or cost of compliance does not excuse a contractual obligation. <em>Crookham &amp; Vessels, inc. v. Larry Moyer Trucking, Inc., </em>16 ArkApp. 214, 699 S.W.2d 414, 416-17 (Ark.Ct.App.1985). Mazzio\u2019s failed to meet its burden of proving the impossibility defense, and it has not shown the district court was clearly erroneous in its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">C. Damages Evidence and Award</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Mazzio\u2019s also appeals the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and damages award in regard to the value of the land. Mazzio\u2019s first quibbles with the district court\u2019s decision allowing First Financial\u2019s president to testify as to the value of the land. However, Arkansas law grants broad authority for land owners to testify as to the value of their land. <em>See Ark. State Highway Comm\u2019n v. Mullens, </em>255 Ark. 796, 502 S.W.2d 626, 627 (Ark.1973). Some of the testimony by the president of First Financial was based on hearsay; however, in light of the president\u2019s other sources of information, we perceive no abuse of discretion in admitting this testimony. <em>See Ogden v. Wax Works, Inc., </em>214 F.3d 999, 1010 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">As for the damages award itself, we believe the district court accurately applied Arkansas law on First Financial\u2019s expectations damages. <em>See Green v. Ferguson, </em>263 Ark. 601, 567 S.W.2d 89, 92 (Ark.1978). The district court was in the best position to make credibility determinations as to First Financial\u2019s president; moreover, Mazzio\u2019s presented no testimony on the value of the land. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">D. Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">Finally, Mazzio\u2019s appeals the attorney\u2019s fees the district court awarded to First Financial. Mazzio\u2019s objects to this award, arguing it doesn\u2019t comply with Arkansas Code \u00a7 16-22-308. However, Mazzio\u2019s ignores the fact that the attorney\u2019s fees were awarded based on a contractual provision, not a statutory provision. Paragraph Nine of the contract clearly states: \u201cIn the event of any court action or proceeding to enforce any provision hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party all reasonable costs of the action, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d First Financial indisputably is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>prevailing party in this ease, and Mazzio\u2019s hasn\u2019t disputed the accuracy of the calculation of fees. Accordingly, the district court properly enforced the fees provision according to its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">For the reasons explained in this opinion, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for damages and award of attorney\u2019s fees in favor of First Financial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-16\">. The Honorable H. Franklin Waters, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\">. In addition, we find no abuse of discretion in declining Mazzio's untimely motion to amend its complaint. <em>See Bell v. Allstate Life Insurance Co., </em>160 F.3d 452, 453 (8th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
