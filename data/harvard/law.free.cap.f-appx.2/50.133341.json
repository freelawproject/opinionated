He concedes that his petition was filed outside the one-year time limit but argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the time limit. We disagree. This court has yet to decide the question whether \u00a7 2255 is subject to equitable tolling. <em>Cf. Libby v. Magnusson, </em>177 F.3d 43, 48 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (reserving the question whether \u00a7 2244(d)(1), which applies to postconviction motions filed by state prisoners, is subject to equitable tolling). However, assuming without deciding that equitable considerations apply, we do not think that Mateo-Salas has demonstrated facts which would warrant equitable tolling. We briefly explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In response to a show cause order issued by the district court, Mateo-Salas argued that the limitation period should be equitably tolled because \u201che relied upon his counsel who specifically stated that he would keep up on changes in the law and if the law changed he would petition the court for a reduction or other relief in the sentence.\u201d On appeal, Mateo-Salas has failed to point to any decisions, or other changes in the law, that should have triggered the filing of a \u00a7 2255 petition. The cases that Mateo-Salas cited below do not help him for the reasons stated by the district court. Under the circumstances, Mateo-Salas has failed to demonstrate attorney negligence, much less the sort of conduct that might conceivably warrant equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Mateo-Salas suggests for the first time on appeal that equitable tolling is warranted because he timely asserted his rights in the wrong forum. This suggestion is meritless. During the relevant time period, Mateo-Salas filed a motion to reduce sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This motion asserted different \u201crights\u201d under a different vehicle and was filed in the correct forum. Accordingly, the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion does not provide a basis for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Our conclusion that equitable tolling is not warranted obviates the need to address Mateo-Salas\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was involuntary. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
