Robinson appeals the district court\u2019s amended judgment dismissing his action with prejudice and awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to appellees. Because Robinson failed to file a timely notice of appeal as to the judgment dismissing his action, we lack jurisdiction to consider the dismissal. We review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Barjon v. Dalton, </em>132 F.3d 496, 500 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 827, 119 S.Ct. 75, 142 L.Ed.2d 59 (1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-26\">A district court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>fendant under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, \u201cbut only where the action brought is found to be unreasonable, frivolous, meritless or vexatious.\u201d <em>Patton v. County of Kings, </em>857 F.2d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if its fee award \u2018is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barjon, </em>132 F.3d at 500 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The district court found that Robinson\u2019s claims consist of \u201cvague conclusions,\u201d and that his complaint \u201ccontinues in ... rambling fashion through 29 causes of action against 29 defendants.... \u201d There is nothing in the record that demonstrates that these findings are clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Robinson\u2019s action was frivolous or in awarding fees and costs under \u00a7 1988. We further conclude that the basis for the district court\u2019s award of $15,560.93 is clear from the record, and that the award is amply supported by uncontested evidence regarding appellees\u2019 costs to defend Robinson\u2019s frivolous action and to expunge the lis pendens filed by Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Because we conclude that Robinson\u2019s appeal was not entirely without merit, we reject appellees\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) and Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b887-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
