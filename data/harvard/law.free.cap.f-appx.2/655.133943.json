At sentencing, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied defendant\u2019s request that he be given a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a). Mr. Touche appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">The sentence imposed was 33 months. The crime involved the death of a passenger in a car driven by the defendant, who was intoxicated at the time. Initially, defendant was released on bond, and agreed that he would refrain from any use of alcohol. Either that day or the next defendant was arrested by the Lower Brule Police Department, and a blood-alcohol test showed him with a level of .180. Defendant\u2019s bond was then revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">As its reason for denying the aceeptanee-of-responsibility reduction, the District Court cited defendant\u2019s conduct in drinking to excess immediately after his release on bond. We see no error of law or abuse of discretion in this situation. See <em>United States v. Goings, </em>200 F.3d 539 (8th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\">. The Hon. Richard H. Battey, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
