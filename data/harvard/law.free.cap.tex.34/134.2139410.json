The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-9\">I. \"On the trial of an indictment for the theft of a gelding, the jury found the defendant \u201c guilty of horse stealing.\u201d <em>Held, </em>in view of our statute and of former decisions of this court, that the verdict did not find the defendant guilty of the offense for which he was indicted. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 3409; Jordt v. The State, 31 Texas, 571.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-10\">3. It was not competent for the State, in rebuttal to evidence of general good character of the accused, to prove particular instances of .criminal conduct against him, which were not connected with the charge for which he was being tried.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b132-11\">Appeal from Fayette. Tried below before the Hon. I. B.. McFarland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-12\">On an indictment for the theft of a gelding, the defendant was convicted by the jury of \u201chorse stealing,\u201d and his punishment was assessed at five years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-13\">The accused examined a witness as to his, the defendant\u2019s, general character for honesty. The witness stated that it was. good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>among all classes, <em>\u201c </em>all but a few things,\u2019'\" and was proceeding to say that he had lately heard of <em>\u201c </em>one or two things,\u201d when he was stopped by the defendant\u2019s attorney, and informed that he must not mention any particular transaction, whether of advantage or prejudice to the accused, but could only state whether his general character was good or bad in his neighborhood, for honesty. The witness then answered that it was good. On the cross-examination the district attorney asked the witness what were those <em>\u201c </em>one or two things\u201d he had heard respecting the accused, and told the witness to state all about them. The defendant\u2019s attorney objected to the question, on the ground that particulars of character are not admissible. But the court overruled the objection, and the witness was permitted to state that he had lately heard that the defendant had stolen an ox and a mule. Exceptions to the ruling of the court were duly reserved. A new trial being refused to the defendant he appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-6\"><em>J. R. Burns, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqP\">cited on the question of evidence the late English case of Regina v. Rowton, 2 Leading Criminal Cases, 333, in which the question was fully considered, and evidence of particular acts held to be inadmissible, even in rebuttal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-7\">No brief for the State,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-8\">Ogden, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">The judgment in this case must be reversed, because of a fatal error in the verdict of the jury. The defendant was indicted for the theft of a gelding, and the jury found him guilty of \u201c horse stealing.\u201d He was therefore indicted and tried for one offense, and the jury found him guilty of another. (See Jordt v. The State, 31 Texas, 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">We presume the verdict was written out by the jury, under the mistaken idea that a gelding is a horse, and it was the duty of the district attorney and the court to have had the verdict of the jury corrected, or else to give the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>We also think the court erred in permitting the district attorney: to prove individual instances of bad character of the defendant,. disconnected with the charge for which he was being tried, in re^. buttal of proof of a general good character. . . :</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
