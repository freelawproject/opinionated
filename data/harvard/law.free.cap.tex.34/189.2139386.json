If a judgment creditor takes out execution against the principal in the judgment, and then waives it and has it returned unsatisfied, the sureties in the judgment are thereby discharged. (Parker v.

McFarland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-16\">This was an injunction suit instituted by the appellee against James W. and Harriet A. Jenkins, and T. A. Baker, sheriff of Washington county, to restrain execution in favor of J. W. and H. A. Jenkins against one W. B. Lipscomb and petitioner McNeese, emanating from a delivery bond executed by Lipscomb as principal and McNeese as surety. This bond was dated April 5, 1860, and bound the makers for the delivery of the property on the third of the same month\u2014a day already elapsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The injunction was perpetuated by the district court, and the Jenkinses appealed; but in their appeal bond they take no notice of Baker, the sheriff, who was a party to the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">In certifying the transcript sent up to this court, the district clerk stated that it comprised \u201c a true and correct copy of the following papers,\u201d proceeding to enumerate the several proceedings from the petition to the assignment of errors; but not cer-. tifying that these were all the proceedings had in the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\"><em>S.

It does not appear from the certificate of the clerk that the record before us is a complete transcript of all the proceedings had in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The certificate is not in accordance with the requirements of the law, article 1494,. Paschal\u2019s Digest. Th|e appeal bond misdescribes the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Were we to determine the case on its merits, we can only look to the pleadings in the case, there being no statement of the facts which we can regard as such. (See 23 Texas, 65, Fulgham v. Bendy, and Birge v. Wanhop, Ib., 441.) The judgment of the district court, we think, is essentially correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The delivery bond was dated April 5, 1860, conditioned for the delivery of property on the third day of the same month and same year. (See Violand v. Saxel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 33 Texas, 283.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The writ required the defendants to appear at a time which had elapsed before it'was issued, and was therefore held to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>If the error was clerical merely, it might have been healed by proper allegation and proof, hut none such has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\"Where the creditor takes out execution against the principal in a judgment, and then waives it and causes it to be returned unsatisfied, the security is thereby discharged. (See Parker v. Nations, pamphlet copy, Galveston cases, 47; 33 Texas, 210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The syllabus in this case, as reported, misstates the decision of the court</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
