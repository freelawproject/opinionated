The courts of this State will admit a promissory note in evidence, if not stamped at all. The United States must collect her revenue, without assuming to regulate the law of evidence- in the different States.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We are of opinion that delay is properly suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
