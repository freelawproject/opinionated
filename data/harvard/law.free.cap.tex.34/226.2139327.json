The presumption of law is that the .survey was made, and .there is no proof against it, except the opinion of Tally, which is not evidence. As to presumptions in favor \u25a0of the grant, and the acts of the officers issuing it, see Williams v. Simpson, 16 Texas, 438; Id., 391; Bissell v. Haynes, 9 Texas, 556; Paschal v. Perez, 7 Texas, 384; McGehee v. Dwyer, 22 Texas, 435; Chambers v. Fisk, 22 Texas, 504; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 167; Titus v. Kimbro, 8 Texas, 210; Jones v. Garza, 11 Texas, 207; Lewis v. San Antonio, 7 Texas, 288; Norton v. Mitchell, 13 Texas, 47; 21 Texas, 728; 16 Texas, 616; 7 Texas, 384; and 26 Texas, 253. And the eases from the Supreme Court of the United States cited and approved in the .above cases. Where the act is by the proper officer, <em>\u201c every </em>pre.snmption is in favor of the grant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">The fourth charge is tha<em>t </em>the survey must set apart the land with such certainty that the land may, from the field notes alone, be known and designated, etc.\u201d This is error. The petition to the Governor, and all the papers preceding the survey, form a part of the title, and are to be considered to ascertain its locality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-7\">The description \u00a9f the land is by the commissioner who extends the title, and not by the surveyor, who is merely the agent of the commissioner, and for whom he is responsible. Decree No. 190 of Coahuila and Texas, dated April 12, 1832, in article five adopts the instructions to commissioners of September 4, 1827; of which article seven provides in regard to the commissioner:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-8\">\u201c He shall appoint, under his own responsibility, the surveyor, \u25a0who must survey the land scientifically, requiring him previously \u2022to take an .oath truly and faithfully to discharge the duties of his .office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-9\">\u201c Article 8. He shall form a manuscript book of paper of th e \u00a1\u00a1third seal, .in which shall b.e written the titles of the lands distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>uted to the colonists-, specifying the names, the boundaries, and other requisites and legal circumstances-, and a certified copy of each title shall be taken from said book, on paper of the second seal, which shall be delivered to the interested person as his title.\u201d'</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">This makes the entire record of the commissioner* a part of the title, and is exactly what the court charged against. This charge is erroneous, and misled the jury by excluding from their consideration all the description of the land in the Uranga grant, not contained in the field notes proper of Geo. W. Cash, the surveyor. The- court below seems to have confounded the Mexican system of granting lands with our own,, by location, survey and' patent.. They are as widely different as two things having- anything in-common can well be. Principles applicable to- one are totally inapplicable to the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-7\">The fifth charge is calculated to mislead the jury. No such: call as stated therein appears in the field notes: On the contrary, the call is from a fixed point designated by marked natural objects <em>\u2014i. e., </em>the hearing trees, which were found and sufficiently identified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-9\"><em>\u201c </em>When objects of the- character called for are found, they shall be taken as alluded to, if others of a like kind' are not found near and proved.\u201d (1 Bibb., 123; Id., 167, 67, 50, 86; and Herbert v. Bartlett, 9 Texas, 97.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-10\">The charge then states, \u201c should the jury find the surrey in the grant insufficient, as above stated, they should find for the plaintiff.\u201d But all of the description in the title, and' al'l the- marks, natural and artificial, found, should have been permitted to have been considered by the jury. \u201c The bearing trees, of beginning on the Medio:\u201d\u2014Every fair inference, in the absence of proof, would be, that this, an alteration in an immaterial matter, was a clerical error of the person who copied the protocol, corrected by himself, or under his direction ; and if so, it will hardly be pretended that it vitiates- and avoids the grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>11 Misrecitals of a grant in the title papers do not avoid it if it can be ascertained.\u201d (Fuller v. Duncan, 18 Texas, 34; Senne v. Bayne, 18 Texas, 50; Booth v. Upshur, 26 Texas, 64; Robertson v. Mosson, 26 Texas, 248.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-6\"><em>Glass \u00a7\u2022 </em>Callender, for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABv\">discussed the evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b227-7\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW3\">This is an action of trespass to try title.

(Johnson v. Pannel, 2 Wheaton, 208; Shipp v. Miller, Id., 325; Garnet v. Jenkins, 9 Wheaton, 75; Lewis v. Durst, 10 Texas, 415; Welder v. Carroll, 29 Texas, 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The question of potice was properly submitted to the jury. Whether the boundary lines of' the Uranga grant were so defined as to notify the public of their location was the main question of fact the jury was called on to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">It was a question for the court whether lodging the <em>testimonio </em>of the grant in the General Land Office; operated as constructive notice, or not; and whether it should not be recorded in the county where the lands were situated. In Gilbeau v. Mays, <em>et </em>al., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>it'was held that where there was no record of a prior grant in the \" General Land Office, nor in the county where the lands were situated, a subsequent location will hold the land, unless the subsequent locator had notice of a prior appropriation of the land, or the facts were such as should have put a prudent man upon inquiry. ' i</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We think the court erred in its conclusions and instructions as to the vagueness, and uncertainty of the evidence. If by meandering the Medio and Blanco creeks, it had been found that the surveyors, Giraud, Cash, Tulley and McKenney, had ascertained the point and the only point at which a line two miles in length would cut the waters of both streams, it should have been left to the jury to determine whether the Uranga grant had been marked by this line. The testimony may be uncertain and doubtful, but we think it should be passed upon by the jury; and the charge of the court, in virtually withdrawing the evidence irom the jury, we can but regard as erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
