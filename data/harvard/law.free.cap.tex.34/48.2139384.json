Petitioning for a <em>certiorari, </em>he alleged that Ihe note was just and unpaid, and represented that he was not present at the trial in the county court, on account of feeble health, old age, and his residence in are-mote portion of the county; that a letter from his attorney advising him of the judgment of the county court had miscarried, and he had not otherwise heard of the judgment until too late to give the bond for appeal. <em>Reid, </em>that the petition disclosed all the diligence requisite under the circumstances, and there was no error in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the <em>certiorari. </em>(Norris v.
