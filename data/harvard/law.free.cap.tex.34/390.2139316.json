G. McGehee v. J. L. Lane.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-6\">1. Parties aggrieved by rulings of the district court on questions of evidence must make the rulings matter of record by proper bills of exception, in order <em>to </em>entitle themselves to a revision of the rulings by this court. It does not suffice that the rulings were complained of in a motion for a new trial\u2014no bill of exceptions having been taken.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-8\">2. When part of a conversation is introduced as evidence, the party against whom it is offered is entitled to call out the entire conversation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-10\">3. The instrument sued on was\" a certificate of a remarkable cure of the defendant\u2019s eyes effected by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor ; and it concluded with an equivocal acknowledgment of indebtedness to some doctor therefor. The defendant pleaded <em>non est factum </em>under oath, and also an unsworn denial of any indebtedness to the plaintiff. Held, that in such a case it was error to instruct the jury that the only issue before them was the genuineness of the defendant\u2019s signature to the instrument. Por, though the unsworn denial of indebtedness may have been demurrable, yet it tendered an issue of fact which was accepted by the plaintiff\u2019s omission to demur to it; and that issue imposed on the plaintiff more evidence than that of the execution of the instrument.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-12\">Appeal from Hays.

Anthony, 31 Texas, 157; Riggs v. Horde, 25 Sup. Texas, 461; Seawell v. Lowery, 16 Texas, 50; Hutcheson v. Owen, 20 Texas, 288; and Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 1591.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arh\">Counsel further contended that as appellant neither excepted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the charge of the court, nor asked such charges at the trial as he deemed proper to be given, he could not be heard to object in this court to the charge which was given\u2014citing Converse v. McKee, 14 Texas, 30; Berry v. Donley, 26 Texas, 748; Thatcher v. Miller, 14 Texas, 16; and Howard v. Colquhoun, 28 Texas, 134.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-6\">Walkeb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A09\">If the appellant had obtained a bill of exceptions to the ruling of the court complained of in his motion for a new trial, ,we should have felt bound to reverse the judgment on that ground alone. When a witness is introduced for the purpose of proving part of a conversation, the party against whom the evidence is offered has a right to call out the entire conversation; but the record does not show that the court ruled otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">But there is error in the charge of the court, wherein it is charged that the only issue for the jury to try was as to the execution of the note. This was certainly not correct. The very short and imperfect answer of November 4, 1869, cannot be entirely ignored. It denies all indebtedness whatever to the plaintiff ; and this, in connection with the plea of <em>non est </em>factum, which was properly sworn to, certainly called on the plaintiff for more proof than the simple execution of the note. The plea might have been bad on demurrer, but it Avas not demurred to, and whatever issue it tendered the plaintiff accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The instrument is of a very unusual and suspicious character. It was doubtless intended as a puff for Dr. Lane. The defendant may have been willing to acknowledge that Lane had performed a miracle in restoring him to sight, but it may not have been his intention to acknowledge an indebtedness, of three hundred dollars on the same instrument, and it was a very unusual proceeding. The language is, \u201c for the above I am due the doctor three hundred dollars.\u201d What doctor? Doctors Herff and Edwards are named in this instrument as Avell as Dr. Lane. The-Avhole instrument reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201c Lockhart, March 26, 1867.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201c To all whom <em>it </em>may concern\u2014X do certify that I. was blind with chronic sore eyes seven years, and had been under Drs. Herff and Edwards, of San Antonio, for twelve months, and quite blind and given up as a hopeless case. I heard of Dr. Lane as an oculist, and applied to him; and, Io and behold, in nine short days I had no more use for my guide; can see very clear, and of course can recommend Dr. Lane as a <em>shore (sic) </em>eye doctor. For the above I am due the doctor three hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c Thos. G. McGehee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">This instrument, if ever signed by the appellant, was evidently no promise to pay Dr. Lane three hundred dollars, and cannot be legally so treated. It might be regarded as the admission of an indebtedness to some one, and perhaps could he explained to mean Dr. Lane. The parties doubtless did not regard it as a promissory note, or they would have affixed the proper revenue stamp to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
