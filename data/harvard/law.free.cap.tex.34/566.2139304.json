The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-14\">An \u201c assault with intent to kill \u201d is not an offense under our criminal law. A verdict, therefore, convicting a party of an \u201c assault with intent to kill \u201d is nugatory, and will not support a judgment founded thereon. Though the word \u201c murder \u201d may have been omitted from the verdict by mere inadvertence, yet it cannot be supplied by the court.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Appeal from Tyler. Tried below before the Hon. H. C. Pedigo.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">The opinion of the court sufficiently discloses the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-8\"><em>Pickett Rock, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anj\">The offense found, <em>\u201c </em>an assault with intent to kill,\u201d is not an offense under our criminal law. An assault with intent to murder is an offense. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 2155.) But an assault with intent to kill is not an offense. There is no punishment affixed by our law to such an act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-9\">The indictment is for an assault with an intent to murder. There is a difference between an intent to kill and an intent to \u25a0 murder. The former may exist where the party intends only such killing as amounts to manslaughter, or even to justifiable homicide. (People v. Shaw, 6 Parker, 327; The State v. Nichols, 8 Conn., 496; Nancy v. The State, 6 Ala., 483; Bishop on Criminal Law, \u00a7 515, note 3; 8 Alabama, 313; Arch. Crim. Plead., 260, note 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-10\">The most that can be said of this verdict is that it is a conviction for an aggravated assault. A charge that the defendant shot at T. with a pistol, with an intent to kill, constitutes an aggravated assault. (The State v. Lutterloh, 22 Texas, 213; Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 2150, note 663.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-11\">. Such being the effect of this verdict, if it has any effect at all, the punishment assessed, two years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary, is without any warrant of law to support it; and this, of course, makes the judgment rendered erroneous. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 2153.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-12\"><em>Wm. Alexander, </em>Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b565-13\">Evans, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">The appellant Long was indicted, under article 2155, Paschal\u2019s Digest, for an assault to kill and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">. The verdict of the jury was in the following words: <em>\u201c </em>We, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>jury, find the defendant guilty of an assault with intent to kill, and assess his punishment at two years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">This verdict is manifestly erroneous and will not support the judgment. <em>\u201c </em>An assault with intent to kill \u201d is not an offense under our criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The jury probably omitted, through inadvertence, the word \u201cmurder\u201d in their verdict; but the court cannot supply the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
