Horne, TDCJ-ID #825876, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Horne argues that he did exhaust his administrative remedies, though his grievances were refused as \u201cuntimely\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">We do not consider Home\u2019s appellate arguments that address the district court\u2019s dismissal of a prior 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. \u201cA timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite\u201d to this court\u2019s review. <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). Horne did not file a notice of appeal from this prior dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">We also conclude that Horne has failed to show exhaustion of his administrative remedies. The untimely filing of grievances does not excuse the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 867 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
