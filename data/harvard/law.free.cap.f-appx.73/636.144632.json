Furtick, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised A-Shabazz that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, A-Shabazz failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-19\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Al Shabazz has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-20\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
