Lewis has not provided a transcript, and he fails to establish a basis to have a transcript prepared at government expense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (2000). We have reviewed the existing record and find no basis for appellate relief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Lewis v. Boucher, </em>No. CA-00-566-7 (WD.Va. Nov. 27, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
