Alvarez seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying his \u00a7 2255 motion and motion to reconsider. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-25\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 16, 2001. As the district court properly concluded on remand from this court, Alvarez\u2019s notice of appeal was due on January 15, 2002 and was given to prison officials for mailing on day late, on January 16, 2002. Because Alvarez failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
