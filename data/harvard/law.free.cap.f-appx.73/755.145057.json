Kingery filed suit against the attorney who represented him in his criminal case and alleged that his attorney was friends with the prosecutor and provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s determination that Kingery\u2019s complaint was frivolous. See <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-24\">Kingery\u2019s claims that his attorney conspired with the prosecutor and provided ineffective assistance of counsel challenge the constitutionality of Kingery\u2019s conviction, which has not been reversed or called into question on direct appeal or in a habeas proceeding. The claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-25\">The district court\u2019s dismissal was not an abuse of discretion. Kingery\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is also DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir.42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Kingery is warned that, if he accumulates a third strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
