Maritrans appeals the district court\u2019s finding on lost profits and the court\u2019s amending of its judgment five months after it was entered. We uphold the latter action, but we vacate and remand for further proceedings on lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">1. The shipowner is entitled to recover lost profits upon a showing that its \u201cvessel was active in a market ready for its services.\u201d <em>See In re M/V Nicole Trahan, </em>10 F.3d 1190, 1195 (5th Cir.1994). Charles Gordon, Maritran\u2019s manager of chartering, testified that Maritrans participated \u201cvery heavily\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico charter market and the <em>Ocean 211 </em>was active in that market. Barge utilization reports showed that <em>Ocean 211 </em>was idle for lack of work for only 6.45 days during calendar year 1998. In May and June of that year there were no days in which <em>Ocean 211 </em>was idle for lack of work. Maritrans had no idle tugs or other barges available during the period in which the <em>Ocean 211 </em>was out of service. In fact, demand was so great that Maritrans leased a barge from one of its competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Uncontroverted proof that the shipowner\u2019s vessel operated in an active market is sufficient to establish lost profits. <em>See Delta Steamship Lines, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>747 F.2d 995, 1001 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Skou v. United States, </em>526 F.2d 293, 298 (5th Cir.1976) <em>(Skou II). </em>The shipowner is not required to prove that it lost particular charters because its vessel was out of service. <em>See Skou v. United States, </em>478 F.2d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1973) <em>(Skou I); Delta Steamship, </em>747 F.2d at 1001; <em>M/V Nicole Trahan, </em>10 F.3d at 1195. The uncontroverted evidence established that there was a steady, uninterrupted demand for <em>Ocean 211 </em>and the rest of Maritran\u2019s fleet both before and after the grounding. Maritrans therefore proved lost profits. <em>See Skou II, </em>526 F.2d at 298 (\u201cMost clear ... is the proof that [the vessel] was in immediate demand, as were her sister ships, upon her return to service. This demonstrates \u2018that profits may be reasonably supposed to have been lost because the vessel was active in a ready market.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Skou I, </em>478 F.2d at 344). The district court\u2019s contrary finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">At trial, Maritrans and the government offered competing estimates of the amount of lost profits. Because the district court concluded that Maritrans was not entitled to lost profits, it did not reach this question. We leave the issue of the amount of lost profits to the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">2. The district court may correct its judgment to comply with a statutory prescription for prejudgment interest at any time under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a). <em>See, e.g., Aubin v. Fudala, </em>782 F.2d 287, 289-90 (1st Cir.1986) (Breyer, J.); <em>Hayden v. Scott Aviation, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 270, 271-72 (3d Cir.1982). The district court in this case properly amended its judgment to comply with the Suits in Admiralty Act, which categorically limits prejudgment in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>terest against the United States: \u201cno interest shall be allowed on any claim prior to the time when suit on such claim is brought....\u201d 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 745 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
