Although the district court denied Davage\u2019s petition on the merits, the court should have construed Davage\u2019s pleading as a motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction because Davage had not obtained authorization from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We note that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>when the district court denied relief, it did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.2003). Because the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Davage\u2019s petition, we affirm the denial of relief on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Pursuant to <em>Winestock, </em>we construe Davage\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In order to obtain authorization to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 118. Davage\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Davage to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
