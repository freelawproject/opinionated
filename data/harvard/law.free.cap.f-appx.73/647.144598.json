For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">Savoy first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that she failed to demonstrate extreme hardship as required to qualify for suspension of deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 (1994) (repealed by \u00a7 308(b)(7) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009). We find that the immigration judge\u2019s \u201cdecision with respect to whether extreme hardship is established is a discretionary one [that the court] may not review.\u201d <em>Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E) (providing that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under [INA] section ... 244\u201d). Thus, we are without jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s discretionary decision to deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-24\">Savoy also claims that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Savoy\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1009, 1011-12 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003); <em>see also Khattak v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure on retroactivity grounds and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
