Araia argues that the evidence shows that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in both Eritrea and Ethiopia and that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Araia, however, fails to show a particularized connection between the feared persecution and his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-24\">Araia does not challenge the denial of his application for withholding of removal. That issue is, therefore, deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986) (issues not briefed are waived). Araia\u2019s contention that the decision of the Immigration Judge contains an error relative to Araia\u2019s statement about his citizenship is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">Araia\u2019s petition is DENIED. His motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
