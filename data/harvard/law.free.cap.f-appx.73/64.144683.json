She argues that the district court erred by increasing her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) because her offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the illegal aliens she transported. Because the transportation of aliens in the trunk of a vehicle is specifically listed in the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) as the type of conduct contemplated by the Sentencing Commission in drafting this guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>line provision and because the district court determined that the aliens being transported in the trunk of an automobile without seats or restraints were susceptible to serious bodily injury or death in the event of an accident, the district court did not err in increasing Brown\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.6). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
