(Bowman) filed a <em>qui tarn </em>action pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1) of the False Claims Act against Computer Learning Centers (CLC), various officers and board members of CLC, and Price Waterhouse LLP (\u201cPW\u201d). After CLC filed a bankruptcy petition, the district court, invoking 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1), issued an order dismissing the entire action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Bowman argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the entire action was erroneous. He argues that CLC\u2019s filing of a bankruptcy petition should not affect the pursuit of claims against PW and the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Once a party files in bankruptcy, further actions against the debtor are stayed under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. <em>See Arnold v. Garlock, Inc., </em>278 F.3d 426, 435-36 (5th Cir.2001). However, \u201ca section 362(a)(1) stay is available only for the debtor\u2019s benefit and does not prohibit actions against nonbankrupt third parties or codefendants.\u201d <em>In re S.I. Acquisition, Inc., </em>817 F.2d 1142, 1147 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and REMAND this matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">PW argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal should be affirmed on an alternate ground. PW contends that Bowman failed to effect service within the 120-day period provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), and that Bowman cannot show \u201cgood cause.\u201d However, as we explained in <em>Thompson v. Brown, </em>91 F.3d 20, 21 (5th Cir.1996), a district court enjoys discretion under Rule 4(m) to extend the time for service even when a plaintiff fails to show good cause. \u201cIf good cause is present, the district court <em>must </em>extend time for service. If good cause does not exist, the court <em>may, </em>in its discretion, decide whether to dismiss the case without prejudice or extend time for service.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Because Rule 4(m) vests the district court with discretion to extend the time for service if good cause, does not exist, <em>see id., </em>it would be inconsistent with the dictates of the rule, as well as an infringement on the discretion granted the district court, to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal based merely on the absence of good cause. Accordingly, we do not reach the good cause issue, and we decline to affirm the judgment on the alternate ground argued by PW.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
