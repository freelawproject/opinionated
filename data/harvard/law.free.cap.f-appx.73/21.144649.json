Plaintiff-Appellant Clarence A. Pitre, M.D., appeals the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Wadley Regional Medical Center. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-27\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. Clarence A. Pitre, M.D., an African-American male, is an obstetrical and gynecological (\u201cOB/GYN\u201d) physician. Pitre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was employed by Wadley Regional Medical Center (\u2018Wadley\u201d) from November 1998 until August 1999. One of the terms of his employment contract expressly required that he hold and keep current his Texas Department of Public Safety (\u201cDPS\u201d) certification. Pitre\u2019s DPS certification lapsed on July 31, 1999, while he was on vacation; when he returned to work, he was informed of this lapse and told that he needed to have another doctor sign off on his prescriptions until his DPS renewal was completed. However, on August 2, 1999, Wadley\u2019s interim CEO Bill Curtis fired Pitre and explained to Pitre that the termination was due to his failure to maintain a current DPS certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Pitre initiated this employment discrimination suit in May 2001, claiming that Wadley discharged him because of his race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (2000), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (2000). In response, Wadley filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that Pitre could not establish a cause of action under either statute. The entire case was referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge, while assuming that Pitre could make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, concluded that Pitre had failed to present substantial evidence to demonstrate that Wadley\u2019s reasons were pretextual. The magistrate judge recommended granting Wadley\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The district court reached the same conclusion as the magistrate judge as to pretext, and it granted Wadley\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Before we begin our review of the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment, we turn our attention to several motions. Wadley moves to strike (1) certain portions of the record excerpts containing deposition testimony and (2) the portions of Pitre\u2019s brief that refer to these excerpts. Pitre moves to supplement the record with the deposition pages contained in his record excerpts. Wadley argues that inclusion of the deposition pages would be improper because these depositions were not made part of the record, and Pitre responds that the record should be supplemented because there was no harm resulting from his failure to attach the deposition pages. As a general rule, this court is barred from considering evidence not included in the record on appeal, and \u201cattachments to briefs will not suffice.\u201d <em>Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>313 F.3d 305, 315 n. 11 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>In re GHR Energy Corp., </em>791 F.2d 1200, 1201-02 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam)). Because the depositions were not a part of the district court record, the depositions cannot be considered; the absence of harm is irrelevant. The motions to strike are granted and the motion to supplement is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Turning to the grant of partial summary judgment, this court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reviewing the record under the same standards the district court applied in determining whether summary judgment was appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Byers v. Dallas Morning News, </em>209 F.3d 419, 424 (5th Cir.2000). Under the summary judgment standard, a moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits on file indicate no genuine issue as to any material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, </em>530 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), <em>\u201cMcDonnell Douglas </em>and subsequent decisions have \u2018established an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof,\u2019 \u201d whereby a \u201cplaintiff must [first] establish a prima facie case of discrimination. [After doing so,] [t]he burden [of production] shiftfs] to [the defendant] to \u2018produce evidence that the plaintiff was rejected ... for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142-43. If the defendant is able to produce a legitimate reason, then the presumption of discrimination vanishes. <em>Id. </em>However, because the burden of persuasion \u201c \u2018remains at all times with the plaintiff,\u2019\u201d the plaintiff is \u201cafforded the opportunity [to demonstrate that an issue of material fact exists and] that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">To establish his <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, Pitre must demonstrate: (1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was qualified for his job; (3) an adverse employment action was taken against him; and (4) he was replaced by someone outside his protected group, or others similarly situated were treated more favorably. <em>E.g., Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Hous. Health Sci. Ctr., </em>245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001). We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that Pitre\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case is relatively weak. However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Pitre can demonstrate his <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, his evidence in support of pretext is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In attempting to show pretext, Pitre relies on essentially the same evidence that he used to establish his <em>prima facie </em>case. Pitre contends that Wadle/s decision not to fire two white doctors whose certifications had expired suggests that similarly situated persons were treated more favorably than he. This dissimilar treatment, Pitre argues, indicates that the real reason for his termination was based on racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The district court concluded that Pitre did not present evidence that Wadley\u2019s legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for its decision to terminate Pitre was false. We agree. According to the summary judgment record, there were significant differences between the situations of Dr. Johnny Jones and Dr. Thomas Wilson, the two white doctors that Pitre suggests were similarly situated but not discharged by Wadley. First, the evidence indicates that Jones\u2019s DPS license never expired, which makes his situation completely different from Pitre\u2019s. Second, although Wilson\u2019s DPS certificate did expire, by the time Wadley administrators became aware of the expiration, the certificate had already been renewed. Thus, in comparing Pitre with Jones and Wilson, Pitre was the only doctor to have his certification expire <em>and </em>have the Wadley administrators become aware of its expiration before it was renewed; these circumstances provided Wadley with a permissible basis for termination under Pitre\u2019s employment contract. More important, it means that Pitre\u2019s situation was not similar to the situations of Jones and Wilson. Whether we say that Pitre fails to make out a prima facie case or we say that he fails to provide sufficient evidence of pretext, the conclusion that summary judgment in favor of Wadley must be sustained is inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The final judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED; both of Wadley\u2019s motions to strike are GRANTED; Pitre\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">. Departing from the magistrate judge's recommendation, the district court found that Pitre could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination because he presented evidence that other similarly situated persons were treated more favorably than he.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
