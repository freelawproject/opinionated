Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Jefferies filed a motion to reconsider with the district court on January 8, 2003. This motion tolled the running of the time period to appeal, and thus the ten-day period began to run from the date of the district court\u2019s disposition of the motion. <em>United States v. Christy, </em>3 F.3d 765, 767 n. 1 (4th Cir.1993); <em>see generally United States v. Ibarra, </em>502 U.S. 1, 4 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The district court entered an order denying Jefferies\u2019 motion for reconsideration on February 11, 2003; the ten-day appeal period thus expired on February 26, 2003. Jefferies states he mailed his informal brief to this court on March 6, 2003. We construe this informal brief as a notice of appeal from the February 11, 2003 order. <em>See Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992). As such, Jefferies filed his notice of appeal after the ten-day appeal period expired. Jefferies has not alleged excusable neglect for his untimely notice of appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of the parties are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\"> This is the only order that Jefferies attacks in his informal brief filed in this Court. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
