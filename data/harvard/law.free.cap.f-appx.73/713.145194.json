Such judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>\u201cexamining the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the nonmovant[s]\u201d. <em>Duckett v. City of Cedar Park, Tex., </em>950 F.2d 272, 276 (5th Cir.1992). The judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in this light, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. <em>Amburgey v. Corhart Refractories Corp. Inc., </em>936 F.2d 805, 809 (5th Cir.1991) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-26\">Pursuant to our review of the briefs and record, summary judgment, based on prescription, was proper. Contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, the continuing tort doctrine does not save their claim. Then-contention that James Triche continued to be exposed to excessive noise <em>after </em>his transfer to a warehouse position in 1996 (this action was not filed until 2001) is supported only by conclusory statements in Triche\u2019s own affidavit. <em>See, e.g., Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 825, 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992) (conclusory allegations not sufficient to defeat claim for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-27\">Because summary judgment, based on prescription, was proper, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>reach CF Industries\u2019 alternate basis for summary judgment (claims barred by exclusivity provisions of Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
