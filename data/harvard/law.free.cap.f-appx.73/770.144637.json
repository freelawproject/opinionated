He argues that the evidence compels a conclusion that he is so eligible. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Pauc, however, has not shown that all reasonable fact finders would conclude that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion were he to be returned to Guatemala. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). He, therefore, has not shown error in the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Pauc also assigned as error the Board\u2019s denial of his application for voluntary departure and the denial of his application for asylum. Pauc, however, has failed to brief either of these issue and they are, therefore, waived. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986) (issues not briefed are waived). Moreover, even had Pauc briefed the issue of the denial of his application for voluntary departure, this court is without jurisdiction to hear that challenge. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(f), 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Pauc\u2019s petition is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
