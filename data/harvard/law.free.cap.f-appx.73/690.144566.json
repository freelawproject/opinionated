Kestler\u2019s new-trial motion did not extend the appeal period or postpone the finality of his conviction because the motion was filed more than 30 days after his sentence was imposed. <em>See </em>Tex.R.App. P. 21.4, 26.2(a)(2); <em>see also Roberts v. Cockrell, </em>319 F.3d 690, 693-94 (5th Cir.2003) (looking to state law to determine when direct appeal no longer available).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Kestler argues that his state habeas application should have been deemed filed when he mailed it rather than when it was actually filed in the state-court record. The \u201cmailbox rule\u201d Kestler seeks to apply does not apply to the filing date of a state habeas application. <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, the delay between the mailing and the filing of the state habeas application is immaterial under an equitable-tolling analysis because the additional suspension of the limitation period would still leave his federal application untimely. <em>See id. </em>(prescribing equitable-tolling analysis). In addition, the mailbox rule as applicable to the filing of his federal application would not render the application timely even were we to accept Kestler\u2019s assertions as to the date of mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
