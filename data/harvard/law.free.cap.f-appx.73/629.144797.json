Scott contends that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">The statutory maximum sentence applicable to Scott\u2019s offense was forty years (twice the maximum punishment of twenty years authorized under 21 U.S.C.A \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2003)). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a). Scott argues that, because the instant offense involved a distribution of .1 grams of crack, his punishment is excessive. However, he concedes that harsh sentences for repeat drug offenders have been upheld against similar challenges. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>973 F.2d 1354, 1365-66 (7th Cir.1992). In this circuit, proportionality review is not available for sentences of less than life without parole. <em>United States v. Ming Hong, </em>242 F.3d 528, 532 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 823, 122 S.Ct. 60, 151 L.Ed.2d 28 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-20\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
