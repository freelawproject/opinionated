The district cotut, holding that Rodriguez was entitled to absolute immunity, dismissed Hunter\u2019s monetary claims against Rodriguez with prejudice, and dismissed Hunter\u2019s monetary claims against Kille and Mitchell without prejudice pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court dismissed Hunter\u2019s claims for injunctive relief against all three defendants without prejudice to those claims being reasserted in a petition for habeas corpus. None of the defendants were served and none appeared. Hunter argues that the district court erroneously determined that the defendants were entitled to immunity because he had a constitutional right to counsel at his parole revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">A district court\u2019s dismissal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), of a prisoner\u2019s suit prior to service is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.1994). Whether a defendant possesses absolute immunity from suit, however, is a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. Walter v. Torres, </em>917 F.2d 1379, 1383 (5th Cir.1990). Immunity is \u201ca threshold question, to be resolved as early in the proceedings as possible.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>31 F.3d at 284. It is therefore \u201cappropriate for the district court[ ] to resolve the question of absolute immunity before reaching the <em>Heck </em>analysis when feasible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">Defendants Mitchell and Kille are entitled to absolute immunity because they were participants in the decision to revoke Hunter\u2019s parole. <em>Hulsey v. Owens, </em>63 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Littles v. Board of Pardons and Paroles Div., </em>68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>F.3d 122, 123 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Rodriguez participated in the revocation decision, the district court also correctly concluded that Rodriguez is also entitled to absolute immunity. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, even if Rodriguez did not participate in the decision to revoke Hunter\u2019s parole, Hunter\u2019s claim against him is barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey. See McGrew v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 160-61 (5th Cir.1995). A dismissal of a claim for damages based on absolute immunity or pursuant to <em>Heck </em>is a dismissal with prejudice. <em>See Boyd, </em>31 F.3d at 283-84, 285. A dismissal of a claim for injunctive relief may also be made pursuant to <em>Heck </em>and may be made without prejudice. <em>See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 190-191 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc) (holding that a claim for prospective injunctive relief that would imply the invalidity of a prisoner\u2019s conviction may be dismissed without prejudice subject to the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey). Heck v. Humphrey </em>clearly extends to Hunter\u2019s request for injunctive relief based on his assertion that he was denied representation at his revocation hearing, and the district court, therefore, correctly dismissed Hunter\u2019s claim for injunctive relief without prejudice and correctly dismissed with prejudice Hunter\u2019s claim for damages against Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Hunter\u2019s remaining claim, his claim for damages against Mitchell and Kille, was also properly dismissed. However, a dismissal based on absolute immunity should generally be <em>with </em>prejudice. <em>Boyd, </em>31 F.3d at 285. Indeed, \u201cin <em>in forma pauperis </em>proceedings ... dismissals as frivolous or malicious should be deemed to be dismissals with prejudice unless the district court specifically dismisses without prejudice.\u201d <em>Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1506 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc). Of course, a district court that chooses to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>claim as frivolous may also choose to make that dismissal without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[w]hen the trial court dismisses without prejudice it is expected that the court will assign reasons,\u201d and \u201c[u]nexplained dismissals without prejudice will necessitate remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court provided reasons for the decision to dismiss without (rather than with) prejudice Hunter\u2019s claims for damages against Mitchell and Kille. Accordingly, we VACATE that portion of the order dismissing without prejudice Rodriguez\u2019s claim for damages against Mitchell and Kille, and REMAND for entry of an order of dismissal with prejudice. We AFFIRM that portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice Hunter\u2019s claim for injunctive relief and dismissing with prejudice Hunter\u2019s claim for damages against Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">.
