At the outset, we must determine whether Dixon timely filed his notice of appeal. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). Where excusable neglect is apparent from the face of record, we need not remand the case to the district court for such determination. <em>Reyes, </em>759 F.2d at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The district court entered its order on the criminal docket on January 2, 2003, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6); the ten-day appeal period expired on January 16, 2003. Dixon dated his notice of appeal January 28, and it was filed on February 6, 2002. Dixon\u2019s notice of appeal was, therefore, filed beyond the ten-day appeal period but within the excusable neglect period. Because the district court\u2019s order denying relief misinforms Dixon that he had thirty days in which to note his appeal, we find excusable neglect appears on the face of the record. <em>See Reyes, </em>759 F.2d at 354; <em>see also Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 388, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (discussing factors relevant in determining whether excusable neglect exists); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>51 F.3d 42, 44 (5th Cir.1995) (holding <em>\u201cPioneer </em>controls determinations of excusable neglect under Rule 4(b)\u201d). Thus, we have jurisdiction over Dixon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Turning to the merits of Dixon\u2019s appeal, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Dixon v. United States, </em>Nos. CR-98-520, CA-02-2800-6-24 (D.S.C. Aug. 21, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
