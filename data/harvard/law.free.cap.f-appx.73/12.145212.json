While conceding that it has refused to comply with the order, Baker contends that the NLRB improperly certified Local 551 as the collective bargaining representative for certain of its employees. The NLRB has filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cAn order requiring an employer to negotiate with a union will be enforced if the NLRB\u2019s decision to certify the union is reasonable and based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Avondale Indus, v. NLRB, </em>180 F.3d 633, 636 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe certification order\u2019s enforceability depends, in turn, on the validity of the underlying election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA representation election is presumed to be fair and regular, unless proven otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn challenging a representation election, the objecting party bears the burden of adducing prima facie facts that, if proven true, would invalidate the election.\u201d <em>NLRB v. McCarty Farms, Inc., </em>24 F.3d 725, 728 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cThe objecting party must produce evidence of misconduct that interfered with the employees\u2019 exercise of free choice to such an extent that they materially affected the results of the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Such evidence must provide \u201cspecific events from or about specific people\u201d and must raise \u201csubstantial and material factual issues ... which, if true, would be sufficient to set aside the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Baker filed objections to the election selecting Local 551 as the collective bargaining representative for the truck drivers and production and maintenance employees at its Houston, Texas facility. Baker alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that agents of Local 551 represented that the union could solve the immigration problems of employees if it won the election but would report any employee who was an illegal immigrant to the authorities if it lost. The NLRB\u2019s hearing officer found that the testimony presented by Baker in support of this contention lacked credibility and recommended that Baker\u2019s objection be overruled. Rejecting Baker\u2019s exceptions to the report, the NLRB adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings in part and certified the election of Local 551.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">In order to succeed on any of the arguments raised in its petition for review, Baker must overcome the credibility determinations made by the hearing officer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>adopted by the NLRB.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Credibility determinations, however, are \u201cpeculiarly within the province of the trial examiner and the National Labor Relations Board and are entitled to affirmance unless inherently unreasonable or self-contradictory.\u201d <em>Cent. Freight Lines, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>666 F.2d 238, 239 (5th Cir.1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we are bound by such determinations unless: (1) the determination is unreasonable; (2) the determination contradicts other findings of fact; (3) the determination is based on inadequate reasons or no reasons; or (4) no justification is offered for the determination. <em>Valmont Indus. v. NLRB, </em>244 F.3d 454, 463-64 (5th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In support of its contention that Local 551 improperly capitalized on the immigration status of many of the employees, Baker offered the testimony of three witnesses. The first witness, Nemesio Cases, a Baker employee, testified that he attended a meeting at which a woman, who was introduced as a \u201crepresentative of Immigration,\u201d stated that she would be able to secure immigration papers for those employees who were in the United States illegally if Local 551 won the election. Casas did not provide the woman\u2019s name, could not recall when the meeting occurred, and stated that he left after fifteen minutes. In addition, Baker presented testimony from two of its supervisors, Baldomero Castillo, Jr. and Sergio Ortega, who testified that, at various times, they overheard unidentified prounion employees tell other employees that Local 551 could help with immigration problems if it won the election but would report any illegal immigrants to the authorities if it lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">In response, Local 551 presented the testimony of Adriana Cadena, an employee of a different union, who testified that she spoke at a meeting on January 19, 2002 regarding her work as an advocate for illegal immigrants. Cadena testified that she was the only woman to discuss immigration issues at the meeting and that she never represented herself as a government official, promised to solve immigration problems, or encouraged employees to vote in favor of Local 551. Her testimony was corroborated by her notes from the meeting and the testimony of three witnesses who were present. Local 551 also presented the testimony of two Baker employees, Baudelio Perez and Juan Jose Mendoza, who testified that Cadena was the only woman to discuss immigration issues at a union meeting prior to the election and that they had not heard anyone make promises or threats regarding immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">In overruling Baker\u2019s objections, the Board adopted some, but not all, of the hearing officer\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the NLRB adopted the hearing officer\u2019s finding that Casas\u2019 testimony was unreliable because it was not corroborated by any other witness and because he could not remember when the meeting in question occurred. The Board also adopted the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the testimony of Castillo and Ortega was not credible because they were not specific about times or individuals and because, as supervisors, they had a stake in the outcome of the election. Finally, the NLRB adopted the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the testimony of Cadena was credible because it was corroborated by documentary evidence and the testimony of other witnesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Nothing in Baker\u2019s petition for review demonstrates that these credibility determinations were unreasonable, unjustified or contradicted by other findings of fact. Accordingly, we are bound by those determinations. The petition for review is DENIED and the NLRB\u2019s order directing Baker to negotiate with Local 551 is ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>published and is not precedent except tinder the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">. Ideally, a representation election should occur under \"laboratory conditions\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\"an ... atmosphere in which a free choice may be made by employees, protected from interference by employer, union, Board agent or other parties.\u201d <em>Avondale, </em>180 F.3d at 636 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because, however, such conditions are \"unattainable ... in the real world of union organizational efforts,\u201d we must compare \"the conduct of a challenged election to the laboratory conditions paradigm, recognizing the contaminating influence of the realities of industrial life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636-37 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-12\">. While Baker objected to the election on other grounds, it does not raise those objections in its petition for review. Accordingly, they are waived. <em>See Carmon v. Lubrizol Corp., </em>17 F.3d 791, 794 (5th Cir.1994) (\"We liberally construe briefs in determining issues presented for review; however, issues not raised at all are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-5\">. In addition to challenging these credibility determinations, Baker contends that the election was not conducted under \"laboratory conditions\u201d and that the NLRB\u2019s certification order was not supported by substantial evidence. These arguments, however, are premised on Baker\u2019s assertion that the credibility determinations adopted by the Board were erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">. Although our case law primarily addresses situations in which credibility determinations are made by an administrative law judge, the parties do not dispute that the same standard of review applies when such determinations are made by a hearing officer in the context of a representation proceeding pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d) and then adopted by the NLRB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\">. The Board expressly declined to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s findings that Cadena was a disinterested witness and was not acting as an agent of Local 551 when she spoke at the January 2002 meeting. Moreover, only one member of the Board relied solely on the finding that the alleged misconduct occurred outside the relevant time period between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>filing of the petition for election and the election itself. Thus, we need not address Baker\u2019s challenges to these findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">. Baker contends that the hearing officer erred in crediting Cadena\u2019s testimony because the failure to call union organizer Juan Del Campo, who introduced Cadena at the meeting in question, created an inference that Del Campo\u2019s testimony would be adverse to Local 551's position and consistent with the testimony of Casas. <em>See Tellepsen Pipeline Servs. Co. v. NLRB, </em>320 F.3d 554, 562 (5th Cir.2003) (\"Normally, under NLRB precedent, the failure to call an available witness likely to have knowledge about a particular matter gives rise to an inference that such testimony would be adverse to the party\u2019s position and consistent with the opposing party.\u201d). As we discussed in <em>Tellepsen Pipeline, </em>however, this inference does not affect a credibility determination where, as here, the relevant witness testimony was corroborated by other witnesses. <em>See id. </em>at 562-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
