Wyatt, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Wyatt\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Wyatt v. Jones, </em>No. CA-03-247-3 (E.D. Va. filed Mar. 18, 2003 &amp; entered Mar. 19, 2003; Apr. 11, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
