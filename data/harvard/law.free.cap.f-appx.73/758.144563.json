Zavaher contends the BIA erred by upholding the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations and by failing to give weight to his own documentary evidence and corroborative testimony. The IJ determined that Zavaher failed to present a credible application for asylum after viewing Zavaher\u2019s demeanor and examining inconsistencies and implausibilities in Zavaher\u2019s testimony and application.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\u201cWe give great deference to an IJ\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). In this regard, we have made it emphatically clear that we \u201cwill not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility\u201d. <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted).
