Bruton, Texas prisoner # 703691, appeals the summary judgment in favor of the defendants, employees of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. He asserts that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in failing to conduct sufficient testing to identify and treat his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-23\">Bruton has not, however, produced summary judgment evidence which would support a finding that the defendants knew \u201cthat [Bruton faced] a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded] that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1984, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Rather, he has merely identified a disagreement with the steps taken to treat him, and has, at best, established only negligence on the part of prison employees, a level of culpability insufficient to give rise to a constitutional violation. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-24\">Bruton also asserts that the district court prematurely granted summary judgment because the defendants failed to comply with a discovery order. In light of Bruton\u2019s failure to establish a constitutional violation, he has not established that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide him with the name of one of the doctors who treated him would have affected the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-25\">Bruton has not shown the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).
