Little claims that the Bureau of Prisons erred in failing to restore his forfeited statutory good time credit on his federal sentence. He argues that the warden did not have the discretion to deny his request for the restoration of his statutory good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">Little has failed to show that the prison administration abused its discretion or that he did not receive proper notice from the prison authorities. The warden had the discretion to deny Little\u2019s request for restoration of his statutory good time. <em>See Sexton v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 1300, 1301 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-23\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-19\">.
