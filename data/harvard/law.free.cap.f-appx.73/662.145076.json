Robinson raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for mistrial in light of the Government\u2019s remarks offered during its rebuttal argument. Second, Robinson asserts that the district court improperly instructed the jury in three instances. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct warranting a mistrial, a court considers: (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>remarks were improper; and only if so, (2) whether the remarks prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Morsley, </em>64 F.3d 907, 913 (4th Cir.1995). It is not prosecutorial misconduct for the prosecution to point out that the defense\u2019s argument relies on an implication that the testifying police officers were not credible. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>267 F.3d 729, 740-41 (7th Cir.2001). Likewise, the Government\u2019s statement that \u201cat the end of the day it turns on credibility,\u201d is a proper statement. <em>See United States v. Diaz Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 956 (5th Cir.1990). Under this standard, the rebuttal argument offered by the Government in response to the defense implication that the police officers might not be credible was not improper, and we find the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Robinson\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>293 F.3d 153, 163 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cThis court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and as part of the whole trial\u201d to determine \u201cwhether the court adequately instructed the jury on the elements of the offense and the accused\u2019s defenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>932 F.2d 306, 317 (4th Cir.1991)). A refusal to grant a requested instruction is only reversible error if the instruction (1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>150 F.3d 382, 388 (4th Cir.1998). First, Robinson asserts the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that his mere presence near a firearm did not establish possession. The instructions given to the jury properly advised the jury that the Government was required to prove the firearm and ammunition were within Robinson\u2019s control, and that he possessed them purposefully, voluntarily, and not by accident or mistake. Robinson tossed the gun as he was fleeing, the arresting officer recovered a magazine of ammunition from Robinson\u2019s pocket, and the magazine from Robinson\u2019s pocket fit the gun recovered from the path of his flight. Because the instructions offered by the district court substantially covered the instruction sought by Robinson, and the mere presence instruction did not deal with a factual situation presented at trial and not covered by the district court\u2019s instructions, we find the instructions offered by the district court to the jury were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Second, Robinson contends the district court erred by refusing to give the identification instruction requested by the defense. The instruction Robinson sought, however, is required only in a case in which the evidence strongly suggests the likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>928 F.2d 1403, 1405 (4th Cir.1991). Upon our review of the record, we conclude the district court did not err in failing to give the requested instruction. There was plenty of additional identification evidence present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Third, Robinson asserts the district court erred by giving an instruction concerning flight as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Generally, a consciousness of guilt may be deduced from evidence of flight, and a jury\u2019s guilty verdict may be supported by consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Obi </em>239 F.3d 662, 665 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 835, 122 S.Ct. 86, 151 L.Ed.2d 49 (2001). In order for a flight instruction to be appropriate, the evidence must establish all the supporting inferences that link the flight to consciousness of guilt for the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>In response to a command from a uniformed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>officer in a marked police car to stop and raise Ms arms, Robinson quickly turned and ran in the opposite direction. Robinson fled down the street and attempted to dispose of Ms handgun. The jury instruction specifically cautioned that the evidence of flight did not substitute for proof of guilt. Furthermore, the jury was instructed that the Government was required to prove that Robinson knowingly and willfully possessed the firearm and that Ms possession was not by mistake or accident. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving an instruction concerning flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument will not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
