She argues that the district court erred when it departed upward two-levels to reach her guideline range of imprisonment based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1, comment. (n.5), which allows upward departures for identification fraud involving \u201csubstantially more than 100 documents.\u201d Vargas argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 already provides an adjustment for cases involving 100 or more documents, thus, the guideline already took her offense conduct into consideration. Because she did not make this argument in the district court, her argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Musa, </em>45 F.3d 922, 924 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The district court correctly applied Application Note 5 when it upwardly departed two-levels. Because 2,700 documents is \u201csubstantially more than 100 documents,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1, comment, (n.5), the upward departure was justified. In addition, the district court based its departure, in part, upon the threat to the nation\u2019s security placed by Vargas\u2019 offense conduct. The court found that the selling of false social security cards to illegal aliens who hail from nations that are known to support terrorism placed the nation in \u201cgreat peril.\u201d The guidelines encourage departures for offense conduct which significantly endangers national security. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14. Vargas cannot show plain error; the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
