Henderson\u2019s motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">Henderson\u2019s allegations concerning the delay in receiving medical treatment and the denial of adequate medical treatment do not demonstrate that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Henderson\u2019s allegations demonstrate, at most, negligence and disagreement with the treatment received; such conduct does not establish a constitutional violation. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106; <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-22\">Henderson\u2019s conclusional allegations of retaliation do not establish a retaliatory motive or a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996). Henderson has abandoned by failing to assert his claims regarding the slip and fall in the shower and the denial of due process with respect to his classification as a gang member. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-23\">Henderson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying him leave to amend his complaint. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9-10 (5th Cir.1994); R. 16-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-24\">Henderson has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. He has not shown that he will present a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>frivolous issue on appeal. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Henderson\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous each count as strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Henderson is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
