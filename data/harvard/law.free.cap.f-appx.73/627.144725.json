DeVaughn appeals his conviction and six-month sentence following his guilty plea to possessing marijuana in a federal correctional facility in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 (2000). DeVaughn\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing the adequacy of DeVaughn\u2019s plea hearing. DeVaughn has filed a supplemental pro se brief asserting claims under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, <em>as amended, </em>18 U.S.C., app. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1-9 (2000), and a breach of his plea agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Our review of the record reveals no error. At DeVaughn\u2019s plea hearing, the district court ascertained DeVaughn\u2019s competency to enter a plea, that he had adequately reviewed his case with his attorney, that his plea was freely and voluntarily given, and reviewed with DeVaughn the rights he would forego by pleading guilty, the elements of the crime, the statutory maximum sentence, the impact of the Sentencing Guidelines, and the terms of his plea agreement. Given this, the district court adequately discharged its obligations under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Further, a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives antecedent non-jurisdictional errors, including claims of unlawful search and seizure. <em>See Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Hence, the claims raised in DeVaughn\u2019s pro se supplemental brief regarding his conviction and plea are without merit.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm DeVaughn\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, although we grant DeVaughn\u2019s motion to amend, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">To the extent DeVaughn alleges the United States failed to honor its agreement to make a non-binding recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons that his forfeited good time credits be restored, the record indicates DeVaughn has mis-characterized the nature of the United States' obligation. Rather, the United States agreed to recommend to the district court that DeVaughn \"receive any and all good time credit that may be available to him.\" Because the record reflects that the United States made such a recommendation, DeVaughn\u2019s claim for specific performance is meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
