Adams asserted claims of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs against eleven defendants. On appeal, however, Adams has adequately briefed arguments against only three of the original defendants: Nurse Bounds, Dr. Stephen Peck, and Dr. William Gonzalez. With respect to the dismissal of his claims against Officer Jesus Elizondo, Officer David Stevens Adams, and Warden James M. Duke, Adams has made one-sentence requests for relief that fail to identify any error in the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis. Such briefing is insufficient to entitle Adams to relief. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Adams has abandoned his claims against the five remaining defendants by failing to raise them in his brief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Because Adams\u2019s claims against Nurse Bounds, Dr. Peck, and Dr. Gonzalez were dismissed as frivolous, this court\u2019s review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cA complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact....\u201d <em>Martin, </em>156 F.3d at 580. Because Adams is proceeding <em>pro se </em>in this matter, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Adams alleged that Nurse Bounds disregarded a substantial risk to his health by failing to order medication that was prescribed for his edema, despite his repeated requests, resulting in a twenty-nine-day delay in his receipt of the medication. He also alleged that, in failing for so long to order the medication, Nurse Bounds disregarded a substantial risk of danger which \u201cshe was knowledgeable of.\u201d Adams further alleged that, during the period of the delay, without evaluating his condition, Nurse Bounds refused his request to see a doctor and instead scheduled a future appointment to evaluate his progress under the medication that she had failed to order. Finally, he alleged that he contracted a bone infection due to the lack of timely testing and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Although it is evident that Adams has received considerable medical care, we cannot agree that his claims with respect to Nurse Bound\u2019s are facially frivolous. <em>See Murrell v. Bennett, </em>615 F.2d 306, 310 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980) (concluding that an overall pattern of medical care reflecting general attentiveness does not \u201cnecessarily excuse one episode of gross misconduct.\u201d). Adams\u2019s claims against Nurse Bounds are not merely allegations of unsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence or medical malpractice, or disagreement with prison officials regarding medical treatment, claims that are insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we VACATE the dismissal of Adams\u2019s claims against Nurse Bounds and REMAND these claims for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">We reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to Adams\u2019s claims against Dr. Peck. After a thorough examination of Adams\u2019s allegations regarding Dr. Peck\u2019s treatment, and the arguments presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Adams\u2019s appellate brief, we conclude that Adams\u2019s claims amount to nothing more than complaints regarding unsuccessful medical treatment and disagreements with the medical treatment provided by Dr. Peck. <em>See id. </em>Because Adams has not shown that the magistrate judge abused her discretion, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Adams\u2019s claims against Dr. Peck.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We likewise agree with the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Adams\u2019s claims against Dr. Gonzalez are frivolous. Adams\u2019s allegation that Dr. Gonzalez, whom he identified as the \u201cMedical Director for Texas Tech University Correctional Health Care Systems,\u201d was personally involved in or causally connected to the treatment he received are conclusory and thus insufficient. <em>See Arnaud v. Odom, </em>870 F.2d 304, 307 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, to the extent that Adams contends that Dr. Gonzalez is liable in his capacity as Dr. Peck\u2019s supervisor, we agree with the magistrate judge that because Adams has not stated a nonfrivolous constitutional claim regarding Dr. Peck\u2019s treatment, he has no nonfrivolous constitutional claim against Dr. Gonzalez. <em>See Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>15 F.3d 443, 454 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (stating that supervisory liability attaches only where the plaintiff demonstrates deliberate indifference on the part of the supervisor).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Adams also argues that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing his complaint without conducting a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1985). The \u201cprincipal vehicles which have evolved for remedying inadequacy in prisoner pleadings are the <em>Spears </em>hearing and a questionnaire to bring into focus the factual and legal bases of prisoners\u2019 claims.\u201d <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation and footnote omitted). In this matter, the magistrate judge utilized a questionnaire. Because Adams has not shown that the magistrate judge\u2019s use of a questionnaire, rather than a <em>Spears </em>hearing, compromised his ability to present the facts underlying his claims, he has failed to show error on the part of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">We VACATE the dismissal of Adams\u2019s claims against Nurse Bounds, and REMAND those claims for further consideration. We AFFIRM the dismissal of all Adams\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
