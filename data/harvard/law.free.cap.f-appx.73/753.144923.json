Mancillas argues that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was barred by res judicata from filing charges against him after it had failed to appeal a prior determination by the Immigration Judge in a previous case. The respondent argues that, first, we must consider whether we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">We have held that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), jurisdiction will be precluded where the alien is removable for committing an aggravated felony even if the INS did not seek removal for that reason. <em>See Lopez-Elias v. Reno, </em>209 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2000). Mancillas\u2019s conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a) is an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to consider his petition. <em>See Lopez-Elias, </em>209 F.3d at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
