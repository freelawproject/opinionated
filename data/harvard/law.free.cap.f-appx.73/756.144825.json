Ali was ordered removed to his native Liberia after being convicted of a conspiracy to possess pseudoephedrine, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(d)(2). As Ali pleaded guilty to violating provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, his crime is a drug trafficking crime rendering him removable. <em>Cf. United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997). Because Ali\u2019s habeas petition relies upon an undisputably meritless legal theory, his argument is frivolous. As Ali\u2019s petition and appeal are frivolous, this court does not address any possible restriction on habeas corpus jurisdiction stemming from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. <em>Cf. United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, Ali\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
