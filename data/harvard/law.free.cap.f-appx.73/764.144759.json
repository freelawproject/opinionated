The plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights suit stems from the suicide of their son, Clinton Hines, a prisoner then housed at Parchman. After a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-21\">The plaintiffs argue that Anderson was deliberately indifferent to a dangerous condition created by Parchman\u2019s \u201cPharmacy Distribution Program,\u201d and thus violated Clinton Hines\u2019s Eight Amendment rights. The evidence does not reflect Anderson\u2019s personal involvement. <em>See Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir.1983). Nor does it reflect that Anderson was involved in the implementation of the Pharmacy Distribution Program. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that Anderson was subjectively aware <em>either </em>that Clinton Hines posed a substantial suicide risk <em>or </em>that the prison\u2019s policies concerning prescription drugs posed a substantial risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>increased inmate actual or attempted suicide. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Accordingly, summary judgment was proper even if we were to adopt the views expressed in Judge Kravitch\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Tittle v. Jefferson County Commission, </em>10 F.3d 1535, 1541 (11th Cir.1994). The alleged \u201c \u2018failure to alleviate a significant risk that [the official] should have perceived, but did not\u2019 is insufficient to show deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 838, 114 S.Ct. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
