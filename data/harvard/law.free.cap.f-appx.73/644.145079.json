Mandamus is a drastic remedy, which will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). The party seeking mandamus relief has the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate avenues of relief and that his right to the relief sought is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (citations omitted); <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). We find that Adams has not met his burden of proving that mandamus is the proper remedy in this situation. Rather, Adams could have raised this claim on direct appeal and/or in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>See In re United Steelworkers of Am., </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979) (mandamus may not be used as substitute for appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-20\">Accordingly, while we grant Adams\u2019 motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
