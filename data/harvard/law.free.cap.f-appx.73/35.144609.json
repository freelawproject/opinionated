The district court did not commit plain error in using the earlier edition, because the edition in effect at sentencing would have resulted in a higher specific offense characteristic enhancement than that required by the earlier edition; concerns use of the later edition would have caused <em>ex post facto. Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E) (2001) <em>with </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(G) (1994); <em>see United States v. Domino, </em>62 F.3d 716, 719-720 (5th Cir.1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">Keith asserts that his sentence was improperly enhanced based on an unreliable loss amount calculation. The PSR provides an \u201cadequate evidentiary basis\u201d for the enhancement; the burden shifted to Keith to rebut the loss amount in the PSR. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>283 F.3d 300, 314 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 934, 122 S.Ct. 2612, 153 L.Ed.2d 797 (2002). Because Keith failed to present evidence to rebut the amount, the district court did not commit clear error in accepting the loss determination; nor did it err in applying the offense level increase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(G) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-21\">Keith maintains the district court clearly erred by increasing his offense level by two levels for abuse of a position of \u201cpublic trust\u201d, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. Even if determining Keith held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>position of \u201cpublic trust\u201d was clear error, our record review persuades us: (1) Keith occupied a position of \u201cprivate trust\u201d with respect to Associated Milk Producers, Inc.; and (2) he abused that position \u201cin a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 (1994); <em>see United States v. Fisher, </em>7 F.3d 69, 70 (5th Cir.1993); <em>cf. United States v. Iloani, </em>143 F.3d 921, 922-23 (5th Cir.1998). Because Keith abused a position of private trust, we need not address whether he abused a position of public trust. <em>See United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.) (court may affirm on any g round supported by the record), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 874, 116 S.Ct. 199, 133 L.Ed.2d 133 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Next, Keith bases error on the district court\u2019s requiring restitution for the entire conspiracy, despite his plea to only a single instance of adulteration. We review only for plain error. Because Keith\u2019s offense involved a fraudulent scheme, and because his factual resume acknowledged multiple instances of fraud, there was no plain error in basing restitution on the entire scheme. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 289 (5th Cir.2002); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a)(2) (imposing additional penalties if adulteration committed \u201cwith the intent to defraud or mislead\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Finally, Keith claims ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to object on several grounds to his sentence. Because this claim was not presented to the district court, the record is not sufficiently developed. Therefore, we decline to address this issue, without prejudice to Keith\u2019s raising it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. McIntosh, </em>280 F.3d 479, 481 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
