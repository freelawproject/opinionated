Sexton challenges an increase to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). He argues that mere possession of the firearm during another felony offense does not justify the increase. He contends that the Government did not prove that the firearm was used in connection with the commission of the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (\u201cUUMV\u201d) offense, in furtherance of the UUMV offense, or in obtaining the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The determination of the connection between a firearm and another offense is a factual finding. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d 748, 754 n. 24 (5th Cir.1999). We review factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Section \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), U.S.S.G., authorizes a four-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d A \u201cclose relationship between the firearm and the other felony offense\u201d need not be shown; the showing required is only that the \u201cfirearms were possessed and could have been used to facilitate\u201d the other felony offense. <em>Armstead, </em>114 F.3d at 511, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">The presentence report provided that while he was involved in the UUMV offense, a police officer saw Sexton pick up a black revolver. The district court did not clearly err in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) increase to Sexton\u2019s offense level because the firearm was \u201creadily available\u201d to Sexton and \u201ccould have been used to facilitate\u201d his UUMV offense. <em>See Armstead, </em>114 F.3d at 512. The district court properly relied on the information in the presentence report, which Sexton did not rebut sufficiently. <em>See Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d at 754. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
