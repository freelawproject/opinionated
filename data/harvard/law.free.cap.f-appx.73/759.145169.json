Pursuant to a prisoner transfer treaty between the United States and Mexico, Buitr\u00f3n was transferred to the United States to serve his foreign sentence. After several hearings, the United States Parole Commission (\u201cParole Commission\u201d) ordered that Buitr\u00f3n serve 312 months of imprisonment. Buitr\u00f3n appeals the Parole Commission\u2019s determination. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">On May 31, 1997, Buitr\u00f3n strangled a woman to death at the Hotel Buenos Aries, Colonia Centra, Mexico. According to Buitr\u00f3n, he met the woman at a bar and after several drinks she offered to have sexual relations with him for five hundred pesos. Buitr\u00f3n obtained the five hundred pesos and checked into the Hotel Buenos Aires under a false name. Once inside, Buitr\u00f3n gave the woman the 500 pesos. Shortly thereafter, the woman allegedly slapped him and shouted profanities at him. In response, Buitr\u00f3n demanded his money back. When the woman said no, he grabbed her and strangled her to death. After the murder, Buitr\u00f3n left the hotel room with the five hundred pesos.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">On August 17, 1997, Buitr\u00f3n was arrested for the victim\u2019s death. On December 5, 1997, Buitr\u00f3n was convicted of aggravated homicide and sentenced to twenty seven years and six months imprisonment. Pursuant to the Treaty on the Execution of Penal Sentences, Buitr\u00f3n was transferred to the United States to serve his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following his transfer, Buitr\u00f3n was interviewed by a probation officer, who prepared a post-sentence investigation report. In the report, the probation officer noted that Buitr\u00f3n had also been convicted of intentional simple homicide in Mexico for which he was sentenced to ten years in prison, but served less than three years. The probation officer noted that Buitr\u00f3n committed the prior offense in the same manner as this case \u2014 he strangled a wom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>an to death in a hotel room after drinking and socializing with her. The probation officer further noted that Buitr\u00f3n committed the instant offense nine months after being released from prison for the first offense. Buitr\u00f3n did not deny these allegations. The probation officer concluded that first degree murder, which carries a base level offense of 43, was most analogous to the offense charged by the Mexican authorities. Buitr\u00f3n objected to the characterization of his offense. The Parole Commission scheduled a hearing for June 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Prior to the hearing, Buitr\u00f3n was evaluated by a psychologist, Dr. Karen Gold (\u201cDr.Gold\u201d). In a written report, Dr. Gold found \u201cBuitr\u00f3n to be a man of average intelligence, with a good deal of personal insight and a recognition that alcohol and anger have been weighty problems for him throughout his adult life.\u201d Dr. Gold also found Buitr\u00f3n \u201copen to learning and psychological intervention\u201d and that he possessed \u201cthe intellectual ability to profit from past experience.\u201d Dr. Gold concluded that the \u201clikelihood of Buitr\u00f3n reoffending or posing a future danger is very low.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">At the Parole Commission hearing, Buitr\u00f3n submitted Dr. Gold\u2019s report and argued that his offense was more analogous to voluntary manslaughter, and at worst, second-degree murder. Buitr\u00f3n also requested a downward departure because of the torture that he allegedly received in Mexico. The hearing examiner found that Buitron\u2019s offense was most analogous to second degree murder, which resulted in an offense level of 30, and with Buitron\u2019s criminal history category of I, produced a guideline range of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The hearing examiner rejected Buitron\u2019s request for a downward departure, finding his torture allegation unpersuasive. Relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 and/or 5K2.0, the hearing examiner recommended departing above that range with a release date after service of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment. The hearing examiner found that Buitron\u2019s criminal history score did not reflect the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood that he would commit future crimes. The hearing examiner forwarded the recommendation to a Parole Commission attorney, who in turn recommended that Buitron\u2019s sentence be upwardly departed to the maximum sentence possible \u2014 330 months imprisonment. The Parole Commission adopted the attorney\u2019s recommendation. Buitr\u00f3n appealed the Parole Commission\u2019s sentence determination to this Court. After receiving a copy of Buitron\u2019s appellate brief, the Parole Commission granted Buitr\u00f3n a new hearing to consider whether the upward departure was appropriate under both \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 and 5K2.0. As a result, Buitron\u2019s first appeal to this Court was dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">On May, 16, 2003, the Parole Commission held a second hearing. The hearing examiner recommended that the Parole Commission set Buitron\u2019s release date after 330 months of service. The hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation was reviewed by a Parole Commission attorney, who in turn recommended a release date after 312 months of service. The Parole Commission adopted the attorney\u2019s recommendation and ordered that Buitr\u00f3n serve 312 months of imprisonment. Buitr\u00f3n appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">\u201cThis Court reviews the [Parole] Commission\u2019s release determination as though it \u2018had been a sentence imposed by the United States district court.\u2019\u201d <em>Molano-Garza v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>965 F.2d 20, 23 (5th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Hansen v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>904 F.2d 306, 309 (5th Cir.1990)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106A(b)(2)(B). We review the Parole Commission\u2019s construction of \u00a7 4106A and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. Molano-Garza, </em>965 F.2d at 23. We review the Parole Commission\u2019s upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Winters, </em>174 F.3d 478, 482 (5th Cir.1999). A departure is not an abuse of discretion if acceptable reasons are offered for the departure and the departure is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir.1993). When reviewing the Parole Commission\u2019s factual findings, this Court applies the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Molano-Garza, </em>965 F.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, the Parole Commission departed upward to 312 months imprisonment because: 1) Buitron\u2019s prior Mexican conviction was not taken into consideration in calculating his criminal history score, and 2) it was likely that Buitr\u00f3n would commit serious additional criminal conduct in the future. Buitr\u00f3n argues that the Parole Commission\u2019s determination that he posed a likelihood of future serious criminal activity was unreasonable because it was based in large part on the hearing examiner\u2019s subjective belief that individuals who suffer from alcohol abuse pose a greater danger of recidivism. The Parole Commission retorts that its decision was reasonable because Buitr\u00f3n posed a high risk of recidivism. We agree with the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Section 4A1.3 provides that a sentence outside the guideline range is permissible if \u201cthe criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... \u201d The introduction to chapter four of the Sentencing Guidelines provides the following statement with respect to recidivism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">The Comprehensive Crime Control Act sets forth four purposes of sentencing ... A defendant\u2019s record of past criminal conduct is directly relevant to those purposes. A defendant with a record of prior criminal behavior is more culpable than a first offender and thus deserving of greater punishment ... To protect the public from further crimes of the particular defendant, the likelihood of recidivism and future criminal behavior must be considered. Repeated criminal behavior is an indicator of a limited likelihood of successful rehabilitation. While empirical research has shown that other factors are correlated highly with the likelihood of recidivism, e.g., age and drug abuse, for policy reasons they were not included here at this time. The Parole Commission has made no definitive judgment as to the reliability of the existing data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">U.S.S.G., Introductory Commentary to chapter Four, at \u00a7 4.1.; <em>see also United States v. Riggs, </em>967 F.2d 561, 563 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cRecidivism is an integral factor in a court\u2019s determination of whether an offender\u2019s criminal history category ... is appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">In determining the degree of the likelihood of recidivism, the Parole Commission heard testimony from Dr. Karen Gold, Buitron\u2019s expert, who stated that Buitr\u00f3n presents \u201ca very low likelihood of reoffending if he maintains sobriety.\u201d Specifically, Dr. Gold stated that \u201cthere is a ten percent likelihood that Buitr\u00f3n would reoffend.\u201d The hearing examiner rejected Dr. Gold\u2019s conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">I disagree with the psychologist\u2019s overall evaluation of this case as posing a low likelihood of re-offending. I disagree with this evaluation because the exception which she allows for (the subject maintaining sobriety) is too great an assumption in this case and with the subject\u2019s prior history. In fact, my personal experience in this area would sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>gest to me that it is more likely than not that an alcoholic addict of many years will revert to the use of alcohol when next released (as he did after the first murder) and therefore pose a very high risk to the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">As the hearing examiner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">[I have] over a quarter century of experience working with alcohol dependence individuals. It has been my experience, almost without exception, these individuals are excellent inmates and very compliant while incarcerated. However, once released, most revert to the use of alcohol and alcohol addiction, and commit new violent criminal acts while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">... My finding and recommendation on this matter, based on my experience in this area, is as follows: The subject has had a life long addiction to alcohol which has only stopped due to his incarceration for the murder which he is currently serving. While incarcerated, he as well as many other alcoholics, display a high degree of motivation, remorse, and self awareness. However, when released, there is a high probability that he will return to his prior alcoholic addictive behavior. When he does, he will be an extreme danger to the community as is evidenced by his prior alcoholic addictive behavior. When he does, he will be an extreme danger to the community as is evidenced by his prior conduct which involved two separate murders, both fueled by his alcohol addiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">We reject Buitron\u2019s assertion that the hearing officer relied solely on his subjective beliefs regarding alcohol abusers in deciding whether to upwardly depart from the Guidelines. Although the hearing examiner seemingly stressed his views regarding the likelihood that a person who suffers from alcohol abuse will return to abusing alcohol when released from prison, they were made in response to Dr. Gold\u2019s unpersuasive psychological assessment that Buitr\u00f3n had a low likelihood of re offending. As the reviewing Parole Commission attorney pointed out, Dr. Gold\u2019s assessment was based upon a sample of only ten persons. Moreover, the hearing examiner correctly pointed out that Buitr\u00f3n demonstrated a high likelihood that he would commit future serious crimes based on the similarity and recency of Buitron\u2019s current and prior homicide convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">In <em>United States v. De Lunar-Trujillo, </em>this Court held that \u201cprior similar adult criminal conduct may indicate the seriousness of the past crimes and the likelihood of future crimes____The recidivist\u2019s relapse into the same criminal behavior demonstrates his lack of recognition of the gravity of his original wrong, entails greater culpability for the offense with which he is currently charged, and suggests an increased likelihood that the offense will be repeated yet again.\u201d 868 F.2d 122, 125 (5th Cir.1989). We find <em>De Luna-Trujillo </em>instructive and find that the similarity of Buitron\u2019s current and prior homicide offenses \u2014 both of which involved alcohol, solicitation for sex, and strangulation \u2014 to be reflective of his likelihood to reoffend. Moreover, the fact that the instant homicide was committed just nine months after his release from prison for the first homicide supports this conclusion. As the Parole Commission stated, \u201cthe nature of Buitron\u2019s prior criminal act \u2014 a homicide committed under similar circumstances as the instant offense \u2014 is clearly the type of offense that the Sentencing Parole Commission contemplated would be a basis for a departure above the highest criminal history category for the applicable offense level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">After carefully reviewing the briefs and record in this case, we find that the Parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Commission did not abuse its discretion in departing upward from the Sentencing Guidelines. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
