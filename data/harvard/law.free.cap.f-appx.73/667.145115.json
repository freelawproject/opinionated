Noble argues that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a four-level sentencing increase \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense----\u201d The district court did not err in applying the four-point adjustment in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Noble possessed the firearms in question during his commission of the felony offense of possession of a controlled substance, and could have used those firearms to facilitate his possession of that controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Armsted, </em>114 F.3d 504, 511 (5th Cir.1997). Noble purchased the firearms from the same person who supplied him with the controlled substance, and the firearms were clearly readily available to him to protect his drug possession. Indeed, by Noble\u2019s own admission, he purchased at least one of the firearms-a short-barreled shotgun-precisely because it was easier to maneuver and to use in the cab of his pickup truck, the very place where he possessed the controlled substance. <em>See id. </em>at 512; <em>see also United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1197 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that the danger of violence is undeniably increased where a firearm is possessed simultaneously with illegal drugs). The firearms Noble possessed were found in close physical proximity to the drugs he then possessed and were readily available to him to protect his drug possession. Nor is it of any import that the quantity of drugs Noble possessed was consistent with personal consumption. \u201c[I]t would be more than reasonable to infer that [Noble] possessed the firearm[s] in order to protect even the small amount of drugs kept, or intended, for his personal use.\u201d <em>Condren </em>at 1199. The firearms were thus possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d Noble\u2019s offense of felony drug possession within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>See Condren </em>at 1199-2000. Finally, Noble\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Condren </em>and <em>Armsted </em>are without merit, as is his argument that this court should reject <em>Condren </em>in favor of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s more stringent approach in <em>United States v. Routon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>25 F.3d 815 (9th Cir.1994). <em>See Hogue v. Johnson, </em>131 F.3d 466, 491 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
