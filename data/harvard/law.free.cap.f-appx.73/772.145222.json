Tokoph, is a pilot challenging the suspension of his pilot\u2019s certificate for operating a surplus military jet in violation of Federal Aviation Regulation, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.319(c) (\u201cSection 91.319(c)\u201d). Tokoph petitions for review of the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (\u201cNTSB\u201d) decision affirming the order of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) in favor of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (\u201cFAA\u201d) charge and suspension. Because NTSB\u2019s decision is not arbitrary or capricious and is supported by substantial evidence, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Petitioner Tokoph operated a North American F-100F Super Sabre (the \u201cF-100\u201d) - a surplus military aircraft with an experimental-category special airworthiness certificate - under written operating limitations issued by the FAA. While piloting the F-100 on the day in question, Tokoph made a high-speed approach to, and low-level pass over, a runway at the Lordsburg, New Mexico airport. During this approach, the plane was in the \u201cclean\u201d configuration, i.e., without flaps or landing gear extended. Tokoph\u2019s airspeed was at least 300 knots. For this maneuver, the FAA charged Tokoph with violating \u00a7 91.319(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The aircraft-specific operating limitations issued to Tokoph for the F-100 state that the \u201caircraft may not be operated over densely populated areas or congested airways, except when otherwise directed by Air Traffic Control\u201d and require that Tokoph \u201cplan routing that will avoid densely populated areas and congest ed airways when operating VFR.\u201d Because the Lordsburg, New Mexico-area is densely populated, the FAA ordered a 180-day suspension of Tokoph\u2019s pilot certificate. Tokoph appealed the suspension, and, after exhausting the administrative review and appeals process, found himself facing a thirty-day suspension of his pilot\u2019s certificate. He now petitions us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Aou\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">We accord substantial deference to the NTSB\u2019s interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That deference, to be sure, is not unlimited: As with any federal administrative agency, we will not defer to the NTSB\u2019s interpretation if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, we will not substitute our own judgment for that of the agency and will affirm unless the agency fails to articulate a rational relationship between the facts found and the choice made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>B. Tokoph\u2019s Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Tokoph complains that the NTSB erred in affirming his violation of \u00a7 91.319(c). Tokoph advances three arguments in his petition for review. First, he claims to have received oral authorization from an FAA Inspector permitting him to operate the F-100 in the way that he did. Second, the operating limitations issued to prior owners of the F-100 contained an exception for takeoffs and landings from the restriction governing flights over densely populated areas. Tokoph argues that it is unfair to deny him equally broad operating authority. Tokoph\u2019s third argument is that the flight in question was permitted by the language of \u00a7 91.319(c) as a necessary component of the landing or prelanding phase of flight. After carefully reviewing the facts and legal arguments in the record on appeal and the parties\u2019 briefs, we are convinced that his petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Given the airspeed and configuration of the F-100 during Tokoph\u2019s approach over the Lordsburg runway, the NTSB determined that no landing could have been made. There is substantial evidence in the record to support this pivotal conclusion, which, as we shall explain, requires us to reject Tokoph\u2019s first two claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Tokoph\u2019s first claim relies on the fact that the FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector (the \u201cInspector\u201d) who issued the aircraft-specific operating limitations for Tokoph\u2019s F-100 advised Tokoph orally that he could make reconnoitering approaches over densely populated areas. The Inspector also told Tokoph that he needed nothing in writing to reflect this exception. Tokoph contends that this oral statement by the Inspector either constitutes binding FAA authorization or should estop the FAA from charging a violation of \u00a7 91.319(c). The NTSB concluded, however, that the Inspector\u2019s guidance was limited to the context of landings and takeoffs and that, by his own concession, Tokoph was not landing the F-100 at Lordsburg that day. Again, because there is substantial evidence to support this determination,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we will not reverse the NTSB\u2019s conclusion that any purported FAA authorization to fly over a densely populated area when landing could not apply to Tokoph\u2019s conduct. The NTSB articulated a rational relationship between the facts found and its decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Likewise, Tokoph cannot prevail on his second claim, that his approach fell within the takeoffs-and-landings exception contained in the operating limitations governing prior owners of the F-100. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that prior owners\u2019 operating limitations could be extended to Tokoph, however, the exception could not apply to his conduct. This is because the NTSB determined that Tokoph was not actually landing the F-100. Again, the deference we must accord the NTSB\u2019s factual determinations requires us to uphold its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">Tokoph\u2019s third argument, that the language of \u00a7 91.319(c) itself permits his maneuver, also fails. First, it is unclear from Tokoph\u2019s appellate brief exactly what language in \u00a7 91.319(c) he contends authorized his reconnaissance pre-landing approach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More importantly, when, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>here, a court reviews an agency\u2019s application and interpretation of its own regulations, the standard of review is even more deferential.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under this standard, we cannot conclude that Tokoph\u2019s approach is exempted from the prohibitions of \u00a7 91.319(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Apz\">Because substantial evidence supports the NTSB\u2019s findings, and it cannot be deemed to have acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, we cannot disturb its disposition of this matter. For the foregoing reasons, Tokoph\u2019s pleas must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
