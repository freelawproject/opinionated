The summons in it was dated November 21st, 1857; was served on the 24th of said November, .and states that judgment will be taken for $72.50, with interest from the 1st of January, 1857.

Bainbridge </em>Smith, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-13\">1. It appears by the judgment roll in the former action, and the complaint in this, that the causes of action were between the same parties, for the recovery of the same kind of merchandise; that they accrued during the same periods, and that judgments were demanded for the same amounts. This constituted a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>fense, and judgment should have been rendered for the defendant. (M<em>arston </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>1 Johns. C., 397; <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>8 How. Pr., 414; <em>Averill </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>10 id., 85; <em>Swart </em>v. <em>Borst, </em>,17 id., 69.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-5\">II. The former judgment was conclusive upon the parties, not only as to the matter actually determined, but as to every other .matter which might have- been litigated therein. <em>(Bendernagle </em>v. <em>Cocks, </em>19 Wend., 207; <em>Embury </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>3 Comst., 511, 522; <em>Doty </em>v. Brown, 4 id., 71; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>id., 579.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-6\">III. The fact of the names of the plaintiff and defendant being identical in both suits, was <em>prima facie </em>evidence that they were the same persons in both actions. <em>(Hatcher </em>v. <em>Rocheleau, </em>18 N. Y. R., 87.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-7\">The j udgment should be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-8\"><em>Wm. M. Niles, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-9\">I. The appellant does not allege any other defense than a prior judgment for the same identical cause of action. We suppose that in a city of eight hundred thousand inhabitants, the mere production of a judgment roll against a defendant of the same name, is not sufficient evidence that it is the same defendant, .especially if the name be John Smith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-10\">II. Even if that were not so, the case in judgment is not \u201c identical \u201d in a single particular with that in suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-11\">One is for sales between May 23d, 1855, and December 25th, 1856; the other is for sales between November 9th, 1854, and December 24th, 1856. One is for colored linen shirts, cravats, &amp;c.; the other is for colored linen shirts, hose, &amp;c. One is for sales to amount of $72.50; the other for sales to amount of $122.50. One is alleged to have been sold for cash; the other is not alleged to have matured before January 1st, 1857.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-12\">One claims judgment for $72.50. The answer sets up a judgment for $90.43, and no attempt to identify parties, goods, times or anything else, except by throwing up to the judge a paper purporting to be a judgment roll, and asking hiip to deprive the plaintiff of a claim sworn to as now existing, and admitted by defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-13\">III. The \u201c answer is controverted as upon a direct denial.\u201d That is, we deny that any judgment was recovered against this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>defendant, and we deny that any judgment of this Court is for this identical cause of action. (Code, \u00a7 168.) Both then must be proved by the defendant, (1 Phil. on Ev., 2 ed., p. 6,) and the papers prove nothing on either of those points. Besides, the judgment roll produced is a mere nullity on its face. It does not show any appearance by defendant, and does not show a service within the j urisdiction. Perhaps the summons was handed to Richards in Australia, and then, he not appearing, the Court had no jurisdiction. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 138.) And lastly, if all this were not so, the judgment is not properly pleaded. Defendant alleges a public record on information and belief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-5\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-6\">By the Court\u2014Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlU\">The defendant set up in his answer a former judgment recovered against him for the same demand by the same plaintiff. The whole question is as to the identity of person, and cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The parties, plaintiff and defendant, have the same names in each suit, and not names of very ordinary occurrence. The complaint in the first action asks for judgment in the sum of $72.50, with interest from the 1st of January, 1857. The complaint in the second action is in this respect the same. The summons in each action is, in this particular, also alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The complaint in the present suit states sales of linen shirts, silk cravats, suspenders, &amp;c., between the 23d of May, 1855, and the 25th of December, 1856. The complaint, in the former action, states sales between the 9th of November, 1854; and the 24th of December, 1856, of shirts, hose, suspenders, &amp;c., to the amount of $122.50, and then avers that the defendant remains indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $72.50,-with interest from the 1st January, 1857, on account of said goods and merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">We think that there was enough presented to raise a presumption of identity and support the answer. The plaintiff should have been driven to repel this presumption. (18 N. Y. R., 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
