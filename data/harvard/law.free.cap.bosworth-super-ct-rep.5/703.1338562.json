Chave and Wife.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b711-11\">1. The provision, of section 220 of the Code requiring that on the service of an injunction a copy of the affidavit on which it is granted be served therewith, is satisfied by the service of copies of whatever papers were laid before the Judge, and on which he ordered the injunction whether the allowance was upon a summons and a complaint duly verified or upon affidavits commonly so called.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>2. An injunction order may be allowed and signed by the Judge, and be delivered to the officer before the service of the summons upon the <em>defendant; </em>but the service of the order upon the defendant before the summons is served, is irregular and is ineffectual. (Oode, \u00a7\u00a7 220 and 99.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-5\">3. An undertaking duly approved by the Judge, procured or furnished by the plaintiff or his attorney for the security of the defendant, and executed by, any persons possessing the requisite qualifications, agreeing that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant the damages he may sustain, is an undertaking \u201con the part of the plaintiff\u201d within the meaning of section 222 of the Oode, requiring security on granting an injunction. It is not necessary that it should be executed by the plaintiff or his agent or attorney,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-6\">4. Such undertaking must be given in form absolute and binding either the \u2022 plaintiff, or some one or more who undertake for him, absolutely for the payment of such damages; and it may, if the Judge require sureties, also bind others as sureties in form and in terms as sureties. There should be a principal and the Judge may require sureties; but such principal may be one who undertakes on behalf or for the plaintiff, without the latter being a party to the instrument.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-8\">5. The neglect to file the papers upon which an injunction is granted, within the time prescribed by the rales of Court, may be excused, and it does not render the service of the injunction a nullity or require that it be set aside.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-9\">(Before Woodeuff, J.)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b712-10\">At Special Term; Heard and decided, April, 1860.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-11\">Upou the summons and complaint in this action with the usual affidavit of verification, and upon an undertaking executed by two persons, neither of whom is the plaintiff, an injunction order was granted by a Justice of this Court before the summons had been served on the defendants, and the injunction order was served with the summons and complaint upon each of the defendants. The summons and complaint upon which the injunction order was granted had not been filed when the notice of the motion was served.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-12\">The defendants move to vacate the order of injunction or dissolve the injunction, or set aside the service thereof, &amp;c., on various grounds, viz., that the affidavits upon which the injunction was granted, were not served therewith; that the injunction was granted and signed by the Justice before the action was commenced <em>(i. e., </em>before the actual service of the summons on either of the defendants); that the undertaking was not executed by the plaintiff nor by any person on his behalfj but by sureties only; and that the papers upon which the injunction was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>were not filed within five days as required by the rules of Court.

The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit shows that no other affidavit than the complaint duly verified was presented to the Justice for the purpose of obtaining an injunction; this is sufficient for that purpose. By. the plain terms of section 219, a temporary injunction may .be granted, when it \u201cappears by the complaint\u201d that a case exists in the plaintiff\u2019s favor entitling him to have the defendant restrained. Whether under the language of section 220 requiring that \u201ca copy of the affidavit\u201d be served with the injunction, the complaint and verification are to be regarded as \u201c an affidavit \u201d as sometimes held, or the requirement of section 220 in this respect be held to relate only to cases in which the injunction is obtained upon affidavit (strictly so called) after the suit has been commenced. In either view it is sufficient to serve with the injunction the complaint and verification upon which it was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">The next objection denies the jurisdiction of the Justice to grant an injunction order before the actual service of the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">The language of the 220th section is, \u201c the injunction may be granted at the time of commencing the action, or at any time afterward before judgment,\u201d &amp;c.; and section 99 declares .that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201c an action is commenced as to each defendant when the summons is served on him or on a co-defendant who is a joint contractor or otherwise united in interest with himand section 127, \u201c that civil actions in the Courts of record in this State shall be <em>commenced </em>by the <em>service </em>of a summons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Under these provisions it is plain, I think, that an injunction order cannot become operative until the summons in the action has been served; and that the service of an injunction upon the defendant, prior to the service of the summons, would be irregular and ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">It does not follow, that the injunction order may not be signed by the Justice preparatory to such service and be delivered by the Justice to be served with the summons, although until the summons is served it has no effective operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The language, the injunction may be granted \u201cat the time of commencing the action <em>or </em>at any time afterwards \u201d was meant to define two periods. If the summons must in all cases be served before the Justice has jurisdiction to grant the order, then no injunction can issue until after the action has been commenced,, and the words \u201cat the time of commencing the action\u201d are without meaning and superfluous; but the Code means that a plaintiff may not only have an injunction after his action is commenced, but that he may have it at that prior-time described by the words \u201cat the time of commencing\u201d his action. And in this connection, those words mean while the work of commencing the action is going on and not after it is finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">It imports that the injunction may be obtained so that it shall operate at the time when and so soon as the action is commenced, and not alone after it is commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">This- accords with good sense. It meets a very large class of cases- in which it is of vital importance to a plaintiff to enjoin the defendant at the very instant he is apprised that an action is commenced, and in which the defendant would, but for such injunction, defeat the very object of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The section which declares that the Court is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction in a civil action from the time of the allowance of a provisional remedy <em>(\u00a7 </em>139) is in harmony with this construction, and sustains it.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The objection that the undertaking was not signed by the plaintiff or his agent, or by some person who in very terms is described on the face of the undertaking as acting \u201c on the part of the plaintiff,\u201d raises a question in regard to which there has been some conflict of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The language of the 222d section is, that \u201c-the- Court or Judge shall require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with or without sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined, such damages,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In my opinion the just meaning of this language is satisfied, and all the proposed benefits to the defendant are secured by construing the words \u201con the part of the plaintiff,\u201d as simply words of contrast or opposition to the part of his adversary. And that an approved undertaking, executed by any persons of competent ability, agreeing that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant the damages which he may sustain, if it be procured and furnished by the plaintiff or his attorney for the security of the defendant, is an undertaking on the part of the plaintiff within the meaning of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">If this be not so, then on the part of the plaintiff can only mean \u201c executed by the plaintiff.\u201d Ho other person can execute it who would not be (as between him and the plaintiff) a mere surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">It is suggested that his agent or attorney may execute the undertaking. Ho doubt he may, but if he executes it by the plaintiff\u2019^ authority then it is in law the plaintiff\u2019s undertaking and not his own; if he have no such authority, then he executes it just as any other person would execute it, binding himself and not the plaintiff, and he is just as much a surety as any other person would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Suits are often necessary when a plaintiff is out of the State, or sick, or under disability, or an infant, or otherwise incompetent or unable to execute an undertaking, or to authorize any agent or attorney to do so. I cannot concede-that it was intended that in such case no injunction should be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The words \u201c by the plaintiff, with or without sureties,\u201d had they been used, would be plain and would require the plaintiff to execute, but the words \u201c on the part of the plaintiff, with or without sureties,\u201d are fully satisfied if any person or persons in aid of the prosecution, acting in furtherance of the action, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>instance of the plaintiff, will peremptorily and unqualifiedly undertake that the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant the damages which he may sustain.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The terms \u201c with or without sureties\u201d would seem to indicate that whoever gives the absolute undertaking, whether it be the plaintiff himself or some person or persons whom he or his attorney may procure, there may still be sureties if the Judge so require. The forms of undertaking now in common use make all the undertakers in form and in fact principals as between them and the defendant; and in that sense they are absolute undertakings on the part of the plaintiff and not undertakings with sureties, and such is the undertaking-in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">It is only in accordance with the language of the section under consideration to say that an absolute undertaking that the plaintiff will pay (whether executed by him or by other persons) is an undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, and the Court or Judge may receive it, if satisfactory, of he may require the security of 'Others who shall execute in very terms as \u201c <em>sureties.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">That those who sign as sureties may so express their obligation is plain. Oftentimes they will prefer .to .do so. And the utmost that can be claimed by a defendant-(if so much even be conceded) is, that there shall be a principal in the undertaking in form; and whoru he can treat as principal without the necessity of demand or notice, and if the responsibility of such principal be inadequate then that he may have sureties. This construction would har\u25a0monize with the claim that in using the terms \u201c with.or without sureties,\u201d the Legislature necessarily imply that there must be a \u25a0principal, since otherwise there is no surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">If a defendant bring his action on an undertaking in the form in common use, in which the undertaking is absolute, he will be the first to say,'1 \u2018As between me and yourselves you are principals and not sureties.\u201d If so, then he has an undertaking given on the part of the plaintiff strictly without sureties. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\u25a0 Nor is it doubtful, I think, that an undertaking in the form \u201cI undertake and promise,\u201d &amp;c., executed by one person, with a further agreement in due form by another person by which he became bound as surety, would be a compliance with the statute in its terms as well as its meaning, although the plaintiff signed neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Indeed if that form of undertaking had been introduced into use, I greatly doubt that this question would have ever arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">But as undertakings are, in general, in form absolute, binding all the signers as principals, it has happened that'they have been called sureties and somebody is sought for to be principal in the terms \u201c on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">I repeat that an approved absolute undertaking that the plaintiff will pay, &amp;c., is enough, whether it be executed with sureties or without sureties, and such an undertaking has been given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">I am aware that there has been on this point also a difference of opinion, the late Chief Justice Duer, in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>(1 Duer, 666,) held that similar words in the section (182) prescribing the undertaking to be given, on obtaining an- order of arrest made it necessary that the plaintiff should sign the undertaking. But he was compelled to make his own construction yield when the plaintiff was an infant, &amp;c. In <em>Sief </em>v. <em>Shausenburgh, </em>(Sept. 22, 1858,) I am told that Chief Justice Boswobth held an absolute undertaking sufficient to justify an order of arrest, though neither signed by the plaintiff nor by any one professing to be his agent. <em>(Askins </em>v. Hearns, 3 Abb., 184; <em>Bellinger </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>12 How. Pr. R., 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The last obj ection to the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings is that he has not filed the papers upon which the injunction was granted as required by the 4th of the Rules of Court. When the notice of this motion was given the fact so stated was true and the defendant had a right to his motion and the Court might vacate the injunction order upon that ground. But it appears by the affidavit on behalf of the plaintiff that the omission to file the papers was an inadvertence, and so soon as the notice of motion was received the papers were filed. Under such circumstances the Court have a discretion to relieve the plaintiff from the consequences of his omission, but as the defendants\u2019 motion is regular such relief should be granted upon terms. Indeed, if the plaintiff had at once given notice of the filing and sought a waiver of the motion, I would have allowed no costs to the defendant if he persisted in his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">All the other grounds of motion must be overruled, but upon this last point the motion must be granted unless the plaintiff pays the costs of motion, $7. If he pay those costs within five days the motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
