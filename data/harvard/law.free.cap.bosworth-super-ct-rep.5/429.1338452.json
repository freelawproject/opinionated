A Mutual Insurance Company, for the purpose of increasing its available means, took up a subscription by which its friends agreed to give their notes for premiums in advance of insurances to be effected by them, the subscription not to be binding until \u00a7300,000 was subscribed. When the subscription was understood and believed to be made up, no fraud being practised on the defendant, he gave Ms two notes for $500 each for the amount of his subscription, and he effected actual insurance to an amount for which the premiums were over '$900, which was charged to him against his said two notes, and he, in addition thereto, took an open policy upon wMch the premium considerably exceeded the remaining $100, but no other risks were indorsed thereon except those included in the $900: <em>Held, </em>that the two notes for' $500 each were valid binding notes, although it afterwards appeared that the whole $300,000 subscription was not made up; the notes having been voluntarily given and there being no fraud on the part of the 'Company or its Agent.1</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-12\">1 <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Wilson,{i </em>Bosw\u201e 64;) <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Basset, {ante, </em>p. 147.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>2. A resolution of. the Board of Directors directing the officers to proceed with certain notes, mentioned, to liquidate the indebtedness of the Company, is a sufficient authority to warrant.the officers in settling an indebtedness to the plaintiffs by paying a part, appropriating an indebtedness from the plaintiffs not yet payable, in further payment, and transferring to them a .portion of such notes as security for the balance on their agreeing to givo further time of payment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-5\">3. Such a transaction makes the plaintiffs <em>Iona fide </em>holders for value in such sense that the transfer to them is valid, even without a resolution of the Board of Directors, though it exceeds $1,000, if they have no notice of the want of such resolution.1</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-6\">4.

Also that the Company was insolvent when the note was transferred to.the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs took the note with knowledge of the circumstances and of the insolvency of the Company,: and received it as collateral security for a preexisting indebtedness and parted with no value therefor, and are not the lawful and <em>bona fide </em>holders or owners, of the note for value paid before maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-12\">The answer then -avers that the Company are indebted to the defendant in the .sum of $2,300 for losses on property insured, &amp;c., which sum the defendant will set up by way of set-off and counterclaim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-13\">The issues were referred to Murray Hoffmah, Jr., Esq., upon whose decision judgment was rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-14\">He found the following facts, viz.:</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-15\">1 <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Johnson, (ante, </em>213:) <em>Smithy.

That this transaction was conducted in good faith on the part of the plaintiffs, and under the belief that the notes were valid, and that the' Company had power to make a valid transfer of the same to the plaintiffs for the purposes intended, and neither the Company nor the Receiver thereof has hitherto, in any way, repudiated the transfer thereof</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cThat the subscription of $300,000 was not full at the time the defendant gave his notes, nor has that amount been subscribed in binding subscriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">\u201c That the Company having failed, an injunction was served on its officers the 5th of March, 1856, and a Receiver thereof was appointed on the 21st of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">\u201c That on the 28th of the same month of March the defendant entered into an agreement with the said Receiver to cancel the two special policies which had been issued to him on the 12th November and 1st of December, as before stated; and by an indorsement in writing on the back of each of the said policies, signed by the Receiver, it\" was declared that the said policies were thereby canceled; and the defendant was entitled to the amount of return premium thereon specified, \u201cto be paid to the holder out of the assets of the Company, ratably .with all legal claims for losses.\u201d And there is also a balance to the credit of the defendant in his account with the Company of $98.87, being the amount of the said two notes left after charging against them the premiums of the two special policies, and the premiums actually earned on one open policy of $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">\u201c That the defendant is the holder of the said two several policies, and entitled to such return premium.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">\u201c That the Company is also indebted to the defendant to an amount exceeding that due on the note in controversy, for losses which occurred after his notes were transferred to the plaintiffs, as above stated, but before and were payable before their maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">\u201cUpon the foregoing facts I do find, as conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">\u201c That as the subscription for $300,000 was not filled, the Company could not have demanded from the defendant notes in pursuance thereof; but inasmuch as the Company had issued policies to the defendant, and as he had become, and was at the time the notes were given, a debtor for the premiums thereon, the notes were founded upon a good and valid consideration, and were valid notes in the hands of the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-11\">\u201cThat the notes were transferred by the Company to the plaintiffs, in contravention of the provisions of the Revised Statutes; and that the plaintiffs are not purchasers for valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u25a0 \u201cThat, therefore, there was no valid transfer of the said note to the plaintiffs, and that by reason of the offsets the defendant would have against the Receiver of the Company, if the suit were prosecuted by him, he can set up this defense. \u2022 That if the said note was legally .transferred to the plaintiffs, yet, as no value was given therefor, the defendant -is entitled to set off in this-action the several losses mentioned in his account, and also the amount of return \u00a1premium ($454.50) .so adjusted with the Receiver-as aforesaid, and the said balance- of $98.87, which- sums I have allowed; and exceeding,.as they do, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, Ido find .and decide that there is nothing due from the defendant to the plaintiffs in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">. \u201cBated New.Yokk, July 30, 1858.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">.

The note in suit was founded upon a good and valuable consideration, and was valid in the hands of the Company at the time of its transfer to the plaintiffs. In this respect the Referee-has decided correctly, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">I. At the time the defendant gave the note, he was justly indebted to the Company for premiums in an amount exceeding the note in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">It is not pretended that the subscription was obtained by fraud. It was fairly obtained, although it was not to be binding unless the amount specified should be subscribed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-10\">The insurances which the defendant afterwards effected, and for the premiums on which he became indebted, were likewise made in good faith, without any condition or qualification; and it is not pretended that there were any representations or other acts, which in any way invalidate the same; whether, therefore, the subscription which was then in circulation, was or was not full, is immaterial as regards the indebtedness f\u00f3r such premiums.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-11\">II. The note was given and received in settlement <em>pro tanto </em>of such indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-12\">In the absence of any proof to the contrary, this would be the legal inference. Giving the note is <em>prima fade </em>evidence of an accounting and of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness. <em>(Lake </em>v. <em>Tysen, </em>2 Seld., 461 ; <em>Defreest </em>v. <em>Bloomingdale, </em>5 Denio, 304.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-13\">3. There was no fraud in obtaining the notes, nor anything connected therewith which rendered them invalid, even in the hands of the Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-14\">\u25a0 While there was nothing wrong either in obtaining the subscription, or effecting the insurances, yet it is alleged that when the defendant was called upon to give the notes, - he was told that the subscription had been filled, whereas, in fact, it not so. was</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>It does not, however, appear that the defendant gave the notes relying solely upon the truth of such representation. On the contrary, it appears that he made inquiries of various subscribers, and finding that some had given their notes, and others were about giving them, he gave the notes in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">H. The note in \u2022 suit was legally and properly transferred to the plaintiffs before maturity, and they are the lawful owners and holders thereof for value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">Having been indorsed in blank, it was negotiable and transferable without any other act of the Company than the mere delivery with intent to pass the title thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">Such transfer and delivery was not in contravention of any provision of the Revised Statutes, and the Referee has erred in deciding to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-8\">The provisions of the statutes referred to (1 R. S., p. 591, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9,) are not applicable to this case, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">I. The plaintiffs were purchasers for a <em>\u201c </em>valuable consideration and without notice,\u201d and therefore within the exceptions of the 8th section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">There is no evidence of notice that a previous resolution (which is the \u201c notice \u201d referred to in that section) had not been passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">The Referee has, in effect, found that the transaction was conducted in good faith, and under the belief not only that the notes were valid, but that the officers had power to make a valid transfer thereof to' the plaintiffs. <em>(Howland </em>v. Myer, 3 Comst. R., 290.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-12\">The plaintiffs settled with the Company, paid their subscription before maturity, gave up and extinguished the notes upon which they had an immediate right of action, and extended the credit for a portion of their demand, which was a \u201c valuable consideration \u201d within the authorities upon that subject. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Springfield </em>Bank, 3 Sandf., 222 ; <em>Youngs </em>v. Lee, 2 Kern., 551; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>5 Duer, 260; <em>Goodman </em>v. Simonds, 20 How. U. S. R., 343, 370; <em>Hart </em>v. Hudson, 6 Duer, 304; Story on Prom.

McDonald, 6 Hill, 93.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-13\">As pledgees, the plaintiffs, on default of payment of the principal debt, were entitled to sue the collaterals. <em>(Wheeler </em>v. <em>Newbold, </em>5 Duer, 29; <em>S. C., </em>16 N. Y. R., 392.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>2. If the 8th section would have otherwise applied, still the charter of this Company has created an exception, rendering such previous resolution unnecessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">The 12th section of the charter of the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, (Laws 1842, chap. 217, \u00a7 12,) which, by the 8th section of the charter of this Company, is incorporated therein, (Laws 1843, chap. 92, \u00a7 8,) authorizes the Company to \u201c receive notes for premiums in advance,\u201d and to negotiate such notes for the purpose of paying claims, \u201c or <em>otherwise </em>in the course of its business.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">If, therefore, the notes in question fall within the class, referred to in the charter, (as they may under the circumstances,) then no resolution was necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">If the 8th section conflicts with the charter, the former must yield to the latter as the last expression of the legislative will. <em>(Howland </em>v. Myer, 3 Comst., 290.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\">3. Regarding the notes, however, as ordinary \u201cpremium notes,\u201d and not of the kind referred to in the charter, still it was not indispensable to the legality of such transfer that a previous resolution of the Board should be passed authorizing the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">Any approval of such transfer, however manifested, whether before or after the transaction, would be sufficient authority. <em>(Curtis </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>15 N Y. R., 11.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-10\">Such authority and approval were given and manifested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-11\"><em>{a.) </em>By the by-laws, (authorized by charter,) appointing a Finance Committee, President and Vice-President, with power, under the advice of such committee or of a majority, to transfer or otherwise dispose of notes, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-12\">(5.) By a resolution of the Board, passed 30th November, 1855, at which a majority of the Finance Committee were present, authorizing the officers to collect the notes and proceed in \u201c liquidating the liabilities of the Company.\u201d And,</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-13\">(c.) By the acts of the Finance Committee and officers, and their and the Receiver\u2019s entire acquiescence in the arrangement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-14\">III. The defendant is not entitled to set off in this action his alleged claim against the Company, for\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-15\">1. If the transfer was legal, and the plaintiffs be considered <em>bona fide </em>holders of the note for value, without notice, then no</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>claims of the defendant against the Company, however valid, can be set off. (Code, \u00a7 112 ; 2 R. S., 354, \u00a7 12, subd. \u00a7 9; <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Union </em>Bank, 4 Sandf., 604; <em>S. C., </em>5 Seld., 211; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>22 Barb., 335.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">2. But if otherwise, and if the defendant (as was decided by the Referee) is entitled to set off any claim, which he might have done if the action had been brought in the name of the Receiver, still he was not entitled to set off either the return premiums or the losses claimed, because neither was in existence at the date of transfer, and therefore not the subject of set-off. <em>(Furniss </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, </em>1 Sandf. R., 53.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\"><em>(a.) </em>As to the return premiums, they were to be paid in a special manner \u201cout of the assets of the Company ratably, with all legal claims for losses,\u201d and in no other way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">The Receiver was not required to cancel the Policies, (2. R. S., 470, \u00a7 85,) and instead of doing so, he might have suffered the risks to continue, in which case the insolvency of the Company would not have furnished any defense to an action upon the notes given for the premium. <em>(Hone </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>1 Sandf., 481.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">(5.) The losses should not have been allowed,.because</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">Neither of them was due or payable when the transfer was made, nor even when the Receiver was appointed, and not then a valid set-off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">The Receiver was appointed the 25th March, 1856. The \u201cpapers,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the preliminary proofs, were left with the Company for \u201c adjustment,\u201d in one case on the 8th, and in the other on the 21st of February of that year; such losses were, by the terms of the Policies, not payable until thirty days thereafter, which would be after the appointment of the Receiver, and therefore not susceptible of set-off as against him.

The fact found by the Referee, that this transfer or trust was in violation of the statute, and therefore void, because not authorized by a previous resolution of the Board of Trustees, is supported by the evidence, and disposes of the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">In the case of <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Myer, </em>(3 Comst., 290,) the plaintiff was a <em>bona fide </em>holder, and the decision is put on that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The resolution of 30th November is not an authority for - this transaction; because it was founded in an error of fact, if not in a fraudulent misrepresentation.

(16 N. Y. R., 324.) In respect to creditors of the Company, in good faith and in the usual' course of business, it was payable absolutely and in full. There was an actual loan of money at the time of transfer in this case. <em>(Ogden </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>MS.; heard, April, 1859; decided, May 21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The transfer to the plaintiff was made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The Referee so found, and, I think, correctly. Neither the Receiver of the Company nor any of its officers has ever demanded or claimed the return of this note. The Referee so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">There was no offer to show that the plaintiffs had any reason to suppose there was no resolution of the Board of Trustees authorizing the transfer. The fact that the plaintiffs received the note from the officers of the Company did not charge them with such notice. All dealings with a Company are done with its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Such a resolution is not, under all circumstances, indispensable to a valid transfer. In <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Myer, </em>(3 Comst., 290,) the plaintiff dealt directly with the officers of the Company, and that case decides the precise point' that the absence of a resolution would not defeat a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The Company had power to make the transfer. (3 Comst., 290.) The power was sufficiently exercised to pass the note to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The resolution of November 30,1855, was passed at a meeting of the Board of Trustees, (eleven members being present, and four of the Finance Committee,) and it directed \u201c that the officers commence at once to collect the notes to that amount, ($300,000,) and proceed in liquidating the liabilities of the Company therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">By-law X expressly authorizes the President or Vice-President, with the advice and consent of the Finance Committee, or a majority of them, to assign, transfer, or otherwise validly dispose of, bills receivable, or any assets, to secure the repayment of money borrowed by them,.the payment of losses, or other purposes, that shall have been sanctioned by the Finance Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The two notes, held by the plaintiffs past due, were pressing for payment. They probably were for losses. It was an undisputed claim against the Company. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">At the meeting of the Board of Trustees on the 7th November, all of the Finance Committee were present, when the \u201c Committee appointed to settle with Mr. Brookman, (plaintiff,) reported that they had not yet completed the settlement.\u201d (The pro-gramme for procuring the necessary means had not yet been matured. The subscription list is dated the next day, the 8th.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">At the time of the transfer, December 10th, the President, Vice-President, and two of the Finance Committee were present. (Probably others sanctioned it.) It required but three members to constitute a quorum of the Finance Committee, a majority of whom could transfer, &amp;c., &amp;c. The transfer has never been repudiated, and no question ever raised as to the proper transfer to the plaintiffs, except by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Gardiner, J., (3 Comst., 292,) says: \u201cI apprehend that the Company were not restricted by the statute to a negotiation for the purposes of payment exclusively. They might procure the note to be discounted, and apply the avails in discharge of their responsibility for losses incurred; or, if this could not be done, the same result might be obtained by a transfer of the note to the plaintiff, upon the indorsement of the Company\u2014the creditor giving time until the securities matured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>It will be borne in mind that the note in that case was transferred by the President as collateral security. The point is expressly taken, (2 Sandf., 180-183;) and it is at least doubtful whether the loss was contingent or absolute for which it was given to secure the payment. It is questionable whether anything was given up at the time of receipt of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In the present case, an absolute liability of the Company existed. - Two notes of the Company, over due, were in the hands of the plaintiffs, and they were pressing payment. The claim was indisputable. The amount was $5,574.56. The Company, at the time of the transfer of this note to the plaintiffs, paid them $2,000 in cash, and the plaintiffs permitted the Company to charge them their subscription of $2,000 as cash, thus leaving due to them, at the time of the transfer, the sum of $1,574.56 and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">. Upon receiving the note of the Company for the balance due on those two notes\u2014$1,574.56 and interests $1,751.95\u2014and the note in suit, with others, as collateral, the plaintiffs gave up the existing liability of the Company. The two notes were given up.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">It seems clear to my mind that the present is a stronger case than <em>Aspinwall et al. </em>v. Myer, (2 Sand., 100,) and is embraced and determined by the principle laid down in 3 Comstock, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Again, I do not see how it can justly be said that this transaction conflicts with section 8 of the statute. The act was passed to prevent insolvency. The arrangement entered into with the plaintiffs assisted the statute, in enabling the Company to continue its business, and actually did earn for the defendant a large amount of premiums which he did not pay to the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. In my opinion the Referee erred, and a new trial should be directed, &amp;c.</p>\n<author id=\"b450-10\">Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">The defendant had by a subscription with others agreed to give to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, notes in advance for premiums to the amount of $1,000. He did so. in two sums of $500 each. The condition of the subscription was that it should not be binding until the sum of $300,000 .was subscribed, and if it had never been subscribed the Company could not have required the defendant to give the notes; but on the other hand he could waive the condition and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>he afterwards gave the notes and no fraud upon him is shown, he must be deemed to have waived the condition by voluntarily giving the notes to the amount of such subscription; and on this ground alone'I regard the notes as valid, binding notes even in favor of the Company, although the fact be taken to be as the Referee has found, that the $300,000 subscription was not made up. If it were material, the correctness of that finding upon the evidence might be questioned. But still more clearly is the defendant bound in this case, for after his subscription he took out policies of insurance, the premiums upon which (exclusive of unearned premiums on his open policy) was nearly equal to the amount of his two notes. As that open policy was taken in pursuance of his subscription and in performance of his agreement, I apprehend the Company were entitled absolutely to require that the whole amount of the premium be paid. It was not the ordinary case of an open policy, on which premiums can only be collected to the amount of the risks indorsed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">After not only giving his notes but actually receiving policies for the amounts, and more than the amounts of his notes, it is too late for him to say, in the absence of any fraud, that the $300,-000 subscription was not made up. <em>(Holbrook </em>v. Wilson, November Term, 1858;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Holbrook </em>v. Basset, July, 1859.<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The defendant had agreed to gives notes in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The note in question was therefore not only a note given for value in due course of business, but it was also a subscription note given in advance for premiums under the 12th section of the charter of the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">By the terms of that section, the Company were authorized to negotiate such note for the purpose of paying claims or otherwise in the course of its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">It has often been held that such notes are valid binding notes, founded on sufficient consideration, and subject to transfer as business notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">By the tenth of the by-laws of the Company the President or Vice-President, with the advice and consent of the Finance Committee or a majority of them, has authority to transfer bills receivable to secure the payment of losses or other purposes that shall have the sanction of the Finance Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>On the 30th of November, 1855, the Board of Directors, after reciting the subscription which the defendant and others had made in advance of premiums, resolved \u201c that the officers commence at once to collect the notes * * * and proceed in liquidating the liabilities of the Company therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Company was at that time indebted to the plaintiffs in a large amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On the 10th of December, two notes of the Company, amounting to $5.574.56, were past due.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The statute authorized the Company to transfer the note in question for any lawful purpose in due course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Board of Directors, by a specific resolution, authorized the officers of the Company to proceed at once in liquidating the indebtedness of the Company with this and other notes mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Here was authority enough, in my opinion, for the action of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Thereupon, a settlement was made with the plaintiffs in which they accepted $2,000 in money; consented to apply $2,000 of the money due to them on a subscription also in advance of premiums, thus accepting as cash a subscription for which, they were entitled to give notes on time; and agreed to give time for the payment of the residue of the sum then due to them for four months; in consideration of which the officers transferred to them the note in question as security for the payment of such residue at the end of such four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">I think this was a valid transfer, authorized and upon sufficient consideration and in no wise inhibited nor invalidated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">If this be so the decision of the Referee was erroneous. At the time of the transfer to the plaintiffs, there was nothing due to the defendant, and therefore there was no right of set-off which can defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">If there be no existing debt due to the defendant, at the. time of the transfer of his note, he cannot set off a debt subsequently becoming due as against the assignee, although the assignment be made to secure an antecedent debt. In other words, an assignee, although he takes a note to secure a precedent debt, if there be no fraud, can collect such note notwithstanding his assignor may, by debts becoming due after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>assignment, owe the maker of the note the same or a greater amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Besides, in this case, the plaintiffs received the note, as already stated, for a sufficient consideration in the consent to allow as cash a subscription for which they had a right to give notes on time, and in the forbearance of the residue of the debt due them.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">It is claimed, that inasmuch as the receipt given by the plaintiffs for the note in question, as collateral security to the note of the Company, contained a reservation of authority to sell the notes, if the note of the Company was not paid, that therefore a sale was the plaintiffs\u2019 only remedy. That they are mere trustees to sell for account of the Company, and cannot sue on the notes. This claim is groundless. They received the notes as security, and have the legal title. They can, therefore, sue and collect the note. They have also the equitable title, holding the note as security they have a right to retain the money collected, and the circumstance that when collected it will go so far towards discharging the debt of the Company is only what is always true when the holder of such securities collects them. In that sense only the collection is for account of the principal debtor. <em>(Nelson </em>v. Wellington, July Term, Superior Court, 1859.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">I concur, therefore, in the result to which Justice Moncrief has arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered.
