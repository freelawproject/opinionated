The suit is brought on a note alleged to be parcel of the assets of said bank, of which note the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">\u201c $400.

Island City Bank discounted for this defendant his certain promissory note for the sum of four hundred dollars, payable at a time subsequent thereto, and as security for the payment of said sum of four hundred dollars this defendant assigned to the President of said Island City Bank, (for the benefit of said Bank,) said twenty shares of said capital stock, with a power to sell the same in case of non-payment of said sum of four hundred dollars, according to the terms of said note; that said stock so assigned was entered and transferred on the books of said bank on the twenty-seventh day of December, 1854, and was never after-wards reassigned to this defendant. That said note was not paid at maturity, but was renewed from time to time, until the said note mentioned in said complaint was given, (which was a renewal of \u00e1 note given in said succession of renewals for said original amount of four hundred dollars,) and that when said note became due this defendant abandoned said stock to the said Island City Bank in satisfaction of said amount payable by said last mentioned note; and said Island City Bank possessed itself of said stock and converted the same to its use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">\u201c Wherefore this defendant prays that said complaint may be dismissed, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">A reply was interposed, denying all the material allegations contained in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">At the trial, the note was produced and read in evidence. The due appointment of the plaintiff as Receiver was admitted, and the plaintiff then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">The defendant then produced a paper writing, dated May 8, 1854, signed by himself, by the terms of which he assigned twenty shares of the stock of the Island City Bank, standing in his name on the books of said Bank, to \u201c James O\u2019Brien, President,\u201d and by the terms of which he appointed \u201c William Stebbins \u201d his attorney to sell and transfer the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>He also proved that a transfer was made on the stock transfer book of the Island City Bank, on the 27th of December, 1854, of the said twenty shares of stock, to \u201c James O\u2019Brien, President,\u201d by \u201c John Kennedy, per William Stebbins, attorney,\u201d by virtue of said power of attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">It was admitted that the said twenty shares are the same shares mentioned in the note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">The defendant, as a witness in his own behalf, then testified, that on the 3d of October, 1853, he subscribed for twenty shares of the stock of this Bank, at $25 per share, and paid $500 therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">That on the 8th of May, 1854, his note of that date for $400 was discounted by that Bank, on his pledging (by the assignment and power of attorney of that date above mentioned) the twenty shares of stock as security for its payment, with power to sell it if the note was not paid at maturity. The note was not paid, but was renewed from time to time, and the note in suit is the last of the renewals. That he never received but one dividend on the stock, and never got the stock back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-8\">As evidence of the value of the stock, he proved that in 1855 and 1857, and as late as February, 1857, stock of the Island City Bank was sold at $75 and $80 on the $100, and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-9\">James O\u2019Brien, for the plaintiff, testified that he was President of the Bank from the time it was organized until after the note was given; that the stock was transferred on the books of the Bank, to be held as security only; that it had never been sold or disposed of by the Bank, but was still held as security; and that if the defendant had paid his note, the stock would have been reissued to him at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-10\">It was admitted that the shares so transferred on the books of the Bank to the name of the President, had never been reissued to the defendant or sold by the Bank, but stood in the name of the President as security for the Bank until its failure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-11\">The parties having rested the case upon this evidence, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on grounds substantially covered by the points made by him on the present appeal. The Judge directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, for $457.47, to which direction the defendant excepted. From the judgment entered on the verdict, the defendant appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Francis Byrne, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-4\">I. The Bank had power to receive shares of its stock in payment or satisfaction of any debt due to it. (1 R. S., p. 590, old paging, \u00a7 1, subd. 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">And the shares having been transferred on the books of the Bank, the stock as stock became extinguished,. and the money paid by the defendant therefor should, from the date of transfer, be considered as having been separated from the capital paid in, and as actually held by the Bank. <em>(Dykers </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>7 Hill, 497; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Little, 2 </em>Comst., 443.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">II. The debt so secured not having been paid when due, and for sixty days thereafter, and the Bank having converted the stock, the debt, (because of such conversion, and of the debt being less than the amount paid on such stock,) became extinguished, and the note not available to the Bank or the plaintiff. (1 R. S., 591, \u00a7 6; Peake\u2019s N. P., 30.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-7\">The duty imposed by the statute to sell, and the omission so to do, and conversion of the stock by the Bank to its use, and the defendant\u2019s adoption of (by not dissenting from) their acts, sufficiently make an agreement to accept the stock in satisfaction. The stock represented $500 in the possession of the Bank. The transfer of the stock amounted to an appropriation of the money to its own use. The conversion of the stock was equivalent to a conversion of the money. <em>(Zachrisson </em>v. <em>Ahman, 2 </em>Sandf. S. C. R., 68.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">III.
