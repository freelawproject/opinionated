Hall, Defendant and Respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">1. An Insurance Company, incorporated by the laws of New York, cannot make a valid transfer of its notes, amounting to over \u00a71,000 in the aggregate, unless it is authorized by a previous resolution of the Board of Directors, if such transfer be made merely as security for a precedent debt, and to a person knowing that there is no such resolution authorizing the transfer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">2. When the transfer is made to a firm, one of whose members is a Trustee of the Company, the firm has constructive notice of the non-existence of such a resolution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-8\">3. Where the complaint alleges an indorsement of the note by such Company to the plaintiff, and the answer denies the fact of such indorsement, and avers that the transfer was made by some officer or officers of the Company, when it was insolvent, to secure a precedent debt, proof is admissible that there was no resolution authorizing the transfer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-9\">4. Where a promissory note, payable to the order of The Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, was transferred and delivered to the plaintiffs as security for a debt due to them by the Company, and the indorsement was in form: \u201c Pay........for account of The Atlas Mutual Insurance Company,\u201d G-. H. T., Secretary, the restrictive form of the indorsement forms no obstacle to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on the note against the maker. The collection of the note, and the application of it to the payment of the debt of the Company, would be according to the right of the plaintiffs, and it would be a.paj'ment for account of the Company.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-12\">(Before Boswortu, Ch. J., and Woodruff and Moncrief, J.

The action was tried before Mr. Justice Slosson, without a jury, in March, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-15\">The complaint states that the. defendant made his note, dated the 10th of December, 1855, whereby he promised to pay, six months after its date, to the order of The Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, at the Atlantic Bank, $150; that said Company \u201cindorsed the same to said plaintiffs\u201d before its maturity; that it is past due and wholly unpaid; and that the plaintiffs are the lawful owners and holders of it, and defendant justly owes them thereupon $150, and interest from June 13th, 1856, and prays judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The answer avers that the note is wholly without consideration and void; denies that said Insurance Company indorsed it to the plaintiffs, or that they are the lawful owners and holders of it; and alleges that it was transferred to the plaintiffs by some officer or officers of said Company, when the Company was insolvent, to the knowledge of the plaintiffs, for a prior indebtedness of the Company, with intent to give a preference to the plaintiffs over other creditors of the Company, contrary to the statute, and that the plaintiff, Boynton, was at the time a Trustee of the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">It alleges that the Company owes the defendant $300, \u201c for moneys due on losses and reinsurance on policies of insurance heretofore issued by said Company to said defendant,\u201d which sum the defendant claims to set off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">It was proved on the trial that the note in suit, and another note of the same amount maturing June 8, 1856, were given by the defendant to this Insurance Compan}', upon an open policy, for premiums in advance. The defendant subsequently took risks, the premiums on which amounted to $236.72. It did not appear whether the other note had or had not been paid. The note in suit, with other notes belonging to the Company, amounting in all to $1,153.33, were delivered to the plaintiffs on the 15th of January, 1856, and the plaintiffs gave a receipt therefor, which described the notes and stated that they were \u201cguaranteed by the Company.\u201d They were transferred to the plaintiffs as security for the payment of money which they had loaned to the Company previously thereto, (loans having been made from time to time from May, 1855, until shortly prior to the transfer of the note in question.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">It did not appear whether the balance due to the plaintiffs was more dr less than the amount of the notes so transferred, or was just that amount, unless it appears from the testimony, uncontradicted, \u201c that this note was indorsed to the plaintiffs for their own exclusive use, and in no part for the use of the Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">George II. Tracy, the Secretary of the Company, indorsed and delivered the notes so transferred. The Secretary, to the knowledge of the Trustees, had been in the habit of indorsing the notes of the Company. .This note, and those transferred with it, were indorsed and delivered to the plaintiffs with the knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and approbation at the time of the President and Assistant President.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The form of the indorsement was: \u201c Pay........for account of The Atlas Mutual Insurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">\u201c Geo.

This and the notes transferred with it, as testified, were \u201c indorsed to the plaintiffs for their own exclusive use, and in no part for the use of the Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-10\">\u2022 It did not appear that there was any resolution of. the Board of Trustees authorizing the transfer of the 15th of January, 1856, and there was some evidence that no such resolution had been passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\">The plaintiff, Boynton, was a Trustee of the Company .and had been from the time of its organization. The Company stopped payment on the 5th of March, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-12\">The Court found as facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-13\">\u201c 1.

The said note was not taken by the plaintiffs in- payment of the. indebtedness of The Atlas Insurance Company to said plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">The Court held as conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">\u201c1.

(8 Barn. &amp; Cress., 622; 5 Mass., 543.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">This corporation is subject to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, to prevent the insolvency of moneyed corporations. (See its charter, \u00a7 22, and 5 Seld., 589.) The transfer in .question is directly prohibited by 1 Revised Statutes, 591, \u00a7 8. (3 Kern., 116.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">The plaintiffs took with notice, and are not holders for value; and the transfer being prohibited by law, they cannot recover. (3 Kent\u2019s Com., 80; 16 N. Y. R., 129; 7 Barn. &amp; Cress., 278; 6 Mann. &amp; Grang., 766; 16 N. Y.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az4\">The note in question is proved to have been made upon consideration. Even if the. note of \u00a7150, maturing June 8, 1856, has been paid, there are \u00a786.72 due on this note. No set-off has been proved, or attempted to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">The Company actually owed the plaintiffs the amount of the notes transferred on the 15th of January, 1856, for money loaned to it. There is not a particle of evidence that the note, was transferred when the Company was insolvent, or contemplated insolvency, unless the mere fact that it stopped. payment on the 5th of March, 1856, furnishes some evidence to; that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The terms of the indorsement do not alone present- any obstacle to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.. <em>A </em>collection of the note, or payment of it to the plaintiffs,, to reimburse them the moneys they have loaned to the Company,, would be a collection or payment for the purposes designed . y the indorsement and transfer of it to the plaintiffs. <em>(Lloyd </em>v. <em>Sigourney. </em>3 Youngs &amp; Jervis, 220; <em>Nelson et al. </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>July, 1859, Superior Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u2022 The Secretary is the officer of the Company who, frequently, if not usually, indorsed its notes on a negotiation of them by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The only important question is, whether the fact that there was no resolution authorizing the transfer can be set up as a defense to this \u2019action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">It is objected, <em>first; </em>that such a defense is not admissible under 'the pleadings. The answer not only denies that the Atlas Insurance Company indorsed the note to the plaintiffs, but avers that it was transferred to them by some officer or officers of the Company when it was insolvent, with intent to give to the plaintiffs a preference over other creditors of the Company contrary to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">These allegations are to the effect, in substance, that the transfer was an unauthorized act of some officer or officers of the Company, and sufficiently import that it was not authorized in any ihanner by the Board of Trustees, and consequently not by any resolution passed by it. The allegation in the complaint, that\" the Company indorsed the note to the plaintiffs, being denied by the answer, it is essential to prove, in order to establish this allegation, that the making of the indorsement was authorized by law and the charter and by-laws of the Company. The word indorsed, as here used, imports a delivery of the note, as well as an authorized writing of the payee\u2019s name on the back of it. <em>(Griswold </em>v. <em>Laverty, </em>3 Duer, 690.) It follows that if 1 Revised Statutes, 591, \u00a7 8, applies to such a transaction, then it is essential to the plaintiffs\u2019 title that it should appear, either directly or presumptively, that the transfer was authorized by a previous fesolution. We think that there is no obstacle presented by the pleadings to the interposition of this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Is the absence of a previous resolution of the Board of Trustees authorizing the transfer, a bar to this action?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u25a0 <em>Howland </em>v. Meyer, (3 Comst., 290-293,) presented the case of a note within the 12th section of the act of incorporation, and the President of the Company was authorized 'by its by-laws \u201cto \"transact all its ordinary business, and to perform whatever belongs to the executive department.\"\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The note in suit is not one within the provisions of the 12th .\u25a0section, and the Secretary who .transferred it is not shown to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>been authorized by the by-laws of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company to transact its ordinary business. . i</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">There was not, therefore, in the present case, even such a previous resolution of the Board authorizing the transfer as would be implied by a preexisting by-law authorizing the Secretary of the Company to transact its ordinary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The article of the Revised Statutes to prevent the insolvency of moneyed corporations, (1 R. S., 589,) is, by the statute itself, made applicable to corporations \u201c authorized by law to make insurances.\u201d (Id., 598, \u00a754,) [sec. 51.] Even conceding that, where any charter granted subsequent to the passage of these statutes contains a section or sections in conflict with these provisions of the statutes, the general statute must yield to such sections in a subsequent act; yet, as the note in question is not one provided for by the 12th section of the Company\u2019s charter, that section does not exempt this transfer from the operation of section 8 of 1 Revised Statutes, 591. (Laws of 1843, 67-69, \u00a7 8, and Laws of 1842, 261, 263, \u00a7 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Notwithstanding the opinion of G-ardiiter, J., in <em>Howland </em>v. Meyer, that notes given under the 12th section might be transferred by the Company to a creditor as security for his claim, he giving time until such notes matured, and notwithstanding he reaffirmed that proposition in his dissenting opinion in <em>Brouwer </em>v. <em>Harbeck, </em>(5 Seld., 596,) yet it is evident that the former case presented no such question; and the latter case holds, in effect, that the article of the Revised Statutes, before cited, applies to the assets of such an Insurance Company as the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, excepting notes made under the 12th section of their charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The present plaintiffs are not purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice. The transfer was made to secure a precedent debt, and Mr. Boynton, one of the plaintiffs, was a Trustee of the Company when the transfer was made, and had been from the organization of the Company. He signed the receipt given on the transfer of the notes to the plaintiffs. They are not protected by the exception made by the last clause of section 8, 1 Revised Statutes, 591. <em>(Gillet, </em>Receiver, v. <em>Phillips, </em>3 Kern., 114-117.) They knew the transfer was not authorized by a previous resolution, and that the note was not given under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the 12th section, and they took it as security for a precedent debt. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We think the transfer was prohibited by law and was illegal, and that the plaintiffs acquired no title to .the note, and that payment of it to them, with knowledge of all the facts, would not protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the receiver brought to recover the amount of the note. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u25a0 Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> Ante, page 178.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
