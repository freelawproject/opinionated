The irregularity and omissions of the judgment debtor, with the fraudulent intent alleged in the affidavit of the plaintiff, vitiate the discharge in bankruptcy and render it invalid as to the judgments recovered by the plaintiff <em>(See Hillard on Bankruptcy, secs. </em>23, 24, 25, 38: <em>Small </em>agt. <em>Graves, 7 Barb., </em>576; <em>Ayres </em>agt. <em>Scribner, </em>17 <em>Wend., </em>407).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The motions to cancel the judgments are denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
