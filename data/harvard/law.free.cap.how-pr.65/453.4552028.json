The affiant fails to give the name of the informant with his means of knowledge, so that the court may determine whether the information is entitled to credit as proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">2. The character of the property is not described. This is an important omission, because the examination of a debtor before the return of an execution can only be had where the property which he refuses to apply is concealed or is not subject to levy (10 <em>How. Pr., </em>560).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">3. It is defective because the affidavit does not allege a demand (13 <em>Hun, </em>232).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In short the affidavit should show facts and cirenmstances, in order that the judge may decide whether there has been an unjust refusal (13 <em>Hun, supra). </em>The plaintiffs have not made out a case entitling them to the order (17 <em>How. Pr., </em>512), which will be vacated, wi'th ten dollars costs to be credited on the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
