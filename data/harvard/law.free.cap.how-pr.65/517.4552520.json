It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s motion papers, that although she had demanded alimony in her complaint, yet no provision was made therefor in the judgment, because defendant requested such omission, promising, if she would waive such a provision, he would faithfully pay her moneys from time to time in a fair and reasonable amount, also that he would pay her one-half of his wages every month as long as she needed it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>that plaintiff, relying upon such promise, consented to the entry of the judgment without any provision for alimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">The promise is denied by defendant.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b538-6\">J.

The plaintiff refrained from taking a decree providing for her support, on the promise of the defendant to pay her money from time to time. If she \"were content to take such a promise instead of a decree of the court, she must be content now. Ho charge of fraud can be based on a mere promise, and the judgment cannot be disturbed on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\"With the entry of judgment in an action of divorce dissolving the marriage contract the jurisdiction of the court over the parties is terminated, except to enforce the judgment or correct mistakes <em>(Kamp </em>agt. <em>Kamp, </em>59 <em>N.
