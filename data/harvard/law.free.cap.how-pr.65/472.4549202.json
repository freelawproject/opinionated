By the charter of the city of New York. Second. By any by-law or ordinance of the common council of that city; or, third. By a statute of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">It will be seen that a distinction is made between a penalty created by a statute and a penalty created by a by-law or an ordinance. If a penalty created by an ordinance, passed in pursuance of an authority conferred by statute, were, as the corporation counsel contends, a penalty given by statute, the legislature would not have drawn that distinction, and all that the section would have contained would have been a grant of jurisdiction in an action to recover a penalty given by a statute. The charter of the city of New York gave no penalty for a neglect to remove merchandise from a wharf or pier, it merely authorized the dock department to fix penalties for disobedience of its orders, rules and regulations. In pursuance of this authority the dock department made a regulation that required the removal of merchandise from a wharf, pier or bulkhead within twenty-four hours after the corporation wharfinger orders such removal, and prescribed a penalty for a neglect or refusal to comply with the wharfinger\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">It is obvious that this penalty was not given by a statute, by the charter of the city, or by any ordinance of the common council. A district court had not, therefore, jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We decline to enlarge the jurisdiction of the district courts by construction, as the corporation counsel urges us to do, though we see no reason why an application should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>be made to the legislature for an amendment to the Code that will give to the district courts jurisdiction of this class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
