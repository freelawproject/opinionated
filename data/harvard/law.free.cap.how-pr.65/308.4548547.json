(J. Woodruff, Esq., as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>attorney, and served an answer herein upon deponent on the 29th day of September, 1882; that on the 14th day of October, 1882, deponent procured the affidavits of Jane M. Downs and Melissa Finch, copies of which are hereto annexed, who reside at Florence aforesaid, on behalf of the said Luella Chase, to move for alimony and counsel fees herein <em>pendente lite \u2022 </em>that thereafter and on the 15th day of October, 1882, the said plaintiff returned to the bed and board of the defendant and abandoned her said action against him for a separation, and has since then lived and cohabited with the defendant as his wife. Deponent thereafter, and at a special term of this court, moved on behalf of the plaintiff, upon notice to the defendant, for an allowance for his services in behalf _of the plaintiff out of the husband\u2019s estate. At a special term of this court held at Utica, Dew York, on the 24th day of October, 1882, at which Hon,,lEvnsrs Gr. Yanit presided, an order was made by said justice at said term allowing the plaintiff\u2019s attorney twenty-five dollars for such services as he had rendered in the action to the said plaintiff prior to that time, and ten dollars costs of motion. Which order provided that the same should be paid by the husband ; that an appeal was \u25a0 taken from said order to the general term of the fourth department, where it was reversed by said general term upon the ground, among others, that said motion should not have been made in the name and in behalf of the wife; that deponent procured Olncy &amp; Powers to act as his counsel herein, and make printed points and argue said appeal at the general term; that the services deponent had rendered to the plaintiff in the action prior to the time said appeal was taken were worth the sum of.thirty dollars; that the services of deponent and his counsel in arguing the appeal from said order were worth the sum of thirty dollars ; that the disbursements incurred by deponent in this action amount in all to the sum of six dollars and sixty cents, and no part of same has ever been paid; that deponent has acted in entire good faith as the attorney for the plaintiff; that the plaintiff has no separate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>property, nor any means whatever, of paying deponent for the services he performed, and procured to he performed, for her in the premises; that as deponent is informed and believes the defendant is worth the sum of $1,000, and has a trade out of which he realizes $400 per year; that since said 15th day of October, 1882, the plaintiff and defendant have cohabited together as husband and wife, but that up to the 15th day of October, 1882, deponent verily believes that the plaintiff acted in good faith and with honest intentions in bringing and prosecuting this action. Deponent further says that the defendant, as appears by an affidavit made by him before E. C. Woodruff, a notary public, October 23, 1882, well knew at the time his wife returned to his bed and board as aforesaid that this deponent had not been paid for the services he had rendered to the plaintiff herein; that no discontinuance of the action has been signed by .the parties or their attorneys, and that the same is now - pending and undetermined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">MICHAEL H.

E. </em>Powers, for motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL7\">The general term having decided nothing except that the plaintiff made the original motion after her return to her husband, the question is now before the court for the first time upon its merits, and the only vital question which in our judgment this motion involves is, whether the abandonment of the action by the wife, her attempted discontinuance of the same, has ousted the court of its jurisdiction of the cause. The complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>served and issue had been joined by the service of the defendant\u2019s answer before the reconciliation of the parties took place, and before the wife had attempted to stipulate a discontinuance, and as yet there is no final decree dismissing the complaint or in any way making a final disposition of the cause. Upon this condition of the cause we insist that the court has not lost its jurisdiction <em>(Green </em>agt. Green, 40 <em>How. </em>Pr., 465; <em>Bishop on Marriage and Divorce [vol. </em>2, <em>6th ed.], sec. </em>388; <em>Bass </em>agt. <em>Bass, New York Monthly Law Bulletin [vol. </em>5], <em>page </em>44; <em>Graves </em>agt. <em>Cole, </em>7 <em>Harris </em>[Penn.], 171; <em>Brinkley </em>agt. <em>Brinkley, </em>50 <em>N. Y., </em>200; <em>Griffin </em>agt. <em>Griffin, </em>47 <em>N. Y., </em>134). The <em>Green case </em>(40 <em>How., </em>465) was an action for a separation brought by the wife against the husband for a separation from her husband on the ground of cruel treatment, and like the present cause was never tried. It was settled during its pendency by the parties. The settlement was brought about by the overtures of the wife. After the settlement had been perfected the husband moved to dismiss the complaint. The court refused to do so and awarded the wife\u2019s attorney $750 for counsel fee, and held that it had jurisdiction of the cause until after the entry of final decree. This case, therefore, distinctly holds that the court has power to protect and enforce the attorney\u2019s rights in an action of this character until after the entry of final decree, notwithstanding a settlement by the parties. It is founded upon that familiar principle of equity which holds that where a court of equity acquires jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter of the action it will retain that jurisdiction until justice is done all the parties, and on those wholesome maxims which say that the law hateth a multiplicity of suits and favoreth the speeding of men\u2019s causes. To oust the court of its jurisdiction two things must concur: the parties must settle, and the settlement must be followed up by final decree dismissing the cause. It was proper for the attorney to notice the motion in his own name and serve the moving papers and notice upon both parties <em>(Murry </em>agt. <em>Gilson, </em>22 <em>Hun, </em>386; <em>Goddard </em>agt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Trenbath, </em>24 <em>Hun, </em>182; <em>Rooney </em>agt. <em>Second Avenue R.
