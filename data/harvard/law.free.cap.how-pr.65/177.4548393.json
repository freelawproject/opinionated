In order to attack an illegality not appearing upon the face of the indictment, a motion to quash or set aside the indictment would seem to be the proper practice (1 <em>Bish. Crim. Pro. [3d ed.], sec. </em>763; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Shattuck, </em>6 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>33; <em>N. S. </em>agt. <em>Coolidge, 2 Gall., </em>364; <em>Reg. </em>agt. <em>Hearn, </em>9 <em>Cox Cr. Cases, </em>433; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Hulbert, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>136). Chief justice Bronson said, in <em>People </em>agt. <em>Hulbert </em>(4 <em>Denio, </em>136), \u201c that the indictment when complete imparts absolute verity. It cannot be impeached except on motion for insufficient evidence, or any other fact or irregularity in the proceedings.\u201d In the same case <em>{p. </em>136) the court further observed: \u201cIn <em>Low\u2019s case </em>(4 <em>Greenl., </em>439) so long as the record remains no defect in the evidence upon which it was founded, nor any irregularity in the proceedings, however great, can furnish an answer to it. But when the ends of justice require it a record may be set aside on motion, and when set aside that is the end of it \u201d <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Restenblatt, </em>1 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>268; 3 <em>Am. Law Reg. [O. S.], </em>418; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Strong, </em>1 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>[N. S.], 247, 249).</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">III. The grand jury is a constituent part of the court of oyer and terminer, and all the proceedings controlled, regulated and governed by the court of oyer and terminer, and this may be done after the grand jury has adjourned. <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Naughton, 7 Abb. [N. </em>S.], 421, 422, 424; 30 <em>How. Pr., </em>430; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Cowan, </em>1 <em>Head. [Tenn.], </em>280; <em>Clem. </em>agt. <em>State, </em>33 <em>Ind., </em>418.) The evidence given before the grand jury constitutes a part of the record of the court <em>(State </em>agt. <em>Little, </em>42 Iowa, 51). A court always takes judicial notice of its own record in the case (1 <em>Wharton on Ev., sec. </em>325). And this is so, though not brought before it by affidavit <em>(Crann </em>agt. <em>Smith, L. R., </em>4 <em>Exch., </em>146).</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">IV. \u201c The oath of the grand juror does not prohibit his testifying to what was done before the grand jury when the evidence is required for the purposes of public justice or the establishment of private right \u201d <em>(Burnam </em>agt. <em>Hatfield, </em>5 <em>Blackford [Ind.], </em>21). The oath of the grand juror is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>legal or moral infringement to his solemn examination, under the direction of a court, as to evidence before him, whenever it becomes material to the administration of justice <em>(State </em>agt. <em>Broughton, 1 lred. </em>[N. C.], 96, 100). This is a direct motion before the court in which the record remains to set aside or quash it; for that it is void in law, in that it was improperly and unlawfully procured by introducing as a witness the wife of defendant before the grand jury without the consent and against the will of defendant, and in violation of the statute in such case made and provided <em>(See </em>6 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>34, 36). A witness may be indicted for perjury for false swearing before a grand jury, and grand jurors are competent witnesses to prove what he swore to before them (1 <em>Whar. Am. Crim. Law, sec. </em>508).</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\">V: Section 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reads as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The grand \u25a0 jury can receive none but legal evidence.\u201d Although the indictment in this case was found prior to the adoption of this Code, yet we perceive that this section\"(256) is but the reiteration of the common-law doctrine. JSTo evidence should be presented to a grand jury which would not be legal and competent at the trial 'before the traverse jury (2 <em>Hawk. Pl. Cr., </em>353 <em>[Curw. ed., book </em>2, <em>chap. </em>25, <em>secs. </em>138, 139]; 4 <em>Hawk. Pl. Cr. [Leach's ed.], </em>80, <em>81; Denby's case, </em>1 <em>Leach [4th ed.], </em>514). An indictment procured upon the knowledge of a grand juror, without his being sworn, is void, and upon amotion for that purpose should be quashed (4 <em>Hawk. Pl. Cr., </em>82 <em>[Leach's ed., book </em>2, <em>chap. </em>145, <em>note]; </em>2 <em>id. [Curw. ed.], </em>354, <em>note). </em>The rule is thus laid down. A grand jury ought not to find an indictment upon the evidence of incompetent witnesses, and where an indictment was found upon the testimony of witnesses who had been convicted of an infamous crime, the court 'told them they ought not to have done so, the witnesses competency having been destroyed <em>(MS.). </em>In one case the indictment was quashed because the witnesses before the grand jury were not properly sworn (6 <em>Car &amp; P., </em>90; 25 <em>Eng. C. L., </em>336). In the <em>U. S. </em>agt. <em>Cool</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>idge </em>(2 <em>Gallison, </em>364), the indictment was quashed by judge Story, for the reason that one of the witnesses before the grand jury was not sworn (see opinion of the court at p. 367). An indictment should be quashed when it appears by affidavit that it was found by the grand jury without adequate evidence to sustain it <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Restenblatt, </em>1 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>268; 3 <em>Am. L. Reg., </em>248, 249; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Hyler, </em>2 <em>Parker, </em>570). If any illegal evidence has been introduced before the grand jury which bears in the smallest degree upon the final result of their deliberations, it cannot properly be disregarded, and the indictment should be set aside (<em>Worrall </em>agt. <em>Parmlee, </em>1 <em>N. Y., </em>519; <em>Anderson </em>agt. <em>Rome, &amp;c., </em>54 <em>JP. Y., </em>334; <em>Baird </em>agt. <em>Gillett, </em>47 <em>N. Y., </em>186). Since the decision of the case of the <em>People </em>agt. <em>Briggs </em>(60 <em>How. Pr., </em>17), deciding the incompetency of the wife as a voluntary witness against the husband <em>(per judge </em>Osborn), the same question has been decided the same way in the case of <em>Byrd </em>agt. <em>The State </em>(57 <em>Miss., </em>243), reported since judge Osborn\u2019s decision. See, also, <em>People </em>agt. <em>Crandan </em>(17 <em>Hun, </em>490), which holds directly that the wife is not a competent witness in a criminal action against her husband. Any defect which, in any stage of a criminal proceeding will vitiate the indictment, may be taken advantage of by plea in abatement (2 <em>Hales' Plg. of the Cr., </em>236). Any defect or irregularity appearing upon the face of the indictment or upon some matter of fact extrinsic of the record, may be cured by plea in abatement to quash (1 <em>Bish. Cr. Pr., </em>416).</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">The testimony of defendant\u2019s wife before the grand jury was well calculated to prejudice that body against defendant, for she relates with somewhat of detail, the facts and circumstances under which her husband committed the worst of human crimes, wholly without motive. In the absence of her testimony it would seem unreasonable to suppose, and unfair to conclude, that the defendant would have been indicted for the crime of murder. The very presence of the wife before the jury asseverating to those facts, so incriminative in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>nature, and taking place in the privacy of her home, was well calculated to exercise a most potent and improper influence. It would seem to be a sort of trifling with or mockery of the precepts of the law, and the practice of the courts, to attempt to extenuate so grave an error. The wife being in no wise a competent witness, and her testimony before the grand inquest being so vitally material, and the indictment demand- \u2022 ing a punishment so dreadful, it would seem proper that it should be set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">At an adjourned term of the Niagara circuit court and court \u25a0 of oyer and terminer, held at the court-house at the city of Lockport, in and for the county of Niagara, on the 30th day of 'October, 1882.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">Present \u2014 Hon.
