Whether the agreement was a complete contract or not depends upon the clause above quoted. The special agreement never was signed. Was there a complete contract ? Here .is an agreement to make a contract of sale by which the '\u00a1lease was to be voided which was never executed. The \u00a1attempt is to dissever so much of exhibit B as relates exclusively to a lease for two years from that part- by which the \u00a1lease is to be determined and the rent extinguished. But the \u00a1terms of exhibit B preclude any such legal computation as \u25a0mortal to the whole, as it provided- that \u201ca sale of the prop-erty voids the lease.\u201d \u25a0 -A sale, how ? \u25a0 Why, according to the terms of the special agreement signed at the same time with \u00a1the lease. There is no absolute term of; leasing for two years, for on compliance with the-terms.of the -special agreement of .sale the lease is <em>ipso facto </em>terminated. These two clauses are inter-dependent, and neither can be eliminated and leave an entire contract, nor can the court make - an agreement of - sale or lease between the-parties. The most- that can be claimed is that it is an agreement, to make an agreement which has . been-uniformly, held to be- non-enforceable. The. test is, could either party have maintained an action for specific performance? Contract evidenced by two or more papers they must all be construed together <em>(Meyer </em>agt. <em>Hunke, </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>416; <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., </em>44 <em>N. Y., </em>80; <em>Foot </em>agt. <em>Webb, </em>59 <em>Barb., </em>52, 55; <em>Lindsay </em>agt; <em>Lynch, </em>2 <em>Schoales &amp; Lefroy; Potts </em>agt. <em>Whitehead, </em>5 <em>C. E Green, </em>60). The paper called a lease is insusceptible of specific performance <em>(Stanton </em>agt. <em>Miller, </em>58 <em>N. Y., </em>203; <em>Shakespeare </em>agt. <em>Markham, </em>72 <em>N. Y., </em>407);</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">II. Before breach- a contract under seal.cannot be modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>by parol <em>(Delaroix </em>agt. <em>Buckley, </em>13 <em>Wend., </em>71; <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Jaguish, </em>21 <em>Wend., </em>628; <em>Coe </em>agt. <em>Hobby, </em>72 <em>N. Y., </em>148).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">III. A deed referred to in another deed \u201c is as if incorporated in it \u201d <em>(Jackson </em>agt. <em>Parkhurst, </em>4 <em>Wend., </em>369; <em>French </em>agt. <em>Carhart, </em>1 <em>Comst., </em>96; <em>Hoppough </em>agt. <em>Strube, </em>60 <em>N. Y., </em>433; <em>Marsh </em>agt. <em>Dodge, </em>66 <em>N. Y., </em>533; <em>Whittelsey </em>agt. <em>Delaney, </em>73 <em>N. Y., </em>575).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">IV. The construction of a written instrument is a matter of law for the court. The plaintiff contends that the question as to whether or not the parties intended to execute another paper or not, or whether the paper, exhibit B, was a complete instrument, was tried as a question of fact and so submitted to the jury. If it had been so submitted it would have been clearly error. The court did not stultify itself. In his charge the learned judge said: <em>\u201c </em>It is needful for the defendant to establish this defense to your satisfaction, because the plaintiff produces a lease which is in form complete and signed by the parties.\u201d The learned judge not only ruled exhibit B in as a perfect instrument in itself, but he charged the jury that it was \"in form complete,\u201d and that it was for the defendant to show that it was not. If the charge had been directly the reverse of what it was there would have been ground for claiming that the jury had found as a fact that the instrument was complete, which question was not submitted to them as they were charged that it was complete as it stood. If tire learned judge had submitted the instrument to the jury as a question of fact it would have been error\" <em>(The Arctic Fire Ins. Co. </em>agt. <em>Austin, </em>69 <em>N. Y., </em>477).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">V. The burden of proof was on the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged title in himself; the defendant denied it. The burden of proving the fact waston plaintiff; the court charged the other way. In <em>Heineman </em>agt. <em>Hurd </em>(62 <em>N. Y., </em>455, 456) Church, C. J.: \u201c The burden of maintaining the affirmative of the issue involved in the action is upon the party alleging the fact which constitutes the issue, and the burden remains throughout the trial.\u201d <em>Lamb </em>agt. <em>Camden and Amboy Railroad </em>(46 <em>N. Y., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>271) Grover, J.: \u201c The question of which party has the affirmative of an issue is in many cases very material as the case might be one in which the jury might hesitate in finding that the plaintiff had established the charge; and yet when they could not find that it had been satisfactorily answered\u201d <em>(Banker </em>agt. Banker, 63 <em>N. Y., </em>409).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">VI. The respondent\u2019s contention that the jury have settled an issue of fact by their verdict against the defendant is of no force in view of the charge of the court that the burden of proof was upon the defendant to overturn the lease perfect in form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">VII. There was no basis for the extra allowance of seventy-five dollars <em>(Coates </em>agt. <em>Geddard, </em>2 <em>J. &amp; S. [Sup. </em>Ct.], 118; <em>Spofford </em>agt. <em>Texas Land Co., </em>9 <em>J. &amp; S. [Sup. </em>Ct.], 228; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Albany S. R. R., </em>5 <em>Lans., </em>25). This is estimating the value of a two years\u2019 lease, \u201cthe subject-matter involved\u201d <em>(See. </em>3253, <em>Code Civil Pro), </em>at $1,500 over and above the rental which, plaintiff had to pay, which was $1,700, together-$3,200-; that is, that the house worth $8,000 would rent for $1,600 a-year, or twenty per cent of its value; and the court will assume this without evidence. The complaint does not allege.the--lease to be of any value; and there is no. profit if it- had any value. The jury did not find that the possession of the- premises were of any value. As a matter of law the rent reserved is equivalent for the lease as agreed upon between the parties.. The - lessee must \u00abpay the rent to enjoy-the--lease-. T.he rental and the use of the premises are equal) and the lease had no value beyond the rent <em>(Kelley </em>agt, <em>Dutch Church of </em>\"Schenectady, 2 <em>Hill, </em>116; <em>Kinney </em>agt. <em>Watts, </em>4 <em>Wend., </em>41).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-7\"><em>George F. Langbein, </em>for- plaintiff), respondent, made and argued the following \"points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-8\">I. Exhibit B, the lease, is a complete perfect paper on its face. As a lease it is a full, perfect and complete contract. It simply contains a further'agreement, a special agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>for the sale and purchase of the house by the respondent from the appellant at the election' of the respondent. The lease was the usual printed blank form, containing blank spaces. The parties filled up one of these with writing in making their special agreement. The owner, Mr. Eamsperger, a German, to save a lawyer\u2019s charges acted as his own lawyer, drew the lease and filled up the blank space with the agreement for the purchase and sale of the house, and therein called it a special agreement. There was no sale, and could be none, until the plaintiff elected to buy as contained in that special agreement; and he'had such election at any time during two years upon giving two- months\u2019 previous notice. It was an executory agreement of sale, conditioned upon the election of respondent as provided in it, contained in the lease. This is what the German meant by writing \u201cas per special agreement, signed in the same time with this l\u00e9ase.\u201d The words are not, \u201cto be signed at the same time with this lease,\u201d as if another paper was to be signed when the lease was signed, but the words are of the present \u201c signed in \u201d the same with this lease, meaning the execution of both the lease and the special agreement at the same time in signing the one paper, the lease. It was signed at or in the same time with the lease as it was embodied in it. Both the lease and the special agreement were signed at the same time by signing the one paper. Appellant could not have meant by the words \u201cspecial agreement\u201d the contract of sale, else he would have so written; He meant the executory agreement for the sale if plaintiff should elect to buy during the term. He was writing the special agreement to be signed with the lease; \u201c signed in the same time with the lease;\u201d as it was contained in the lease when it was signed. If respondent gave the notice of his intention to effect a sale, in accordance with this special agreement, he was to pay $8,000 in cash, and the lease was Void by being merged in the sale. He could not therefore mean the \u201c contract of sale \u201d by the words \u201c special agreement,\u201d as respondent was not' to buy until he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>notice of his election to buy, and he had within two months of two years to do that. The lease was to be void when the sale of the property was effected. If the respondent was to have a lease, and in the same time must effect a sale in order to have the lease, and the latter was to avoid the former, what was the use of going through the work of creating a lease ? Such an understanding is inconsistent to what they signed under seal at the time. The intention .of the parties is to be kept in view <em>(The Orphan Society </em>agt. Waterbury, 8 <em>Daly's R., </em>35). Hone of the cases cited by appellant\u2019s counsel are relevant to the case at bar. The contract of lease was complete and entirely mutual. What was left to be determined, or done, to complete it ? Hothing. The executory or special agreement was also complete. The plaintiff was not bound to buy the house until he gave the notice of his election to do so, as stated. This was the mutual agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">II. Whether the lease was or was not the whole contract between the parties, or whether it was an incomplete, inchoate paper, or not, was raised as a question of fact by the appellant before the jury, and upon a conflict of evidence was decided by the jury against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">III. The question of law raised was tried and decided as a question of fact by the jury. The question tried by the jury was whether there was a valid contract of lease, but that question depended as to whether another paper was to be executed. Appellant contended two different papers to be signed, perfected and constituted the agreement. Respondent contended this was not true as matter of fact, and the jury decided for the respondent. So that it was decided that the lease and the special agreement in it was the whole agreement, and was not to be evidenced by any further paper. The law could not be against the actual fact. Until the election to buy, and until a sale of the property, the lease remained in existence and in full force and effect. In <em>Lazarus </em>agt. <em>Heilmann </em>(11 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>93; <em>also reported in </em>2 <em>N. Y. Civil Pro. R., </em>204) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>court of common pleas for the city and county of New York,' equity term, Van Hoesen, J., in an action for waste, held the special agreement in the lease a complete, perfect contract, and compelled specific performance of the same on a counterclaim for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">IV. The justice did not charge as excepted to, and the exception is therefore of no avail. \"What he did charge was in fact the truth. The lease is in form complete. It was not a question of law as to the interpretation of a contract, but whether the contract had been completed or not by the decision of a fact, about which the parties contended. Defendant had the affirmative of the issue of fact that he raised on the trial. He claimed the lease was inchoate and not complete, because the fact was, another paper was to be executed before this was so. The burden of proof was upon him to show it, and thus impeach the lease. Appellant took no exception to the submission to the jury of the question of fact whether another paper was to be executed or not. He himself submitted his side of this question to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">V. As to the allowance. The value of the subject-matter involved to the respondent, the lease, was $700 for the first year and $1,000 for the second year \u2014 $1,700. Respondent had to pay this sum; it was the sum agreed between the parties, and it must, therefore, be taken as the value involved. The case was difficult and extraordinary, in view of the defense sprung upon the trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-7\">Finch, <em>J. </em>\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">We do not discover in the lease under which plaintiff claims to obtain possession of the property in question the element of uncertainty upon which the defense is primarily founded. It purports to let the premises in dispute for the term of two years from the ensuing first day of Hay, at the yearly rent of $700 for the first year and $1,000 for the second, to be paid in equal monthly advance payments, and contains the ordinary and usual provisions for the protection of lessor and lessee. It has, however, a further provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>looking to the purchase of the property by the lessee, which is claimed to be imperfect and incomplete as an agreement of sale, and to infect with its own' uncertainty the entire contract. The stipulation thus criticised is in these words, viz.: \u201c The party of the first part agrees to sell to the party of the.second part, and the party of the second part agrees to buy from the party of the first part, the house and lot herein leased, for the sum of $8,000 lawful money of the United States- as per special agreement signed in the same time with this lease ; a sale of the property voids the lease, and can be effected any time during the term of the lease upon two months\u2019 previous notice given to the party of the first part by the party of the second part of his intention to effect the sale.\u201d The operation of this provision is claimed to be rendered doubtful and uncertain by its reference to a <em>\u201c </em>special agreement \u201d contemplated to be concurrently executed. The argument at our bar developed a question of construction. The respondent contended that the <em>\u201c </em>special agreement \u201d referred to was not a separate and distinct contract, but the agreement for purchase and sale contained in the lease, and put stress upon the words \u201c signed in \u201d as- well as the fact that the lease was drawn by the lessor himself, who was a German, somewhat awkward in the use of an unfamiliar language, and wholly inexperienced in the drawing of legal papers. The appellant, however, insists upon the more natural and obvious meaning, that the <em>\u201c </em>special agreement \u201d contemplated was one fixing the minor details of the contract of sale, and to be concurrently executed, so that the signing of the lease was merely provisional and conditional, and until the further instrument was executed no complete contract was made. But the lease as signed contained within itself, even as it respected the contract of sale, a complete and perfect agreement, if no reference had been made to a further settlement of details, or if such settlement and modification was waived. One agreed to buy and the other to sell. The price was fixed at $8,000. It was to be paid in lawful money bf the United States, and in legal effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>at the time of the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the deed, the time of conveyance and payment was fixed ; it was to be during the continuance of the lease and upon two months\u2019 previous notice, but within those restrictions was at the option of the lessee. When made it avoided the lease. The agreement, therefore, in and of itself, had every element necessary to its completeness, and if at the .time it was signed no further agreement was in any manner made or presented, claimed or insisted upon, the natural inference would be either that none was contemplated, because both parties understood the contract as respondent reads it, or that it was entirely waived, the parties resting upon the paper signed as a complete execution of their contract. Whether a contract was in fact executed, or only partially and incompletely executed, was therefore the question litigated, and to some extent was a question of fact. The paper actually signed was admissible, of course, for it tended to show the making of a complete and perfect contract, and was supplemented by the oath of the plaintiff that no other or' further paper was executed at the same time, and no other was presented or shown to him. In this respect he was corroborated by two other witnesses present at the execution \u00f3f the lease. At this point the defendant moved for a nonsuit, upon the ground that no completed contract had been executed and the plaintiff had not bound himself to buy. What we have said indicates that the motion was properly denied, for upon the facts it was competent for the jury to find that no further agreement was contemplated at the time of the execution of the lease. The defendant then gave rebutting evidence.' He called the owner and lessor, who testified that a further paper specifying details and conditions of the contract of purchase was prepared and presented at the time of the execution of the lease; that plaintiff declined to sign it until he consulted a lawyer, and later refused entirely. If this was true the minds of the parties never met, and no completed contract was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The evidence having closed, the court charged, as. matter of law, that the agreement signed was of a character sufficient, if perfected, to be valid and effectual; but whether or not a complete and perfected agreement was in truth made was a question of fact for-the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Apparently'the learned counsel for the defendant meant to except to the proposition of the law laid down by -the court. If he had done so, the exception would have been unavailing, for it is certainly true that the instrument on -its face contained every necessary element of a complete and perfect contract. But 'the exception was inaccurate. It was taken to so much of the charge \u201c as states that the lease produced by the plaintiff is a complete and executed instrument, as appears upon its face.\u201d The learned judge nowhere spoke of it as \u201c completed and executed.\u201d He described it as complete on its face and -V signed,\u201d but whether executed as a complete- and perfected contract was precisely the question submitted to the jury. In the progress of the charge the court stated to the jury the evidence given on the part of the defendant, tending to show that a separate and special agreement was prepared, presented for execution and refused, and said: \u201cTf but one of these papers was executed, and under this understanding as detailed by Mr. Eamsperger, the other, for any reason whatsoever, was left unexecuted, the -two papers together making the agreement, there would have been no complete agreement between the parties as to these premises.\u201d The learned judge, however, further said, adverting to defendant\u2019s version of the facts: \u201c It is needful for the defendant to establish this defense to your satisfaction, because the plaintiff produces a lease which is in form complete and signed by the parties.\u201d It is claimed that this proposition was erroneous and was reached by defendant\u2019s exception \u201c to that part of the chai\u2019ge which-says that the burden of proof is on the defendant to impeach the lease.\u201d Hotting is said in the charge as to the burden of proof or about impeaching the lease. The issue as to which the burden of proof was on the plaintiff was that of title, of right to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>possession of the land, and that the burden remained with him to the end. But the court was not speaking of that, nor of the burden of proof in connection with it. Attention was being directed to a conflict of evidence upon a question of fact arising under the main issue, and the language used can fairly be said to mean no more than that the plaintiff having made out a <em>prima facie </em>case the defendant must give some evidence to rebut it which the jury believe, or the <em>prima facie </em>case must prevail. In such cases it is sometimes, and perhaps inaccurately, said that the burden of proof is shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In <em>Heineman </em>agt. <em>Hurd </em>(62 <em>N. Y., </em>455) it was observed that by such expression is only meant \u201c that there is a necessity of evidence to answer the <em>prima fade </em>case or it will prevail.\u201d And the same thing was said in <em>Lamb </em>agt. <em>Chicago and Alton Railroad Company </em>(46 <em>N. Y., </em>279). Substantially that, and no more than that, was the evident meaning of the court in the present case, and we do not think it was intended or can be fairly construed to mean that the burden of the issue tendered by the complaint was upon the defendants. On the contrary, we think its fair construction is that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff; that he had borne it so far as to have made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, and that must prevail unless the defendant gave some evidence tending to rebut it which the jury could believe. The language of the charge might possibly bear a stronger construction; but even then it could not be justly said to have related to the burden of proof upon the issue of title. We do not think the jury were in any manner misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">But the defendant also appeals from the order which gave to the plaintiff an extra allowance of seventy-five dollars.
