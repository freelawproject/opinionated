The sheriff alleged that after making a levy the attorney of defendant, in order to protect the property from being disturbed in the stores, agreed to pay costs and expenses for preservation of said property, if it were allowed to remain intact. In pursuance of such agreement certain sums of money were paid to him from time to time, not as fees, but for the payment of keeper\u2019s fees and other expenses incidental to keeping the property of defendant in his or his agent\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-12\"><em>W.
