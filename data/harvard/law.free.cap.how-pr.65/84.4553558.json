Cocks, a judgment debtor of, in and to two certain leases, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">1. One made by Mary A. Kieff to the said Lydia 0. Cocks of the aforesaid premises, No. 129 Fifth avenue, and of the furniture therein, for the term of eight months, commencing September 1, 1882, and terminating May 1, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">2. The other made by Mary A. Kieff to Anna Franger of part of said premises, for a term commencing November 8, 1881, and terminating May 1, 1883, which lease was assigned to said Lydia 0. Cocks, and was owned by her at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, which took place February 16, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">It will be observed, therefore, that these leases had but two and a-half months to run at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-10\">The question presented is whether, under such circumstances, the petitioner has acquired such a title to said lease as authorizes him to. invoke and maintain summary proceedings under the statute to recover possession of the premises claimed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-11\"><em>C. </em>Fine, for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-12\"><em>I.

This was probably legal <em>(Allen on </em>Sheriff's, 159). Having been advertised and sold as \u201c chattel \u201d interests they must be so regarded for all purposes in subsequent proceedings founded upon the sale. The statute invoked by the petitioner is entitled \u201c Summary proceedings to recover the possession of real property,\u201d and section 2232 of the Code, under which the present proceeding was instituted provides * * * \u201cthat a person who holds over and continues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>possession of real property \u2022 * * * may be removed therefrom * * * where the property has been sold by virtue of an execution against him * * * and a title under the sale lias been perfected.\u201d These \u00a1provisions clearly indicate the legislative intent that in order to invoke the aid of summary proceedings there must be a sale of the leasehold interest, advertised and conducted in all respects like a sale of real property (3 <em>R. S. [6th ed.], </em>638; <em>Bigelow </em>agt. <em>Finch, </em>17 <em>Barb., </em>394). These proceedings are in derogation of the common law, and magistrates clothed with the power of entertaining them must find their authority in the statute or they are without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The leasehold interest having been advertised and sold as personal property, the petitioner who purchased at the sale cannot invoke the aid of the statute, which in express terms limits its operation to real property. It follows that the proceeding must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
