That section does not, in my opinion, fix the costs upon an <em>appeal. </em>It only provides for an allowance of fifty dollars as costs upon the <em>original </em>ajaplication. Neither does any other section, to which my attention has been called, provide specially for costs in a case of this character on appeal. The result is that section 3240, <em>as it now reads (See Throop\u2019s edition of </em>1882) applies, for it gives, \u201c upon an appeal in a special proceeding,\u201d the same costs which are given on \u201c an appeal from a judgment.\u201d It is true that such costs are \u201cin the discretion of the court,\u201d but when the court has allowed costs, it is to be assumed that they allowed such as they had power to award, and that, therefore, in this case, costs as pirovided for in section 3240 are given.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The motion to correct the taxation by the clerk, who has allowed costs as upon an appeal from an order made upon a simple motion, is granted, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
