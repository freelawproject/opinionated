After reviewing the briefs, the decision below, and the record, we find that Hinojosa is not entitled to a GOA as to any issue. As this is a death penalty case, it deserves the most exacting scrutiny from this court, which typically involves a written opinion. The district court in this case, however, wrote a thoroughly detailed and well-reasoned 88-page opinion and order denying Hinojosa\u2019s petition for habeas relief and a COA. Were we to write a lengthy opinion affirming that court, we would be exalting formalism and scrupulosity over substance and judicial economy, adding nothing but repetition and doing nothing more than filling innumerable pages with synonyms and paraphrases. In this exceptional case, therefore, we decline to do so and simply deny Hinojosa\u2019s COA for the reasons well and fully explicated in the district court\u2019s writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-30\"> Under 5th Cir.
