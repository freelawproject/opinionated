R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b705-28\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-29\">1. The following orders are non-final and beyond our jurisdiction to review:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-30\">a. The May 15, 2003 order releasing the <em>lis pendens. See Special Inv., Inc. v. Aero Air, Inc., </em>360 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2004). The order is not appealable as an injunction. <em>See Shee Atika v. Sealaska Corp., </em>39 F.3d 247, 248 (9th Cir.1994) (describing jurisdiction over orders where the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) is satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-31\">b. The October 17, 2003 protective order. <em>See Admiral Ins. Co. v. United States Dist. Court, </em>881 F.2d 1486, 1490 (9th Cir.1989) (describing discovery orders as non-appealable). The order is not an injunction, because no state court proceedings are enjoined. <em>See Sperry Rand Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Rothlein, </em>288 F.2d 245, 248 (2d Cir.1961). Neither does this case meet the requirements for consideration of a writ of mandamus. <em>See Bauman v. United States Dist. Court, </em>557 F.2d 650, 654-55 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">c. The October 23 and October 27, 2003 partial summary judgment orders. <em>See American States Ins. Co. v. Dastar Corp., </em>318 F.3d 881 (9th Cir.2003). The case of <em>Batzel v. Smith, </em>333 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir.2003), is based on a unique California statute that does not apply in this Washington case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">d. The November 14, 2003 order denying Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See Credit Suisse v. United States Dist. Court, </em>130 F.3d 1342, 1345-46 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">e. The October 8, 2004 order imposing Rule 11 sanctions and staying the proceedings in a parallel federal action. <em>See Hill v. MacMillan/McGraw-Hill Sch. Co., </em>102 F.3d 422, 424 (9th Cir.1996) (recognizing that Rule 11 sanctions orders are not generally appealable); <em>see also Privitera v. Cal. Bd. of Med. Quality Assur., </em>926 F.2d 890, 892 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that a stay order may be appealable if ordered in connection with the denial of a preliminary injunction). This case does not meet the requirements for a writ of mandamus. <em>See Bauman, </em>557 F.2d at 654-55. Neither was the stay imposed in connection with a preliminary injunction, because no substantive relief was granted. <em>See Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 89-90, 101 S.Ct. 993, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">2. The court acted within its authority when it entered the contempt order. <em>See F.J. Hanshaw Enterprises, Inc. v. Emerald River Dev. Inc., </em>244 F.3d 1128, 1136\u201437 (9th Cir.2001). Appellants\u2019 challenge to the contempt order under the Anti-Injunction Act is precluded by the collateral bar rule. <em>See In re Establishment Inspection of Hern Iron Works, Inc., </em>881 F.2d 722, 725-26 (9th Cir.1989). Appellants had sufficient notice of the contemplated contempt finding. <em>See United States v. Rylander, </em>714 F.2d 996, 1004 (9th Cir.1983). The portion of the contempt order prohibiting the filing of any additional <em>lis pendens </em>is not appealable as a preliminary injunction, because it granted no indefinite or permanent substantive relief. <em>See Carson, </em>450 U.S. at 89-90, 101 S.Ct. 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">3. The district court properly applied the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to dismiss Appellants\u2019 challenge to the state court\u2019s disqualification of Frederic Sanai as counsel for Viveca Sanai.. <em>See Mothershed v. Justices of the Supreme Court, </em>410 F.3d 602, 606-07 (9th Cir.2005) (noting lack of jurisdiction over challenges to \u201cstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.\u201d) (citations omitted). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>applies to the interlocutory orders at issue in this case. <em>See id. </em>n. 3, <em>see also Doe and Assocs. Law Offices v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1030 (9th Cir.2001). The non-party doctrine articulated in <em>Johnson v. DeGrandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994), does not apply in this case where Frederic personally litigated the issue of his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">4. In view of the ongoing state proceedings, the district court properly abstained under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), from deciding Appellants\u2019 application for a TRO/motion for preliminary injunction. <em>See H.C. v. Koppel, </em>203 F.3d 610, 613 (9th Cir.2000). The fact that the outcome of the state proceedings is adverse does not mean that the opportunity to litigate is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>5. Reassignment to a different judge is not warranted. A judge\u2019s expression of impatience, annoyance or anger does not establish bias. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On remand, the district court is urged to carefully examine its subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We dismiss the appeal of the interlocutory orders entered in this case. In all other respects, we affirm the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">DISMISSED in part, AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
