We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual background of the case, we do not recite it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">The issue presented in this case is whether the district court incorrectly applied the Sentencing Guidelines in determining that an upward departure from the guideline sentencing range was appropriate, and if so, whether that incorrect application requires the sentence to be vacated. The Supreme Court has severed the provisions of the federal guideline statute that made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, effectively rendering the guidelines advisory. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, the Court made it clear that although review of a sentence will ultimately turn on its reasonableness, the district court <em>must </em>consider the Guidelines in making its sentencing determination. <em>Id. </em>at 767. Misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines can constitute re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>versible error requiring a sentence to be vacated. <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>No. 02-30326, 2005 WL 1291977, at *12 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We therefore find it appropriate to review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines before determining what kind of remand may be required. <em>See id. </em>at *11 (allowing for \u201climited\u201d remand in situations involving unpreserved <em>Booker </em>error).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In this case, we must determine whether the district court improperly applied a two-level upward departure to Benson\u2019s sentence. The district court was persuaded that upward departure was warranted because of the large number of victims, the sophistication of the enterprise, and the large potential for non-monetary loss suffered by individual victims. We cannot say that this constituted a misapplication of the Guidelines. For example, upward departure may be appropriate where \u201c[t]he offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 Application Note 15(A)(2). We therefore find that the district court did not err in applying the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Although we do not find a misapplication of the Guidelines, a limited remand may nonetheless be appropriate, as we cannot be sure from the record whether the district court would have imposed a different sentence. <em>See Ameline, </em>409 F.3d at 1085. In light of the appellant\u2019s expressed desire, in prior additional briefing, to have this case remanded for possible re-sentencing, we grant a limited remand for a determination of whether \u201cthe sentence imposed would have differed materially if the district court judge were applying the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory.\u201d <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">. If so, the district court must vacate the sentence and re-sentence with the defendant present. The defendant may \"opt out\u201d of re-sentencing by prompt notice to the district court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
