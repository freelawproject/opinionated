They challenge their convictions for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine based on sufficiency of the evidence and challenge their sentences, including challenges in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">The Defendants participated in crack cocaine trafficking in Front Royal, Virginia. Defendants Kelly Stanback and Arnold Jackson were cousins and supplied crack to local dealers. Defendants Calvin Buchanan and Howard Beard worked together and also supplied local dealers in Front Royal, some of whom also sold drugs for Stanback and Jackson. Defendant Jessie Newton sold for Stanback and Jackson and also had interaction with a dealer for Buchanan and Beard. The Defendants argue that, at best, the Government\u2019s evidence showed three separate conspiracies and not the single overall conspiracy charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">The Appellants argue that three separate conspiracies were proven and that the evidence of the separate conspiracies was represented to the jury as evidence of a single conspiracy. They argue that the Government\u2019s evidence does not demonstrate an overall agreement or joint business venture among the smaller conspiracies, interdependence, or overlap of key actors, methods, or goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">The Government bears the burden of proving the single conspiracy as charged in the indictment. <em>United States v. Hines, </em>717 F.2d 1481, 1489 (4th Cir.1983). The existence of a conspiracy, \u201cas well as an agreement to participate in the conspiracy, is a question of fact for the jury[,] and [this court] must affirm its finding ... \u2018unless the evidence, taken in the light most favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>able to the government, would not allow a reasonable jury so to find.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>39 F.3d 1262, 1267 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Urbanik, </em>801 F.2d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1986)); <em>see Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>United States v. Banks, </em>10 F.3d 1044 (4th Cir.1993), several appellants challenged their conspiracy convictions, alleging the evidence demonstrated only isolated transactions, not an overarching conspiracy. In concluding the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">[I]t is not necessary to proof of a conspiracy that it have a discrete, identifiable organizational structure; the requisite agreement to act in concert need not result in any such formal structure, indeed frequently, in contemporary drug conspiracies, [it] contemplates and results in only a loosely-knit association of members linked only by their mutual interest in sustaining the overall enterprise of catering to the ultimate demands of a particular drug consumption market.... Furthermore, the fact that parallel suppliers, or middlemen, or street dealers serving such a market may sometimes, or even always, compete for supplies or customers in serving that market does not on that account alone disprove either the existence of a single conspiracy to achieve the overall results of their several efforts, or the participation of particular ones of them in that conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1054; <em>see also United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 858 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Appellants argue that there is no evidence that Stanback and Jackson directly knew Beard and Buchanan. However, each co-conspirator need not know each other in order for all of them to be engaged in a single conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Crockett, </em>813 F.2d 1310, 1317 (4th Cir.1987); <em>see also United States v. Gray, </em>47 F.3d 1359, 1368 (4th Cir.1995). Rather, the touchstone analysis is whether there is an \u201coverlap of key actors, methods, and goals.\u201d <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 385 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Several co-conspirators tied the five men together in their venture to distribute narcotics. Tresvant, Fitzhugh, Lopez, Newton, and Thompson all bought their drugs from the Stanback/Jaekson team and the Beard/Buchanan team.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The Appellants also argue that the Government did not prove an overarching goal among the Appellants. However, \u201cmembers linked only by their mutual interest in sustaining the overall enterprise of catering to the ultimate demands of a particular drug consumption market\u201d is sufficient to show a common goal. <em>Banks, </em>10 F.3d at 1054. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, each Appellant acted as part of the same conspiracy with its goal being the distribution of narcotics to users in the Front Royal area. The four main suppliers were Stan-back, Jackson, Beard, and Buchanan. These four men shared dealers, including Newton, whom they sold to in order to serve the demand for drugs in Front Royal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">However, even assuming, without deciding, that there was a variance, the Appellants are not entitled to relief from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>convictions. Under <em>United States v. Howard, </em>115 F.3d 1151, 1157 (4th Cir.1997), a variance demonstrating multiple conspiracies does not constitute reversible error unless the defendant demonstrates that he has been prejudiced by the variance between the single conspiracy charged in the indictment and the multiple conspiracies proven at trial. <em>See also United States v. Miller, </em>471 U.S. 130, 136, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985); <em>United States v. Bollin, </em>264 F.3d 391, 406 (4th Cir.2001). When the indictment alleges a single drug conspiracy but the proof demonstrates multiple conspiracies, prejudice only occurs if: (1) the defendant is surprised by the evidence and was unable to present a defense or (2) the number of conspirators and conspiracies was so large that there was a substantial likelihood that the jury transferred proof against one conspirator and conspiracy to another charged conspirator in an unrelated conspiracy. <em>See Bollin, </em>264 F.3d at 406, <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 883 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The likelihood of spillover evidence is minimized when the evidence against each defendant is established by direct evidence, such as controlled buys from the defendant, <em>see United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1360 (4th Cir.1996); when the district court instructs the jury to consider each defendant\u2019s guilt independently or cautions against transferring evidence to other defendants, <em>see Bollin, </em>264 F.3d at 406; or when the number of defendants and conspiracies is relatively small. <em>See, e.g., Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 83, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935) (two conspiracies); <em>Bollin, </em>264 U.S. at 406, 44 S.Ct. 380 (four defendants and three conspiracies); <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405 (11th Cir.1998) (five defendants); <em>Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d at 883 (eight defendants and three conspiracies).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Here, there was direct testimony regarding the dealings of each Appellant. Further, Stanback, Buchanan, and Beard were taped during controlled buys. The Appellants were not surprised by the evidence and do not claim that they may face a second prosecution for the same offense. Finally, the district court clearly cautioned the jury against transferring evidence from one defendant or offense to another defendant or offense. We therefore conclude that there is no reversible infirmity in the convictions for the single conspiracy charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Newton and Jackson also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that each engaged in any conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>See United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficiency of evidence should be \u2018confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978)). In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court does not \u201cweigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). Where the evidence supports differing reasonable interpretations, the jury will decide which interpretation to believe. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In order to establish that a defendant participated in a drug conspiracy, the Government must prove: (1) an agreement with another person to violate the law; (2) knowledge of the essential objectives of the conspiracy; (3) knowing and voluntary involvement; and (4) interdependence among the alleged conspirators. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 250 (4th Cir.2001). Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Newton and Jackson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Appellants claim that the sentencing enhancements they received violated the decision announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Booker. </em>Because Newton, Beard, and Buchanan did not raise this issue at sentencing, their sentences are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Stanback and Jackson challenged their enhancements at their sentencing hearings, which were held prior to the decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and therefore their sentences are reviewed for harmless error. The harmless error standard permits an error at sentencing to be disregarded if the reviewing court is certain that any such error \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746, 750, that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000) (requiring courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Newton challenges the drug quantity and career offender status attributed to him on Sixth Amendment grounds and argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure for overstating the seriousness of his criminal history. The district court found that the career offender enhancement, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A) (2002), applied to Newton. The district court did not specifically rule on the objection as to drug quantity because the career offender status determined the applicable criminal history and offense level. In order for Newton to be designated a career offender, the Government had to establish (1) that Newton was at least 18 at the time of the instant offense, (2) that the instant offense is a felony that is either a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d and (3) that Newton had at least two prior felony convictions for either a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2002); United <em>States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 245 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Newton argues that the finding that he is a career offender constituted impermissible judicial fact-finding, but <em>Booker </em>specifically excepted prior convictions from its requirement that facts be admitted or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. New<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ton\u2019s prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence as a matter of law; no further judicial fact-finding was required to reach this conclusion. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>171 F.3d 188, 192 (4th Cir.1999) (court\u2019s inquiry into career offender status generally limited to \u201cthe fact of conviction and the statutory elements of the prior offense\u201d). Thus, the district court did not err in its ruling that Newton qualified for the career offender sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In <em>Harp, </em>this court, applying the plain error standard, found that even if the district court committed plain error when it determined that the defendant was a career offender without the elements of that designation having been charged in an indictment, this court would not exercise its discretion to correct that error. <em>Harp, </em>406 F.3d at 247. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d Although the opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>this court has subsequently clarified that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>See United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see generally Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (discussing documents that a sentencing court may consider in determining whether a prior conviction is considered a violent felony). We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in designating Newton as a career offender and Newton\u2019s sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Newton argued at sentencing and on appeal that the career offender status and his criminal history score overstated the seriousness of his criminal record and therefore warranted a downward departure. The Sentencing Guidelines Commission has acknowledged that there may be cases where \u201ca defendant\u2019s criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (2002). Although Newton\u2019s felony convictions were committed when he was sixteen and seventeen years of age, his criminal history demonstrates a continued pattern of illegal activity, with a conviction nearly every year from age sixteen to twenty-five, with the exception of the years that he was incarcerated. If a downward departure was given on this basis, it would effectively nullify the career offender enhancement by awarding a downward departure on the grounds that the seriousness of Newton\u2019s criminal history was overstated. In <em>United States v. Weddle, </em>30 F.3d 532, 536 (4th Cir.1994), the court disapproved of \u201cthe notion that criminal history points accrued under [Chapter Four of the Sentencing Guidelines] may be offset by way of a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.\u201d On the facts of Newton\u2019s case, we conclude that no departure was justified on the grounds that Newton\u2019s criminal history was overstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The remaining Appellants also contend that their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because they were sentenced on facts found by the court and not by the jury. The Government agrees that the cases should be remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>Because Stanback, Beard, Jackson, and Buchanan received higher sentences than would have been permissible based only on the jury\u2019s findings, we vacate and remand their sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>tences for resentencing under an advisory guidelines system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-49, 555-56 (finding that Hughes had satisfied all three prongs of the plain error test set forth in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), when he was sentenced to a sentence substantially longer than the sentence permitted based purely on the facts found by a jury, and that the court should exercise its discretion to recognize the error).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Although the guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. Sentencing courts should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider the Guideline range, along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guideline range, the court should explain its reasons for departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp. 2004). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We therefore affirm all the Appellants\u2019 convictions and affirm Newton\u2019s sentence and vacate Stanback, Beard, Jackson, and Buchanan\u2019s sentences and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>We grant Buchanan\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and Jackson\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief. We deny the Government\u2019s motion to place the cases in abeyance pending the Court\u2019s disposition of the petition for rehearing filed in <em>Hughes </em>as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. The Appellants\u2019 brief <em>makes many </em>references to the unreliability of the evidence because it was either not corroborated or testimony from a drug dealer or user. However, the uncorroborated testimony of one witness or an accomplice may be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \u2018\u2018[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\" of Appellants\u2019 sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v.
