We also ordered a limited remand of his sentence to allow the district court to determine whether it would have imposed the same sentence had it known that the sentencing guidelines were merely advisory. <em>See United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The district court replied to our inquiry by stating that even treating the guidelines as advisory, it would impose the same sentence. Neither party argues that the guideline range was computed incorrectly. Sanders\u2019s base offense level was 34 and two levels were added because he was an organizer or supervisor. With a criminal history category of TV, the guideline range was 262-327 months. The court sentenced Sanders to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">This court has found that \u201cany sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 607 (7th Cir.2005). \u201cThe defendant can rebut this presumption only by demonstrating that his or her sentence is unreasonable when measured against the factors set forth\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Sanders argues that his sentence cannot possibly be reasonable because he is only 20 years old. He also cites 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(B) and contends that his sentence is not fair and does not \u201cavoid[] unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduett.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Judge Crabb properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found: \u201cAlthough the sentence is a harsh one, I am not persuaded that any shorter one will accomplish the purposes of protecting the community and reflecting the seriousness of defendant\u2019s long term involvement in drug trafficking, the large quantities of pseudoephedrine and other precursor chemicals and equipment in his possession and his supervision of two other individuals.\u201d She further noted that Sanders has been \u201cundeterred by his previous run-ins with the criminal justice system[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cJudges need not rehearse on the record all of the considerations that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) lists; it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u201d <em>United States v. George, </em>403 F.3d 470, 472-73 (7th Cir.2005). Sanders has not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that his sentence, which was within the properly calculated guideline range, was reasonable when imposed. Therefore, Sanders \u201ccannot meet the third plain error element\u201d; namely, that the changes wrought by <em>Booker </em>\u201caffect[ed his] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">We Affirm Sanders\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
