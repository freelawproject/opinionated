To warrant such a remedy, a petitioner must show that he has (I) no other adequate means of obtaining the desired relief and (ii) a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>See Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 89 (3d Cir.1992) (citing <em>Kerr v. United States District Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">Hayden\u2019s motion was pending at the time he filed this mandamus petition. However, the District Court denied Hayden\u2019s motion by order entered August 3, 2005. Thus, the request for relief before us is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-13\">. In 1994, Hayden was convicted of using extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect an extension of credit; he was sentenced to 188 months of imprisonment. In July 2002, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which the District Court denied. We denied his request for a certificate of appealability in May 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
