(\u201cGlass\u201d), and its employee Clyde Ham-street (\u201cHamstreet\u201d). Nelson, the former general manager of Wescold, Inc. (\u201cWescold\u201d), sued Glass and Hamstreet (together \u201cDefendants\u201d) for tortious interference with economic relations. He alleged that Defendants improperly informed Wescold\u2019s Board of Directors that he was refusing to cooperate with the Board. The district court found that Nelson had not raised an issue of fact as to the Defendants\u2019 use of improper means or acting with improper motives.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Leonel v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>400 F.3d 702, 708 (9th Cir.2005). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">The district court properly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Hamstreet used improper means in conveying information to Wescold\u2019s Board. Hamstreet told Mark Youngren that he did not think Nelson was cooperating with the Board\u2019s directions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Hamstreet could fairly have drawn this conclusion from Nelson\u2019s actions. Youngren\u2019s testimony confirmed that Ham-street simply stated that Nelson was apprehensive in cooperating with Glass. There was no evidence that Hamstreet communicated to Youngren his thoughts that Nelson\u2019s cooperation was a \u201ccharade\u201d or that Nelson was \u201cstonewalling.\u201d There was thus no evidence suggesting that Hamstreet\u2019s statements constituted misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">There was also no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants acted with an improper motive. No evidence indicated that their purpose was to inflict injury on Nelson \u201cas such.\u201d <em>See Volm v. Legacy Health Sys., Inc., </em>237 F.Supp.2d 1166, 1176 (D.Or.2002). As the district court recognized, Defendants\u2019 financial interest standing alone did not constitute an improper motive for purposes of an interference claim. <em>See Koch v. Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>108 Wash.App. 500, 31 P.3d 698, 702 (2001); <em>see also Birkenwald Distrib. Co. v. Heublein, Inc., </em>55 Wash.App. 1, 776 P.2d 721, 727 (1989) (\u201cAsserting one\u2019s rights to maximize economic interests does not create an inference of ill will or improper purpose.\u201d). Summary judgment was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-21\">.
