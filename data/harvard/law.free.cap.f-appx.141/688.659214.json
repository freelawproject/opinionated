Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) adverse credibility determination, including discrepancies in Ali Al-Zubidi\u2019s statements concerning his political activities and opinions, and his vague statements regarding the alleged persecution. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">2. The IJ\u2019s determination that Al-Zubidi failed to show that he was persecuted for his political opinions is supported by substantial evidence. Evidence of \u201cconscription\u201d alone does not satisfy the burden to show persecution because of a political opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">3. There was substantial evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s determination that there was a fundamental, change in conditions in Yemen after Al-Zubidi left, including the facts that a different political party is now in power,- and that Al-Zubidi\u2019s family remains unharmed. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
