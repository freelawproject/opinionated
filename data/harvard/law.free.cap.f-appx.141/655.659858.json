We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-24\">\u201cWhere, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>See Kataria v. </em>INS; 232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-25\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon the omissions in Karapetian\u2019s testimony of incidents that he described in his asylum application. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Karapetian failed to mention both that the police beat his wife and that she subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>quently suffered a miscarriage, and that the police arrested him in 1997 and broke his arm by throwing him out of a moving car. Because these omissions go to the heart of his asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Because Karapetian did not establish that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Karapetian\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to exhaust the issue with the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
