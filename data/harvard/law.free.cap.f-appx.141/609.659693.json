We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an enumerated ground. Because petitioner was arrested for harboring a fugitive, and there is no evidence that she was arrested based on a political opinion or membership in a particular social group, she fails to present evidence compelling the conclusion that she was persecuted on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See id. </em>at 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812 (holding that guerrilla group\u2019s attempt to recruit alien did not establish persecution based on political opinion); <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that alien must show that the persecutors imputed a political opinion to him and that there was no such evidence showing that guerrillas attacked alien\u2019s home based on political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that she was eligible for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Petitioner also fails to establish a CAT claim because she did not show that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if she was returned to China. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
