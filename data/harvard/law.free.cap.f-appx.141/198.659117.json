He was sentenced to 101 months imprisonment (41 months on the drug count and 60 months on the firearms count, to run consecutively), followed by five years of supervised release. The court also announced an identical alternative sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Daughtie appeals his sentence on the drug count, contending that the judicially enhanced guidelines sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We find that, because the alternative discretionary sentence was identical to the sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at the time, any error in the imposition of Daughtie\u2019s sentence was harmless. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
