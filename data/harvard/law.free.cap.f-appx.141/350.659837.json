For the first time on. appeal, Enriquez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As Enriquez acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which was not overruled by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Enriquez argues that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the enhancement of his sentence based on his prior conviction was error. However, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), reaffirmed the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that prior convictions are excluded from the facts that must be admitted or submitted to the jury. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Thus, Enriquez\u2019s sentence was not affected by a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Enriquez argues that because his sentence was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional mandatory guidelines system, it is unconstitutional and should be vacated. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69; <em>see also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). We review for plain error. See <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The error was plain, meeting the first two prongs of the plain-error standard. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005). However, Enriquez has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. Although the sentence was at the low end of the guideline range, a sentence at the low end of the guideline range does not alone indicate that the district court would have sentenced Enriquez differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 318 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535). Furthermore, the error was not structural and prejudice is not otherwise presumed. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601; <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). Nothing in the sentencing transcript indicates that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it known that the guidelines were not mandatory. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
