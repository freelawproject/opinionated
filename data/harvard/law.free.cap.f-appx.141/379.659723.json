For the first time on appeal, Castillo argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. He asserts that this issue should be reviewed de novo because raising an objection in the district court would have been futile and because the remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>was unforeseeable. We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). As Castillo acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Castillo contends that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the guidelines because the error was structural or because prejudice should otherwise be presumed. He concedes that he cannot show plain error under the standard set forth in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517), but asserts that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided. The error was not structural and prejudice is not otherwise presumed. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005)(citing <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). As Castillo acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">Also for the first time on appeal, Castillo argues that the sentence enhancing provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Booker </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536-43. This court must follow the precedent set in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As Castillo concedes, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">affirmed:</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
