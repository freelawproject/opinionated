Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one potential issue but stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Slusarezyk was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. After the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), counsel for Slusarezyk filed a supplemental brief and a motion to remand for resentencing. The Government responded that it did not oppose remand. Because we find no plain error in the determination or imposition of Slusarczyk\u2019s sentence, we deny the motion to remand and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), this court held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not by a jury (or, in a guilty plea case, admitted by the defendant), constitutes plain error that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56. The court directed sentencing courts to calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004), and impose a sentence. If the court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court should state its reasons for doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Because Slusarezyk did not object to the sentencing range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment set forth in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and adopted by the district court, this Court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s sentence is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under the plain error standard, Slusarezyk must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In determining whether error occurred in Slusarczyk\u2019s sentencing, we note that <em>Hughes </em>also recognized \u201cthat after <em>Booker, </em>there are two potential errors in a sentence imposed pursuant to the pre<em>Booker </em>mandatory guidelines regime: a Sixth Amendment error, ... and an error in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 552. We first consider whether Slusarczyk\u2019s sentence was affected by a Sixth Amendment error. Slusarczyk\u2019s base offense level was ealeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>lated at thirty-four based on his status as an armed career criminal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the fact that he possessed firearms in connection with a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4(a) (2003), an individual subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004), is an armed career criminal. Section 924(e) provides as follows: \u201cin the case of a person who violates [\u00a7 ] 922(g) ... and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another ... such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.... \u201d The indictment alleged that, at the time of the crime in question, Slusarczyk had previously been convicted of three aggravated burglaries and one robbery. The PSR reveals that Slusarczyk has five prior convictions for burglary, an offense explicitly deemed a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), and one conviction for robbery. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We thus conclude that Slusarczyk\u2019s classification as an armed career criminal did not violate Slusarczyk\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, as the facts supporting that classification were charged in the indictment and acknowledged in Slusarczyk\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the offense level for an armed career criminal who \u201cused or possessed the firearm ... in connection with ... a crime of violence ...\u201d is thirty-four. Section 4B1.2(a) specifically lists burglary of a dwelling as a crime of violence. The criminal history category for an armed career criminal who \u201cused or possessed the firearm ... in connection with ... a crime or violence .... \u201d is Category VI. USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Slusarczyk received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of thirty-one. This offense level, combined with his criminal history category of VI, yielded a sentencing range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The facts supporting the one-level enhancement for possession of the firearm in connection with a burglary were not charged in the indictment. If this enhancement were removed, Slusarczyk\u2019s total offense level would be thirty, and his sentencing range 168 to 210 months. At the plea hearing, however, Slusarczyk stated that he and two other people burglarized houses and that he knew that an accomplice put a stolen gun in the trunk of Slusarczyk\u2019s vehicle. In addition, Slusarczyk acknowledged the truth of the prosecutor\u2019s summary of the factual basis for the plea that included a description of the burglaries and theft of firearms. Moreover, the imposed sentence of 200 months imprisonment is within the 168 to 210 month range that would apply in the absence of the one-level enhancement. We conclude that the one-level enhancement was based upon facts admitted by Slusarczyk, and he therefore suffered no Sixth Amendment violation in the calculation of his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">In his supplemental brief, Slusarczyk asserts error in the application of the guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>lines as a mandatory sentencing determinant. In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005), this court determined that \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, the imposition of a sentence under the former mandatory guidelines regime rather than under the advisory regime outlined in <em>Booker </em>is error\u201d that is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17. The court also concluded that, to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test, an appellant must demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 217-23. White could not satisfy this requirement, however, because he could not establish that the application of the guidelines as mandatory had an effect on \u201cthe district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Slusarczyk asserts that the district court indicated that it would possibly have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory scheme, based upon comments by the district court after Slusarczyk\u2019s sentence was announced. Our review of the district court\u2019s remarks leads us to conclude that the district court\u2019s statements do not support Slusarczyk\u2019s argument, but would rather require speculation by this Court to determine whether the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence by treating the guidelines as advisory. <em>White, </em>405 F.3d at 223. Accordingly, Slusarczyk cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s error<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we deny Slusarczyk\u2019s motion to remand and affirm his conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\">. Slusarczyk has never contested any aspect of the determination that he qualified for sentencing as an armed career criminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\">. If the enhancement for possession of the firearm in conjunction with a crime of violence did not apply, Slusarczyk's base offense level under the armed career criminal classification would be thirty-three, rather than thirty-four. USSG 4B 1.4(b)(3)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AnW\">. Slusarczyk\u2019s extensive criminal history re-suited in a total of thirty criminal history points, which yields a criminal history category of VI regardless of his status as an armed career criminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. We of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of Slusarczyk\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
