Donnellan and Anne Marie Donnellan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendant GNLV Corporation (\u201cGNLV\u201d). Donnellan brought an action under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), alleging GNLV rejected Donnellan\u2019s employment application because of his disability. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not recount them here except as necessary for our disposition. We assume for purposes of our disposition that Donnellan established a <em>prima facie </em>claim of disparate treatment under the ADA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 271 (9th Cir.1996). GNLV proffered three legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for rejecting Donnellan\u2019s application: (1) Donnellan\u2019s application exhibited inadequate job stability because he had been unemployed for the three years preceding his application; (2) Donnellan received a \u201c2\u201d rating for both appearance and presentation; and (3) his application reflected a lack of computer skills. <em>See Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, </em>540 U.S. 44, 50, 124 S.Ct. 513, 157 L.Ed.2d 357 (2003); <em>Chuang v. Univ. of Cal., Davis, </em>225 F.3d 1115, 1123-24 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Donnellan failed to present evidence which would allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude those legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons were pretextual. <em>See Raytheon, </em>540 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. 513. Donnellan presented no evidence to suggest GNLV deviated from its normal operating procedures in reviewing Donnellan\u2019s application, or that GNLV preferred the application of Susan Rosinski (who was ultimately hired) over Donnellan\u2019s applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tion because of Donnellan\u2019s disability. <em>See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ. Co., </em>513 U.S. 352, 361, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Further, GNLVs proffered reasons for rejecting Donnellan\u2019s application are not inconsistent solely because GNLV initially stated it rejected Donnellan\u2019s application because of \u201cJob Stability,\u201d but later elaborated that Donnellan\u2019s application was rejected because of (1) job stability (ie., Donnellan was unemployed for the three years preceding his application); (2) Donnellan received a rating of \u201c2\u201d for appearance and presentation; and (3) Donnellan\u2019s application reflected a lack of computer skills. The two latter reasons are in addition to, not inconsistent with, the initial reason offered by GNLV and thus provide ho evidence of pretext. <em>See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\">. Kevin Donnellan died during the pendency of this appeal. Anne Marie Donnellan, Mr. Donnellan\u2019s sister and personal representative, brought a motion to substitute appellant, which we granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 43(a)(1). For ease of reference, we refer to Kevin Donnellan as \"Donnellan\u201d in this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\">. The district court found Donnellan did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case because the GNLV employee making the hiring decision was unaware of Donnellan\u2019s disability. The district court alternatively found, however, that even if Donnellan did establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, GNLV proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for rejecting Donnellan\u2019s application, and Donnellan did not present evidence which would allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude those reasons were pretextual. We may affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Enlow v. Salem-Keizer Yellow Cab Co., </em>371 F.3d 645, 649 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
