MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b797-27\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>mously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Richard Lee Beams appeals from district court orders that dismissed his Indian Preference Act (IPA) claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, <em>see </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 472, and entered summary judgment on his discrimination and retaliation claims, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Radil v. Sanborn Western Camps, Inc., </em>384 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir.2004). Whether a private right of action exists is a jurisdictional concern, <em>Hancock v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., </em>21 F.3d 373, 374 (10th Cir.1994), which turns on \u201c \u2018whether Congress intended to create the private remedy asserted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southwest Air Ambulance, Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, </em>268 F.3d 1162, 1169 (10th Cir.2001) <em>(quoting Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979)). As for orders granting summary judgment, our review is de novo, <em>Alexander v. Oklahoma, </em>382 F.3d 1206, 1215 (10th Cir.2004), to determine whether \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s IPA claim and entering summary judgment on appellant\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the challenged decisions for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its July 30, 2004, and September 7, 2004 orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-29\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">. We decline to adopt that portion of the district court's July 30, 2004 decision that examines Beams\u2019 IPA claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and finds a failure to plead a claim for non-monetary relief under the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 101-02, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
