The district court sentenced him to 24 months of imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">For the first time on appeal, Mesa-Franco argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court must vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing because the mandatory guideline regime was in place at the time of his sentencing. An unpreserved challenge to the application of the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in their mandatory form constituted error that is \u201cplain\u201d for purposes of satisfying the first two prongs of the plain error analysis. <em>Id. </em>However, Mesa-Franco bears the burden of demonstrating \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Mesa-Franco has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Mesa-Franco also argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated-felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As Mesa-Franco concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 22, 2005) (No. 05-5469). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
