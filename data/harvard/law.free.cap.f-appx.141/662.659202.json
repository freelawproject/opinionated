We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Ritchie, </em>342 F.3d 903, 906 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The district court properly treated Clivens\u2019 motion as a civil complaint seeking equitable relief. <em>See id. </em>The record shows that the government mailed notice to, and received a signed certificate of delivery from, the Los Angeles address that Clivens provided to DEA agents during the seizure. This notice was \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to apprise Clivens of the pendency of the civil forfeiture proceedings under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(a). <em>See Dusenbery v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 161, 170-71, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002) (holding the government is not required to provide actual notice or to evaluate \u201cthe possibility of a conceivable injury\u201d). Accordingly, the district court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over this motion. <em>See Ritchie, </em>342 F.3d at 907 (\u201c[Wjhere a claimant has received adequate notice of an earlier administrative forfeiture proceeding, and thus has had an adequate remedy at law, the district court should deny a subsequent Rule 41(e) motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
