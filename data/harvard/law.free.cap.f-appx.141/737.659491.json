HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">Danny Clyde White, an Oklahoma state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s decision dismissing as untimely his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). We deny Mr. White\u2019s application for a COA, deny his request to proceed IFP, and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On January 7, 2000, Mr. White pleaded guilty in Oklahoma County district court to five felony charges relating to the manufacture and possession of methamphetamine. He now serves concurrent sentences, ranging from ten to twenty-five years of imprisonment, for those convictions. Mr. White neither sought to withdraw his pleas nor directly appealed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On July 9, 2004, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief in state court, arguing that an intervening change in Oklahoma law warranted modification of his sentences. The trial court denied his application, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed that decision. The OCCA concluded that (1) Mr. White was sentenced properly under the range of punishment in effect when he committed the crimes and (2) the state sentencing amendments in question did not provide for retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On October 15, 2004, Mr. White filed a petition in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The magistrate judge recommended that this petition be dismissed as untimely. The district court did not receive Mr. White\u2019s objection to the report within the advised twenty-day period, and it adopted the report in its entirety. The district court later received Mr. White\u2019s objection,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> treated it as a motion for reconsideration, and denied relief. It also denied Mr. White\u2019s motion for a COA and his request to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">We review Mr. White\u2019s petition for habeas corpus under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This court may issue a COA and entertain Mr. White\u2019s appeal only if he \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make a substantial showing, Mr. White \u201cmust show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Here, the decision to grant a COA turns on the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), which provides that a federal habeas corpus petition must be filed within one year of the latest of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">Mr. White pleaded guilty on January 7, 2000, and did not seek to withdraw the pleas or otherwise appeal his convictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>His convictions became \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) on January 17, 2000, ten days after the entry of judgment and sentence. Okla Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1051. Thus, absent statutory or equitable tolling exceptions, Mr. White\u2019s one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) expired on January 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Mr. White contends that post-sentencing events provide a more recent \u201cdate on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). First, he cites an amendment to the state sentencing law that went into effect on July 1, 2001, and reduced the minimum sentence for Mr. White\u2019s crimes from twenty to seven years. <em>See </em>Okla Stat. tit. 63, \u00a7 2-401(G)(2). The amendment does not render Mr. White\u2019s petition timely. Importantly, the amendment at issue is silent as to its retroactivity. Without \u201cexpress indication that the Legislature intended the amendment changing the range of punishment to be applied retroactively, [appellant [is] entitled only to an application of the law which was in effect at the time he committed the crime.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>59 P.3d 518, 519 (Okla.Crim.App.2002). Even if the amendment somehow gave rise to a claim under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), which it does not, the one-year limitation period would have expired on July 1, 2002, absent exceptions for statutory or equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Second, Mr. White relies on a decision of the Osage County district court, entered on May 27, 2004, that modified another Oklahoma prisoner\u2019s sentence for a similar crime committed before the 2001 amendments. <em>See State v. Blythe, </em>No. CF-98-281. Upon review of the record, we agree with the district court that <em>Blythe </em>does not provide a \u201cfactual predicate\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) for Mr. White\u2019s claim. The trial court in <em>Blythe </em>only modified the sentence of a state prisoner after finding that (1) the state intended, at the time of initial sentencing, that the defendant be sentenced to the minimum punishment available and (2) the defendant had sought all rehabilitation measures during incarceration. Rec. doc. 14, Ex. 2 (Modified Judgment and Sentence upon Judicial Review, filed May 27, 2004). This unpublished decision of an Oklahoma trial court is without precedential effect. Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Blythe, </em>Mr. White has shown neither the state\u2019s intention to sentence him to the minimum punishment available nor his pursuit of all rehabilitation measures during incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Therefore, because Mr. White did not file his federal habeas petition until October 15, 2004, he is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) and (D) unless tolling extends the limitation period. We further agree with the district court, however, that neither statutory nor equitable tolling exceptions apply. As to statutory tolling, we note that \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Mr. White did not file for post-conviction relief in state court until July 2004. His petition cannot be tolled for time spent in state post-conviction proceedings because the state petition for relief was filed after the expiration of his one-year limitation period. <em>Fisher v. Gibson, </em>262 F.3d 1135, 1142-43 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">In certain \u201crare and exceptional circumstances,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling. <em>York v. Galetka, </em>314 F.3d 522, 527 (10th Cir.2003). For example, \u201c[e]quitable tolling would be appropriate ... when a prisoner is actually innocent\u201d or \u201cwhen an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>adversary\u2019s conduct-or other uncontrollable circumstances-prevents a prisoner from timely filing.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cSimple excusable neglect is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, equitable tolling applies only \u201cwhen an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000). We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. White has not met this standard for equitable tolling. He has neither diligently pursued his claims nor offered any reason for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. White\u2019s application for a COA, DENY his request to proceed IFP, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. The magistrate judge advised Mr. White to object to the report and recommendation by December 29, 2004. The certificate of service, attached to Mr. White\u2019s objection, suggests that he signed and relinquished control of the document on December 22, 2004. The objection was mailed on December 29, 2004, and received in district court on January 4, 2005. <em>See </em>Rec. doc. 18. We consider the objection to be timely filed under the prisoner mailbox rule. <em>See Dunn v. White, </em>880 F.2d 1188, 1190 (10th Cir.1989) (deeming the mailing date to be the filing date for a prisoner\u2019s objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
