The district court denied relief because it determined that Chester\u2019s claims sounded as an unauthorized second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and found that Chester had not made the showing necessary to seek 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 relief by means of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because Chester does not challenge this determination by the district court, he has waived the only issue relevant to his appeal. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
