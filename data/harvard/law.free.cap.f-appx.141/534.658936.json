We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we dismiss the appeal for Santos\u2019 failure to provide a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Santos contends that the jury\u2019s finding was unsupported by the evidence and that the trial was tainted by judicial bias, jury bias, and ineffective assistance of counsel, but he did not provide a transcript of the proceedings as required by Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Without a trial transcript and supporting affidavits we are unable to review Santos\u2019 contentions, and we dismiss the appeal. <em>See Syncom Capital Corp. v. Wade, </em>924 F.2d 167, 169 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">In his reply brief Santos contends that because the district court denied his motion to proceed in forma pauperis, the transcript was \u201cunavailable\u201d to him and he should be able to provide a substitute statement of the proceedings under Fed. R.App. P. 10(c). Even if not waived, this contention lacks merit because the transcript was not \u201cphysically unobtainable\u201d and was therefore not \u201cunavailable.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Computax Corp., </em>631 F.2d 139, 143 (9th Cir.1980). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Santos\u2019 motion seeking production of transcripts at government expense, because Santos made only conclusory statements about the issues he would raise on appeal. <em>See McKinney v. Anderson, </em>924 F.2d 1500, 1511-12 (9th Cir.1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by Hell</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>ing v.
