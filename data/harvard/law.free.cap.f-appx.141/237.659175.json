We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-26\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on June 18, 2004. Cargill filed a request for certificate of appealability on June 6, 2005. Because Cargill failed to file a timely notice of appeal, and because he did not obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny his motion for certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
