Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Our review of the Board\u2019s \u201casylum eligibility determination is most narrow ... [and] recognizes the respect we must accord the [Board\u2019s] expertise and its status as the Attorney General\u2019s designee in deportation decisions.\u201d <em>Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.2004). Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tive findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We find there was no such compelling evidence. Accordingly, we will not reverse the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367. Because Ibrahim is not eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-15\"> By not raising the issue in her brief, Ibrahim has abandoned any challenge to the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
