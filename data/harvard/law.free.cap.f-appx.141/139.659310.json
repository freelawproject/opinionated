We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Lalawi\u2019s motions. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (b) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We accordingly deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
