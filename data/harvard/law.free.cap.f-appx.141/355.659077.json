Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the sentencing judge applied the sentencing guidelines as if they were mandatory. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Ramos-Garcia must show, among other things, that the error prejudiced him by adversely affecting his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Ramos-Garcia fails to establish that he would have received a lower sentence had the district court applied the sentencing guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See id. </em>at 733-34. He thus fails to establish prejudice to his substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
