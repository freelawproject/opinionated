We mention only that after oral argument, the Department moved to supplement the record with an updated, revised <em>Vaughn </em>index<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that indicates that several of the previously-withheld documents have now been produced, but that the Department still is withholding thirty-five documents under FOIA\u2019s Exemption 5. We granted the Department\u2019s motion, and, in an attempt to put an expeditious end to this litigation, we ordered the Department to submit the withheld documents to the court for in camera inspection. After conducting a thorough review of the submitted documents, we conclude that each has been properly withheld as attorney-client privileged and/or attorney work-product. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5). We have also determined that there is no segregable, non-privileged information, and thus do not require redaction of the withheld documents. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(b). We see no need for further discovery into the Department\u2019s search methodology. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, </em>80 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cWe may affirm on any ground supported by the record even if it differs from the rationale of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">.
