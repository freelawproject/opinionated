We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of plaintiffs\u2019 nine arguments concerning the validity of the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (\u201cRFDP\u201d), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460Z-6a, will be addressed in turn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Decker v. Advantage Fund, Ltd., </em>362 F.3d 593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2004). We review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend <em>de novo. See Smith v. Pacific Props. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>358 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 106, 160 L.Ed.2d 116 (2004). Dismissal without leave to amend is improper unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment. <em>See Thinket Ink Info. Res., Inc. v. Sun Microsystems, Inc., </em>368 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">\n<em>A. Plaintiffs had actual and timely notice of the Enterprise Project\u2019s Adventure Pass requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">Plaintiffs contend that the Forest Service failed to provide public notice of the Enterprise Project\u2019s implementation as required by \u00a7 552(a)(1)(E) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-59, 701-06. Section 552(a)(1)(E) requires that \u201camendment, revision, or repeal\u201d of federal agency policies and procedures be published in the Federal Register. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(E). However, because the RFDP did not repeal or amend any federal or state provisions, \u201cwas enacted \u2018notwithstanding any other\u2019 legislation,\u201d <em>United States v. Dahl, </em>314 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 928, 123 S.Ct. 2589, 156 L.Ed.2d 606 (2003), and is self-executing, it was <em>not </em>governed by \u00a7 552(a)(1)(E). Moreover, this notice requirement does not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>when \u2014 as here \u2014 an individual has <em>actual </em>notice of the terms. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>742 F.2d 1153, 1155 (9th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we reject Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Forest Service improperly failed to comply with the APA\u2019s public notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>B. The FLREA complies with the \u201cmeeting\u201d requirement of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b, requires that every portion of every federal agency meeting be open to public observation. Section 552b defines \u201cmeeting\u201d as the \u201cdeliberations of at least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.... \u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552b(a)(2). The FLREA requires the creation of a Recreation Resource Advisory Committee to review and recommend changes to the fee system. <em>See </em>FLREA \u00a7 804(d), 118 Stat. at 3382-85. The Committee is scheduled to meet \u201cas often as needed to deal with citizen concerns about the recreation fee program\u201d and community participation in those meetings is mandatory. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 804(d)(3), (5), 118 Stat. at 3383-84. Accordingly, the Enterprise Project complies with \u00a7 552b\u2019s meeting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">C. <em>The Forest Service has the authority to post signs advertising the Adventure Pass along California highways within the National Forests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Plaintiffs assert that the Forest Service is not authorized to place signs notifying motorists of the Adventure Pass requirement on state highways running through the National Forests. Plaintiffs lack standing to assert a claim on behalf of the State of California because they do not claim that the signs\u2019 <em>locations </em>(on state highways within the National Forests) have caused them injury. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). However, this contention fails on the merits as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The authority to post signs on roads within National Forests to inform the public of the Adventure Pass is merely an extension of the Forest Service\u2019s authority under the Organic Administration Act of 1897, c. 2, \u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 11, 36 (codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 473-82, 551), and the Constitution\u2019s Property Clause, U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. That authority applies to established state rights-of-way located within the National Forests. <em>See United States v. Vogler, </em>859 F.2d 638, 642 (9th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the Forest Service was acting within its authority when it posted signs on state highways within the National Forests.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">\n<em>D. The Forest Service has the authority to require that vehicles parked along state highways within the National Forests display an Adventure Pass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">Plaintiffs contend that the Forest Service has no authority to require vehicles parked on state highways within National Forest boundaries to display an Adventure Pass. We reject this contention. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Forest Service have the power to regulate activities within the National Forests. <em>See Cal. Coastal Comm\u2019n v. Granite Rock Co., </em>480 U.S. 572, 596, 107 S.Ct. 1419, 94 L.Ed.2d 577 (1987). Accordingly, the Forest Service has the authority to impose this minor duty on vehicle owners while their cars are parked within National Forest boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\n<em>E. The Adventure Pass does not violate an individual\u2019s right to travel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Plaintiffs assert that the Enterprise Project\u2019s Adventure Pass requirement violates an individual\u2019s right to infra state travel. However, neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has recognized a protected right to intrastate travel. <em>See Nunez ex rel. Nunez v. City of San Diego, </em>114 F.3d 935, 944 n. 7 (9th Cir.1997). Plaintiffs also contend that the pass requirement violates the right to interstate travel. Although the Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right to interstate travel, <em>see Attorney Gen. of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, </em>476 U.S. 898, 903, 106 S.Ct. 2317, 90 L.Ed.2d 899 (1986) (Brennan, J., plurality op.), the Enterprise Project does not impede an individual\u2019s right or ability to travel between states. A five-dollar vehicle parking fee, charged for recreational use of the National Forest, does not constitute a barrier to intrastate or interstate travel. <em>See Miller v. Reed, </em>176 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.1999) (recognizing that \u201cminor burdens impacting interstate travel, such as toll roads, do not constitute a violation\u201d of the right to travel). Accordingly, the Enterprise Project does not violate Plaintiffs\u2019 right to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>F. The Enterprise Project does not conflict with NEPA requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Plaintiffs allege that the Enterprise Project failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act\u2019s (\u201cNEPA\u201d) requirements. Under the NEPA, federal agencies are required to prepare an environmental impact statement for every \u201cmajor Federal action[] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d <em>Forest Guardians v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>329 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C)) (alteration in original). The NEPA implementing regulations define \u201cmajor federal actions\u201d as actions with effects that may be major or significant and which are potentially subject to federal control and responsibility. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The Enterprise Project\u2019s Adventure Pass display requirement and fee does <em>not </em>constitute a \u201cmajor federal action,\u201d as the potential impact of a five-dollar fee is minimal. <em>See, e.g., Ka Makani O Kohala Ohana Inc. v. Water Supply, </em>295 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Lake Berryessa Tenants\u2019 Council v. United States, </em>588 F.2d 267, 271-72 (9th Cir.1978) (per curiam); <em>Tucson Rod &amp; Gun Club v. McGee, </em>25 F.Supp.2d 1025, 1029 (D.Ariz.1998). Because the Enterprise Project is not a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d \u2014 inasmuch as it merely authorizes a user-generated cost recovery plan and will not affect the quality of the human environment \u2014 it is not subject to the NEPA\u2019s environmental impact statement requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\n<em>G. The Enterprise Project does not conflict with the California Constitution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Plaintiffs contend that the Enterprise Project conflicts with California\u2019s constitutional guarantee that \u201c[t]he people shall have the right to fish upon and from the <em>public lands </em>of the State and in the waters thereof....\u201d Cal. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 25 (emphasis added). The California Constitution <em>is not </em>at issue in this case because the \u201cpublic lands\u201d described in article 1, section 25 of the California Constitution are <em>state-owned lands, </em>not federal lands. <em>See State v. San Luis Obispo Sportsman\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>22 Cal.3d 440, 149 Cal.Rptr. 482, 584 P.2d 1088, 1092 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\n<em>H. The Enterprise Project does not conflict with the Tenth Amendment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Plaintiffs contend that the Enterprise Project conflicts with the Tenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Amendment because it purports to regulate \u201cpublic lands throughout the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Tenth Amendment is not implicated here. As discussed above, the \u201cpublic lands\u201d at issue are federal, not state, property. Congress\u2019s authority to establish the Forest Service and to regulate the National Forests is derived from the Constitution\u2019s Property Clause, which provides that \u201cCongress shall have [the] Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States____\u201d U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>I. The Enterprise Project does not conflict with the FLPMA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Enterprise Project violates the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 <em>et seq., </em>by requiring fisherman and hunters to purchase and display the Adventure Pass on their vehicles. In pertinent part, the FLPMA states that \u201cthe Secretary shall ... regulate ... the use, occupancy, and development of the public lands ... [provided] [t]hat nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary concerned to require Federal permits to hunt and fish on public lands or on lands in the National Forest System and adjacent waters....\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the Enterprise Project conflicts with the FLPMA because, while the FLPMA prohibits general hunting and fishing permits, the Enterprise Project allows the Forest Service to charge hunters and fishermen a fee for parking within the National Forests. Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to equate a hunting or fishing permit with a parking fee is misplaced. A \u201cpermit\u201d is defined as \u201ca special use authorization which provides permission, without conveying an interest in land, to occupy and use National Forest System land or facilities for specified purposes\u201d\u2014 in this case, for hunting or fishing. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.51 (2004). The Adventure Pass, on the other hand, is required for <em>any vehicle </em>parked within the confines of the National Forests; it is not specifically required for fishing or hunting. Accordingly, the Enterprise Project does not conflict with the FLPMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Because Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are fatally flawed and could not be saved by amendment, the district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\">. On December 6, 2004, Congress passed, and on December 8, 2004, the President signed into law, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (\"FLREA\"), Pub. L. No. 108-447, div. J, tit. VIII, 118 Stat. 2809, 3377-93 (2004). After this case was submitted for decision, the government filed a Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter asserting that the FLREA renders this case moot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">It is true, as the Government asserts, that section 813(b) of the FLREA expressly repealed the RFDP. <em>See </em>118 Stat. at 3390. But section 803(f), (g), and (h) reauthorized the Forest Service to collect recreation fees, such as those collected through the Enterprise Project. <em>See </em>118 Stat. at 3380-82. Because the FLREA disadvantages Plaintiffs \"in the same fundamental way\u201d that the RFDP disadvantaged Plaintiffs, the case is not moot. <em>Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., </em>508 U.S. 656, 661-62, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L,Ed.2d 586 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-17\">. In their complaint, Plaintiffs also alleged that the Enterprise project violated section 4 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460l-6a, and the Fifth Amendment. On appeal, Plaintiffs concede that these claims are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dahl, </em>314 F.3d 976 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 928, 123 S.Ct. 2589, 156 L.Ed.2d 606 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
