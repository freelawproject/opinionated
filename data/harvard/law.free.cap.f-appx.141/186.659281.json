The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The Plumajs, a married couple who are natives and citizens of Albania, attempted to enter the United States on December 27, 1998, under the Visa Waiver Phot Program (\u201cVWPP\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which allows visitors from certain countries to enter the United States without a visa for a stay of ninety days or less. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1187 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2004). In exchange for the visa waiver, the alien must waive his right \u201cto contest, other than on the basis of an application for asylum, any action for removal.\u201d \u00a7 1187(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Plumajs were apprehended at Dulles airport, posing as assistants to a soccer team from Slovenia, a party to the VWPP. During their questioning by agents of the former Immigration and Naturalization Services (\u201cINS\u201d), the Plumajs admitted that they were not citizens of Slovenia, that they were in possession of fraudulently obtained passports from Slovenia, that they were citizens of Albania (a country that does not participate in the VWPP), and that they feared reprisals for their participation in anti-communist activities if they were returned to Albania. Although the Plumajs were advised that they would not be permitted to enter the United States under the VWPP, as they were ineligible, and that they would be deported, their case was referred to an immigration judge for \u201casylum-only proceedings\u201d pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">When their application for asylum was denied, the Plumajs filed a motion to remand for adjustment of status, contending that Mr. Plumaj\u2019s brother, a United States citizen, filed a visa petition on his behalf. After that motion was denied, the Plumajs filed a motion to reconsider. The Board denied that motion, stating that the Plumajs were not eligible for adjustment of status because they sought to enter the United States under the VWPP. The Board noted that, under \u00a7 217(b) of the INA, a VWPP entrant may apply only for asylum relief as a means of contesting deportation. The Plumajs then filed the instant petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The Plumajs contend that due process requires that the waiver of their right to all claims for relief other than asylum must have been made \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d to be enforceable against them, <em>Nose v. Attorney General, </em>993 F.2d 75, 79 (5th Cir.1993), and argue that they did not sign their waivers \u201cknowingly and voluntarily.\u201d According to the Plumajs, at the time of their entry they were unable to speak English, and although they signed the forms requesting entry under the VWPP, a third party actually completed the paperwork for them. Thus, the Plumajs maintain that they did not understand the forms they were signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a due process challenge to a [removal hearing], an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>by any such violation.\u201d <em>See Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002) (stating that removal and asylum proceedings are \u201csubject to the requirements of procedural due process\u201d). Under current agency regulations, arriving aliens seeking admission without valid entry documents (such as a visa or visa waiver), are precluded from applying for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(c)(8) (2005). Moreover, the Plumajs have not demonstrated that a visa was \u201cimmediately available to them,\u201d an element required to establish an alien\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255(a) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1) (2005). Because the Plumajs cannot demonstrate that they were entitled to an adjustment of status, they cannot show they were prejudiced by the alleged error. <em>See Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324. We therefore find that the Board did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Plumajs\u2019 motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. U.S. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">. The Program was later made permanent by Congress, and was renamed the Visa Waiver Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">. We note that the merits of the orders issued by the Board \u2014 the October 31, 2003 order denying the Plumajs\u2019 motions to reopen and to remand or of its earlier February 13, 2003 decision dismissing their appeal from the immigration court \u2014 are not the subject of the present petition because the Plumajs did not timely file a petition for review of any of those decisions. The Plumajs had thirty days from the date of each of these orders to timely file a petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). This time period is \"jurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\" <em>Stone </em>v. <em>INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). The filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider with the Board does not toll the thirty-day period for seeking review of the underlying order. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537. Accordingly, this court\u2019s review is limited to the propriety of the Board\u2019s denial of the Plumajs' motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
