Coekerham appeals his guilty-plea conviction and sentence for being a felon in possession of ammunition and firearms. Coekerham contends that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the sentencing judge applied the sentencing guidelines as if they were mandatory. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Coekerham must show: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). If these three conditions are met, this court has the discretion to correct the error, \u201cbut only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733 (citation and internal quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">To demonstrate that the plain error affected his substantial rights, Coekerham has the burden of showing that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). He must demonstrate \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that Cockerham\u2019s sentence would have been any less had the court applied the sentencing guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34. Coekerham thus fails to establish prejudice to his substantial rights. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
