Galicia argues that the district court committed reversible plain error by increasing the maximum authorized Guidelines sentence based on facts neither admitted nor found by a jury, and by imposing a sentence under \u00e1 mandatory Guidelines scheme. Galicia correctly concedes that he cannot carry his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Galicia also argues that because his indictment did not allege a prior felony conviction, he was subject to a maximum sentence of two years under U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He correctly acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and not a separate criminal offense. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
