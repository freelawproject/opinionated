Both his plea agreement and plea hearing reveal that Richardson was informed that the Government considered him an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West Supp.2005) and that his minimum sentence under the statute was fifteen years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Counsel conceded at Richardson\u2019s sentencing hearing that the designation was proper but argued that the sentencing enhancement was invalid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court sentenced Richardson to 180 months of imprisonment, the mandatory minimum under \u00a7 924(e). Since Richardson\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court has extended its decision in <em>Blakely </em>to federal criminal defendants. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (striking down the mandatory provisions of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines). On appeal, Richardson argues (1) that the sentence is invalid in light of <em>Blakely </em>and (2) that his criminal history, as calculated in his presentence report, is also invalid. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Richardson has preserved his <em>Blakely </em>arguments for appellate review. He first alleges that his armed career criminal designation does not survive <em>Blakely. </em>Richardson, however, does not deny the fact of his five prior North Carolina convictions for \u201cFelonious Robbery With a Dangerous Weapon\u201d or that such convictions are a proper predicate for the armed career criminal enhancement he received. Because Richardson\u2019s fifteen-year sentence was mandated by statute, the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines did not affect his sentence. Accordingly, we find there is no error under <em>Booker. See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>did nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d). Moreover, we recently rejected the argument that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are violated under <em>Booker </em>when his sentence is statutorily enhanced under \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Second, Richardson alleges that his criminal history, as calculated in his presentence report, was erroneous in light of <em>Blakely. </em>This claim fails, however, as Richardson\u2019s sentence was not increased based on his criminal history. Rather, Richardson was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Thus, we affirm Richardson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
