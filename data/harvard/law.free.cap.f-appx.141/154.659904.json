Counsel for Wilson filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests that the district court erred in overruling Wilson\u2019s objection to the Government\u2019s failure to move for a downward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wilson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">A departure on the ground of substantial assistance to the Government first requires that the Government file a motion for the court to depart. <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 508 (4th Cir.1997). The district court may review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion to determine whether the refusal is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In order to invoke this review, however, a defendant must do more than make \u201cgeneralized allegations of improper motive\u201d\u2014 he must make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186,112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">In this case, Wilson\u2019s counsel never objected to the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure. The Assistant United States Attorney informed the district court that the Government was not moving for a departure because Wilson refused to be debriefed regarding a past conviction. Wilson\u2019s counsel argued that Wilson had assisted the Government and that she had advised him not to discuss the conviction in question until she had an opportunity to investigate it, but did not specifically object to the Government\u2019s decision not to move for departure. We conclude that the issue of the propriety of the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a departure was never squarely presented to the district court, and in any event Wilson has failed to make a threshold showing that the Government\u2019s refusal to move was based upon an improper motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly examined the entire record, including the transcripts of the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and sentencing hearings, for any other potentially meritorious issues and have found none.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>affirm Wilson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">. <em>Anders v.

Accordingly, we have not considered any potential issues arising under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
