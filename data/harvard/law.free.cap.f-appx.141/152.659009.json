We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Jiang\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
