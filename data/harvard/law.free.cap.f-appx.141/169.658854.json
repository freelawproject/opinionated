See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Reginald Lucas, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and dismissing his action filed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Lucas also seeks to appeal a separate district court order denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lucas has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Because Lucas did not raise his FOIA claim in his informal brief to this court, the issue is waived. <em>See </em>4th Cir. Local R. 34(b). Further, in Lucas\u2019 valid and binding plea agreement, he waived his right to bring the FOIA claim as well as the claim he raised in his Rule 60(b) motion. We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the FOIA request and the Rule 60(b) motion. The motion to compel the district court to state its reason for denying a certificate of appealability and the \u201cMotion to Subtract Supplement Brief\u2019 are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-10\"> The motion did not seek relief from any civil judgment, but rather was an attack on Lucas\u2019 drug conviction. Lucas filed the motion before he filed his \u00a7 2255 action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
