We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because Flores Martinez failed to provide any evidence that he would be at risk of suffering torture if he were returned to Guatemala. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir.1987) (motion to remand requires showing of prima facie eligibility for relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Flores Martinez waived any challenge to the denial of his application for eancellation of removal by failing to raise this issue in his opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Flores Martinez\u2019s voluntary departure period was stayed, and that stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
