Deemed a career offender pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2003), Mercer was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count of bank robbery, to be served concurrently. He appeals, claiming his counsel was ineffective and the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-25\">This court will not consider Mercer\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal \u201cunless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). If the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance, a prisoner must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000)' motion. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Our review of the record discloses no evidence that Mercer was subjected to ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In addition, Mercer signed a plea agreement in which he waived his rights to contest his conviction and sentence on all bases except ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and sentencing guidelines issues inconsistent with the plea agreement or of an unanticipated nature requiring the district court to certify review by this court. Whether the defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal is an issue we review de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). When the United States seeks to enforce a waiver provision, as it does here, this court \u201cwill enforce the waiver to preclude a defendant from appealing a specific issue if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 170-73 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Here, the court queried Mercer and his attorney with regard to the plea agreement in general, and Mercer agreed to the specific appellate waiver provision. In addition, both Mercer and his attorney acknowledged they understood all the terms of the agreement. The court found Mercer entered the plea \u201cknowingly and voluntarily,\u201d understanding \u201cthe charges, potential penalties and consequences of said plea.\u201d Finally, we find that the meaning of the plea agreement and the waiver provision is clear. We conclude, therefore, the waiver is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Furthermore, we find no merit to Mercer\u2019s contention that his sentence for the jury conviction, which was not a part of the plea agreement and thus not included in the waiver provision, was unreasonable. We therefore affirm Mercer\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
