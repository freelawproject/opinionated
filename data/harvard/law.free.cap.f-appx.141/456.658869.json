Rosen, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-9\">ROGERS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The defendant-appellant, Bobby Bonee, appeals his conviction on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Specifically, Bonee argues that the government failed to prove that Bonee possessed, either actually or constructively, the firearms which formed the basis of the charge of felon in possession of a firearm. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">On November 27, 2003, deputies from the Henderson County Sheriffs Department went to Bonee\u2019s house as part of an ongoing investigation. While deputies were talking with Bonee outside of his home, it began to rain heavily. At the deputies\u2019 request, Bonee allowed the deputies to enter his trailer and, after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, gave the officers permission to search the trailer. The search of the trailer led to the discovery of seven firearms located in Bonee\u2019s bedroom in an unlocked gun cabinet. In particular, the search revealed a Remington Model 700, a .270-caliber Winchester, a Winchester Model 370 12-gauge shotgun, a Winchester single-shot Model 370 16-gauge shotgun, a Winchester Model 1300 12-gauge shotgun, a .17-caliber Marlin rifle, and a Remington Speed Master Model 552 .22-caliber rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">After the discovery of the firearms, Bonee was transported to the Henderson County Sheriffs Department. After again being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Bonee gave a statement to Investigators Tolley and Stanford. At the defendant\u2019s request, Tolley wrote the defendant\u2019s statement \u201cword-for-word.\u201d Tolley testified that, after every sentence, he and Bonee went back through the statement for accuracy. After Bonee was finished with the statement, Tolley read it back to Bonee, and then let Bonee read and review the statement for accuracy. Finally, Bonee signed the statement to indicate that the information was truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">In the statement to investigators, Bonee admitted ownership of some of the weapons. Specifically, Bonee stated: (1) that he bought the .270 from a Gene Moore, who lived in Scott\u2019s Hill, Tennessee, about two years prior; (2) that he traded for the .22-caliber about eleven years ago; (3) that he bought one of the 12-gauge shotguns from a Jeremy Marshbanks last summer; (4) that he received the other 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>gauge shotgun as a Christmas gift when he was 15; (5) that he traded with his brother for the 16-gauge in 1988; and (6) that he traded with a boy in Crump, Tennessee for a 20-gauge firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Despite Bonee\u2019s statement to the contrary, the defense presented several witnesses who testified that the guns did not belong to Bonee, but instead belonged to Bonee\u2019s wife, Tammy Barrett. These witnesses testified as to how Barrett received the weapons and for what purposes Barrett used the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">At the end of prosecution\u2019s case, and again at the end of the defense\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a motion for judgment of acquittal. The court denied both of the defendant\u2019s motions and sent the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty and, on September 27, 2004, the district court entered a judgment sentencing the defendant to 51 months\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by two years of supervised release. Bonee appeals his conviction, arguing that the government failed to prove that Bonee possessed the firearms in question. Because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">When a conviction is attacked for insufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found each essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>398 F.3d 516, 521-22 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In this case, Bonee was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g). The essential elements of a \u00a7 922(g) violation are as follows: (1) the defendant had a previous felony conviction; (2) the defendant possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm had traveled in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>160 F.3d 1078, 1087 (6th Cir.1998). The term \u201cpossession,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 922(g), includes actual possession and constructive possession. <em>United States v. DeJohn, </em>368 F.3d 533, 545 (6th Cir.2004). \u201c \u2018Both actual and constructive possession may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Schreane, </em>331 F.3d 548, 560 (6th Cir.2003)). In this case, Bonee argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish the second element of the offense \u2014 that he possessed, either actually or constructively, the guns found in his bedroom. Bonee\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence against Bonee is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to infer that Bonee possessed the firearms in question. The guns at issue were found in an unlocked gun cabinet in Bonee\u2019s bedroom. While mere proximity to contraband may not be sufficient to indicate ownership, <em>see United States v. White, </em>932 F.2d 588, 589-90 (6th Cir.1991), in this case, more than physical proximity tied Bonee to the firearm \u2014 Bonee admitted to the police that he owned several of the guns in question. While Bonee now attempts to downplay the significance of his confession by arguing that, because the confession was not actually written by the defendant, it was \u201cnot credible,\u201d this court has previously upheld the admission of a confession taken in similar circumstances. <em>See United States v. Soto, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 956 (6th Cir.2005) (affirming the admittance of defendant\u2019s statement where officers read the defendant questions and then recorded the defendant\u2019s answer .in writing). Moreover, Bonee had the opportunity to read and review the statement as recorded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>investigators, and Bonee signed the statement indicating that it accurately reflected what Bonee had told investigators. Under such circumstances, the jury was entitled to rely on Bonee\u2019s statement that he owned several of the guns and to discount the testimony of defense witnesses who stated that the guns did not belong to Bonee, but instead belonged to Bonee\u2019s wife, Tammy Barrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Quite simply, Bonee\u2019s admission that he owned several of the guns in question, coupled with the location of the guns in Bonee\u2019s bedroom, was sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that Bonee possessed the guns in question. <em>See United States v. Gardner, </em>No. 90-2182, 1991 WL 58297 (6th Cir. April 11,1991) (holding that defendant\u2019s residency in an apartment where firearms were located, coupled with the defendant\u2019s admission that he owned the firearms, was sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm). Bonee\u2019s conviction is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict in this case, Bonee\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
