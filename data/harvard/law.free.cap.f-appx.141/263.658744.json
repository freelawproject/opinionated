We affirm the district court\u2019s enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">NCS\u2019s appeal is the latest chapter in its five-year-old employment dispute with Prescott; indeed, this is the second time that these parties have come before us regarding the validity of the arbitrator\u2019s award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we detailed the facts underlying this dispute in our <em>Prescott I </em>opinion, we shall not repeat them here. We shall, however, briefly review the background proceedings for the sake of clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">After being fired from her job as principal at NCS, Prescott brought suit in the district court, alleging Title VII and various state law claims, including breach of her employment contract. After NCS moved successfully to compel arbitration, such proceedings were conducted according to the Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation (\u201cRules\u201d) of the Institute for Christian Conciliation (\u201cICC\u201d). In arbitration, Prescott prevailed on her breach of contract claim and was awarded approximately $ 150,000 in damages for reputational harms and loss of future income. In reaching his decision, the arbitrator determined that NCS had wrongfully discharged Prescott by failing to follow Biblical precepts, as required in her employment contract; specifically, the conflict resolution process described in Matthew 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">NCS immediately returned to federal district court, this time requesting vacatur of the arbitrator\u2019s award. NCS insisted that, even though the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement specified that proceedings would be conducted under the Rules of the ICC and the Montana Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the parties had actually contracted for plenary judicial review of the arbitration proceedings when they struck through language in NCS\u2019s form arbitration agreement, thereby making communications between the parties confidential and inadmissible in a court of law. The parties had also inserted a hand-written provision stating that \u201c[n]o party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NCS reasoned that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>this expanded scope of review, the district court had jurisdiction to address and hold that the arbitrator misconstrued Prescott\u2019s employment contract as well as applicable Louisiana law. NCS also argued that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and was impermissibly biased \u2014 both grounds for vacatur under the MTJAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The district court ruled against NCS, holding that the parties had not expanded the scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings and that NCS had not shown that it was entitled to vacatur under the MUAA\u2019s narrow standard of judicial review of proceedings in arbitration. NCS appealed this ruling to us in <em>Prescott I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Holding that the parties\u2019 handwritten strike-outs and their insertion to their arbitration agreement were ambiguous, we vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded with instructions for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing. In so doing, we directed the district court to \u201ctake evidence on and contractually interpret the circumstances surrounding the <em>making </em>of the provision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On remand, the district court held an evidentiary hearing as instructed, after which it again concluded that the parties had not contractually expanded the scope of review and again ordered enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award for the reasons given in its previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In the instant appeal, NCS challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the arbitration agreement did not expand the parties\u2019 right to judicial review on appeal. In addition, NCS now contends that it was entitled to a jury trial on the question of <em>interpretation </em>of the arbitration agreement, not just the <em>making </em>of that agreement, reiterating the contention that the district court erred in its earlier order enforcing the arbitration award in favor of Prescott.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">A. The Ambiguous \u201cAppeal Rights\u201d Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of facts for clear error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden of showing that the findings of the district court are clearly erroneous is heavier if the credibility of witnesses is a factor in the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">2. The Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On remand from <em>Prescott I, </em>the district court heard testimony from the parties as to whether, in amending their arbitration agreement, they had intended to expand the scope of any subsequent judicial review. Prescott testified that she understood at the time that she had only a limited right of appeal but that she wanted to confirm in writing that, by signing the arbitration agreement, she was not waiving or curtailing even this limited right of review. To that end, she requested that the parties include a clause stating that \u201cNo party waives appeal rights by signing this agreement.\u201d Prescott testified further that NCS twice rejected her suggestion but finally agreed to accept her modification on the condition that the words \u201cif any\u201d be inserted after \u201cappeal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Boyd Leahy testified on behalf of NCS that the clause was added to preserve all appeal rights in the event that there was no successful mediation. He claimed that the words \u201cif any\u201d were added to the clause because, if the mediation had been successful, there would have been no appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">NCS also argued to the district court that the conduct of the parties demonstrated their belief that they had contracted for appeal rights beyond those guaranteed by the MUAA. NCS emphasized that (1) Prescott had hired a court reporter to transcribe the entire arbitration hearing, (2) during the arbitration proceeding, the parties discussed possible appeal to the Fifth Circuit, (8) Prescott proffered evidence for consideration on appeal, and (4) she agreed to the arbitrator\u2019s retaining custody of disputed evidence pending final appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">The district court ruled in favor of Prescott, holding that the phrase \u201cif any\u201d was inserted to preserve appeal rights normally guaranteed by the MUAA. He interpreted \u201cif any\u201d to mean \u201cif there are any,\u201d a phrase that implies the possibility of none. \u201cIn other words,\u201d ruled the district court, \u201cthe parties agreed to not waive appeal rights <em>if there are any.\u201d </em>NCS\u2019s insistence on adding the words \u201cif any\u201d to the contract, the court concluded, demonstrated its own concern that, without these words, Prescott might be allowed to appeal the arbitrator\u2019s decision on grounds not permitted by the MUAA. The court stated that NCS\u2019s explanation that \u201cif any\u201d referred to the possibility that there would be no appeal rights if mediation was successful \u201cmakes no sense because it is obvious that a successful mediation would mean there would be no need for an appeal.\u201d The only reason for including language regarding appeal rights under these circumstances, reasoned the court, \u201cwas to clarify the parties\u2019 intention in the event there was an arbitration hearing and decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">In contrast, the district court found credible Prescott\u2019s explanation that she was concerned that the arbitration agreement stated that \u201carbitration will be the exclusive remedy for this dispute and ... we may not later litigate these matters in civil court\u201d without reference to the appeal rights available under the MUAA. And, the court disagreed with NCS\u2019s characterization of the parties\u2019 conduct, finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>it indicated only that they were aware that <em>some </em>ground for appeal was available, not necessarily that they would be entitled to plenary judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">NCS also cites Prescott\u2019s communications with the ICC prior to the mediation as evidence of her intent to gain plenary appeal rights, noting that she stated in a letter protesting the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction that she intended to participate, \u201creserving every right to exhaust every appeal.\u201d This proves nothing, however; a reading of the entire letter shows that Prescott\u2019s primary concern was her perception that the ICC was biased in favor of NCS. Her letter makes clear that she felt herself cheated out of a fair trial and considered the ICC a willing party in \u201cthis evil attempt to permanently damage my professional and personal integrity ... thus becoming a biased party supporting NCS in this action.\u201d Prescott also referred to the ICC as \u201ca biased party to this conspiracy to effectively strip away my guaranteed Constitutional rights.... \u201d The MUAA provides for vacatur of awards granted by a biased arbitrator.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The district court committed no error in determining that the parties did not intend to expand the scope of judicial review. The court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that Prescott intended only to preserve what rights she thought she had and that NCS intended to ensure that she did not gain any appeal rights to which she was not already entitled \u2014 is plausible. Even if the court had not credited Prescott\u2019s explanation that she wished only to preserve her rights under the MUAA and instead had credited NCS\u2019s explanation that Prescott wanted plenary appeal rights, NCS\u2019s insertion of the words \u201cif any\u201d effectively nullified any such effort on her part. Thus, when the words furnished by each party are construed against the writer,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and after noting that NCS made the final change to the language, it is logical to assume that, in the final revised draft of the arbitration agreement, the parties intended nothing more than to reiterate that the appeal rights enumerated in the MUAA \u2014 and only such appeal rights \u2014 would be available to them. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the parties did not expand the scope of review available to them under the MUAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">B. Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">After we remanded this case in <em>Prescott I </em>for an evidentiary hearing on the meaning of the contract\u2019s wording, NCS requested a jury trial on the interpretation of the contract. The district court denied this request, noting that motions to enforce or vacate an arbitration award carry no right to a trial by jury. On appeal, NCS asserts that the FAA permits parties to demand a jury trial to resolve factual issues surrounding the making of an arbitration agreement,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that this right should also apply to interpretation of an arbitration agreement as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Neither the FAA nor the MUAA provide for a jury trial under these circumstances. Unlike the FAA, the MUAA makes no explicit guarantee of a trial by jury at any stage of arbitration-related litigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As for the FAA, its \u00a7 4 allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for a jury trial only'to resolve fact issues surrounding \u201cthe <em>making </em>of an arbitration agreement\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and applies in proceedings to compel arbitration. Although the \u201cmaking of an arbitration of an agreement\u201d could be broadly construed to include any factual issue surrounding the writing of the arbitration agreement, we have not done so. In fact, we have explicitly interpreted \u00a7 4 to require that a party make \u201cat least some showing that under prevailing law, he would be relieved of his contractual obligation to arbitrate if his allegations proved to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The party must put the <em>existence </em>of the agreement to arbitrate itself at issue to create a jury-triable issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> NCS is not seeking a jury determination whether the parties contracted to arbitrate disputes; they clearly did. NCS seeks a jury determination only as to the meaning of particular words of the agreement that the parties acknowledge having made.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In contrast, neither \u00a7 10 of the FAA (the portion governing judicial review of an arbitration award) nor any other part of the FAA explicitly authorizes jury trials on issues of interpretation of other aspects of an arbitration agreement. Obviously, NCS\u2019s argument relates to the enforceability of the contract, an issue that we have expressly held not to be encompassed within \u00a7 4\u2019s jury trial provision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">NCS also contends that it is entitled to trial by jury by virtue of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38. But of course, Rule 38 only <em>preserves </em>the parties\u2019 right to jury trial in cases in which the right is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment or is provided by statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In determining whether a party enjoys a right to a trial by jury when the statute does not expressly grant one, we examine (1) the nature of the issues involved, comparing them to actions brought in 18th century England before the merger of law and equity, and (2) the nature of the remedy sought, whether legal or equitable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cIn the 18th century, an action to set aside an arbitration award was considered equitable.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And, even though NCS ultimately seeks vacatur of the arbitrator\u2019s award for damages, it seeks a jury trial only on the issue whether it contracted to expand the scope of review of the award, not the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>itself. NCS thus seeks only a declaration of its rights, not a legal award of damages. NCS enjoys neither a Seventh Amendment nor a statutory right to a trial by jury under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Finally, in our <em>Prescott I </em>remand for an evidentiary hearing, we only ordered the district court \u201cto take evidence on and contractually interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of the [review] <em>provision.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We did not order the district court to conduct a jury trial. The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining NCS\u2019s request for a jury trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">C. Motion to Vacate Award</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">As the district court did not clearly err in its determination that the parties did not intend to expand their right of judicial review, we must consider whether the district court properly denied NCS\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award under the narrow standard of review applicable to such an issue. NCS insists that the arbitrator\u2019s award must be vacated because (1) he erroneously concluded that NCS had breached its employment contract with Prescott and that she was entitled to damages \u2014 conclusions that NCS contends are in conflict with Louisiana law \u2014 (2) the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and (3) the arbitrator was biased against NCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqa\">We review a district court\u2019s confirmation or vacatur of an arbitration award <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court\u2019s scope of review of an award by the arbitrator, however, is extremely limited. Although the FAA would normally provide the grounds for vacatur, in this case the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement specifies that \u201c[t]his agreement is subject to arbitration pursuant to the Montana Arbitration Act, Title 27, Montana Code Annotated,\u201d which statement expresses the parties\u2019 binding agreement that Montana\u2019s <em>procedural </em>rules will govern the entire arbitration process, including the review of the award.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And, the Rules of the ICC do not purport to change the scope of judicial review of its arbitration decisions, stating that \u201c[t]he arbitration decision is final and cannot be reconsidered or appealed except as provided by Rule 41 and/or <em>civil law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As we noted in <em>Prescott I, </em>the MUAA provides substantially identical grounds to the FAA for vacatur by the district court:<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to wit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">(a) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>(b) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">(c) the arbitrators exceeded their powers;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The MUAA does not allow for judicial review of arbitration awards on the merits of the controversy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (As NCS has not argued that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law, we do not consider this ground for vacatur.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">2. Mis-interpretation of Louisiana Law</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">NCS dedicates the bulk of its appellate brief to demonstrating that the arbitrator misconstrued both Louisiana law and the contract between the parties. NCS contends that, under Louisiana law, it did not breach its contract with Prescott and therefore cannot be hable for damages. Arbitrators have the power to decide issues of fact and law under the MUAA<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and, as should be obvious, neither the MUAA nor the FAA permits either the district court or this court to review the merits of the controversy underlying this arbitration award.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We decline to consider NCS\u2019s attacks on the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">3. Exceeding the Powers of the Arbitrator</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">An arbitrator exceeds his powers when he acts outside the limits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>authority granted to him by the arbitration agreement, such as deciding issues that have not been submitted to him<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or acting contrary to express provisions of that agreement.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> As a general rule, the fact that the remedy ordered by an arbitrator is inconsistent with state law is not grounds for vacating an award.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">NCS argues that \u00a7 27-5-113 of the MUAA exempts employment agreements from the automatic application of many other portions of the code, including \u00a7 27-5-312(2), which states that the fact that an arbitrator has awarded damages that a court could or would not is not grounds for vacatur. Prescott responds that \u00a7 27-5-113 of the Montana Code refers only to labor agreements, as it is titled \u201cApplication to Labor Agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Neither party cites any case law in support of their arguments or stating the converse, that an arbitrator\u2019s award of damages inconsistent with state law <em>is </em>grounds for vacatur. As NCS\u2019s argument appears to be in conflict with established law, we decline to adopt this expansive construction of Montana\u2019s statute.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">NCS argues that the arbitrator also exceeded his powers by awarding on a matter not submitted for resolution and by awarding damages inconsistent with Louisiana law, despite the employment contract\u2019s provision requiring that Louisiana law govern the employment relationship. An award is sustainable against a challenge that the arbitrator has exceeded his power if the award can be \u201crationally inferred\u201d from the contract.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> That we may disagree with the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of both law and fact, including his determination of the kinds of damages allowed by the contract, is not a grounds for vacatur.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cTo draw its essence from the contract, an arbitrator\u2019s award must have a basis that is at least rationally inferable, if not obviously drawn, from the letter and purpose of the agreement. The award must, in some logical way, be derived from the wording or purpose of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">First, the statement of issues that the parties submitted to the ICC for resolution through conciliation included determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tions of, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) whether NCS wrongfully terminated Prescott; (2) what damages, if any, does NCS owe Prescott; and (3) how and when should damages be paid. The issues whether NCS breached Prescott\u2019s employment contract by wrongfully discharging her, as the arbitrator ultimately found, and what damages should be awarded for that reason, were plainly placed before the arbitrator by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Second, the arbitrator\u2019s award of damages is not contrary to express contractual provisions. In contending that the award is contrary to the contract, NCS argues that, because the parties included a Louisiana choice-of-law provision in the employment contract, they agreed to have their employment relationship governed by Louisiana law. Therefore, reasons NCS, the arbitrator was limited to awarding damages that would be available under Louisiana law.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The narrow scope of our review limits us to inquiring whether an award is rationally derived from the parties\u2019 contract, or whether it is contrary to express contractual provisions.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, we must examine first whether the parties contracted to restrict arbitration awards to damages ordered by a court of law applying the substantive law of Louisiana. Neither the employment contract nor the arbitration agreement specifically mention, or limit, the kind of damages that may be awarded in the arbitration proceedings. Both agreements do, however, express the parties\u2019 intention to abide by the Rules of the ICC, which specify that arbitrators may award</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">any remedy or relief that they deem scriptural, just and equitable, and within the scope of the agreement of the parties, including, but not limited to, specific performance of a contract. In making their decisions, the arbitrators shall consider, but are not limited by, the remedies requested by the parties.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agm\">We hold that the contract\u2019s silence on limitations of damages, when contrasted with the Rules\u2019 express, broad provision for any manner of damages the arbitrator deems acceptable, demonstrates that the arbitrator\u2019s award of damages, even if not avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>able under substantive Louisiana state law, was not expressly contrary to the parties\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The arbitrator\u2019s award is also rationally derived from the employment agreement. That contract does not state broadly that Louisiana law will govern every aspect of the employment relationship between the parties, only that \u201c[t]his contract shall be interpreted under the laws of the state of Louisiana as if jointly authored by the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">More importantly, the employment contract states the overarching principle that the parties will be governed by biblical provisions, both in the substantive terms of their employment relationship and in their arbitration and mediation proceedings. Specifically, employees are required to affirm that (1) they are \u201cBorn Again\u201d Christians, (2) they have a sense of God\u2019s will and that their presence at NCS is at God\u2019s direction, (3) they will manifest the highest Christian virtue and personal decorum in and out of school, and (4) they will attend and financially support a local church with fundamental beliefs that are in agreement with the doctrinal statement of Northlake Christian School. Furthermore, each employee promised to abide by the precepts of Matthew 18: 15-17 and Galatians 6:1, and to resolve all differences, including those not submitted to arbitration, according to biblical principles. This is the provision of the contract that the arbitrator held NCS to have violated, and this is the violation for which the arbitrator assessed damages against NCS.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The parties thus evinced a clear desire to incorporate biblical provisions into their everyday employment dealings. Whether such a contract is sustainable under Louisiana law is not a question for this court: The parties freely and knowingly contracted to have their relationship governed by specified provisions of the Bible and the Rules of the ICC, and the arbitrator\u2019s determination that NCS had not acted according to the dictates of Matthew 18 relates to that contract. Further, the Rules of the ICC indisputably contemplate that an arbitrator will have extremely broad discretion to fashion an appropriate remedy; and no language in the parties\u2019 contracts expresses their intent to depart from the Rules of the ICC. We hold that the arbitrator\u2019s award of damages is rationally derived from Prescott\u2019s employment contract with NCS and not contrary to any express contractual provisions, either biblical or secular. Consequently, NCS is not entitled to vacatur of the arbitrator\u2019s decision on this ground and the district court\u2019s order enforcing the arbitration award cannot be vacated for the reasons asserted by NCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">4. Misconduct by Arbitrator</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">Finally, NCS asserts that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>participated in <em>ex parte </em>communications with Prescott\u2019s counsel, neglected to hear material evidence pertinent to the controversy, and refused <em>to </em>disclose circumstances likely to affect partiality. NCS contends further that, under either the FAA or the MUAA, the district court had the power and duty to vacate the arbitration award because of the arbitrator\u2019s apparent bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">NCS includes only two sentences on this argument in its brief, electing instead to direct our attention to documents that it filed in the district court, which documents NCS purports to adopt by reference in its brief. But, an appellant must include the substance of its arguments in the body of its brief: We will not consider arguments presented only in earlier filings.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As we do not consider arguments that are not adequately briefed to us,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> we decline to entertain NCS\u2019s assertions on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The district court did not clearly err in deciding to credit Prescott\u2019s version of events over that of NCS and, accordingly, to hold that the parties did not expand the scope of judicial review over the arbitration award. Neither did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to order a jury trial to ascertain the meaning of the party\u2019s hand-written addenda to their arbitration agreement, because, as a matter of law, NCS was not entitled to demand a jury trial on this or any other issue, save only the making of the contract which was not questioned. The district court correctly determined that NCS had not demonstrated entitlement to vacatur of the arbitration award on any of the narrow grounds on which a court of law may vacate such an award. The district court\u2019s order enforcing Prescott\u2019s arbitration award is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

In <em>Mastrobuono, </em>the parties' contract included a New York choice of law provision in addition to an arbitration provision, stating that arbitration proceedings would be governed by the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\u201d). 514 U.S. at 58-59, 115 S.Ct. 1212. Although the NASD rules allowed arbitrators to award \u201cdamages\u201d without reference to punitive damages, New York case law forbade arbitrators from awarding punitive damages, even though punitive damages might be awarded by a New York state court, and the parties\u2019 contract itself was silent on the subject. <em>Id. </em>at 61, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The Court based its decision on an inquiry into whether the parties intended to exclude or include punitive damages from arbitration proceedings, eventually concluding that punitive damages were permissible \u2014 stating that \"if contracting parties agree to <em>include </em>claims for punitive damages within the issues to be arbitrated, the FAA ensures that their agreement will be enforced according to its terms even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 64, 115 S.Ct. 1212. Although this case differs slightly, in that NCS does not argue that Louisiana law purports to limit the kinds of damages available in <em>arbitration </em>proceedings, the Court made clear that the relevant inquiry was whether the parties intended to exclude punitive damages from consideration in arbitration proceedings, not whether such damages were available under state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. <em>Terra W.

This argument is specious: In <em>Prescott I, </em>we inquired only \u201cwhich state's law governs <em>the interpretation of the arbitration contract\" </em>and decided that, consistent with the above-cited contractual language, Louisiana law governed the interpretation of the contract\u2019s language. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">.
