Edwards and Paula E. Nick-ens appeal the district court\u2019s orders granting their former employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying their motion for reconsideration in their civil action in which they alleged employment discrimination and retaliation claims. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The court\u2019s order that granted summary judgment in favor of the employer was entered on the court\u2019s docket on March 8, 2004. Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), the Appellants had thirty days in which to appeal that order. Even if the Appellants were not aware of the court\u2019s final order until October 29, 2004, they never moved for reopening of the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Further, even had the Appellants explicitly requested reopening under Rule 4(a)(6)(A), the district court would have been unable to do so because the Appellants could not satisfy the time limits set forth in that subsection. Therefore, their notice of appeal filed in the district court on February 18, 2005, was untimely as to the court\u2019s order entered on March 8, 2004. We therefore dismiss the appeal as untimely as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The notice of appeal is timely as to the court\u2019s January 26, 2005 order that denied the Appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error as to the court\u2019s denial of that motion. Accordingly, we affirm that order substantially on the reasoning stated by the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Edwards v. Roberts-Roberts Assoc., LLC, </em>No. CA-02-4078-8-AW (D. Md. filed Jan. 26, 2005 &amp; entered Jan. 27, 2005). We deny the Appellants\u2019 motion to strike the Appellee\u2019s brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> We disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis that its local rule rendered Appellants' motion to reconsider untimely. The local rule provides: \"Except as otherwise provided in Fed. R.Civ.P. 60, any motion to reconsider any order issued by the Court shall be filed with the Clerk not later than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d Local Rule 105(10) (D.Md.2004). Rule 60(b) provides .\"[t]he motion shall be made within a reasonable time\u201d and for limited reasons \"not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d Nevertheless, we conclude that the Appellants were not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
