On appeal, Maxwell argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized during a traffic stop and the resulting search of his car because they were conducted without probable cause. He further argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the firearm conviction because there was insufficient evidence that he used the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug trafficking offenses. Finally, Maxwell argues for the first time in his reply brief that the district court erred when it sentenced him in accordance with the federal sentencing guidelines in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">I. The Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Maxwell argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the physical evidence obtained from the traffic stop and the resulting search of his car because the officers had no reasonable suspicion upon which to base the stop. He asserts that the seatbelt violation was \u201cmanufactured\u201d to justify a traffic stop based on his race and his presence in a neighborhood known for its drug activity. Maxwell also contends that the officers had neither a reasonable, articulable suspicion, nor consent, to detain him for longer than was necessary to write the citation. In response, the government argues that Officer Jones had probable cause to effectuate a traffic stop because he observed\u2014 albeit mistakenly \u2014 Maxwell not wearing his seatbelt. Regarding the duration of the stop, the government argues that the stop was reasonably prolonged once Officer Jones learned that Maxwell had a concealed and loaded weapon underneath the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact to be true, unless it is shown to be clearly erroneous, and review the district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>These factual findings include the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, to which we will \u201caccord considerable deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (internal citation and quotation omitted). \u201c[A]ll facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe individual challenging the search has the burdens of proof and persuasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>133 F.3d 1394, 1398 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">A. The Legality of the Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by government officials, and its protections extend to \u201cbrief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). For brief investigatory stops, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the police officer has a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). When determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, courts must consider the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the circumstances to determine whether the police officer had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspected legal wrongdoing. <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744 (citation omitted). In so doing, \u201cthe reviewing court must give due weight to the police officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>United States v. Briggman, </em>931 F.2d 705, 709 (11th Cir.1991). A decision to stop a vehicle is also reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where an officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>172 F.3d 775, 778 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The seminal case on the legality of traffic stops is <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 819, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), in which the Supreme Court declined to deviate from \u201cthe traditional common-law rule that probable cause justifies a search and seizure.\u201d In other words, regardless of the officer\u2019s subjective intent at the time the traffic stop is made, as long as he has \u201cprobable cause to believe that [the defendant has] violated the traffic code,\u201d the stop will be reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We conclude that Officer Jones was responding to a valid \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d call when he stopped Maxwell, based on another officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot and his knowledge of the neighborhood\u2019s history of drug activity. Accordingly, the call was legal justification for a brief investigatory stop under <em>Terry. </em>Notwithstanding the call, however, Officer Jones also believed that Maxwell was in violation of a Georgia traffic law, thus giving him another basis to effectuate a legal stop. Even though Officer Jones later admitted at trial that his belief that Maxwell was not wearing his seatbelt was \u201cmistaken,\u201d such a mistake of fact will not vitiate probable cause to support the traffic stop. Thus, because Officer Jones was responding to a valid \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d call, and also observed what he thought at the time to be a seatbelt law violation, he had probable cause to effectuate the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">B. The Duration of the Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">We have held that, \u201c[u]nder <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>an officer\u2019s investigation of a traffic stop must be \u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1106 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The stop must be of \u201climited duration,\u201d and may not last \u201cany longer than necessary to process the traffic violation unless there is articulable suspicion of other illegal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The duration of the traffic stop \u201cmust be limited to the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001). However, where the initial traffic stop is legal, the officer has \u201cthe duty to investigate suspicious circumstances that then [come] to his attention.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>928 F.2d 1113, 1117 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">We conclude that the investigation was reasonably related in scope and duration to the circumstances that led to the stop. <em>See Boyce, </em>351 F.3d at 1106. While he wrote out the traffic citation, Officer Jones asked Maxwell whether he had any guns in the car in order to ensure his safety. Maxwell informed Officer Jones of his gun, which led to the brief search of his car. Because the investigation arose out of a valid traffic stop, the investigation into the gun and the subsequent, brief detention were valid. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because both the stop and the detention were both reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Maxwell\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>II. The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Maxwell next contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the firearms charge because there was insufficient evidence that he used the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug trafficking offenses. He notes that the evidence revealed that the gun was located well beneath the driver\u2019s seat of his car and that there was no evidence that he took the gun out of the car to use it in connection with obtaining the drugs. In response, the government argues that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Maxwell\u2019s conviction because the firearm\u2019s proximity to the drugs was not merely coincidental and unrelated to the offense. Because Maxwell was arrested while transporting both the drugs and the gun, the government argues it was reasonable for the jury to infer that Maxwell used the gun for his protection while he obtained and moved the drugs and once he reached his destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We review the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. See United States v. Bowman, </em>302 F.3d 1228, 1237 (11th Cir.2002). If the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, then the motion was properly denied. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. We will not overturn a jury verdict \u201cso long as a reasonable juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used these weapons in connection with the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1393 (11th Cir.1989) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Section 924(c) provides in relevant part that an individual who, \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ..., uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">As an initial matter, we have held that possession with intent to distribute drugs qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>889 F.2d 1029, 1030 (11th Cir.1989). Furthermore, Maxwell concedes that there was sufficient evidence to prove the \u201ccarrying\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c). Therefore, the remaining issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to prove that the firearm found in Maxwell\u2019s car was used \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">To establish use of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug trafficking crime for purposes of \u00a7 924(c), the government need not prove that the defendant \u201cfired, brandished, or even displayed\u201d the gun during the drug trafficking offense; \u201chowever, ... the mere presence of a firearm [will] not constitute use within the meaning of section 924(c)(1).\u201d <em>Poole, </em>878 F.2d at 1393. \u201cRather, possession of a firearm constitutes use in relation to the drug trafficking offense if the possession is an integral part of, and facilitates the commission of, the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cthe presence of weapons in a location defendant used to distribute a significant quantity of illegal drugs is sufficient to submit to the jury the issue of whether defendant used the firearms in connection with a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">For example, in <em>Poole, </em>878 F.2d at 1393-94, when considering whether the defen- . dant had used the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug offense, we noted that the evidence supported the inferences that \u201c[the defendant] was engaged in selling cocaine; the guns were used to protect the house members and the cocaine; and [the defendant] knew the guns were readily accessible.\u201d Accordingly, we held that a reasonable jury could have found that the defendant used the guns during and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>relation to her cocaine trafficking. <em>Id. </em>(noting that while the evidence was \u201cfar from overwhelming,\u201d it was sufficient in light of our deferential treatment of jury verdicts).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Here, the testimony that Maxwell was in possession of large amounts of cocaine, BZP, and TFMPP supports the inference that he possessed those drugs with the intent to distribute them. Also, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the loaded gun, which was discovered under Maxwell\u2019s seat and in close proximity to the drugs on the backseat, was \u201creadily accessible.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Likewise, the jury could have concluded that Maxwell\u2019s intention was to use the gun, if necessary, to protect the drugs and himself while he transported them. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the evidence was sufficient, even if not overwhelming, to support Maxwell\u2019s conviction for a violation of \u00a7 924(c). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Maxwell\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">III. The <em>Booker </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In his reply brief, Maxwell argues for the first time that his sentence should be vacated in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maxwell notes that the district court expressed at his sentencing that the guidelines\u2019 penalties for his drug offenses were \u201cpretty stiff.\u201d He urges us to remand for re-sentencing in light of the district court\u2019s comments and in fight of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">We have consistently held that an issue not raised in an party\u2019s initial appellate brief is considered waived, and the party is prohibited from raising the issue later in the appeal. <em>See United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041-42 (11th Cir.2004) (refusing to consider a claim under <em>Blakely </em>first raised in a letter submitted pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j)); <em>United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004) (refusing to consider a <em>Blakely </em>claim first raised in a petition for rehearing). Accordingly, because Maxwell raises this <em>Booker </em>issue for the first time in his reply brief, he has waived the argument and may not raise it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Maxwell\u2019s convictions on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\">. In his reply brief, Maxwell asserts that <em>Booker </em>was not available to him when he filed his initial appellate brief. His initial brief, however, was date-stamped January 19, 2005, and the <em>Booker </em>opinion was released January 12, 2005. Moreover, Maxwell did not make reference in his initial brief to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) or <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), both of which are predecessor cases to <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
