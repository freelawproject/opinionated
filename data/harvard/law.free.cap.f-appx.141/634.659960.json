Lincoln seeks to suppress the evidence and statements as the fruit of violations of the Fourth Amendment and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-21\">I. <em>TERRY </em>STOP AND FRISK</p>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">Officers had reasonable suspicion to detain Lincoln briefly and frisk him for weapons. Officers knew specific, articulable facts that provided a reasonable basis to infer that Lincoln was engaged in criminal activity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Michael R., </em>90 F.3d 340, 345 (9th Cir.1996) (stating standard). Officers responded to a 911 call in which Lincoln\u2019s girlfriend complained that the two had been fighting and Lincoln was selling drugs. Officer Hokenson also had been called to Lincoln\u2019s trailer the night before for a similar do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>mestie disturbance. When the officers arrived, Lincoln was letting the air out of a van\u2019s tires in the middle of the night. Finally, the officers knew that drug dealers often carry guns and that domestic disturbances often escalate into violent situations. These facts gave rise to reasonable suspicion for the <em>Terry </em>stop and the subsequent frisk for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">During the frisk, when Officer Clark felt a hard, cylindrical object that he thought could be a pocket knife, he was permitted to remove the object to assure himself that it was not a weapon. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mattarolo, </em>209 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>597 F.2d 187, 191 (9th Cir.1979). His questions about its contents did not constitute a search or manipulation of the object.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Compare Muehler v. Mena, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 1471-72, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005), <em>with Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 378-79, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">II. REMAINING CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Lincoln\u2019s remaining challenges also fail. First, the district judge did not clearly err in his conclusion that the physical evidence would have been inevitably discovered. Second, the physical evidence would have been admissible even if there had been a violation of Lincoln\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See United States v. Patane, </em>542 U.S. 630, 124 S.Ct. 2620, 2630-31, 159 L.Ed.2d 667 (2004) (plurality opinion) (concluding that <em>Miranda </em>does not require suppression of physical evidence discovered as fruit of a defendant\u2019s unwarned, yet voluntary, statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Finally, the district judge properly denied the suppression of the statements that Lincoln made on the way to the station. Lincoln\u2019s statement that he \u201conly sells drugs because of [his girlfriend]\u201d was spontaneous and not made in response to custodial interrogation. Officer Clark\u2019s statements to Lincoln were not \u201c \u2018reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from\u2019 \u201d Lincoln. <em>United States v. Orso, </em>266 F.3d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (quoting <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-14\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\">. Because articulable suspicion permitted the officers to frisk Lincoln without his consent, we need not address Lincoln\u2019s contention that his consent to the search was not voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\">. Unlike the dissent, the majority of the panel concludes that this case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Miles, </em>247 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2001), because Officer Clark did not know whether the object was a weapon when he removed it from Lincoln's pocket. His inquiry did not extend the detention and thus was permissible under <em>Muehler, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1471.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b664-14\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AO5\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">I respectfully dissent, because the majority\u2019s holding in this case conflicts with our ruling in <em>United States v. Miles, </em>247 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">The validity of the seizure of evidence in this case is inextricably intertwined with the validity of the patdown conducted pursuant to <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). As we recognized in <em>Miles, </em>\u201cthe purpose of a <em>Terry </em>stop is to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>247 F.3d at 1012 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If the stop exceeds a brief restraint and check for weapons, an arrest occurs, requiring probable cause. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>If during a <em>Terry </em>patdown, the officer feels an object that he recognizes immediately as contraband, that tactile recognition may constitute probable cause. <em>See id. </em>at 1013. However, if the object is not immediately recognized as contraband and is not a weapon, any further inquiry is \u201cnot authorized by <em>Terry. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>Miles, </em>the officer felt a box in the suspect\u2019s pocket, \u201cone-half the size of a package of cigarettes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We ruled that the \u201csmall box ... could not possibly be a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that because the officer did not \u201cimmediately recognize the box as contraband\u201d and it clearly was not a weapon, \u201cthe officer\u2019s further manipulation of the box was impermissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In this case, the officer removed from the defendant\u2019s pocket a small cannister of the type normally containing 35mm film. The officer did not consider the cannister to be a weapon and could not readily recognize the cannister as contraband. At that point, as in <em>Miles, </em>any <em>Terry </em>justification ended. At that point, further investigation required probable cause, of which there was none. In my view, this case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Miles, </em>where we held that \u201cofficers cannot leverage the safety rationale into a justification for a full-scale search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
