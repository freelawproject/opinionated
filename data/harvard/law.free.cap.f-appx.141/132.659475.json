As the IJ and Board concluded that the asylum application was untimely, we find that consideration of Sudpto\u2019s asylum claim is barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Sucipto also challenges the finding that he failed to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Sucipto fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> Sucipto also seeks review of the Board's order of March 8, 2005, denying his motion to reopen. He has not, however, presented any claims to the court regarding this order. Likewise, he has not challenged the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
