On appeal, appellant challenges the validity of his underlying sentence, contending that the district court exceeded its authority when it revoked appellant\u2019s probation because it was without authority to impose a term of supervised release in the first place. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-26\"><em>United States v. Simmons </em>makes clear that an underlying conviction may not be collaterally attacked on direct appeal from a district court order revoking probation, emphasizing that \u201ca court should consider the petition for probation revocation as if the underlying conviction was unquestioned.\u201d 812 F.2d 561, 563 (9th Cir.1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In so doing, <em>Simmons </em>also establishes that the district court necessarily had jurisdiction to consider a petition for revocation of probation as long as the underlying conviction has not been set aside. Id (citing <em>United States v. Francischine, </em>512 F.2d 827, 828-29 (5th Cir.1975)). The same holds true for Ruiz-Camarena\u2019s challenge to the validity of his underlying sentence. <em>United States v. Gerace, </em>997 F.2d <em>1293, </em>1295 (9th Cir.1993) (dismissing appellant\u2019s contention, in the context of a direct appeal from a probation revocation order, that the original sentencing court lacked authority to impose the modified sentence that it did, holding that \u201c[a]n appeal challenging a probation revocation proceeding is not the proper avenue through which to attack the validity of the original sentence\u201d) (citing <em>Simmons, </em>812 F.2d at 563). The proper method of challenging RuizCamarena\u2019s underlying sentence is not on direct appeal from a probation revocation order, but on collateral review of the underlying sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant\u2019s collateral challenge to his sentence is therefore not cognizable on this appeal. <em>Gerace, </em>997 F.2d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
