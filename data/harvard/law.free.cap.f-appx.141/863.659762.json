Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See McGhee v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2287, 161 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2005). We previously affirmed McGhee\u2019s conviction and 87-month sentence for possession of five or more grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(C). <em>United States v. McGhee, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 975 (11th Cir. 2004). After review, we conclude that McGhee\u2019s failure to timely raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence precludes him from doing so on remand. Accordingly, we reinstate our prior opinion and again affirm McGhee\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">A four-count indictment charged McGhee with: (i) possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (\u201cCount One\u201d); (ii) possession of five or more grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (\u201cCount Two\u201d); (in) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (\u201cCount Three\u201d); and (iv) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a federal drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (\u201cCount Four\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The case proceeded to trial, where McGhee voluntarily testified, denying knowledge of or involvement with the charged drug sales. Following the close of evidence, the district court granted McGhee\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal of Count Four. The jury then found McGhee not guilty of Count One, but returned guilty verdicts on Counts Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u00abPSi\u201d) caicu]ated a base level of 26, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1, then added: (i) a two level firearm possession enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); and (ii) an additional two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice, based on McGhee\u2019s denial of the charged drug sales at trial. With a total resulting offense level of 30 and a Criminal History Category I, the PSI\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 97 to 121 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">McGhee filed several objections to the PSI, including objections to the firearm enhancement and the obstruction of justice enhancement. However, none of McGhee\u2019s objections raised constitutional errors in sentencing, nor so much as mentioned McGhee\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any case extending <em>Apprendi. </em>The district court sustained McGhee\u2019s firearm objection and overruled his objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement, for a resulting offense level of 28 and a sentencing range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed an 87-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Though McGhee\u2019s initial brief on direct appeal raised several points of error concerning his conviction, his only contention regarding his sentence focused on the obstruction of justice enhancement, which McGhee argued was inappropriate given the district court\u2019s failure to make sufficiently specific factual findings. As such, McGhee\u2019s initial brief made no argument that it was inappropriate for the judge to make such factual findings, nor did his brief raise his constitutional jury trial rights, the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, or any other argument implicating what became <em>Booker. </em>While McGhee later moved for permission to file a supplemental brief addressing Sixth Amendment issues, that motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">We affirmed McGhee\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>McGhee, </em>125 Fed Appx. 975. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>McGhee then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. On May 16, 2005, the Supreme Court granted that petition, vacating our opinion and remanding the case for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">McGhee contends that his objection to the district court\u2019s enhancement for obstruction of justice, along with his contentions on direct appeal concerning that enhancement, have preserved the <em>Booker </em>issue for our review. The record does not support this argument. As discussed above, McGhee\u2019s PSI objection argued that the enhancement for obstructing justice was improper because as an issue of fact McGhee did not falsely testify at trial. Likewise, McGhee\u2019s obstruction-of-justice arguments on appeal focused on the specificity of the district court\u2019s factual findings, not on the constitutionality of those factual findings. Because McGhee made no constitutional Booker-type arguments concerning the obstruction of justice enhancement before the district court or in his initial brief on appeal, we reject his contention that he has preserved the <em>Booker </em>issue for review. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant\u2019s non-constitutional sentencing objection failed to preserve <em>Booker </em>error, where that objection made no reference to the Sixth Amendment, the role of judge as fact-finder, the right to jury determination of disputed facts, or the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">To the contrary, McGhee\u2019s failure to timely raise any <em>Booker-type </em>constitutional challenge to his sentence in the district court or in his initial brief on appeal precludes us from now considering the issue. Our precedent dictates that issues not timely raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2542, 162 L.Ed.2d 272 (2005), <em>judgment reinstated by United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2005). Prior precedent similarly holds that neither the procedural posture of this case, nor the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions on remand, permit any variance from the prudential <em>Levy </em>rule. <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001) (stating after a remand from the Supreme Court that \u201cwe apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs [prior to Supreme Court remand] are deemed abandoned\u201d); <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to consider <em>Booker </em>where it was not raised in appellant\u2019s initial brief, notwithstanding Supreme Court remand for consideration in light of <em>Booker).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Our opinion affirming McGhee\u2019s conviction and sentence is accordingly REINSTATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
