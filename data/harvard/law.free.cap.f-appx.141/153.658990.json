Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2005), the immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Getachew challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that she failed to meet her burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted). We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Getachew failed to establish past persecution or the well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We decline to address Getachew\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s credibility determination, as she failed to raise the claim before the Board to satisfy the exhaustion requirement of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000). <em>See Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005). Getachew does not challenge the ruling of the immigration judge, as affirmed by the Board, on her applications for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
