Destruction of petitioner\u2019s legal materials, the warden\u2019s delay in verifying that prison officials had destroyed them, the California Supreme Court\u2019s erroneous statement that it had not received any filings from petitioner and its failure to respond to petitioner\u2019s request for clarification constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d sufficient to justify equitable tolling until petitioner received the warden\u2019s declaration. <em>See Lott v. Mueller, </em>304 F.3d 918, 924 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Corjasso v. Ayers, </em>278 F.3d 874, 878 (9th Cir.2002). The warden\u2019s declaration confirmed that \u201cthe loss of [petitioner\u2019s] original Petition by the searching correctional officers ha[d] hindered his access to the courts.\u201d Petitioner could reasonably have believed that his own declaration would be insufficient to establish the destruction of the documents, and that the warden would be unwilling to provide confirmation once petitioner filed his federal habeas petition. After receiving the warden\u2019s declaration, petitioner filed his federal petition within five weeks, much less than the time he had left under AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the time his legal materials were destroyed. The petition was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">2. We construe the uncertified issue briefed on appeal as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e). We conclude that there has been no substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, and therefore deny the motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
