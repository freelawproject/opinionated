The statute prohibits <em>\u201cforcible assault\u201d </em>on certain federal officers. <em>United States v. Abraham, </em>627 F.2d 205, 206 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (emphasis added). It does not restrict protected speech in the form of purely verbal, non-threatening opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-29\">We conclude the statute is not vague because \u201ca reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would understand what conduct the statute prohibits.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>183 F.3d 1029, 1032 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Abraham, </em>627 F.2d at 206 (\u201cThe language of section 111 is not ambiguous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>On de novo review, we conclude there was no outrageous government conduct: the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion and was reasonable under the circumstances; Border Patrol Agents Oropeza and Stewart justifiably used deadly force to protect themselves; the interrogation in the hospital was justified based on the officers\u2019 concerns that other people may have been wounded in the shooting and in need of medical care; and the violations of Border Patrol regulations, if there were any, did not demonstrate outrageous conduct in a constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Lastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise its supervisory powers to dismiss Reyes-Lopez\u2019s indictment as a sanction for official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b561-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
