LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b768-26\">This case is before us on direct criminal appeal of a sentence imposed after defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>dant Douglas Lee McDonald\u2019s plea of guilty to bank fraud. McDonald argues both that his sentence was incorrectly calculated and that it violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); he contends, and the government concedes, that the amount of intended loss was incorrectly calculated because $2300 was double-counted, resulting in an increase to the adjusted offense level of two levels and a sentence that was sixteen months higher than that authorized absent the error. McDonald also contends that judicial factfinding on the amount of intended loss as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under the Guidelines violated <em>Booker. </em>Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we REVERSE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">McDonald pled guilty to a one-count indictment for bank fraud which alleged that McDonald deposited a $5000 check drawn on a non-existing account, and subsequently withdrew $2300 from that account. The court also considered as relevant conduct McDonald\u2019s having convinced his mother and stepfather to write fraudulent checks and loan his bail agent $250,000. As part of its \u201crelevant conduct\u201d calculation, the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) added both the $5000 deposit and the subsequent $2300 withdrawal from that $5000 deposit to the $394,730.60 calculated as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H), which increased the total amount of intended loss to over $400,000. Because the double-counting of the $2300 resulted in an increase of the total intended loss to over $400,000, the applicable total adjusted offense level increased by two levels resulting in an applicable Guideline range of 70-87 months, as opposed to a range of 57-71 months without the error. The district court sentenced McDonald to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence sixteen months higher than that authorized by the correct Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">McDonald contends that both the erroneous double-counting, and judicial fact-finding on the amount of intended loss under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H) which he argues is prohibited under <em>Booker, </em>are plain error requiring remand for resentencing. The government concedes that the double-counting error requires remand, but argues that because this error requires remand for resentencing we need not address the <em>Booker </em>error alleged by McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">McDonald failed to raise below the issue of the district court\u2019s double-counting of the $2300 under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). Thus, our review is limited to plain error. Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(b). Plain error is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights of a defendant, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public perception of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467,117 S. Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). We have long held that \u201cbasing a sentence on the wrong Guideline range constitutes a fundamental error affecting substantial rights within the meaning of Rule 52(b),\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>919 F.2d 123, 124 (10th Cir.1990), \u201cif there is more than a reasonable probability that such misapplication led to a higher sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>413 F.3d 1146, 1154 (10th Cir.2005). In this case, the double-counting increased the adjusted offense level by two levels and resulted in the district court\u2019s adjudging a sentence that was 16 months higher than that authorized by the correct Guideline range. Accordingly, there is more than a reasonable probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>that the district court\u2019s error led to a higher sentence, and we REVERSE and REMAND for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-15\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant, to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>dent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-17\">. Because we conclude that the court committed plain error in basing its sentence on the incorrect Guideline range, and remand for resentencing, we do not address McDonald's <em>Booker </em>argument as his resentencing will occur in the new discretionary sentencing regime applicable <em>post-Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
