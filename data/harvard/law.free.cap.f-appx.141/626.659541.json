The sole ground raised on appeal is ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Although we generally do not review such claims on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Vgeri, </em>51 F.3d 876, 882 (9th Cir.1995), the claim here fits into a recognized exception because \u201cthe record is sufficiently developed to permit the reviewing court to resolve the issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Daly, </em>974 F.2d 1215, 1218 (9th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Llantada-Garcia was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201c[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d). The jury heard evidence that a police informant set up a drug purchase from Llantada-Garcia, and that Llantada-Garcia was arrested at the drug purchase delivery location with the methamphetamine in his car. There is no \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s [allegedly] unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
