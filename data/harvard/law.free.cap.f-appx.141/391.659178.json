Robichaux is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Robichaux was not entitled to summary judgment in his favor because he did not show the absence of evidence to support the defendants\u2019 case. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-27, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Nor did Robichaux satisfy his summary-judgment burden of showing the existence of a genuine factual dispute material to the issue of prison conditions such that the defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motion should have been denied. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250; 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the district court\u2019s determination that Robichaux\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith was correct. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Because Robichaux has failed to show that he has a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Robichaux\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
