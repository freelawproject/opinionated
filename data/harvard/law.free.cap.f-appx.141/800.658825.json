No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-29\">Rivero was found guilty of, among other things, using and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and being a felon in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At the initial sentencing, Rivero objected to his classification as a career offender because his predicate offenses were not \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d The district court overruled this objection. We vacated Rivero\u2019s \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction and remanded for resentencing; but we wrote that the district court properly classified Rivero as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1238 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">At resentencing, Rivero raised no new objections. The district court determined that Rivero\u2019s offense level was 37 and that his criminal history category was VI, resulting in a sentencing range of 360 months to life. Rivero asked only that he be sentenced at the low end of the guideline range. The district court then sentenced Rivero to a 420-month total sentence: 360-month concurrent sentences for two drug trafficking convictions, a 240-month concurrent sentence for a drug-related firearms offense, and a 60-month consecutive sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">After the district court imposed sentence, Rivero asked that the 60-month consecutive \u00a7 924(c) sentence be run concurrently with the other sentences. Rivero noted that \u201ceven though he scores as a career offender, that is extremely Draconian, and is essentially akin to a life sentence, and is not warranted based upon the facts in this case.\u201d The district court overruled Rivero\u2019s objection, concluding that \u00a7 924(c) required that the 60-month sentence run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Rivero argues that the district court erred by not awarding him a downward departure, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the overrepresentation of his criminal history. He contends that the district court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s requirement of a consecutive sentence is evidence that the district court felt that it did not have the authority to depart downward from the 360-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">We \u201cgenerally may not review the merits of a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure\u201d; but we \u201cmay conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a defendant\u2019s claim that the district court mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to grant such a departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Mignott, </em>184 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">We reject Rivero\u2019s argument. At resentencing, Rivero did not request a downward departure based on overrepresentation of his criminal history: he did not mention \u00a7 4A1.3 and only challenged the court\u2019s imposition of the consecutive \u00a7 924(c) sentence. Rivero failed to put the district court on notice that he was requesting a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Dennis, </em>786 F.2d 1029, 1042 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that to preserve issue for appellate consideration, defendant must lodge more than a general objection or an objection on other grounds). Rivero also provides no basis for us to conclude that the district court committed error in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>consider a downward departure based on \u00a7 4A1.3. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) (requiring a court to notify the parties before departing on a previously unidentified ground); <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2186 &amp; n. 4, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (noting that Rule 32 applies to downward departures and that <em>sua sponte </em>departures occur only in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">And even had Rivero filed a motion for a downward departure, we would be unable to review the denial of that request. Rivero has presented no evidence that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward based on alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>criminal history overrepresentation. <em>See United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1255 (11th Cir.2001) (where no indication that district court misapprehended its authority, we assume that sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward). The sentence was lawful and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
