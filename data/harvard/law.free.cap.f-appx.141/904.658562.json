Accordingly, Chin\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Chin was born in 1982 in Fuzhou City, China. She testified that in April 2001, her parents borrowed approximately $10,000 from a local official in order to open a business. The business failed, and Chin\u2019s parents were unable to repay the debt. Chin testified that the official offered to forgive the debt if Chin married his son. Chin objected to the proposal, both because she did not want to be a \u201cpiece of merchandise\u201d and because the official\u2019s son was \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d Despite Chin\u2019s objections, her parents accepted the official\u2019s offer and arranged the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">In April 2002, Chin ran away from her parents to the home of another relative. After about a week, her mother, accompanied by four village cadres, came and took her home. Chin ran away again in June 2002, this time to her sister\u2019s home in Fuzcheng City. She stayed there for about two weeks, until her mother sent the cadres to take her home again.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Chin ran away to the city of Quanzhou in September 2002. She rented a room and found work with the help of a smuggler, known as a \u201csnakehead.\u201d She remained in Quanzhou for three months. She testified that her parents borrowed $25,000 to pay half of the snakehead\u2019s fee for smuggling Chin to the United States, and that the remainder of the fee would be paid over time, in part from monies that Chin earned working in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Upon leaving Quanzhou, Chin traveled first to Thailand. She stayed in Thailand for about three months, then flew to Nepal, where she stayed for a week. From Nepal, she flew to India, where she stayed for another week before flying to Germany, changing planes and heading to Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Once in Atlanta, Chin attempted to enter the United States under a visa waiver pilot program using a Singapore passport that was not her own. When immigration authorities in Atlanta questioned Chin about the passport, she admitted that she was a resident of China and stated that she wished to file for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">On April 24, 2008, Chin submitted her application for asylum and withholding of removal, citing past persecution and a fear of future persecution by local officials on account of her political opinion against arranged marriages. At her hearing, Chin argued that the local officials had persecuted her by attempting to force her into an arranged marriage and by returning her to her family when she ran away. She also claimed that she feared future persecution because her family owed a substantial amount of money and she thought she might be forced to go through with the arranged marriage. Finally, she claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>that she would face torture if returned to China because she left the country illegally-</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The IJ denied Chin\u2019s petition, finding that Chin\u2019s claim was personal in nature and that she was an economic rather than political refugee. The IJ also found Chin\u2019s story regarding her parents\u2019 debt and resulting agreement to the arranged marriage \u201chighly suspect\u201d in light of the parents\u2019 ability and willingness to obtain the funds to pay the snakehead. The IJ went on to hold that, even if her claims were accepted as true, Chin could not establish refugee status under the INA because she could not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, the IJ held that Chin did not qualify for withholding of removal under the CAT because Chin could not demonstrate that she was likely to be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to China. In support of this holding, the IJ noted that first-time returnees to China generally suffer only a fine. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ]\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted). In other words, we reverse the agency\u2019s decision only if \u201cthe evidence presented by [the petitioner] was such that a reasonable factfinder would <em>have to conclude </em>that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). When the Board of Immigration Appeals affirms an IJ\u2019s order without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision constitutes the final agency determination subject to review by this court. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1285 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">B. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1bV\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or <em>political opinion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, \u201cestablish (1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). If the petitioners demonstrate past persecution, they are presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless the government can rebut this presumption by showing a fundamental change in circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>stances in the country or the ability to avoid future persecution by relocating within the country. <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2004). If the petitioners cannot show past persecution, then they must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee,\u201d we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In order to establish the necessary causal connection between the political opinion and the feared persecution, the petitioner must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted) (emphasis in original). Furthermore, we have approved of a \u201ccountry-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in their own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, in addition to estabhshing a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution, the alien must also establish that the persecution could not be avoided by relocating within their country.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Chin did not suffer past persecution on account of her political opinion. Chin sets forth only two incidents in which the government allegedly persecuted her, and both of these incidents occurred when local officials, either accompanied by her mother or acting upon her mother\u2019s request, found Chin and took her home after she had run away to avoid an arranged marriage. It is not at all clear that this conduct rises to the level of persecution, nor is there any evidence of a causal link between the conduct and any political opinion, real or imputed, on the part of Chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Chin failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. We agree with the IJ that Chin\u2019s claimed fear of being forced to enter an arranged marriage to satisfy her parents\u2019 $10,000 debt is undermined by the fact that her parents were willing and able to obtain $25,000 to help Chin reach the United States, and that even if that were not the case, it is unlikely that the Chinese government would force Chin to enter and remain in an arranged marriage in order to satisfy her parents\u2019 debt. We also agree that Chin\u2019s concerns about the arranged marriage, even if legitimate, are not likely to persist country-wide. This is particularly so given Chin\u2019s testimony that she lived and worked unmolested in Quanzhou for three months prior to her departure for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">With respect to Chin\u2019s claim that she will be persecuted for illegally leaving China, the country reports cited in the IJ\u2019s opinion provide substantial support for the IJ\u2019s finding that first time returnees to China are generally only subjected to fines, not persecution or torture. Because Chin cannot demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, her petition for asylum was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if she can show that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. When attempting to make this showing, the alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country. <em>Id. </em>Because this is a more stringent standard, \u201can applicant [who] is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum ... is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33 (internal quotation omitted). Since Chin has failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution sufficient to support her asylum claim, as discussed above, it logically follows that she cannot establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the heightened standard of the INA and the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Upon review of the record, and having considered the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Based on the foregoing, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">. Because Chin\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996) (\u2018'IIRIRA\u201d), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the INA, as amended by IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
