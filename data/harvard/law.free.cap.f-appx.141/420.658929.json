Lewis filed her Complaint in the Western District of Kentucky on October 1, 2002, alleging failure to promote and wrongful discharge on the basis of sex, race, and maternity status, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>On April 21, 2004, the district court granted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that the doctrine of judicial estoppel precluded Lewis from pursuing her discrimination action because she failed to list the action as an asset on a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition she filed shortly after Weyerhaeuser terminated her employment. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Lewis, an African-American female, began her employment with Weyerhaeuser in July 2000. Weyerhaeuser hired Lewis to work as a \u201cstaeker/counter\u201d in the production department of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s Guthrie, Kentucky, cardboard manufacturing plant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April 2001, Lewis requested maternity leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">Weyerhaeuser granted Lewis\u2019s request for 12 weeks of maternity leave, which began on May 15, 2001, and was scheduled to end on August 7,2001. Lewis, however, did not return to work on August 7, 2001, and Weyerhaeuser alleges that she failed to contact anyone at the Guthrie plant to provide a return date. On October 3, 2001, Ronnie Face, the Guthrie plant\u2019s Production Manager, sent a letter to Lewis terminating her employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\">Since we have not heard from you since mid-August, we are forced to make the assumption that you have resigned. Under the FMLA provisions, we are not obligated to hold a position for you beyond the 12 week time period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-20\">Therefore, this letter is to inform you of your termination with Weyerhaeuser Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">J.A. at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">On December 26, 2001, two months after her termination, Lewis and her husband filed a joint voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Two sections of the petition are relevant for purposes of this appeal. First, the \u201cStatement of Financial Affairs\u201d section of the petition required Lewis and her husband to list \u201cthe gross amount of income the debtor has received from employment ... from the beginning of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>calendar year to the date this case was commenced.\u201d J.A. at 86. It is undisputed that Lewis did not list the wages she received from Weyerhaeuser during 2001, but she did list the wages she received from another employer called Manpower, Inc. Second, the \u201cSchedule B \u2014 Personal Property\u201d section of the petition required Lewis and her husband to list \u201c[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature, including tax refunds, counterclaims of the debtor, and rights to setoff claims.\u201d J.A. at 92. It is undisputed that Lewis did not list her discrimination claim against Weyerhaeuser. It is also undisputed that Lewis never amended her bankruptcy schedules to accurately reflect either her prior income or the existence of her discrimination claim. On February 26, 2002, the bankruptcy court confirmed Lewis\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, which required Lewis and her husband to repay 32 percent of their outstanding indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">On March 29, 2002, approximately one month after the bankruptcy court confirmed Lewis\u2019s bankruptcy plan, Lewis\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (hereinafter \u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging that Weyerhaeuser discriminated against Lewis on the basis of \u201cher sex, race, and pregnancy status\u201d by awarding new jobs at the Guthrie plant to males with less seniority than her while she was away on pregnancy leave. J.A. at 81. On July 18, 2002, Lewis filed a formal charge of discrimination with the EEOC, again alleging discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and pregnancy status. On September 12, 2002, the EEOC dismissed the complaint and issued a right-to-sue letter. Lewis filed the present action alleging Title VII violations on October 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On February 2, 2004, Weyerhaeuser moved for summary judgment on the basis of judicial estoppel. Weyerhaeuser argued that under prevailing case law in the Sixth Circuit, as well as the Eleventh Circuit, judicial estoppel precluded Lewis from pursuing her discrimination claim because she had knowledge of the claim and a motive to conceal it when she filed her bankruptcy petition. In response, Lewis provided an affidavit alleging that she relied on her bankruptcy counsel\u2019s paralegal, who advised her not to mention her potential discrimination lawsuit or the wages she earned at Weyerhaeuser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">At the time that my bankruptcy petition was prepared, I specifically spoke with Kim Vaught who was, at that time, a paralegal with the firm of Kemp Ison Hart\u00f3n Tilley &amp; Holland. I specifically asked Kim if I should list the Defendant as an employer or whether I should list my claim against them for wrongful termination as an asset of my bankruptcy estate. I was specifically advised by Kim Vaught not to do so and that is the reason the Defendant is not mentioned in my bankruptcy petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">J.A. at 207-8 (Lewis Aff. II3). Lewis also alleged in her affidavit that she notified the Chapter 13 Trustee\u2019s office of her potential discrimination claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">Sometime after the start of my bankruptcy plan, I contacted a lady by the name of Phyllis who works ... for the Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee to whom I make my Chapter 13 plan payments. I have not withheld from them the existence of this lawsuit. I specifically discussed with Phyllis what I should do with any proceeds of this lawsuit in the event that I am successful. Phyllis explained that some of the proceeds of the lawsuit would have to be paid into the bankruptcy plan. That is exactly what I intend to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">J.A. at 208 (Lewis Aff. f 4). Lewis averred that she relied in good faith on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>advice of her bankruptcy attorney and his staff, and \u201cnever intended to mislead anyone in any way.\u201d J.A. at 208 (Lewis Aff. If 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On April 21, 2004, the district court granted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court found that Lewis intentionally omitted from her bankruptcy schedules both her prior employment with Weyerhaeuser and her discrimination claim. The district court rejected Lewis\u2019s argument that her omission was a good-faith mistake, finding that the \u201conly \u2018mistake\u2019 was in relying on bad legal advice----\u201d J.A. at 28 (D. Ct. Op. at 3). Lewis appeals that judgment, arguing once again that judicial estoppel should not bar her claim because she relied on the advice of her bankruptcy counsel and informed the Trustee\u2019s staff of the potential discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Smith v. Henderson, </em>376 F.3d 529, 533 (6th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions, and pleadings combined with the affidavits in support show that no genuine issue as to any material fact remains and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact exists when there is \u201csufficient evidence favoring the non-moving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.\u201d Anderson v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (citations omitted). In application of this summary judgment standard, the Court must view all materials supplied, including all pleadings, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and come forward with specific facts to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); <em>Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548. The non-moving party must do more than show that there is some abstract doubt as to the material facts. It must present significant probative evidence in support of its opposition to the motion for summary judgment in order to defeat the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Moore v. Philip Morris Co., </em>8 F.3d 335, 339-40 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Additionally, this court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel. <em>See Browning v. Levy, </em>283 F.3d 761, 775 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Eubanks v. CBSK Financial Group, Inc., </em>385 F.3d 894, 897 (6th Cir.2004). We note, however, that the Supreme Court has recently described judicial estoppel as \u201can equitable doctrine invoked by the court at its discretion.\u201d <em>See New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001). In the Sixth Circuit, \u201c[gjenerally matters that are committed to the sound discretion of the district court are reviewed by the court of appeals for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Workman v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>165 F.3d 460, 465 (6th Cir.1999). Indeed, a majority of federal courts that have ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>dressed the issue apply the abuse of discretion standard to a district court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel. <em>See Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 30-31 (1st Cir.2004); <em>Klein v. Stahl GMBH &amp; Co. Maschinefabrik, </em>185 F.3d 98, 108 (3d Cir.1999); <em>King v. Herbert J. Thomas Mem. Hosp., </em>159 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir.1998); <em>In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 197, 205 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Broussard v. Univ. of California, </em>192 F.3d 1252, 1255 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Barger v. City of Cartersville, GA, </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>78 F.3d 1556, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>but see United States v. Hook, </em>195 F.3d 299, 305 (7th Cir.1999) (applying <em>de novo </em>standard of review). In light of <em>New Hampshire </em>and the extensive contrary authority, we question the continued use of the <em>de novo </em>standard in the context of judicial estoppel. Nevertheless, because we find that the district court\u2019s ruling was proper under either standard, we need not resolve this issue here. <em>See Leonard v. Southwestern Bell Corp. Disability Income Plan, </em>341 F.3d 696, 700 (8th Cir.2003) (declining to adopt an abuse of discretion standard for review of judicial estoppel rulings based on <em>New Hampshire </em>because the district court would be affirmed under the <em>de novo </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Section 521(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor to file \u201ca schedule of assets and liabilities, a schedule of current income and current expenditures, and a statement of the debtor\u2019s financial affairs.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(1). It is well-settled that a cause of action is an asset that must be scheduled under \u00a7 521(1). <em>See Eubanks v. CBSK Financial Group, Inc., </em>385 F.3d 894, 897 (6th Cir.2004); <em>Cusano v. Klein, </em>264 F.3d 936, 945 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, \u201c[t]he duty of disclosure is a continuing one, and a debtor is required to disclose all potential causes of action.\u201d <em>In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 197, 208 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Youngblood Group v. Lufkin Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>932 F.Supp. 859, 867 (E.D.Tex.1996)). \u201c[T]he disclosure obligations of consumer debtors are at the very core of the bankruptcy process and meeting these obligations is part of the price debtors pay for receiving the bankruptcy discharge.\u201d <em>In re Colvin, </em>288 B.R. 477, 481 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.2003); <em>In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d at 208 (citing <em>Oneida Motor Freight, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>848 F.2d 414 (3d Cir.1988)) (\u201cViewed against the backdrop of the bankruptcy system and the ends it seeks to achieve, the importance of this disclosure duty cannot be overemphasized.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The doctrine of judicial estoppel \u201cgenerally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d <em>New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (quoting <em>Pegram v. Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 227 n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000)). Judicial estoppel \u201cpreserve[s] the integrity of the courts by preventing a party from abtising the judicial process through cynical gamesmanship.\u201d <em>Browning v. Levy, </em>283 F.3d 761, 776 (6th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). This court has previously described judicial estoppel as a rule against \u201cplaying fast and loose with the courts,\u201d \u201cblowing hot and cold as the occasion demands,\u201d or \u201chavfing] [one\u2019s] cake and eat[ing] it too.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Comm\u2019r, </em>861 F.2d 469, 472 (6th Cir.1988) (citations omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation or principle.\u201d <em>New Hampshire v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001). Nevertheless, despite the \u201camorphous nature of judicial estoppel,\u201d <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 30-31 (1st Cir.2004), the Supreme Court identified three considerations that are typically relevant in determining whether judicial estoppel should apply: (1) \u201ca party\u2019s later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceedings would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750-51,121 S.Ct. 1808 (internal quotes and citations omitted). These factors, however, are not \u201cinflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808. In <em>Browning v. Levy, </em>283 F.3d 761, 775 (6th Cir.2002), this court, focusing on the first two factors identified in <em>New Hampshire, </em>described judicial estoppel as barring a party from \u201c(1) asserting a position that is contrary to one that the party has asserted under oath in a prior proceeding, where (2) the prior court adopted the contrary position either as a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition.\u201d <em>Browning, </em>283 F.3d at 775 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Both of the factors set forth in <em>Browning </em>are present in this appeal. First, Lewis\u2019s pursuit of her current discrimination action is without question \u201ccontrary to\u201d her sworn bankruptcy petition. <em>Id. </em>Lewis\u2019s bankruptcy petition, which she signed under penalty of perjury, indicates that Lewis had no contingent and unliquidated claims; yet approximately one month after her Chapter 13 plan was confirmed she complained of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s conduct to the EEOC. This court has previously found that pursuing a cause of action that was not disclosed as an asset in a previous bankruptcy filing creates an inconsistency sufficient to support judicial estoppel. <em>See Eubanks, </em>385 F.3d at 898; <em>Browning, </em>283 F.3d at 775. Second, it is also clear that in confirming Lewis\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, the bankruptcy court adopted Lewis\u2019s statement that she had no potential causes of action. <em>See Reynolds, </em>861 F.2d at 473 (\u201c[Wjhen a bankruptcy court\u2014 which must protect the interests of all creditors \u2014 approves a payment from the bankruptcy estate on the basis of a party\u2019s assertion of a given position, that, in our view, is sufficient \u2018judicial acceptance\u2019 to estop the party from later advancing an inconsistent position.\u201d); <em>De Leon v. Comcar Indust., </em>321 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (applying judicial estoppel as a result <em>of </em>omissions in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition). Nevertheless, Lewis maintains that judicial estoppel should not apply because her omissions resulted from a good-faith mistake; specifically, her reliance on her bankruptcy counsel\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">It is well-settled that judicial estoppel does not apply where the prior inconsistent position occurred because of \u201cmistake or inadvertence.\u201d <em>Browning, </em>283 F.3d at 776; <em>See also New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 753, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (\u2018We do not question that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel when a party\u2019s prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). To determine whether the debtor\u2019s omission might be deemed inadvertent, the <em>Browning </em>court adopted the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 197 (5th Cir.1999). Under that approach, the failure to disclose a cause of action may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>deemed inadvertent where (1) \u201cthe debtor lacks the knowledge of the factual basis of the undisclosed claims,\u201d or (2) \u201cthe debtor has no motive for concealment.\u201d <em>Browning, </em>283 F.3d at 776 (citing <em>In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d at 210).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Weyerhaeuser argues that under <em>Browning </em>judicial estoppel <em>must </em>apply if Lewis knew of the factual basis for her discrimination action and had a motive to conceal it. In other words, Weyerhaeuser maintains that unless Lewis can demonstrate that her omission was inadvertent under the factors set forth in <em>Browning </em>and <em>In re Coastal Plains, </em>judicial estoppel must apply. Lewis\u2019s affidavit clearly establishes that she knew of her potential discrimination claim and, furthermore, as the district court noted, Lewis had a motive to conceal her claim since \u201cIt is always in a Chapter 13 petitioner\u2019s interest to minimize income and assets.\u201d J.A. at 25 (D. Ct. Op. at 4) (citing <em>Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.2002)). Thus, if Weyerhaeuser\u2019s interpretation of Sixth Circuit precedent is correct, judicial estoppel would prevent Lewis from pursuing her discrimination claim regardless of her intent or her efforts to place those involved in her bankruptcy on notice of her potential claim. Although we ultimately conclude that judicial estoppel bars Lewis from pursuing her claim, we find that Weyerhaeuser\u2019s interpretation of judicial estoppel is too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Two days after the district court granted Weyerhaeuser summary judgment, the Sixth Circuit decided <em>Eubanks v. CBSK Fin. Group, Inc., </em>385 F.3d 894 (6th Cir.2004). In <em>Eubanks, </em>the court reversed the district court\u2019s decision to apply judicial estoppel despite the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of a potential lender liability claim that they had omitted from a previous Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The court noted that it \u201cconsiders reasons of mistake and inadvertence, <em>as well as an absence of bad faith, </em>in determining judicial estoppel.... \u201d <em>Eubanks, </em>385 F.3d at 895 (emphasis added). Although the plaintiffs in <em>Eubanks </em>omitted their cause of action from the bankruptcy schedules, they (1) notified the bankruptcy trustee of the claim during a meeting and the trustee requested all of the documents regarding the claim; (2) asked the trustee on several occasions over several months whether he intended to pursue the claim on behalf of the estate; (3) moved the bankruptcy court for a status conference on the issue of the lender liability claim; (4) unsuccessfully moved to allow the trustee to be substituted for plaintiffs in the lender liability action after the action was filed and after the trustee refused to abandon the claim in the bankruptcy proceeding; and (5) filed an amendment to their original bankruptcy petition to add the lender liability action to their bankruptcy schedules after the defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of judicial estoppel. <em>See id. </em>at 895-97. The court held that although the plaintiffs had knowledge of the potential lender liability claim during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding, the above actions by the plaintiffs demonstrated that their omission was in good faith and in all likelihood inadvertent given the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconstant affirmative\u201d efforts to inform the trustee and the bankruptcy court of the claim \u201cthrough correspondence, motions, and status conference requests.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 899 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3. Thus, under <em>Eubanks, </em>even if the debtor has knowledge of a potential cause of action and a motive to conceal it, if the plaintiff does not actually conceal it and instead takes affirmative steps to fully inform the trustee and the bankruptcy court of the action, it is highly unlikely that the omission in the bankruptcy petition was intentional. In such a case, the equitable principles governing judicial estoppel do not support its application. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>cordingly, Weyerhaeuser\u2019s argument that judicial estoppel must apply where a debt- or cannot establish \u201cmistake or inadvertence\u201d under <em>Browning </em>is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Nevertheless, Lewis\u2019s actions in the present case pale in comparison to the actions taken by the plaintiffs in <em>Eubanks. </em>As the district court noted, none of Lewis\u2019s evidence \u201csuggests that either her receipt of income from Weyerhaeuser or her claim against Weyerhaeuser were revealed to the bankruptcy court or to the trustee before approval of the bankruptcy plan.\u201d J.A. at 23 (D. Ct. Op. at 3). Lewis never sought to amend her bankruptcy schedules, nor did she file a motion or make any other sort of attempt to inform the bankruptcy court of her discrimination action. Lewis\u2019s failure to notify the bankruptcy court of her potential discrimination claim is notable because judicial estoppel is intended to protect the integrity of the courts. <em>See In re Coastal Plains, </em>179 F.3d at 210 (\u201cAgain, the purpose of <em>judicial estoppel </em>is <em>not </em>to protect the litigants; it is to protect the integrity of the judicial system.\u201d). In addition, her only relevant contact with the trustee was a conversation with a woman named \u201cPhyllis\u201d whom Lewis alleges worked for the Trustee. Lewis\u2019s description of that conversation, however, does not indicate that the conversation took place before Weyerhaeuser raised the issue of judicial estoppel; she alleges only that it occurred \u201csometime after the start of [her] bankruptcy plan.... \u201d Furthermore, Lewis\u2019s affidavit does not establish that Phyllis was aware that the cause of action had been omitted from the bankruptcy petition. Therefore, we find that the minimal alleged effort Lewis put forth to inform the Trustee\u2019s staff of her potential discrimination claim does not establish that her omissions were inadvertent under <em>Eubanks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We also find unpersuasive Lewis\u2019s assertion that she relied in good faith on the advice of her attorney\u2019s paralegal. In a similar case, the Eleventh Circuit noted that although the \u201c[debtor\u2019s] attorney failed to list [the debtor\u2019s] discrimination suit on the schedule of assets despite the fact that [the debtor] specifically told him about the suit, the attorney's omission is no panacea.\u201d <em>Barger v. City of Cartersville, Georgia, </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir.2003). The <em>Barger </em>court relied upon <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) for the general proposition that a litigant is bound by the errors of his or her attorney. <em>See Link, </em>370 U.S. at 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386 (\u201cPetitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent.\u201d). We find the <em>Barger </em>court\u2019s extension of <em>Link </em>to the doctrine of judicial estoppel appropriate in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The issue here is whether Lewis pursued a \u201cposition\u201d before the bankruptcy court that is inconsistent with the pursuit of her current discrimination claim against Weyerhaeuser. Lewis alleges that before filing her bankruptcy petition, she informed a paralegal with her law firm that she had a potential discrimination claim against Weyerhaeuser. For whatever reason, the paralegal or Lewis\u2019s attorney made a conscious decision not to present that information to the bankruptcy court in contravention of the clear terms of the bankruptcy petition. Thus, Lewis\u2019s \u201cfreely selected agent\u201d took the position that Lewis had no cause of action against Weyerhaeuser. <em>Link, </em>370 U.S. at 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386. Lewis presents no compelling reason to justify departing from the general rule set forth in <em>Link </em>that litigants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>bound by the actions of their attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We note, however, that another panel of this court recently affirmed a district court\u2019s decision not to apply judicial estoppel at least in part because the party asserting the inconsistent position relied on the advice of counsel in the prior court proceeding. <em>See Pennycuff v. Fentress County Bd. of Educ., </em>404 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir.2005). In <em>Pennycuff, </em>the court held that a defendant school board\u2019s admission in a prior court proceeding that the plaintiff employee had attained tenure did not prevent the school board from asserting that the employee did not have tenure in a later proceeding because, among other things, \u201cthe defendants relied on the advice of counsel....\u201d <em>Pennycuff, </em>404 F.3d at 453. In <em>Pennycuff, </em>however, the school board\u2019s admission occurred in a proceeding in which the employee\u2019s tenure was not at issue. <em>Pennycuff, </em>404 F.3d at 453. The court determined that \u201c[b]e-cause the Board\u2019s prior admission that Pennycuff was a tenured teacher was made on the advice of counsel in a proceeding in which Pennycuffs tenure was not at issue,\u201d the Board had not engaged in \u201cintentional self-contradiction ... as a means of obtaining unfair advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In contrast, the extent of Lewis\u2019s assets and her earnings were highly relevant in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See In re Coastal Plains, Inc., </em>179 F.3d at 208 (noting that the \u201cintegrity of the bankruptcy system depends on a full and honest disclosure by debtors of all their assets.\u201d) (emphasis removed). Furthermore, the facts in this case, unlike those in <em>Pennycuff, </em>support a finding that Lewis acted intentionally and in bad faith. First, Lewis began the process of filing her discrimination claim with the EEOC only one month after the bankruptcy plan was approved, which tends to show that she waited until the plan was approved before pursuing her discrimination action. Second, she also omitted altogether her prior employment with Weyerhaeuser. While a non-attorney may not know the exact nature of \u201c[ojther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature\u201d (J.A. at 92), it is hard to believe that Lewis did not understand the language in the bankruptcy petition requiring her to disclose \u201cthe gross amount of income the debtor has received from employment ... from the beginning of this calendar year to the date this case was commenced.\u201d J.A. 86. Indeed, during oral argument Lewis\u2019s counsel conceded that Lewis listed her wages from another prior employer called Manpower, Inc. Accordingly, although judicial estoppel may not always apply to positions taken on the advice of an attorney, Lewis\u2019s failure to list Weyerhaeuser as an employer on her bankruptcy schedules despite the clear requirement that she do so under penalty of perjury, the heightened importance of full asset disclosure to the bankruptcy court, and the questionable timing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>events in this case support the district court\u2019s decision to apply judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-15\">. Weyerhaeuser operated the plant under the trade name \"Bardcor Corp.,\u201d which Lewis initially named as the Defendant. Lewis filed an Amended Complaint naming Weyerhaeuser on July 29, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">. In <em>Link, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a lawyer\u2019s failure to prosecute, which clients may have little knowledge of or control over. This court has noted its reluctance to follow <em>Link </em>where the failure to prosecute is the fault of the attorney. <em>Coleman v. Am. Red Cross, </em>23 F.3d 1091, 1094-95 (6th Cir.1994) (\"Despite the Supreme Court's unequivocal language, this court, like many others, has been extremely reluctant to uphold the dismissal of a case merely to discipline an attorney.... [Djismissal is usually inappropriate where the neglect is solely, the fault of the attorney.\u201d). We have no difficulty applying <em>Link </em>to the present case, however, because Lewis\u2019s affidavit establishes that she was aware of the terms of the bankruptcy petition requiring her to disclose under the penalty of perjury her prior employment and any potential claims. Thus, the actions of Lewis\u2019s attorney and/or paralegal were taken with Lewis\u2019s knowledge and consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
