Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling. Furthermore, the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by the fact that [the petitioner] filed a [timely] motion to reopen the removal proceedings ... after issuance of the final order of removal.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>ney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Stone v. INS., </em>614 U.S. 386, 395, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1544, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under the INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">To be timely from the BIA\u2019s December 3, 2004, order affirming the IJ\u2019s opinion and ordering the petitioners removed, the petitioners\u2019 petition for review should have been filed by January 2, 2005. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The petitioners did not file their petition for review of a final order of removal until March 17, 2005. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider the petitioners\u2019 underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims. Accordingly, we dismiss any portion of the motion for reconsideration addressing these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">\n<em>II. Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion, similar to the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003); <em>cf. Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (addressing a motion to reopen) (quotation omitted). The BIA\u2019s decision to deny a motion for reconsideration should be upheld \u201cunless it was made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\u201d <em>Ven v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir.2004) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Under the regulations, a motion for reconsideration must specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cA motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board\u2019s previous decision an error was made.\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 399, 402, 1991 WL 353528 (BIA 1991). When the BIA reconsiders one of its prior decisions, it takes itself \u201cback in time and considers] the case as though a decision in the case on the record ... had never been entered.\u201d Id. Persuasive authority has held that \u201c[reconsideration is not an appropriate forum for rehashing previously rejected arguments or arguing matters that could have been heard during the pendency of the previous motion.\u201d Ahmed <em>v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted); <em>Strato v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 651, 655 (8th Cir.2004). \u201cThe repetition of previous arguments is not sufficient to prevail\u201d on a motion for reconsideration. <em>Ahmed, </em>388 F.3d at 249 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The petitioners have arguably abandoned any challenge to the denial of their motion for reconsideration because they advance no arguments in their brief regarding the motion. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003). However, even if the petitioners have not abandoned their claim, it still fails. Because the petitioners failed to specify the errors of fact or law in the prior BIA decision and simply repeated their prior arguments that the BIA had considered and rejected, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see Ahmed, </em>388 F.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-12\">. The petitioners abandoned any argument related to the denial of relief pursuant to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c), by failing to raise an argument on this issue in their brief on appeal. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-18\"><em>. </em>Because the petitioners\u2019 removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\"IIRIRA\u201d), govern their petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
