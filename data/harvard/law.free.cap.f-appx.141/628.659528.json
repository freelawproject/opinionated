Gonzales is substituted for his predecessor, John Ashcroft, as Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to Fed.

We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Even assuming Hernandez\u2019s testimony was credible, there is insufficient evidence to compel the conclusion that Hernandez\u2019s subjectively genuine fear of returning to Guatemala is objectively reasonable. <em>See Aguilera-Cota v. U.S. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1378 (9th Cir.1990). It has been ten years since Hernandez and his family left Guatemala, and six years since anyone has sought information regarding Hernandez\u2019s whereabouts. There is no evidence that incidents similar to those Hernandez experienced have continued to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Because Hernandez failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 617 (9th Cir.2004). Hernandez also failed to meet the standard for CAT relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
