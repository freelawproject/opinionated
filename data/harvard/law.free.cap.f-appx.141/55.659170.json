The District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania granted Napco\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that Fetterman was unable to demonstrate that Napco\u2019s reason for terminating him was a pretext for age discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">The facts, familiar to the parties, are set out in detail in the District Court\u2019s thorough memorandum order. Fetterman, a former hourly employee at Napco, was promoted in 1989 to the management position of production scheduler, and again in 1998 to the position of off-shift supervisor in the shipping department. In this latter position, his responsibilities included oversight of the shipping department, supervision of twelve to fourteen employees, and regularly conducting a Material Cycle Count (\u201cMCC\u201d) of the product inventory. Although a team of employees actually conducted the MCC, Fetterman was ultimately responsible for its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">Ongoing problems with the MCC, however, prompted Fetterman\u2019s supervisor, Thomas Hogg, to issue a Notice of Corrective Action (\u201cNOCA\u201d) on August 6, 2001. The NOCA advised Fetterman that he \u201cmust immediately demonstrate significant improvement in those critical areas that you have failed. Namely: Discrepancies in the material cycle count \u2014 as a supervisor and leader within the organization you have an obligation to ensure that all procedures are followed and adhered too [sic].\u201d Two instances of inappropriate comments to plant personnel were also cited by Hogg. The NOCA indicated that Fetter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>man had ninety days to improve his performance or he would be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On November 2, 2001, Hogg acknowledged that Fetterman attempted to meet the expectations set forth in the August 6 NOCA. Hogg concluded, however, that Fetterman\u2019s \u201cimprovements have fallen significantly short of what is needed to fulfill the requirements of the Staff level position of Shipping Supervisor.\u201d In addition, Hogg cited concerns about Fetter-man\u2019s management abilities, particularly his lack of communication with management regarding the inappropriate conduct of employees and his lack of leadership in the organization. As a result, Fetterman was terminated from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Fetterman does not dispute that Napco proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment. Rather, he contends that his termination was pretextual because there were inconsistencies with the NOCA itself, and because there were remarks by two decision-makers demonstrating an age bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The District Court thoroughly vetted Fetterman\u2019s argument, applying the familiar analysis in <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir.1994). It rejected Fetter-man\u2019s argument that Napco\u2019s reason for his termination was pretextual because the MCC was completed by a team of employees, not solely by him. The District Court explained that the completion of the MCC by a team of employees did not cast doubt on Napco\u2019s proffered reason because Fetterman was the management official ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the MCC. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We also agree with the District Court that the stray remarks do not demonstrate pretext. The first remark did not pertain to age. The second remark, uttered several months after Fetterman\u2019s termination, was not probative of whether Fetterman\u2019s termination was because of age discrimination. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s memorandum order we will affirm the judgment in favor of Napco.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aeu\">.
