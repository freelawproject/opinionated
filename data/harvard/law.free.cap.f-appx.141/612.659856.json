To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>see INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), and we review due process claims de novo, <em>see Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">To the extent Nevarez challenges the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing her appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal and the BIA\u2019s decision denying her motion to reconsider the dismissal, we lack jurisdiction because Nevarez did not file petitions for review within thirty days of those decisions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied as untimely Nevarez\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order of removal on November 10, 2003, and did not receive Nevarez\u2019s motion to reopen until more than ninety days later on April 30, 2004. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Nevarez\u2019 motion to reopen was not arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
