Taylor, a.k.a. \u201cMezy,\u201d appeals his thirty-four month term of imprisonment following his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). Taylor contends that the district court clearly erred in applying a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm \u201cwith knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense\u201d pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2004). We find no error and affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-24\">\u201cWhen reviewing the District Court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, ... [w]e accept the findings of fact of the District Court unless they are clearly erroneous and give due deference to the District Court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Cutler, </em>36 F.3d 406, 407 (4th Cir.1994). Our review of the record reveals that Taylor and three others attempted to confront the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>responsible for the theft of a companion\u2019s firearm. Testimonial evidence supported a finding that after some discussion on the necessity of being armed for the confrontation, Taylor retrieved a firearm in order to \u201cgo shoot his ass.\u201d Police intercepted Taylor and his three companions prior to their arrival at their intended destination. A firearm was recovered from the vehicle. Because evidence supported the district court\u2019s factual conclusions, we find that the district court did not clearly err in its application of the challenged enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
