Miller, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the Defendant-Appellee, Municipal Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Michigan (\u201cMERS\u201d). Miller was a police sergeant employed by the Oxford Emergency Safety Authority (\u201cOSEA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Oxford, Michigan. MERS is a statewide, public employee pension fund serving governmental entities. At all times relevant to this matter, OSEA was a \u201cparticipating municipality\u201d in MERS. Miller brought suit against MERS, alleging that MERS treated him differently than other similarly-situated employees in calculating his retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>benefits, violating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. \u00a7 37.2701(a), and Michigan\u2019s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. \u00a7 37.1602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On June 17, 2003, the district court, Judge George Caram Steeh presiding, entered an order denying MERS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that there existed genuine issues of material fact over whether the cost discrepancies were part of MERS\u2019s policy or custom. After additional discovery, MERS renewed its motion for summary judgment. On January 24, 2004, the district court concluded that based on the evidence presented, including testimony from Miller\u2019s actuary, MERS did not have a policy of disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court was correct in its decision granting summary judgment for MERS. Because the district court thoroughly articulated its reasons for granting summary judgment, we find that the issuance of a full written opinion by this court would be duplicative and serve no useful purpose. We therefore adopt the reasoning of the district court in its opinion dated January 24, 2004, and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for MERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-26\">. After Miller's termination, OSEA changed its name to Oxford Public Fired and EMS Commission. In this order, we refer to the organization by its prior name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
