Finding that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence violated Gadd\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury, we vacate the sentence and grant the Government\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-21\">Gadd first claims on appeal that the district court erred in calculating the loss Gadd intended to inflict on the various victims of his fraudulent schemes. Gadd claims that the district court\u2019s reliance on the face value of Gadd\u2019s fraudulent demands unreasonably exaggerated the loss because such a financial loss was not economically feasible. We have specifically rejected this claim under similar circumstances. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 499-502 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">Gadd also claims that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines enhanced Gadd\u2019s sentence on the basis of facts he did not admit and that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, we agree.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we vacate his sentence and grant the Government\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-25\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-19\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Gadd's sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
