Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 73, 8, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Defendant Jimmie Lee Byrd\u2019s appeal, with a limited remand to correct a clerical error in the judgment of conviction. <em>See United States v. Byrd, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 462 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to us following its decision in <em>Booker. See United States v. Byrd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2535, 161 L.Ed.2d 1108 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Jimmie Lee Byrd directly appealed his life sentence for conspiracy to import five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 963, 960(b)(1), 851 (\u201cCount 1\u201d); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), 851 (\u201cCount 2\u201d); importation of five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(1)(B), 851 (\u201cCount 3\u201d); and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 851; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (\u201cCount 4\u201d). The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">In regard to the substantive conviction, Byrd argued that the district court erred in denying: (1) his motion to suppress evidence seized from a vessel; and (2) his motion for a judgment of acquittal on Counts 2 and 4 of his indictment. We affirmed Byrd\u2019s conviction. Byrd further argued, in relation to his sentence, that the district court erred in: (1) enhancing his offense level by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B), based on his serving as a captain of a vessel used in the conspiracy; (2) enhancing his sentence, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 851, for Byrd\u2019s previous criminal convictions; and (3) refusing to grant a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, based on Byrd\u2019s \u201cact of humanitarianism.\u201d We also affirmed Byrd\u2019s sentence, but remanded the case to the district court because the judgment of conviction erroneously reflected that Byrd\u2019s convictions in Counts 2 and 4 involved five grams of cocaine, instead of five kilograms. After we issued our opinion, Byrd sought a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court based upon its recent decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">In his initial brief, Byrd did not assert error in his sentence based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny. Only in the reply brief did Byrd rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number><em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), arguing that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment rights by increasing his offense level based on facts not charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">This Court recently addressed a similar case which had been remanded in light of <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Dockery, </em>we observed that the appellant in that case did not raise a constitutional challenge or an argument based on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Apprendi </em>principles. <em>See Dockery </em>at 1262. We further noted how we handled cases which were remanded with instructions to reconsider in light of <em>Apprendi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Because he made no arguments in his initial brief raising <em>Booker/Apprendi </em>issues, Byrd has abandoned those issues. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, the Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. We further remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">OPINION REINSTATED. CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED; LIMITED REMAND TO CORRECT CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">. Prior to <em>Booker, </em>this Court has held that claims not raised on appeal, including <em>Blakely </em>claims, are deemed waived. <em>United States v. Hembree, </em>381 F.3d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir. 2004); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-44 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
