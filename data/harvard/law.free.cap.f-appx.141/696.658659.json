For the past six years, Morris has had criminal speeding charges pending against him in the tribal court of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (\u201cCSKT\u201d) in Montana. Morris is an enrolled member of the Mmnesota Chippewa Tribe, Leech Lake Reservation, but is not a member of the CSKT. He challenges the jurisdiction of the tribal court. The district court granted summary judgement against Morris. <em>Morris v. Tanner, </em>288 F.Supp.2d 1133, 1144 (D.Mont.2003). Morris appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-23\">Morris challenges the jurisdiction of the CSKT tribal court, which was confirmed by the 1990 amendments to the Indian Civil Rights Act (\u201cICRA\u201d) to extend to \u201call Indians\u201d in criminal cases. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 101-511, Title VIII, \u00a7 8077(b)-(e), 104 Stat. 1856, 1892 (1990) (amending 25 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u00a7 1301). He contends that the 1990 amendments violate principles of equal protection and due process. In our recent opinion in <em>Means v. Navajo Nation, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, No. 01-17489, slip op. 11191, 2005 WL 2008433 (9th Cir. Aug. 23, 2005), however, we squarely addressed and rejected both of these challenges to the 1990 amendments to the ICRA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are therefore bound by <em>Means </em>to reject Morris\u2019 challenges as well. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-13\">. In <em>Means, </em>we also held that, as used in the 1990 amendments to ICRA, \" '[a]ll Indians\u2019 plainly includes Indians who are not members of the tribe,\u201d but excludes \"anyone who might ethnically be an Indian but who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe.\u201d <em>Means, </em>\u2014 F.3d at -, slip op. at 11199.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
