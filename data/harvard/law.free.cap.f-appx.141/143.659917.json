We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. U.S. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Cir.1993). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. U.S. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Kamara raises several issues in her brief, none of which have merit. We note the Board did not abuse its discretion denying the motion to reopen as untimely. Moreover, there was no evidence of changed circumstances within Sierra Leone. Thus, there was no reason to ignore the ninety-day period in which to file motions to reopen. We are without authority to review the Board\u2019s decision not to sua sponte reopen the case. <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003). We further find no authority to exercise our mandamus authority and to compel the Board to review the merits of the petition to reopen. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Insofar as Kamara challenges the March 12, 2004 order summarily affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order, we are without jurisdiction because Kamara did not file a timely petition for review. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (this time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We also deny the motion for stay of removal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
