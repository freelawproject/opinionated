He contends that pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his constitutional rights in making upward adjustments under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b). Ikari was sentenced before the United States Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the Sentencing Guidelines were effectively advisory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The record does not show how the district court would have proceeded if it had known that the Guidelines were not mandatory. Accordingly, we remand for the district court to answer the question whether the sentence would have been materially different if it had known that the Guidelines were advisory, and for further proceedings under <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084-85 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b699-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
