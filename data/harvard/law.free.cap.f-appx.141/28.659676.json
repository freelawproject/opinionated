The IJ rejected Vukaj\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (\u201cINA\u201d), <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1231(b)(3), and denied him relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), adopted Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. Furthermore, the IJ directed Vukaj\u2019s removal from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. When reviewing asylum and CAT claims, \u201c[w]e review the factual findings underlying the [IJ\u2019s] determinations under the substantial evidence standard, reversing only if no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find that petitioner suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that when the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ directly). To reverse an IJ\u2019s factual finding, we must conclude \u201cthat the evidence not only supports [a] conclusion\u201d favorable to the asylum applicant, \u201cbut <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">In this case, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that while Vukaj may have experienced instances of harassment and discrimination in Montenegro, his experience did not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of the INA. Accordingly, the IJ did not err in finding that Vukaj failed to meet his burden of proving past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">As to a well-founded fear of future persecution, we agree with the IJ that while Vukaj\u2019s fear may be genuine, it is not objectively reasonable based upon petitioner\u2019s testimony, the information provided by the country condition reports, and the fact that amnesty had recently been granted to all draft evaders. We cannot say that a reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to find that Vukaj\u2019s fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable and thus \u201cwell-founded.\u201d <em>See Alimi v. Ashcroft, </em>391 F.3d 888, 890-91 (7th Cir.2004) (upholding IJ\u2019s determination that ethnic Albanian and participant in an organization supporting civil rights for those similarly situated in Macedonia failed to establish objectively reasonable fear of future persecution in light of changed conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Because an applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum is necessarily precluded from satisfying the heavier burden for withholding of removal, <em>see Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2004), we hold that Vukaj\u2019s petition for withholding of removal also fails. Vukaj\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>petition for review of his CAT claim is similarly deficient. He failed to show that he was likely to be tortured if he returned to Montenegro, and thus his CAT claim was properly denied. <em>See Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 397 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
