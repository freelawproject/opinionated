Castlino (\u201cCastlino\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing his suit for employment discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Castlino alleges that Sergeant Michael Gonzales (\u201cGonzales\u201d) made derogatory remarks and a false statement against him and that he was unlawfully terminated by Tommy Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d), the sheriff at the Harris County Sheriffs Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d), because of his race and Sicilian national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">Castlino was employed as a deputy sheriff by the Department. He was terminated for violating Department policy by attempting to steal inmate property. The Civil Service Commission, after a hearing, upheld the termination decision. Nine months after his termination, Castlino filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Melton v. Teachers Inc. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing the record, we do so in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and the non-moving party is entitled to all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Title VII prohibits an employer from \u201cdischarg[ing] an individual, or otherwise discriminat[ing] against any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Title VII also prohibits retaliation by employers against employees who have filed a charge of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), framework requires a plaintiff to first create a presumption of discrimination by making out a prima facie case of discrimination. The burden of production then shifts to the defendant to establish legitimate non-diseriminatory reasons for its actions. The plaintiff then bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff because of the plaintiffs protected status. <em>See Laxton v. Gap Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir.2003). The Department set forth an adequate, nondiscriminatory reason for Castlino\u2019s termination \u2014 he violated department policies and procedures by attempting to take valuable property from the Inmate Processing Center. Castlino offered no evidence that the Department\u2019s reason for termination was mere pretext and its true reason for its decision was Castlino\u2019s race, national origin, or his filing of an EEOC claim. In addition, there is no evidence that the County\u2019s actions were directly or indirectly related to Castlino\u2019s claimed Sicilian national origin or that race or national origin played any role in the Department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Castlino did offer evidence of inappropriate statements made by Gonzales. We agree, however, with the district court\u2019s conclusion that these comments alone are insufficient to establish a general issue of material fact for Castlino\u2019s employment discrimination claim under Title VII. <em>See Boyd v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>158 F.3d 326, 329 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe mere utterance of a racial epithet is <em>not </em>indicia of discrimination under Title VII.\u201d); <em>Rubinstein v. Adm\u2019r of Tulane Educ. Fund, </em>218 F.3d 392, 400-01 (5th Cir.2000) (Plaintiff only offered evidence that inappropriate comments were made, not that they were proximate in time or related to the employment decision at issue.). In addition, Thomas was the decisionmaker that terminated Castlino\u2019s employment, and there is no evidence that Thomas acted as the conduit of Gonzales\u2019 prejudice. <em>See Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, </em>235 F.3d 219, 226-27 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Castlino also alleges that he was terminated in retaliation for filing an EEOC discrimination charge. This claim is without merit since the EEOC charge was filed after Castlino had been terminated by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
