Based on our review of the record, we find that the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. Singh failed to file his motion within 180 days of his in absentia removal order as required by 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (2000) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2005). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
