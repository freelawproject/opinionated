We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the agency\u2019s application of a statute, <em>see Cervantes-Gonzales v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">We affirm the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae due to his long history of misrepresentation and fraud. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae. Specifically, Singh admits that he applied for asylum, and was convicted of sexual battery and false imprisonment by violence under one name, and then filed an application for adjustment of status under another name. In conjunction with his adjustment application, Singh stated under oath that he had never been arrested, charged, or fined for breaking any law and had never sought to procure immigration benefits by fraud or willful misrepresentation. Then, in his adjustment interview, Singh stated under oath that he had never used an alias. Under these facts, the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh was inadmissible is not manifestly contrary to law. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Singh\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
