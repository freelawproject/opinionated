Stephen Green pled guilty to a single count of conspiracy to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (2000), and was sentenced to fifty months\u2019 imprisonment followed by four years\u2019 supervised release. In January 2005, the district court found Green in violation of the conditions of his supervised release and sentenced him to four years\u2019 imprisonment. Green\u2019s crime of conviction is a Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2000). A district court may sentence a defendant to no more than two years\u2019 imprisonment on the basis of a revocation proceeding where the underlying conviction is a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). The district court\u2019s imposition of a four year sentence thus exceeds the statutory maximum allowable. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and grant the motion to remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-22\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
