We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim and summary judgment. <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The district court properly entered judgment for defendants with respect to Thomas\u2019 state tort claim for public disclosure of private facts because she failed to allege facts sufficient to show that defendant Catlin\u2019s scientific article discussing the detection of steroids identified her in any way as the source of the positive urine samples. <em>See Shulman v. Group W Prod., Inc., </em>18 Cal.4th 200, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 955 P.2d 469, 478 (1998). Nor did Thomas allege facts sufficient to show that the article would be offensive or objectionable to a reasonable person, or that it is not a topic of legitimate public concern. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The district court properly held Thomas failed to state a claim under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 46.101, et seq., the federal statute regulating research involving human subjects, because the statute does not confer a private right of action. <em>See Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (\u201cprivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Thomas\u2019 motion for additional discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) because she did not show that the information she expected to gain from the suggested deponents would preclude summary judgment. <em>See Maljack Prods. v. GoodTimes Home Video Corp., </em>81 F.3d 881, 888 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">We will not entertain Thomas\u2019 negligence <em>per se </em>argument raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Peterson v. Highland Music, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 1313, 1321 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Thomas\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
