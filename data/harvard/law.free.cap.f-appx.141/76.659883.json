The District Court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5(k) motion but refused to grant defendant\u2019s request for a minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The District Court found that Maldonado\u2019s activities rose above that of a minor participant. Maldonado did not appeal his conviction but has appealed his sentence based on the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant him relief under \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Subsequent to briefing before this court on the merits of the sentencing guidelines issue, the United States Supreme Court issued <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In subsequent briefing, Maldonado has additionally sought resentencing based on <em>Booker. </em>The <em>Booker </em>issue was briefed by the parties. For the reasons explained below, we will affirm the conviction, vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">Jurisdiction was conferred on the District Court by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. A timely notice of appeal was filed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">A defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim, asserted for the first time on appeal, is subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">Where, as here, the District Court imposed sentence and treated the \u201cGuidelines as mandatory rather than advisory,\u201d defendant\u2019s claim survives scrutiny under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>plain error review. <em>Id. </em>at 164. In these circumstances, \u201cwe will decide claims of error related to the conviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for consideration of the appropriate sentence by the District Court in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. We do not address Maldonado\u2019s \u00a7 3B1.2(b) claim because any such decision on our part might very well be rendered unnecessary by resentencing under <em>Booker. See, e.g., United States v. Urban, </em>404 F.3d 754, 783 n. 11 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cAppellants O\u2019Malley and Tursi also argue that the District Court committed a sentencing error in fixing their base offense level under the sentencing guidelines for the RICO convictions. Because we are vacating O\u2019Malley\u2019s and Tursi\u2019s sentences and remanding to the District Court for resentencing under <em>Booker, </em>we will not address this particular challenge to their sentences here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">For the reasons explained above, we will affirm the conviction, vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
