We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review whether Arciniega has demonstrated the requisite \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">Arciniega\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated when the IJ relied on incorrect information in assessing the hardship to his legal permanent resident father is not supported by the record and therefore does not raise a colorable due process challenge. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo be colorable ... the claim must have some possible validity\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cDue process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">The voluntary departure period was stayed, and that stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate. <em>See Desta v.
