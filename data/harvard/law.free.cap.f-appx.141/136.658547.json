Shungu contends that the Board did not give adequate weight to some portions of his evidence and engaged in speculation in finding that Shungu and his prime witness were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d Rusu v. <em>U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Credibility determinations of the immigration judge and the Board are entitled to deference as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Figeroa v. U.S. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We have reviewed the evidence of record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order, and we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the immigration judge\u2019s finding that the testimony was not credible. We further find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Shungu failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of withholding of removal as well. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). As Shungu is not eligible for asylum, he fails to qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">Protection under the CAT is generally granted in the form of withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c) (2005). An applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Again, we find that the Board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Accordingly, we deny Shungu\u2019s petition for review. We deny Shungu\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion for Stay of Removal Pending Resolution of Appeal\u201d as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
