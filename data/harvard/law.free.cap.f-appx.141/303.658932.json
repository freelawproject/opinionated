Ornelas was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment and to a ten-year term of supervised release. Ornelas argues that the two-level enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(4), for the importation of methamphetamine is invalid under <em>United States v. </em>Booker, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He further asserts that his sentence is invalid under <em>Booker </em>because he was sentenced under the assumption of a mandatory guidelines system.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">The record does not support Ornelas\u2019s assertion that he did not affirmatively admit or stipulate that he had imported drugs. Ornelas signed the factual basis, in which he stipulated that he drove a Honda Accord passenger car containing methamphetamine from Mexico into the United States at the Bridge 1 port of entry in Laredo, Texas. He further stipulated that he \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessed this methamphetamine with the intent to distribute it.\u201d Additionally, at his rearraignment Ornelas indicated under oath that the factual basis was true and that he was admitting to the facts set forth in it. Thus, because Ornelas admitted to the facts that were used to enhance his sentence, the district court did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 769. Ornelas\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was error also fails because Ornelas fails to show that the district court would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Ornelas also argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi </em>because the statute\u2019s structure treats drug types and quantities as sentencing factors. Ornleas additionally asserts that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b) and 851 based on his prior felony drug conviction because the fact of that conviction was not set forth in his indictment nor proved to jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Ornleas acknowledges that both of his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), and <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), respectively. Accordingly, Ornelas\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
