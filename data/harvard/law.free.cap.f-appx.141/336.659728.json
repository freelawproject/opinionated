Lozano-Reyes argues pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled. He concedes that his constitutional argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and he raises it solely to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -&amp; n. 5, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63 &amp; n. 5, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), also did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. </em>We therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">Lozano-Reyes contends that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>Booker </em>because the sentencing judge applied the sentencing guidelines as if they were mandatory. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Lozano-Reyes must show, among other things, that the error prejudiced him by adversely affecting his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Lozano-Reyes fails to identify anything in the record to suggest that his sentence would have been any less had the court applied the sentencing guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See id. </em>He thus fails to establish prejudice to his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
