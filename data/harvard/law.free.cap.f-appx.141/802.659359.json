Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2002). A court shall grant summary judgment when the evidence before it shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWhen deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Rojas, </em>285 F.3d at 1341-42 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee in retaliation for exercising a right guaranteed thereunder. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). \u201cTo establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (l)[]he engaged in protected activity, (2)[ ]he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Stavropoulos v. Firestone, </em>361 F.3d 610, 616 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1850, 161 L.Ed.2d 727 (2005). \u201cTo be considered an adverse employment action for purposes of Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, the action must either be an ultimate employment decision or else must meet some threshold level of substantiality. Ultimate employment decisions include decisions such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616-17 (internal quotations and citation omitted). In order to meet the threshold of substantiality requirement, an employment action must be \u201cobjectively serious and tangible enough to alter the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617 (internal quotations and citation omitted) (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">To establish the causal connection required by the third prong, the plaintiff must show that \u201cthe decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 590 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Close temporal proximity may be sufficient to show that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">The district court properly determined that McAdams did not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation because he failed to establish: (1) a causal connection between his protected activity and his performance evaluation, <em>see Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2004) holding that a three-month period between the protected activity and the adverse action was insufficient to establish a causal connection in an ADA case and; (2) that the elimination of his position and his transfer to a new position constituted an adverse employment action. Thus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the Army on those claims, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
