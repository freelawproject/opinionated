On appeal, Curry argues that, in 1999, he was sentenced as a habitual offender to life imprisonment without parole under Ala.Code 1975 \u00a7 13A-5-9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, such a sentence was mandatory and the sentencing judge was granted no discretion. The Alabama legislature subsequently amended \u00a7 13A-5-9, such that trial judges were granted authority to retroactively consider early parole sentences for non-violent, convicted offenders based on evaluations performed by the Alabama Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) and approved by the Board of Pardons, provided that such offenders had no prior Class A felony convictions. The Alabama Supreme Court recently held in <em>Kirby v. State, </em>899 So.2d 968, 971-72 (Ala. 2004), that Alabama trial courts now have authority to consider prisoners\u2019 motions for reduction of sentence under that statute. Curry argues he qualifies for a sentence reduction under that statute, and, therefore, he is entitled to a review of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Under the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act (\u201cAHFOA\u201d), in all cases when it is shown that a criminal defendant has been previously convicted of any three felonies, none of which are Class A felonies, and after such convictions has committed another felony, which is a Class A felony, such defendant must be punished by imprisonment for life or life without the possibility of parole, in the discretion of the trial court. Ala.Code 1975 \u00a7 13A-5-9(c)(3). In 2001, the Alabama legislation adopted a statute which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-14\">The provisions of Section 13A-5-9 [including \u00a7 13A-5-9(c)(3), described above,] shall be applied retroactively by the sentencing judge or presiding judge for consideration of early parole of each nonviolent convicted offender based on evaluations performed by the Department of Corrections and approved by the Board of Pardons and Paroles and submitted to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">Ala.Code 1975 \u00a7 13A-5-9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">After the district court\u2019s decision in the instant case, the Alabama Supreme Court held that \u201c \u00a7 13A-5-9.1 provides that an inmate may ask the sentencing judge or the presiding judge for relief from a previous sentence imposed pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>[A]HFOA and provides that the court is to consider the evaluation of the DOC in considering the inmate\u2019s motion.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>899 So.2d at 971. The court further held that \u00a7 13A-5-9 \u201cconfers jurisdiction on the sentencing judge or the presiding judge by giving that judge the power to apply the provisions of \u00a7 13A-5-9 retroactively to \u2018nonviolent convicted offenders\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, state trial judges have jurisdiction to consider an Alabama prisoner\u2019s motion to reconsider his sentence and the authority under the statute to determine whether the prisoner is a nonviolent offender based on factors brought before the judge in the record of the case and information submitted by the DOC and the Parole Board. <em>Id. </em>at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Here, the district court denied Curry\u2019s AHFOA habeas claim after finding that a prisoner cannot pursue relief under the AHFOA until the procedures outlined therein had been implemented by the DOC. The <em>Kirby </em>decision clearly vitiates this finding, as it held that a trial court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 13A-5-9.1 to consider a prisoner\u2019s motion for sentence reduction and to determine whether a prisoner qualifies for parole as a nonviolent offender, with or without evaluations from the DOC. <em>See Kirby, </em>899 So.2d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Section 2254, however, provides the remedy for a state prisoner who claims that he is in custody in violation of the \u201cConstitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). \u201cA state\u2019s interpretation of its own laws and rules provides no basis for federal habeas corpus relief, since no question of a constitutional nature is involved.\u201d <em>Carrizales v. Wainwright, </em>699 F.2d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Curry\u2019s claim on appeal is that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-9(e)(3) and 13A-5-9.1. This is purely a question of state law, and, as such, provides no basis for federal habeas corpus relief. <em>See Carrizales, </em>699 F.2d at 1055. Because Curry\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under Alabama state law provides no basis for federal habeas corpus relief, we affirm the denial of this \u00a7 2254 claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Kirby </em>now establishes an avenue of review for prisoners such as Curry, which Curry has not yet exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\">. In his brief, Curry also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. We granted Curry\u2019s certificate of appealability solely on the issue of his claim pursuant to <em>Kirby. As </em>such, we will only review that claim. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. We may affirm a decision of the district court \"on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied.\u201d <em>Parks v. City of Warner Robins, </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
