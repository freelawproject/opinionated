Kranovich, </em>401 F.3d 1107 (9th Cir.2005), and we now address his challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Kranovich contends the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, constituted impermissible double counting of the same conduct. First, he argues the conduct which triggered the enhancement was \u201cpart of the manner of the commission of crime,\u201d and \u201c[t]he sentencing commission fully accounted for the embezzlement activities\u201d separately from section 3C1.1. However, Kranovich\u2019s effort to impede an investigation by local authorities and the Nevada Division of Investigation was not a requisite element of his convictions under sections 666 and 641, and the obstruction of justice that resulted from his efforts to impede any investigation is a harm distinct from the fraudulent conversion accounted for by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, the Guideline applicable to offenses involving embezzled property. Kranovich relies on <em>United States v. Werlinger, </em>894 F.2d 1015 (8th Cir.1990), but the court in that case had already accounted for Werlinger\u2019s efforts to conceal his embezzlement when it applied an adjustment for \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d pursuant to the former section 2Bl.l(b)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 1017. In contrast, the district court here applied the 2002 version of section 2B1.1, which does not provide for a \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d adjustment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 617 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In addition, Kranovich argues that the section 3C1.1 enhancement was impermissible double counting because the district court also imposed an enhancement for abusing a position of trust. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.3. Although Kranovich was able to obstruct the investigations due largely to his position as Sheriff, the obstruction enhancement addresses a harm that is distinct from the harm that results when a position of public trust is abused. As we stated in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>2 F.3d 870, 895 (9th Cir.1993), \u201c[w]hen more than one kind of harm is attributable to a given aspect of a defendant\u2019s conduct, failure to enhance his punishment for each harm caused thereby would defeat the Commission\u2019s goal of proportionality in sentencing.\u201d Therefore, we reject Kranovich\u2019s double-counting challenges to the section 3C1.1 sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">However, in light of the sentencing challenge based on <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), that defense counsel raised in supplemental briefing, we grant a limited remand pursuant to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b574-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
