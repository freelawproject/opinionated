Velasquez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. Velasquez declined to file a pro se supplemental brief despite being informed of his right to do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-22\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel raises the potential issue of whether the district court complied with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) (2000). We find that Velasquez was given ample opportunity to challenge the existence of this prior conviction, and declined to do so. Accordingly, any challenge to the use of the prior conviction is precluded. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>980 F.2d 245, 252 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Velasquez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
