Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). Andrewes, whose removal order became final on May 22, 2002, continues to be detained by the Government. The magistrate judge found that <em>Zadvydas </em>did not apply to Andrewes. The district court ruled that \u201cuntil the [Immigration and Naturalization Service] is satisfied that [Andrewes] poses no danger to citizens of the United States, and in the face of his unlawful entry status, [he] may continue to be detained, pending efforts to have him removed to Tuber\u00eda.\u201d Andrewes claims the district court erred in its application of <em>Zadvydas </em>to his case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Clark v. Martinez, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), we agree. Accordingly, we vacate the order denying Andrewes\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and remand for reconsideration under <em>Martinez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">Under \u00a7 1231(a)(6), certain aliens subject to removal orders \u201cmay be detained beyond the [ninety-day] removal period.\u201d However, in <em>Zadvydas, </em>the Supreme Court construed this statute to contain an implicit \u201creasonable time\u201d limitation and presumptive limit to six months of post-removal-period detention. 533 U.S. at 682, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Moreover, the Court held that a habeas court \u201cshould measure reasonableness [of the detention in question] primarily in terms of the statute\u2019s basic purpose, namely, assuring the alien\u2019s presence at the moment of removal,\u201d and \u201cif removal is not reasonably foreseeable, the court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no longer authorized by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699-700, 121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">Following <em>Zadvydas, </em>a split in the circuit courts developed as to whether the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the statute applied to inadmissible aliens like Andrewes. In <em>Martinez, </em>the Supreme Court held that it did, explicitly \u201crejecting] the Government\u2019s argument that, under <em>Zadvydas, </em>\u00a7 1231(a)(6) \u2018authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.\u2019 \u201d 125 S.Ct. at 726. Accordingly, upon remand the district court should measure the reasonableness of Andrewes\u2019s detention primarily in terms of the statute\u2019s basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>purpose of assuring his presence at the moment of removal, and if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, should hold continued detention unreasonable and no longer authorized by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We therefore deny as moot Andrewes\u2019s pro se motion for a decision on the case at hand, and we remand to the district court for reconsideration of his \u00a7 2241 petition in light of <em>Martinez. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">. Andrewes further challenges Immigration and Naturalization Service custody review procedures as constitutionally insufficient. However, we decline to address this issue because Andrewes did not raise it in the district court. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-17\">. We note that the Government has suggested Andrewes\u2019s alleged non-cooperation is an alternative basis for Andrewes\u2019s continued detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C) (2000). Although the Government raised this issue in the district court, and Andrewes contended the provision did not apply in his case, the district court did not rule on the issue. Accordingly, the Government remains free to again assert this contention on remand, should it be inclined to do so. We indicate no view as to the appropriate resolution of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
