Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1187 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, because the record shows that the motion was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), and petitioners failed to exercise reasonable diligence waiting over a year to move to reopen after this court issued a published decision allegedly affecting the outcome of their proceedings, <em>see Socop-Gonzalez, </em>272 F.3d at 1184-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">To the extent petitioners contend the BIA should have found exceptional circumstances to grant the motion to reopen under its sua sponte authority, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
