We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Reynoso contends that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to advocate for a downward adjustment of Reynoso\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6). Because resolution of Reynoso\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires the development of facts outside the record, we decline to review it on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Hanoum, </em>33 F.3d 1128, 1131-32 (9th Cir.1994) (observing that ineffective assistance claim is more properly raised by collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory and we cannot determine from the record whether the sentence imposed would have been materially different had the district court known that the Guidelines were advisory. <em>See United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1074 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). On remand, therefore, the district court should also consider in its discretion Reynoso\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Ameline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
