The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) summarily affirmed. On behalf of all three, Oksana petitioned for review, arguing that the IJ\u2019s decision should be reversed because the IJ abused his discretion and because he failed to consider all the evidence in the record. She also argued that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure violated petitioners\u2019 due process rights. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">When the BIA does not perform an independent review of the IJ\u2019s decision and instead defers to the IJ, the court of appeals reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action. <em>San Pedro v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1156, 1156 (9th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision that an alien has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Njuguna v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 765, 769 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s determination must be upheld if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and can be reversed only if the evidence presented by Oksana \u201cwas such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">The IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding; therefore, Oksana is deemed credible. <em>Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 <em>F.3d 1134, </em>1137 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cTestimony must be accepted as true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding.\u201d). Nevertheless, accepting that Oksana\u2019s testimony is credible, her claims do not rise to the level of persecution. Oksana described a series of anonymous threatening phone calls, name-calling and minor vandalism, none of which she reported to the authorities. Such conduct does not constitute persecution. <em>See Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>340 F.3d 865, 870 n. 6 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cunspecified threats\u201d received by Mexican national not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201csufficiently menacing to constitute past persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Similarly, Sergiy\u2019s loss of employment and Oksana\u2019s placement in a lower-paying job do not in themselves constitute persecution because \u201cmere economic disadvantage alone does not rise to the level of persecution.\u201d <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that loss of employment pursuant to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action plan did not amount to persecution based on the deliberate infliction of substantial economic disadvantage).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The university\u2019s denial of admission to Oksana allegedly because she was perceived to be Jewish is properly characterized as discrimination \u2014 not persecution. Persecution \u201cdoes not include mere discrimination, as offensive as it may be.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 962 (9th Cir.1996). Moreover, Oksana\u2019s admission the following year weighs against a finding of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In addition, the record does not support Oksana\u2019s claim that government authorities searched her apartment because she was Jewish. The search warrant presented at the time of the search indicated that government authorities were investigating what appeared to be a \u201ccurrency customs\u201d documentary violation of law. The warrant sought property belonging to Sergiy\u2019s employer. In fact, the officers took only the travel case containing such property, which Sergiy admitted he had kept for his employer. Although the officers found $600 in cash, they returned it immediately to Oksana. Petitioners were never charged with any crimes, were not physically harmed or verbally threatened, and were not bothered by government officials on any other occasion. Additionally, Sergiy\u2019s parents, who were not Jewish, were also questioned and searched for property belonging to Sergiy\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Furthermore, there was evidence in the record that conditions in Ukraine had changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to the country report prepared by the State Department, there has been a resurgence of Jewish religious and cultural institutions. The report states there is no indication that anti-Semitism has any place in government policy, the government has protected the rights of the Jewish community, and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jewry and Amnesty International have active offices in Kiev. Although there are indications that antiSemitism still exists in parts of Ukraine, there is no indication from the State Department profiles that the government of Ukraine promotes or supports anti-Semitism. Oksana\u2019s expert disputed portions of the State Department report; however, he admitted that there were Jewish schools, universities, theaters, and synagogues in Ukraine and that two major Ukranian cities had Jewish mayors.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">On this record, we cannot find that the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioners did not have a well-founded fear of persecution is not supported by substantial evidence. Since petitioners\u2019 evidence did not compel a contrary finding, the IJ\u2019s conclusion must be upheld under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard set forth in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. 812. Similarly, because petitioners could not establish their eligibility for asylum, the IJ properly concluded that they were not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.2001) (the \u201c \u2018clear probability\u2019 standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard governing asylum\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Finally, petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision violated their due process rights was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>rejected in <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b729-6\">JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Alkb\">concurring specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">I concur specially because the decision reached by this court today follows circuit precedent in an opinion by the en banc court in <em>Fisher v. INS, 79 </em>F.3d 955 (9th Cir.1996). I believe the observations in <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.1998), are particularly apt.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">To me, the frequent use of the term \u201cmere discrimination\u201d is most troublesome. What is termed \u201cmere discrimination\u201d can portend much more. Such differentiation between discrimination and persecution fails to consider the events in the world commencing in the last third of the twentieth century when pervasive discrimination did indeed lead to persecution, and ultimately the Holocaust.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
