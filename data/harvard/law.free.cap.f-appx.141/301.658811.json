He maintains that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) was not applicable to this case because the district court ordered him to pay the full filing fee in installments. This contention is without merit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). We review a dismissal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae for abuse of discretion. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). A district court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on a legal error or a clearly erroneous view of the pertinent facts. <em>Esmark Apparel, Inc. v. James, </em>10 F.3d 1156, 1163 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">Stephenson argues that the district court erred by dismissing his claims for the destruction of his personal property because he cannot bring an action against the State under state law for the deprivation. A prisoner may not bring a federal claim for deprivation of property through the \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d acts of government officers, whether negligent or intentional, when state law provides an adequate remedy. <em>Sheppard v. La. Bd. of Parole, </em>873 F.2d 761, 763 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533-35, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). Texas has adequate postdeprivation remedies for the confiscation or destruction of property, such as a tort action for conversion against individual defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>dants. <em>See Cathey v. Guenther, </em>47 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Stephenson\u2019s claims for the destruction of his personal property as frivolous. <em>See Siglar, </em>112 F.3d at 193. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Stephenson contends that his complaint stated a nonfrivolous retaliation claim against Officer Harrison. In his complaint, Stephenson alleged that Officer Harrison harassed him and destroyed his family photographs in retaliation for Stephenson suing one of his colleagues. The district court determined that Stephenson\u2019s retaliation claim was frivolous because the retaliatory action allegedly taken by Officer Harrison was not an independent constitutional violation. However, a retaliatory action can be actionable if it is taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right even if it is not a constitutional violation in the absence of the improper motive. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1165 (5th Cir.1995). Stephenson\u2019s complaint stated a nonfrivolous claim that Officer Harrison retaliated against him for exercising his right of access to the courts. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003). The district court abused its discretion by dismissing Stephenson\u2019s retaliation claim against Officer Harrison. <em>See Esmark, </em>10 F.3d at 1163. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of this retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Stephenson also alleges that Officer Harrison retaliated against him for complaining about his harassment to higher ranking prison officials. Because Stephenson did not raise this factual allegation below, we have not considered it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
