We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Anyike\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s ruling on the asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of Anyike\u2019s requests for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2005). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s]he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1994)). To qualify for protection under the CAT, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Anyike failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
