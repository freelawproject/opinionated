He appeals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">I. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his claims alleging violations of the First Amendment Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), and the Establishment Clause as a result of FDOC policies that require inmates maintain no longer than medium length hair, that deny him the ability to possess materials needed to practice his religion, and that establish a Native American religious program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">II The dismissal, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, of his Equal Protection claim that Christians and inmates of other religious faiths receive more favorable treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">III. The district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">IV. The denial of his request for appointment of counsel</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Brunskill is a Native American that practices the Tobacco Indian religion. It is against his religious belief to cut or allow another to cut or touch his hair except in the case of the loss of a loved one. The FDOC\u2019s grooming policy, however, requires inmates to maintain medium length hair. As a result of this hair policy, Brunskill is required to cut his hair, despite his religious beliefs. Additionally, Brunskill requested permission to possess materials such as tobacco, sage, cedar, sweetgrass, beads, leather, thread, needles, and feathers (collectively referred to as \u201creligious materials\u201d). He indicated that these materials were necessary for the practice of his religion. The FDOC, however, denied his request for security, health, and safety reasons. In an effort to accommodate inmates that practice a Native American religion, the FDOC formed a Native American religious program to provide its staff and inmates with guidelines to better enable inmates to practice their faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">On appeal, Brunskill asserts that the FDOC\u2019s policies, which require him to cut his hair and deny him the ability to possess the requested religious materials, are unconstitutional prior restraints on the exercise of his religion. He contends that non-Indians \u201cwho are not similarly situated to \u2018natives\u2019 \u201d are allowed to exercise and obtain religious materials for the Native American religion, but he is not. He asserts that the FDOC\u2019s Native American religion program is an unconstitutional establishment of religion. He contends that the district court failed to address his RLUIPA claims and his allegation that the FDOC retaliated against him for filing grievances and a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">As a preliminary matter, although Brunskill asserts that the district court failed to address his allegations that he was retaliated against because he filed grievances and this lawsuit, Brunskill did not assert this claim in his complaint. The district court\u2019s order addresses all of the claims presented by Brunskill in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. United States v. Gilbert, </em>920 F.2d 878, 882 (11th Cir.1991). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings and evidence in the record demonstrate that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). On summary judgment, the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587-588, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356-1357, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). \u201cThe nonmoving party, however, must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>920 F.2d at 882 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cIn the summary-judgment context, we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings more liberally than those of a represented party.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1301 (11th Cir.2002). To prevail in a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show he was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Griffin v. Opar-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295,1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A. First Amendment Free Exercise Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The First Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides in pertinent part that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 1; <em>Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 2307 n. 4, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004). Prisoners retain their First Amendment rights, including rights under the free exercise of religion clause; however, \u201clawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u201d <em>O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, </em>482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 2404, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987). Deference is given to prison officials, and, as a result, courts employ a \u201creasonableness\u201d test to determine whether a regulation infringes constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 107 S.Ct. 2400.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), established four factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a regulation: (1) \u201cwhether the regulation has a valid, rational connection to a legitimate governmental interest;\u201d (2) \u201cwhether alternative means are open to inmates to exercise the asserted right;\u201d (3) \u201cwhat impact an accommodation of the right would have on guards and inmates and prison resources;\u201d and (4) \u201cwhether there are ready alternatives to the regulation.\u201d The fourth factor considers whether \u201ca prisoner has pointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates the asserted right while not imposing more than a <em>de minimis </em>cost to the valid penological goal.\u201d <em>Overton v. Bazzetta, </em>539 U.S. 126, 136, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 2169, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Rule 33-602.101(4) of the Florida Administrative Code provides in pertinent part that: \u201cMale inmates shall have their hair cut short to medium uniform length at all times with no part of the ear or collar covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">In <em>Harris v. Chapman, </em>97 F.3d 499, 503-504 (11th Cir.1996), applying a strict scrutiny standard pursuant to the RFRA, we determined that a nearly identical FDOC hair length policy did not violate the First Amendment and RFRA since it furthered a compelling governmental interest in security and order in the prisons, and the policy was the least restrictive means of satisfying the governmental interest. The provision at issue in <em>Harris, </em>stated, in pertinent part, that: \u201c[mjale inmates shall have their hair cut short to medium length at all times with no part of the ear or collar covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501-502. In <em>Harris, </em>we employed a higher standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>than the more deferential \u201creasonableness\u201d test discussed in <em>O\u2019Lone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Because we have determined, under a more stringent standard of review, that an almost identical FDOC policy did not violate constitutionally protected religious freedoms, the district court, in this case, did not err in determining that Boyd and Crosby were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Additionally, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on BrunsMll\u2019s First Amendment religious materials claim since Brunskill failed to offer evidence that would rebut the defendants\u2019 argument that: 1 (1) the denial of Brunskill\u2019s request for materials was rationally related to the FDOC\u2019s legitimate health, safety, and security interests; (2) despite the denial of his request, he is allowed to practice his religion through alternative means; (3) accommodating his request would have a negative impact on guards, inmates and prison resources; and (4) he offered regulatory alternatives that are not already available that would accommodate his right while not imposing more than a <em>de minimis </em>cost to the FDOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">B. Establishment Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment states, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 1. \u201cThis restriction has been made applicable to states, as well as state-created entities and them employees, through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1284 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe Establishment Clause applies not only to state statutes, but acts and decisions of individual government actors ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"><em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), sets forth three factors for use in determining whether the FDOC\u2019s Native American program is permissible under the Establishment Clause: (1) whether the program has a secular non-legislative purpose; (2) whether the principal or primary effect is one that neither advances <em>nor </em>inhibits religion; and (3) whether the statute fosters an excessive government entanglement with religion. \u201cThe clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\u201d <em>Glassroth v. Moore, </em>335 F.3d 1282, 1299 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Brunskfil\u2019s Establishment Clause claim since Brunskill offered no evidence that the FDOC demonstrated preference for one religious denomination over another and did not rebut Boyd and Crosby\u2019s assertion that the FDOC\u2019s program satisfies the <em>Lemon </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">C. RFRA and RLUIPA</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">In <em>City of Boeme v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 536, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2172, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997), the Supreme Court held that the RFRA was unconstitutional as applied to the states because it exceeded Congress\u2019s power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the RFRA does not apply to state regulations or state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">The RLUIPA, on the other hand, is constitutional and does apply to the states. <em>Benning v. Georgia, </em>391 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSection 3 of the RLUIPA applies strict scrutiny to government actions that substantially burden the religious exercise of institutionalized persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1303. The government must show that the imposition of the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ec-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The district court did not err in determining that Boyd and Crosby were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Brunskiirs claims under the RFRA since the RFRA is no longer applicable to the states. Additionally, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Brunskill\u2019s RLUIPA claims since the hair length policy and denial of his request for religious materials are the least restrictive means in furthering compelling governmental interests in the security, health, and safety of inmates and staff. Furthermore, Brunskill failed to show that the denial of his requested religious materials substantially burdened the exercise of his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">D. Equal Protection Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201cTo establish an equal protection claim, a prisoner must establish that (1) he is similarly situated with other prisoners who received more favorable treatment; and (2) his discriminatory treatment was based on some constitutionally protected interest such as race.\u201d <em>Jones v. Ray, </em>279 F.3d 944, 946-947 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Brunskill\u2019s Equal Protection claims regarding the hair length policy and denial of the requested religious materials. Brunskill failed to establish an equal protection claim as he offered no evidence that other similarly situated prisoners were treated more favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Next, Brunskill appeals the denial of his equal protection claim asserting that the FDOC was more accommodating to Christians and other religious faiths. He asserts that the district court erred in determining that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies and did not address his contention that exhaustion of administrative remedies would have been ineffective or futile, and unavailable as a result of state and federal rulings in prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) <em>de novo. Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.1998). Pursuant to section 1997(e) of the PLRA, a prisoner cannot bring a suit under any federal law until the prisoner has exhausted all available administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>The PLRA applies to both state and federal prisoners. <em>Id. </em>at 1324. Because Congress specifically mandated administrative exhaustion, there is no futility exception. <em>Id. </em>at 1325-1326. Additionally, \u201cavailable administrative remedies\u201d does not mean that the administrative remedies must be adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Because Brunskill did not file grievances with the FDOC regarding the preferential treatment of Christians and inmates of other religions, he failed to administratively exhaust this claim and the district court did not err in dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Brunskill also disputes the district court\u2019s decision declining to exercise federal jurisdiction over his state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Raney v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1088-1089 (11th Cir.2004). \u2018We have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when, as here, the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">Since no federal claims remained in the suit, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>mental jurisdiction over Brunskill\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">During the course of the proceedings below, Brunskill requested appointment of counsel. The court denied his request without prejudice, stating that it would determine the complexity of the issues involved in the case and would, on its own motion, appoint counsel at a later time if necessary. The court again denied Brunskill\u2019s request upon his motion to reconsider. On appeal, Brunskill asserts that the district court failed to address or make a reasonable ruling regarding his motion to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We review a district court\u2019s motion to appoint counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004). A plaintiff in a civil case does not have a constitutional right to counsel, and the court should only appoint counsel in exceptional circumstances. <em>Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Because exceptional circumstances did not exist in this case since the core facts of the case were not in dispute and the legal claims were straightforward, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brunskill\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Upon review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. For the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
