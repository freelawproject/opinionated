We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Petitioners contend that they were denied their due process rights to a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d in their removal proceedings, a claim that we review de novo. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We will reverse the BIA\u2019s decision on due process grounds if (1) \u201cthe proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his ease,\u201d and (2) prejudiced ensued. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The BIA affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision. We accordingly review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action. <em>Avendano-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The removal proceedings at issue here did not violate the petitioners\u2019 due process rights. <em>Id. </em>Petitioners were granted substantial time and multiple continuances to prepare for their merits hearing. Prior to receiving their final continuance, the parents were specifically warned by the IJ that they would not receive any further continuances for lack of preparation or communication between the petitioners and their counsel. Both parents stated that they understood that their case would go forward at the next hearing, with or without an attorney, prepared or unprepared. <em>See </em>Transcript of Hearing, Certified Administrative Record, at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The parents had also been advised, in advance, of their obligations in presenting a claim, <em>see id. </em>at 158, and the IJ provided ample opportunity throughout the merits removal hearing for the petitioners to present their evidence. None of petitioners\u2019 contentions convince us that the proceedings before the IJ were fundamentally unfair or that the petitioners were \u201cprevented from reasonably presenting [their] case[s].\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b651-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
