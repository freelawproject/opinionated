We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Varela v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1237, 1239 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ahmad\u2019s second motion to reopen as numerically barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (limiting party to one motion to reopen). Although we have recognized equitable tolling of the numerical limits where a petitioner\u2019s first motion to reopen was wasted through no fault of his own, Ahmad does not allege any such facts. <em>Cf. Varela, </em>204 F.3d at 1240 (applying equitable tolling where fraudulent counsel filed \u201cworthless\u201d first motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">We do not reach the underlying merits of Ahmad\u2019s second motion to reopen. To the extent Ahmad seeks review of an immigration judge\u2019s prior determination that he received proper notice of his November 1998 hearing, we lack jurisdiction because he failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 2002 order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
