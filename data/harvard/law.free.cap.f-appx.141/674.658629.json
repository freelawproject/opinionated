The district court concluded that it could not apply the career offender, bodily injury to victims, and amount of loss enhancements to Hughes. Accordingly, Hughes\u2019 sentence was not imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment. However, the government is entitled to a remand for resentencing under the now-advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that even though respondent\u2019s sentence was authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict and thus presented no Sixth Amendment violation, \u201cthe Government (and the defendant should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in today\u2019s opinions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">2. Applying <em>Booker </em>in this case results in no violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process clause. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that the retroactive application of Booker\u2019s remedial holding does not offend due process). <em>Booker </em>expressly provided for its application to <em>all </em>cases on direct review. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (\u201c[W]e must apply today\u2019s holdings \u2014 both the Sixth Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act \u2014 to <em>all cases on direct review. </em>\u201d) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see also Dupas, </em>419 F.3d at -. Moreover, Hughes faces the same statutory maximum sentence as he did <em>pre-Booker.
