HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">Applicant Andrew Red Star, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his application for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. As a federal prisoner proceeding under \u00a7 2241, Applicant does not need a certificate of appealability. <em>See McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n., </em>115 F.3d 809, 810 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997). Because the issues he raises on appeal are different from those he brought before the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-20\">Applicant pleaded guilty to assault in an administrative disciplinary proceeding and was sanctioned to a loss of telephone and commissary privileges for 45 days, 15 days segregation, and forfeiture of 14 days of good-time credit. Before the district court, Applicant sought expungement of this disciplinary report based on a procedural error \u2014 namely, failure to conduct a hearing before the Unit Discipline Committee within three days. Finding that the error resulted in only a brief delay and that the administrative-appeals process and subsequent rehearing adequately protected Applicant\u2019s rights, the district court denied habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-21\">On appeal Applicant argues that the district court erred in not ordering Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>dent to file an answer to his procedural claim. He also contends that he was not allowed to call witnesses or present evidence in the disciplinary proceeding. Nothing in the record indicates that Applicant raised these issues before the district court. Generally, \u201ca federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d <em>In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applicant \u201cdoes not argue on appeal that any special circumstance requires us to address [his] eontention[s] despite lack of preservation below.\u201d <em>United States v. Windrix, </em>405 F.3d 1146, 1156 (10th Cir.2005). Therefore, we do not consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10 th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
