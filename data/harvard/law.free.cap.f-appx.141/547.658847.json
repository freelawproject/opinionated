Because the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam), and we review due process claims de novo, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Zhang\u2019s motion to reopen because notice of the deportation hearing was sent to and received by Zhang\u2019s attorney of record. <em>See Garcia, </em>222 F.3d at 1209 (holding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">Zhang\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining decision violated his right to due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review Zhang\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s failure to reopen pursuant to his discretionary authority. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">All remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b576-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
