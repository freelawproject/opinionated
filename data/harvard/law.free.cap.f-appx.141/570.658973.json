We affirm his conviction, but remand his sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Bustamante-Rocha asserts four challenges to his conviction. We reject them in turn. First, the facts established at trial were sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the district court. Although Bustamante-Rocha was arrested while he was under official restraint at the port of entry and therefore not \u201cin the United States\u201d as that phrase has been defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act, he nevertheless crossed the boundary into U.S. territory and thus violated the attempt provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Leos-Maldonado, </em>302 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2002). These facts support the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Second, these facts are also sufficient to support Bustamante-Rocha\u2019s conviction. Contrary to his assertion, \u201c[t]he mere fact that an alien is under official restraint does not make substantial steps toward entry impossible.\u201d <em>Leos-Maldonado, </em>302 F.3d at 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Third, the indictment, which we construe liberally in favor of validity, adequately alleged the essential elements of attempted entry. The indictment not only referenced the appropriate statute, <em>see United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 847 (9th Cir.2002), but also charged that Bustamante-Rocha \u201cattempted\u201d to enter the United States, incorporating a term with \u201cwell-established common law\u201d elements that include \u201can overt act which is a substantial step towards committing the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Gracidas-Ulibarry, </em>231 F.3d 1188, 1191-92 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">Fourth, testimony that Bustamante-Rocha appeared to be \u201csmuggl[ing][a] female in\u201d when he attempted entry was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with evidence of the charged offense and therefore fell outside the scope of Federal Rule1 of Evidence 404(b). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>291 F.3d 1180, 1189 (9th Cir.2002). The testimony was necessary \u201cto offer a coherent and comprehensible story\u201d of Bustamante-Rocha\u2019s unsuccessful attempt, <em>United States v. DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d 1203, 1220 (9th Cir.2004), and specifically, to explain why he was referred to secondary inspection even though he informed the inspector that he was a U.S. citizen and presented U.S. identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">For these reasons, we affirm as to Bustamante-Rocha\u2019s conviction. As to his sentence, we remand pursuant to <em>Ameline. </em>Because Bustamante-Rocha\u2019s sentence was enhanced based solely on his prior conviction, his sentence does not present a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1077. It does, however, present a \u201cnonconstitutional error\u201d in that it \u201cwas erroneously imposed under guidelines believed to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1084. We accordingly grant a limited remand pursuant to <em>Ame</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>line. See United v. Moreno-Hernandez, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, No. 03-30387, 2005 WL 1560269, *9 (9th Cir.
