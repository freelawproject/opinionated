Orea-Rodriguez was previously removed from the United States on the basis of a conviction under Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 453.3385. The district court, as did the immigration judge (\u201cLJ\u201d) presiding over Orea-Rodriguez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>prior removal proceedings, concluded that Orea-Rodriguez\u2019s prior conviction under Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 453.3385 was a drug trafficking offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Orea-Rodriguez has a Fifth Amendment right to collaterally attack his removal order because the removal order serves as a predicate element of his conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 837-38, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). He contends that his conviction under Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 453.3385 was not a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and that the IJ\u2019s contrary conclusion rendered his underlying removal fundamentally unfair.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The written plea agreement signed by Orea-Rodriguez and submitted by the government states that Orea-Rodriguez pled guilty to \u201cTrafficking in [a] Controlled Substance (Felony \u2014 NRS 453.3385), as more fully alleged in the charging document. ...\u201d The Nevada information, also submitted by the government, charged Orea-Rodriguez with conduct that constituted drug trafficking. Thus, as the IJ and district court correctly concluded, the judicially noticeable documents in the record of conviction clearly establish that Orea Rodriguez pled guilty to a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (concluding that a court conducting the modified categorical approach under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), may rely on the charging document and written plea agreement). Because Orea-Rodriguez\u2019s prior conviction under Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 453.3385 was properly categorized as a drug trafficking offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment is</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-24\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary to aid in the understanding of this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\">. As a result of categorizing his conviction under Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 453.3385 as a drug trafficking crime under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), Orea-Rodriguez was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and ineligible for certain forms of discretionary relief. <em>See e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
