INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of proof of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We find that Ho failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court to demonstrate her eligibility for either form of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Accordingly, we deny the' petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\">. Ho correctly notes that we lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her asylum application was untimely filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, 377 </em>F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-19\">. To the extent that Ho argues that the immigration judge failed to properly develop the record to allow for meaningful appellate review, we find that this argument lacks merit. Our review of the record reveals that the immigration judge\u2019s opinion is thorough, well-reasoned, and adequately explains the basis for the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
