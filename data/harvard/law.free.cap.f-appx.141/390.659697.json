Zollino, however, is still incarcerated; therefore, he was not entitled to petition the district court for a writ of coram nobis. <em>United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 887 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (5th Cir.1999). Zollino\u2019s pro se motion to vacate the orders issuing writs of garnishment was a de facto attack on the criminal judgment and restitution order, and, therefore, it also lacked a jurisdictional basis. <em>See id. </em>at 886-87. Zollino\u2019s motions were unauthorized, and, consequently, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain them. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
