He argues that the district court erred in assessing a two-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) on the basis that he possessed a weapon during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense. The district court applied the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) adjustment because the search of Charles\u2019s vehicle (in which the cocaine was found) revealed the presence of a loaded semiautomatic pistol. Charles has not satisfied the burden of showing a clear improbability that there was a connection between the drugs and the weapon. <em>See United States v. Marmolejo, </em>106 F.3d 1213, 1216 (5th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). Thus, the district court did not err in applying the two-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">Charles argues for the first time on appeal that the facts supporting the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) adjustment were neither admitted by him nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, thus the adjustment violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>reet an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (8) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 516, 520 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517). Charles cannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test as he cannot show \u201cthat the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d or undermines confidence in those proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 521 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). After finding that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) adjustment was applicable, the court sentenced Charles to the minimum sentence required by statute. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the court would have imposed a lower sentence. In fact, the court was bound by statute to sentence Charles to at least five years of imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii)(II). Thus, Charles cannot demonstrate plain error in the his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
