INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, however, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">To obtain withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant \u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution,\u201d based on his political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). We review for substantial evidence the determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 905-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Morales contends that the IJ erred by determining that he had not shown it was more likely than not he would be subjected to persecution because of his former employment as a police officer, if he returned to El Salvador. The record does not compel a finding that Morales met his burden to show that he was entitled to withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir.2004). Thus, Morales has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
