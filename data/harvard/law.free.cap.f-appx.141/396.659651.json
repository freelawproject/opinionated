He argues that Amendment 591 to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, coupled with principles set forth in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), demonstrate that his sentence should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-24\">Amendment 591 made no downward modification to the guideline under which Causey was sentenced in 1996. <em>See </em>Amendment 591, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C, p. 30 (2002); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1 (1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1 (1995). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Amendment 591 provided no bases for modification of Causey\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Moreover, to the <em>extent </em>that Causey seeks to challenge his sentence based on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>by filing a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, he has failed to make the requisite prima facie showing either that his claim is based on newly discovered evidence or that he relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 212 (5th Cir.2005). He therefore does not meet the standard for filing a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Elwood, </em>408 F.3d at 212. The district court also did not err when it declined to address Causey\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claims, because Causey did not have permission of this court to proceed on a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
