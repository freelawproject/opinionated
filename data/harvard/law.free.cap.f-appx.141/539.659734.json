R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">William S. Cain, M.D., a doctor at Avenal State Prison where appellee Mark Farquhar was incarcerated, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for summary judgment and reconsideration in Farquhar\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Cain did not raise the issue of qualified immunity in his motion for summary judgment and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s determination that the parties\u2019 evidence presents genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Lee v. Gregory, </em>363 F.3d 931, 932 (9th Cir.2004) (district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment is not appealable unless the ground for the motion is qualified immunity). Although Cain asserted in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report recommending denial of the summary judgment motion that he was entitled to qualified immunity, the district court properly declined to address this issue when it adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations. <em>See Greenhow v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>863 F.2d 633, 638-39 (9th Cir.1988) (district court properly ruled that issues raised for the first time in objections to magistrate\u2019s report had been waived), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Hardesty, </em>977 F.2d 1347, 1348 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cain\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which raised the qualified immunity issue, because Cain did not show new evidence, legal error or a change in the law. <em>See Carroll v. Nakatani, </em>342 F.3d 934, 940, 945 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, the district court properly determined that <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), did not modify the well-established standards for a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim based on lack of access to medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Cain\u2019s motion to attach an appendix to the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">DISMISSED in part, AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
