The order, which derives from the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>see Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Mann has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Additionally, we have determined that Mann\u2019s self-styled motion under Rule 59(e) is, in substance, a successive motion attacking his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206-07 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). We therefore treat Mann\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and deny such authorization. <em>See id. </em>at 208; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
