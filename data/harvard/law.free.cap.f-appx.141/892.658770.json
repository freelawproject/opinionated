In its previous order, the BIA had affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Naturalization Act and for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider is within the discretion of the [BIA].... \u201d). A motion to reconsider must set forth either an error of law or an error of fact in the prior BIA decision, and must be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Garzon\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to set forth any error in the BIA\u2019s previous order. Instead, it simply restated her argument that her mother had been granted asylum based on the same facts she alleged, an argument that both the BIA and the IJ had previously considered and rejected. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Garzon\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">In her brief, Garz\u00f3n also challenges the BIA\u2019s first order, in which it affirmed the denial of her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">We do not consider this challenge because it is not properly before us. Garz\u00f3n did not file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal or its rejection of her additional evidence. A petition for review must be filed no later than thirty days after the date of the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Here, the BIA\u2019s first order was entered on August 31, 2004, and Garzon\u2019s petition for review was not filed until December 6, 2004, more than three months later. It makes no difference that Garz\u00f3n filed a motion for reconsideration. That does not toll the time for seeking judicial review of the final order of removal. <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 248 (7th Cir.2004); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
