The BIA denied Reyes\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this decision on June 8, 2004. Reyes filed his petition for review on July 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We are required to examine jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>See Williams v. Chater, </em>87 F.3d 702, 704 (5th Cir.1996). Reyes had 30 days to file a timely petition for review from the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Ibrik v. INS, </em>108 F.3d 596, 597 (5th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which requires its own petition for review. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 401-02, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Because Reyes did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen until more than three months after this decision, his petition for review is not timely as to the March 17, 2004 decision. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this decision, and the petition to review it is DISMISSED. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Although Reyes\u2019s petition for review is timely as to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, he has not made any arguments regarding this decision. Therefore, he has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his motion for reconsideration, and, to the extent that his petition for review may be construed as extending to that decision, it is DENIED. <em>See Al-Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 33 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
