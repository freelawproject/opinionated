Her claims \u2014 arising under the Equal Protection Clause and the First Amendment \u2014 involve the sheriffs allegedly inadequate and impermissible response to her complaint that she was sexually harassed by a fellow officer. That officer was asked to resign and subsequently resolved his civil dispute with Mikkelsen in a settlement. Mikkelsen\u2019s only remaining claims are against Sheriff DeWitt in his individual capacity as her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">We hold that these claims were properly dismissed. The evidence does not establish, as it must, that the sheriff demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to a risk that women like Mikkelsen were being sexually harassed. <em>Shaw v. Stroud, </em>13 F.3d 791, 799 (4th Cir.1994). Nor does it show that the sheriff retaliated against Mikkelsen because she complained. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">H. Wayne DeWitt is the sheriff of Berkeley County, South Carolina. Addie Mikkelsen worked for the Berkeley County Sheriffs Office as a court security officer from 1997 to 2000, and again from 2001 to 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">According to Mikkelsen, beginning in December 2001 she began to receive unwanted attention from her immediate supervisor, Lieutenant Henry Broughton. Mikkelsen says Broughton made several sexual advances towards her \u2014 including attempting to kiss her and transmitting several inappropriate pager messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">In January 2002, Mikkelsen reported her allegations up the chain of command at the sheriffs office, and they came to DeWitt\u2019s attention on January 17. The following day, Sheriff DeWitt placed Broughton on paid administrative leave. Mikkelsen then retained an attorney who wrote a letter on her behalf summarizing Broughton\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">Shortly thereafter DeWitt contacted Marie Wauben, the County\u2019s Director of Human Resources, and asked her to conduct an investigation into the matter. Wauben testified that she was asked by DeWitt to be an \u201cindependent fact-finder\u201d and \u201cthird-party investigator\u201d into Mikkelsen\u2019s allegations. Outside of this investigation, Wauben had no relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>DeWitt or the deputies of the Berkeley County Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Wauben took eight weeks to complete her investigation. She ultimately concluded that some of Mikkelsen\u2019s allegations were credible (specifically the ones involving the inappropriate pager messages). However, she further determined that Mikkelsen herself had also engaged in inappropriate conduct. She informed DeWitt of reports that Mikkelsen had, among other things, left flirtatious messages on napkins for Broughton and had been seen massaging his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Based on this information, Sheriff DeWitt sent two letters. He sent a letter to Broughton asking him to resign or face termination. Broughton chose to retire on March 15, 2002. Four days later, DeWitt sent a letter to Mikkelsen accusing her of conduct unbecoming of an officer. He presented her with the same choice he gave Broughton. Mikkelsen\u2019s job was terminated on March 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Mikkelsen says the allegations in her termination letter are mere \u201cgossip.\u201d She argues that DeWitt erroneously credited them and impermissibly shifted the focus of the investigation away from Broughton\u2019s conduct and to her own. According to Mikkelsen, DeWitt has had a history of hostility towards sexual harassment claims since one was once publicly made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Mikkelsen filed suit in federal court for the district of South Carolina naming Berkeley County, Sheriff DeWitt (in his personal capacity), and Lt. Broughton as defendants. She settled her claims against Broughton, and the claims against the County were dismissed on summary judgment and have not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The only counts before us, therefore, are the two constitutional claims against Sheriff DeWitt. Mikkelsen argues that the sheriff violated her Equal Protection rights by perpetuating a policy of discouraging sexual harassment complaints. She further claims that DeWitt violated her First Amendment rights by demoting her to clerical duties and then firing her in retaliation for reporting Broughton. The district court found for DeWitt on summary judgment, and we review that finding de novo. <em>TFWS, Inc. v. Schaefer, </em>325 F.3d 234, 236 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">We first address Mikkelsen\u2019s Equal Protection claim. Mikkelsen accuses DeWitt of creating a work environment where sexual harassment complaints are discouraged, such that potential harassers may proceed uninhibited by a threat of consequences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201c[Ijntentional sexual harassment of employees by persons acting under color of state law violates the Fourteenth Amendment and is actionable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Beardsley v. Webb, </em>30 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1994). Assuming a constitutional violation occurred here, however, does not by itself resolve the question at hand. To take advantage of the remedy afforded by \u00a7 1983, Mikkelsen must prove that DeWitt is liable for the violation under some recognized theory of fault. <em>See Collins v. City of Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 120, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992). Her theory is that DeWitt is liable for Broughton\u2019s actions because he created a \u201cpolicy\u201d effectively permitting male officers to freely harass their female co-workers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">First, a point of clarification. Mikkelsen\u2019s contention that Sheriff DeWitt is a \u201cpolicy maker\u201d does not quite capture the relevant issue here. Debating whether a public employer has adopted an unconstitutional \u201ccustom\u201d or \u201cpolicy\u201d is a question to be asked when examining the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>municipal </em>liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, <em>98 S.Ct. </em>2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). It is not the right question to ask when confronting a supervisor\u2019s potential liability in his individual capacity. <em>See Randall v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>302 F.3d 188, 206, 210 (4th Cir.2002) (inquiring into the existence of a policy to assess municipal liability, but employing separate analysis to determine individual supervisor\u2019s liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In this case, Mikkelsen\u2019s claims against Berkeley County are not before us; the only remaining defendant is Sheriff DeWitt in his personal capacity. Therefore, as our precedent makes clear, to hold DeWitt responsible for Broughton\u2019s behavior, DeWitt\u2019s conduct must meet the test for \u201csupervisory liability.\u201d And our analysis on that question is guided by the test enunciated in <em>Shaw v. Stroud, </em>13 F.3d 791 (4th Cir.1994). <em>See also Randall, </em>302 F.3d at 206 (using <em>Shaw </em>test to assess supervisory liability of an individual); <em>Tigrett v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., </em>290 F.3d 620, 630-31 (4th Cir.2002) (same); <em>Baynard v. Malone, </em>268 F.3d 228, 235 (4th Cir.2001) (same).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Shaw </em>teaches that \u201csupervisory officials may be held liable in certain circumstances for the constitutional injuries inflicted by their subordinates.\u201d 13 F.3d at 798. Such liability \u201cis not premised upon respondeat superior but upon \u2018a recognition that supervisory indifference or tacit authorization of subordinates\u2019 misconduct may be a causative factor in the constitutional injuries they inflict on those committed to their care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Slakan v. Porter, </em>737 F.2d 368, 372-73 (4th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Three elements are required to establish supervisor liability under \u00a7 1983. A plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(1) that the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge that his subordinate was engaged in conduct that posed a pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury to citizens like the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">(2) that the supervisor\u2019s response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to show deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">(3) that there was an affirmative causal link between the supervisor\u2019s inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-13\"><em>Shaw, </em>13 F.3d at 799 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">While it is questionable whether Mikkelsen satisfies any of these three elements, our focus here will be on the second one. We must determine whether DeWitt demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the presence of sexual harassment in his office. <em>Id. </em>Mikkelsen must prove that DeWitt showed \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of documented widespread abuses.\u201d <em>Slakan, </em>737 F.2d at 373. \u201cDeliberate indifference is a very high standard \u2014 a showing of mere negligence will not meet it.\u201d <em>Gray</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>son v. Peed, </em>195 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1999). As such, \u201ca supervisory official who responds reasonably to a known risk is not deliberately indifferent even if the harm is not averted.\u201d <em>Baynard v. Malone, </em>268 F.3d 228, 236 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">To assess whether Sheriff Dewitt responded reasonably to the risk that his female employees were being subject to sexual harassment, we are helped by considering his response to the allegations in this very case. One day after learning of Mikkelsen\u2019s complaint, DeWitt put the alleged offender on administrative leave. Shortly thereafter, he contacted an independent fact-finder to conduct an investigation into the matter. This investigator, in fact, testified that rarely had she seen an employer respond so promptly. Following her investigation, DeWitt immediately asked Broughton to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Sheriff DeWitt\u2019s reaction was thus rapid, reasonable, and appropriate. If, as Mikkelsen contends, DeWitt was predisposed to ignore sexual harassment complaints, then his conduct toward her specific complaint is inexplicable. Regardless of the ultimate fallout from the investigation, it is hard to accept Mikkelsen\u2019s contention that Dewitt does not permit sexual harassment complaints to be investigated when his actions here do not fit that pattern at all. We thus cannot find that DeWitt demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to sexual harassment complaints, and we therefore cannot hold him liable for Broughton\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Mikkelsen next claims that DeWitt violated her First Amendment rights by firing her in retaliation for protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">It is true that public employees may not be fired in retaliation for speaking on matters of public concern. <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <em>see also Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). The parties ask us to weigh in on a debate among the circuits regarding whether complaints of sexual harassment count as such public matters. <em>Compare Azzaro v. County of Allegheny, </em>110 F.3d 968, 978-79 (3d Cir.1997) (finding them to be public matters) <em>with Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., </em>4 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir.1993) (finding them not to be public matters where the complaints were personal in nature and did not \u201cimplicate[ ] system-wide discrimination\u201d). The answer to this question may very well change depending on the specific circumstances involved. But in any event, we need not grapple with the issue today because there is no evidence that DeWitt retaliated against Mikkelsen for any speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">An essential component of any public employee\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim is proving a \u201ccausal relationship between the protected speech and the retaliatory employment action.\u201d <em>Love-Lane v. Martin, </em>355 F.3d 766, 776 (4th Cir.2004). Plaintiff must establish \u201cthat the protected speech was a substantial factor in the decision to take the allegedly retaliatory action.\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Chestnut Ridge Volunteer Fire Co., </em>218 F.3d 337, 352 (4th Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Although we must defer to Mikkelsen\u2019s version of the events leading to her claim, <em>id. </em>at 356, it is still not apparent that DeWitt fired her because she reported Broughton. Several undisputed faets belie any such argument. Mikkelsen\u2019s speech'\u2014 her complaint about Broughton \u2014 prompted DeWitt to immediately initiate an investigation. It was not until eight weeks later, after much evidence was gathered through the independent investigator\u2019s review, that DeWitt decided to terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>employment of both Mikkelsen and Broughton. It is difficult for plaintiff to contend that DeWitt would waste the time and resources required for such an investigation if his goal was simply to retaliate against Mikkelsen for making the complaint in the first place. On the contrary, his actions indicate a supervisor who was quite responsive to the initial allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Moreover, there is a far more compelling explanation for Mikkelsen\u2019s termination \u2014 namely, the reports of Mikkelsen\u2019s misconduct that came to light from Wauben\u2019s investigation. Even if, as Mikkelsen urges, the reports of her flirtatious conduct were unfounded, that does not alter the fact that DeWitt could reasonably have believed in their veracity. DeWitt made a decision to fire Mikkelsen only after learning of the investigation\u2019s results. No evidence exists to indicate that DeWitt fired Mikkelsen for her initial complaint rather than for the subsequent reports of her inappropriate behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Allegations of sexual harassment are a serious matter, and many of Broughton\u2019s actions towards Mikkelsen give cause for real concern. However, Sheriff DeWitt did not sit idly by. After placing Broughton on leave immediately and contacting an independent fact-finder to conduct an investigation, we are hard pressed to fault the sheriff for being \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to sexual harassment complaints. Since DeWitt responded reasonably to Mikkelsen\u2019s allegations and because we find no evidence to suggest he fired her for making them, he is not hable to Mikkelsen under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> The district court approached this question in a different manner. It held that DeWitt\u2019s potential liability should be analyzed using the Supreme Court\u2019s Title VII standards \u2014 as modified by <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) and <em>Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). It is important to remember, as the district court briefly noted, that <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Burlington </em>govern liability standards for employers, not for supervisors in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">In any event, even after <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Burlington, </em>our court has held that \u201d[e]mployees are not liable in their individual capacities for Title VII violations.\u2019\u2019 <em>Lissau v. S. Food Serv., Inc., </em>159 F.3d 177, 178 (4th Cir.1998). Thus, even under this alternative analysis, Mikkelsen\u2019s claim would fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
