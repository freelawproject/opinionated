The hearing officers were sued both in their individual and official capacities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court found that Hardin\u2019s state law claims were barred by his failure to give the <em>ante-litem </em>notice required by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 36-33-5. The district court also found that Hardin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u00a7 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants were barred by qualified immunity and that his \u00a7 1983 claims against the Official Defendants failed as a matter of law because he had not stated facts estabhshing a federal constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">On appeal, Hardin first argues that the Defendants violated his Sixth Amendment rights by improperly adjudicating his ordinance violations in administrative proceedings. We construe this argument as contending that Hardin stated valid \u00a7 1983 claims based upon the violation of his Sixth Amendment rights and that the district court erred in dismissing Hardin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants and granting the Official Defendants summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims against them. Second, Hardin argues that, because the Individual Defendants exceeded their authority under state law, the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claims against them. Third, Hardin argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Lastly, we note that arguments not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are generally considered waived. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 (11th Cir.2003). Because Hardin\u2019s initial brief did not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his state law claims were barred by his failure to provide proper <em>ante-litem </em>notice, we decline to address Hardin\u2019s argument that the city ordinances under which he was fined were preempted by Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">\u2018We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2003) (stating standard of review in \u00a7 1983 case). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence establishes \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>accord McCormick, </em>333 F.3d at 1243. Because the district court granted the Official Defendants summary judgment on Hardin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, the above standard of review applies to its disposition of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny the defense of qualified immunity on a motion to' dismiss, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003). Because Hardin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants were dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity, this standard of review applies to Hardin\u2019s claims against the Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">When a defendant asserts the defense of qualified immunity, \u201cthe first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged; second, assuming the violation is established, the question whether the right was clearly established must be considered.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Thus, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hardin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants was appropriate if Hardin did not aver facts which would constitute the violation of a federal constitutional right. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, to suceed with his \u00a7 1983 claims against the Official Defendants, Hardin must establish a violation of a federal constitutional or statutory right. <em>Schwier v. Cox, </em>340 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, if Hardin did not create a question of material fact as to whether his federal constitutional rights were violated, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ment to the Official Defendants on the \u00a7 1983 claims was proper. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\u201cIt is well-established that the Sixth Amendment, like the common law, reserves th[e] jury trial right for prosecutions of serious offenses, and that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision.\u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 322, 325, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 2166, 135 L.Ed.2d 590 (1996). Furthermore, \u201c[a]n offense carrying a maximum prison term of six months or less is presumed petty, unless the legislature has authorized additional statutory penalties so severe as to indicate that the legislature considered the offense serious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 116 S.Ct. at 2166-67. Similarly, the Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel extends only to cases in which the Accused is actually imprisoned. <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 661, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 1769,152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In the instant case, none of the ordinances which Hardin was accused of violating carried the potential of a custodial sentence, nor does Hardin argue that any such sentence was imposed. Accordingly, Hardin was not entitled to a trial by jury or appointed counsel, and the denial of these procedural safeguards did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We construe Hardin\u2019s argument that the Individual Defendants exceeded their authority under state law as contending that, because the defendants\u2019 actions were not authorized by state law, the district court erred in granting them qualified immunity. However, for the reasons that follow, we find it unnecessary to address whether the Individual Defendants exceeded their authority under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In the instant case, Hardin has waived any \u00a7 1983 claim premised upon the violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment by not arguing such a theory in his initial brief. <em>See Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1242. Furthermore, while Hardin\u2019s first and second assignments of error in his appellate brief arguably contend that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated, this argument is without merit for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, to the extent Hardin has not waived his constitutional claims, he has not properly alleged facts which would represent a violation of his federal constitutional rights and, therefore, did not plead a valid \u00a7 1983 cause of action. Accordingly, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Individual Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hardin\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants was still proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). However, a district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss a complaint without leave to amend is severely restricted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which requires that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>accord Bryant, 252 </em>F.3d at 1163. Nevertheless, a district court need not grant leave to amend \u201cwhere amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>252 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In the instant case, the district corut concluded that' Hardin\u2019s state law claims were barred by his failure to give proper <em>ante-litem </em>notice, and Hardin has not challenged this finding on appeal. Accordingly, because Hardin has waived the right to contest a fatal defect in his state law claims, these claims are no longer at issue. Furthermore, Hardin has not indicated what additional facts he would like to plead in support of his federal law claims, much less how any such facts would establish a \u00a7 1983 cause of action. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hardin\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Upon review of the district court record and briefs on appeal, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-14\">.
