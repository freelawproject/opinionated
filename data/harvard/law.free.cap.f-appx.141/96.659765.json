See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Alfredo Castillo Reyes, a native and citizen of Cuba, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) habeas corpus proceeding challenging his detention pursuant to a detainer lodged by the former Immigration and Nationalization Service (INS). Reyes claimed in the district court that the detainer was improperly filed and enforced, and that his continued detention pursuant to the detainer was unlawful because there was no likelihood that he would be deported to Cuba in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">On appeal, we appointed counsel to represent Reyes to address the issue of whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> applies to inadmissible aliens. After briefs were filed, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in a case challenging the indefinite detention of an inadmissible alien. <em>Benitez v. Wallis, </em>540 U.S. 1147, 124 S.Ct. 1143, 157 L.Ed.2d 966 (2004). We granted the parties\u2019 motion to hold Reyes\u2019s case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Benitez. </em>That decision came in <em>Clark v. Martinez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), in which the Court held that the <em>Zadvydas </em>Court\u2019s construction of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) (2000) regarding admitted aliens removable under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(C), (2), (4) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005), applies to non-admitted aliens as well. \u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 716, 722, 160 L.Ed.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">Since the opinion was issued in <em>Clark, </em>Reyes has been released on parole. The Government therefore moves to dismiss the appeal as moot. Counsel for Reyes moves to withdraw, conceding that the issue he was directed by the Court to address has been resolved and is now moot. However, counsel notes that Reyes wishes to proceed pro se with other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases or controversies. U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2; <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 317, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). The controversy must be present at all stages of review. <em>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 66, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997). When a case becomes moot after judgment in the district court, the appellate court has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Mellen v. Bunting, </em>327 F.3d 355, 363-64 (4th Cir.2003). Here, Reyes\u2019s claim that, as an inadmissible alien, he should not be subjected to indefinite detention, has been resolved by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Clark </em>decision. Reyes\u2019s parole pursuant to <em>Clark </em>renders this issue moot, mooting as well Reyes\u2019s motion for summary reversal. Further, because we appointed counsel solely to address this issue, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Reyes seeks to proceed pro se with other issues raised in the district court. Having reviewed these issues, we find them to lack merit. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We grant Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the <em>Clark </em>issue as moot, deny Reyes\u2019s motion for summary reversal as moot, grant Reyes\u2019s appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Reyes\u2019s pro se motion for release as moot. As to the other pro se motions currently pending, we grant Reyes\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and deny all others, including the motion to comply, motion for trial, motion for fair justice, motion for release, motion for summary disposition, and motion for general relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> The Supreme Court held in <em>Zadvydas </em>that, absent special circumstances, resident aliens who demonstrate that they are unlikely to be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future because no country will accept them cannot be indefinitely detained. The Court construed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) (2000), authorizing detention beyond the ninety-day removal period, to limit such detention to a period reasonably necessary to effect removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
