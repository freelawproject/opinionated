We review de novo due process challenges, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The IJ denied Vargas-Magallon\u2019s application for cancellation of removal because he failed to establish that his daughter, who is a United States citizen, would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he is removed to Mexico. We lack jurisdiction to review this discretionary determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We reject Vargas-Magallon\u2019s contention that he was denied due process when the IJ continued his hearing for six days due to the unavailability of the interpreter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vargas-Magallon agreed to the continuance and has not demonstrated prejudice because he did not show that the continuance affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Vargas-Magallon\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s use of the streamlining procedure violated his right to due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Because the government has supplemented the record to include the two missing pages of the hearing transcript, we reject Vargas-Magallon\u2019s contention that this case should be remanded for compilation of a complete transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The voluntary departure period was stayed, and that stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate. <em>See Desta v.
