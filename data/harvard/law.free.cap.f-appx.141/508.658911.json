We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). There was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Singh was not credible, and we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-26\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we review the opinion of the IJ. <em>See Khup v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 898, 902 (9th Cir.2004). We give great deference to an IJ\u2019s credibility finding, affirming if there is a legitimate reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility and if the IJ gives a specific and cogent reason for disbelieving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>his or her testimony. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The IJ gave a number of specific and cogent reasons for concluding that Singh was not credible. He found Singh\u2019s various explanations for his family\u2019s decision to harbor his cousin inconsistent. The IJ also found it implausible that Singh\u2019s parents would take his cousin in without understanding the risk; that his cousin would continue his activities at the gurdwara (temple); that the police were not interested in Singh\u2019s parents; and that the authorities in 1995 would trouble themselves with a general member of a legal political party. He further found it implausible that Singh would have received his passport without a problem if he had had an arrest record. These were not minor inconsistencies. Further, the IJ considered the documentary evidence and found it not strong enough to overcome the weaknesses in Singh\u2019s testimony. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1258-59 (9th Cir.2003) (inconsistencies undermining allegations of persecution are sufficient for adverse credibility finding, and documentary evidence must be strong to overcome doubts about testimony). There was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s credibility determination and his denial of Singh\u2019s request for asylum and for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-27\">. We do not consider the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, because Singh did not raise these issues in his brief to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
