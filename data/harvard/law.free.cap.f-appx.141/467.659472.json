Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Proceedings in both appeals were stayed pending the outcome of that case and position statements have since been received from the parties. In their position statements, the parties in both appeals agree that the appellant preserved a meritorious constitutional objection under <em>Booker </em>to factual determinations made by the district judge at sentencing using a preponderance standard that increased the imprisonment range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The government concedes in both appeals that the error was not harmless, and we agree with that assessment. We therefore vacate the appellants\u2019 sentences and remand these appeals for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">Rapp Cornelius Chairs pleaded guilty to assaulting a federal officer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a), and was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court arrived at this guidelines sentence by applying the base offense level for aggravated assault, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(a), and employing four upward adjustments: using a motor vehicle as a dangerous weapon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(C); causing bodily injury to the victim, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2A2.2(b)(3)(A); targeting a government officer, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(a); and obstructing justice, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. Chairs objected at sentencing to the district court\u2019s calculation of the base offense level, arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), \u201crequires proof beyond a reasonable doubt to transform a presumed \u2018simple\u2019 assault to an aggravated one.\u201d Chairs also objected to each of the four upward adjustments and the district court\u2019s use of a preponderance standard in determining the facts underlying his sentence. The district court denied the objections, concluding that Chairs had no argument under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">Darius Hollins was indicted for conspiracy to import cocaine from Jamaica, 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 952(a), 960(a), and for attempting to import cocaine on several occasions, <em>id. </em>At trial the government presented evidence of the amount of cocaine that members of the conspiracy attempted to import on each occasion alleged in the indictment. The jury ultimately found Hollins guilty of conspiracy and a single count of attempting to import 780 grams of cocaine. At sentencing Hollins argued that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi, </em>his base offense level should be determined by this 780-gram amount as that was the only drug amount supported by a jury verdict of guilty. The district court disagreed and instead found that Hollins\u2019s conspiracy conviction encompassed relevant conduct involving over 12 kilograms of cocaine, a determination that increased Hollins\u2019s base offense level under the guidelines. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After imposing a four-level upward adjustment for Hollins\u2019s role as a leader or organizer of the criminal enterprise, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a), the district court sentenced Hollins to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In each appeal, the district court made findings that increased the appellant\u2019s offense level based on facts not proven beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the appellant in a guilty plea. Accordingly, as the government admits, the resulting sentences violate the appellants\u2019 constitutional rights. See <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 751-52, 756. And since the appellants preserved their constitutional objections to their sentences, the burden falls on the government to prove that the sentencing error in each case was harmless, in the sense that it had no effect on the appellant\u2019s substantial rights. See <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 62, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); see also <em>United States v. Harbin, 250 </em>F.3d 532, 542 (7th Cir.2001). Here, however, the government has conceded that it cannot show that Chairs\u2019s and Hollins\u2019s sentences were unaffected by the constitutional error. The only remaining question is what remedy should be chosen to correct this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Typically, when we have concluded that constitutional error has occurred in a case and that the error is not harmless, we have vacated the appellant\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Jackson, </em>32 F.3d 1101, 1109 (7th Cir.1994). The only exception has been the line of plain error cases addressed by our decision in <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005), which calls for a limited remand of sentences affected by <em>Booker </em>in all cases where we are not confident that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in the context of advisory guidelines. See also <em>United States v. Lee, </em>399 F.3d 864 (7th Cir.2005) (recognizing that the district court\u2019s inclinations will be clear in some cases and thus that a limited remand is not always required). Unlike <em>Paladino, </em>the present cases both involve defendants who preserved the Hooker-type objection at the district court level. In these cases, we have followed the general rule noted above that the sentence must be vacated unless the error was harmless. See <em>United States v. Schlifer, </em>403 F.3d 849, 854 (7th Cir.2005). Accordingly, in light of the fact that we cannot say that these errors were harmless, we VACATE the appellants\u2019 sentences and REMAND the appeals for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
