Griffin, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus. In his petition, Griffin stated that he was convicted in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan of several counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (counts 1-5); being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (counts 6 and 8); and structuring a currency transaction to evade reporting requirements, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324 (count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">Griffin asserted four claims in the instant petition. In his first two claims, he argued that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of two of his possession offenses, counts three and four of the indictment, based on <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). In his third claim, he contended that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of evading reporting requirements, count seven of the indictment, as a result of <em>Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994). In a fourth claim, he argued that his sentences for counts 1-5 (possession offenses) and count 7 (evasion of reporting requirements) of his conviction were unconstitutional based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>On appeal, he argues that \u201cactual innocence\u201d is an exception to the requirement that a petitioner satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in order to seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. He asserts that the test established to determine the applicability of the savings clause is procedural and acts as a bar to having his claims considered on the merits, and, as a result, the actual innocence exception should apply. He contends that even if the test is an accurate interpretation of the savings clause, the test does not supersede the actual innocence exception because precedent suggests that actual innocence is a gateway to habeas relief. He argues that he alleged facts that, if true, entitled him to relief, and the court was required to determine whether his alleged facts warranted relief before considering whether the remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. He contends that the court also was required to determine whether he was actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We review the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 <em>de novo. Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). Section 2241 gives authority to district courts to grant a writ of habeas corpus to prisoners under certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. A petitioner usually collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. \u201cUnder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The savings clause provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">We have determined that the savings clause is applicable when: (1) a \u201cclaim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision;\u201d (2) \u201cthe holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted for\u201d an offense that is now nonexistent; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cOnce the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, the proper inquiry in that \u00a7 2241 proceeding will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted, as \u2018actual innocence\u2019 is defined in <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Because actual innocence alone does not determine the adequacy or effectiveness of \u00a7 2255 remedy, we established, and the district court properly utilized, a three-prong test to determine whether the savings clause was applicable. As discussed below, because Griffin\u2019s claims did not satisfy this test, he failed to establish that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">1. Claims 1 and 2</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Section 841 makes it is unlawful for a person to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. In <em>Cotton, </em>the Supreme Court held that a court is not deprived of its power to adjudicate a case because of defects in an indictment. 535 U.S. at 630, 122 S.Ct. at 7785. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>concluded that the absence of a specific drug quantity in the defendant\u2019s indictment did not render his enhanced sentence plainly erroneous because the evidence of the specific quantity was \u201c \u2018overwhelming,\u2019\u201d and, therefore, the enhanced sentence did not affect the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632-33, 122 S.Ct. at 1786.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cotton </em>did not render nonexistent the offense of possession with intent to distribute but instead discussed the effect of the omission of the drug quantity in an indictment. The decision was not related to the actual offenses described in \u00a7 841 and did not affect the scope or validity of \u00a7 841. Additionally, because his claims are based on a sufficiency of the evidence argument, Griffin cannot show that the claims he now makes in light of <em>Cotton were </em>squarely foreclosed during his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. As a result, his first and second claims fail the <em>Wofford </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">2. Claim 3</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Section 5324 of Title 31 makes it illegal to structure a transaction with a domestic financial institution for the purpose of evading financial reporting requirements. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(3). Prior to the <em>Ratzlaf </em>decision, \u00a7 5324 relied on a criminal enforcement provision contained in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322, which subjected those \u201cwillfully violating\u201d \u00a7 5324 to criminal penalties. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>117 F.3d 471, 473 n. 1 (11th Cir.1997); <em>Ratzlaf, </em>510 U.S. at 136, 114 S.Ct. at 657. In <em>Ratzlaf, </em>the Supreme Court held that to establish a willful violation of \u00a7 5324, the government had to prove that the defendant \u201cacted with the knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\u201d <em>Ratzlaf, </em>510 U.S. at 137, 114 S.Ct. at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Because Griffin did not show that Sixth Circuit law squarely foreclosed his claim, he failed to establish that remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. As a result, Griffin\u2019s third claim also fails the <em>Wofford </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">3. Claim 4</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. We have held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001). Because <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable in this context, Griffin\u2019s fourth claim also fails the <em>Wofford </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">In sum, Griffin failed to establish that his claims satisfy the <em>Wofford </em>test. As a result, he did not show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, and, therefore, did not establish that the savings clause applies to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. We thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">Additionally, Griffin moves to transfer back to the district court a separate \u00a7 2241 petition transferred to us by the district court. This petition seeks relief pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Cotton. </em>As we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review, and for the reasons stated above regarding <em>Cotton, </em>Griffin\u2019s motion is DENIED. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 887 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, Griffin\u2019s second \u00a7 2241 petition is REMANDED to the district court with instruction that it be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>AFFIRMED, MOTION DENIED, and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
