Ameline,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> t</em>he memorandum disposition filed on April 13, 2005 is withdrawn and replaced by the attached memorandum disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Vincente Velazquez appeals his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. He also raises sentencing issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm his conviction. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and our subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Ameline</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we remand for a determination of whether the district court would have imposed a materially different sentence if it had known that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-21\">The district court acted well within its discretion when it granted counsels\u2019 motion to withdraw due to a conflict of interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s inquiry was adequate to \u201cprovide[] a sufficient basis for reaching an informed decision\u201d regarding the existence of a conflict arising from Velazquez\u2019s potential presentation of perjured testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion by hearing communications that the attorney-client privilege may have protected because the court needed to hear them in order to resolve the motion to withdraw.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the district court insured that the judge presiding over Velazquez\u2019s criminal case did not hear any privileged communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-22\">Any error the district court committed by excluding Velazquez and one of his attorneys from the <em>in camera </em>hearing did not \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation\u201d of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>as a whole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Velazquez proceeded to trial with the assistance of appointed counsel who did not have a conflict of interest and who had adequate time to prepare.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Velazquez\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"pAmk\">We review the sentencing issues Velazquez raises on appeal for plain error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We cannot determine from the record whether the district court would have imposed a materially different sentence if it had known that the Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, under <em>Ameline, </em>we remand for the limited purpose of making that determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In fulfilling this mandate, the district court may hold such hearings and enter such orders as it determines to be necessary, including, without limitation, modifying or vacating its previous sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Conviction AFFIRMED; Sentence REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\">. - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\">. 409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-14\">.
