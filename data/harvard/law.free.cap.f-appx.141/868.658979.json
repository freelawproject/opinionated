Nichols challenges the district court\u2019s findings with respect to his claims that: (1) the conditions of confinement at the Draper Correctional Center (\u201cDCC\u201d) violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment; and (2) defendant James DeLoach, warden of DCC, transferred him to G.K. Fountain Correctional Center (\u201cFCC\u201d) in retaliation for filing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and apply the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Butts v. County of Volusia, </em>222 F.3d 891, 892 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">A. Eighth Amendment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids cruel and unusual punishments. U.S. Const, amend. VIII. This protection extends to the conditions of a prisoner\u2019s confinement, which must conform to contemporary standards of decency. <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). The Eighth Amendment also protects against future harm to prison inmates. <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 33-34, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 2480-81, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993). An inmate may be granted injunctive or declaratory relief even in the absence of proof that he actually has been injured by the dangerous condition. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The district court erred by finding that Nichols lacked standing because he failed to demonstrate that he had suffered an actual, physical injury. The conditions of confinement, if found to be inhumane, constituted a deprivation of Nichols\u2019s rights under the Eighth Amendment, and, assuming that the other two requirements of standing were met, entitled him to seek injunctive relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment through \u201cthe unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 836, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1978, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Wantonness has been defined as \u201cdeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish an Eighth Amendment violation, a prisoner must prove both an objective and a subjective component. <em>Miller v. King, </em>384 F.3d 1248, 1261 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder the objective component, a prisoner must prove the condition he complains of is sufficiently serious to violate the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the subjective component, \u201cthe prisoner must prove that the prison official acted with \u2018deliberate indifference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Assuming, without deciding, that Nichols offered sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the conditions of confinement at DCC were inhumane, we nonetheless conclude that summary judgment in favor of DeLoach was proper. Because the undisputed evidence demonstrated that the ADC was making a reasonable effort to correct the alleged inhumane conditions of confinement at DCC, a reasonable factfinder could not have concluded that DeLoach acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Hale v. Tallapoosa, </em>50 F.3d 1579, 1583 (11th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Nichols\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">B. Retaliatory-Transfer Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">While an inmate does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest against being transferred to a less agreeable prison, <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 279 n. 9, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976), prison officials may not transfer, or otherwise punish, an inmate in retaliation for exercising his right to file grievances against prison officials, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>Bridges v. Russell, </em>757 F.2d 1155, 1157 (11th Cir.1985). Such retaliatory transfers violate an inmate\u2019s First Amendment rights and his right of access to the courts. <em>See Wildberger v. Bracknell, </em>869 F.2d 1467, 1468 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We find that the district court erred by concluding that DeLoach had not violated Nichols\u2019s rights by transferring him to FCC, without specifically addressing the actual reasons for the transfer. If Nichols was transferred solely for filing his \u00a7 1983 complaint against prison officials, then his constitutional rights were violated and he was entitled to relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In an affidavit, DeLoach stated that Nichols was transferred because he was found to be in possession of a copy of the ADC\u2019s Administrative Regulations and Institutional Standard Operating Procedures \u2014 -a violation of prison regulations. That may be true, but Nichols states in his own affidavit that he was not transferred for disciplinary reasons, but rather, solely because he had filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Without more to evaluate, Nichols\u2019s affidavit suffices to create a genuine factual dispute as to the actual reason for his transfer. Therefore, summary judgment was improper. Accordingly, we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of DeLoach on Nichols\u2019s retaliatory-transfer claim, and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
