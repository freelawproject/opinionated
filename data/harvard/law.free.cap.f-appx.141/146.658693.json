We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-27\">We will reverse a determination denying eligibility for asylum \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. U.S. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We have reviewed the evidence of record and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Konde failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Konde next challenges the finding that she failed to meet her burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and of the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying relief, we hold that the immigration judge did not err in finding that Konde failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution,\u201d or that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would face torture if she returned to Togo. <em>See Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324 n. 13 (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005) (stating that to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We reject Konde\u2019s arguments that she was denied due process at the hearing before the immigration judge. \u201cIn order to prevail on a due process challenge to a deportation or asylum hearing, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any such violation.\u201d <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 320. Konde fails to show any such prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
