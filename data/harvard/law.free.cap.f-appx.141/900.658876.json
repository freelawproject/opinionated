Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirmed previously Appellant\u2019s 120-month sentence imposed after he entered a non-negotiated plea of guilty to drug trafficking offenses. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>116 Fed. Appx. 248 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in the light of its decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Appellant raised no constitutional challenge to his sentence and asserted no error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny, in his initial and reply briefs. In <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.2005), we concluded that \u201c \u2018our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001)) applies to <em>Booker </em>error; an appellant who fails to raise a <em>Booker \u00a1Apprendi </em>issue in his initial brief has abandoned that error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">No <em>Booker/Apprendi </em>sentence challenge has been raised timely \u2014 or at all \u2014 in this case. We reinstate our previous opinion and affirm, once again, Appellant\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in the light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
