Rivera contends for the first time on appeal that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because it was based on over 50 kilograms of cocaine, more than the five kilograms of cocaine alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">The district court plainly erred by basing Rivera\u2019s sentence on the extra verdict factual finding that more than 50 kilograms of cocaine were involved in Rivera\u2019s offense. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, Rivera has not demonstrated that the result likely would have been different but for the district court\u2019s error, had the district court sentenced him under an advisory guideline sentencing scheme. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 522 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
