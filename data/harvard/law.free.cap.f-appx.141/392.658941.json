Sandlin argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Sandlin pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement that contained a waiver of the right to appeal. We may examine Sandlin\u2019s plea agreement sua sponte to determine whether we may hear his claims. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001). We conclude that the appeal is barred by the plain language of Sandlin\u2019s knowing and voluntary appeal waiver in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Sandlin has also filed various motions to relieve the Federal Public Defender, for the appointment of new counsel on appeal, for expedited ruling on his motions and to proceed pro se. These motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED. ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
