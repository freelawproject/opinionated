Randall, Texas prisoner #798548, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Randall does not contest the district court\u2019s findings that the defendants evaluated his infection with the hepatitis B virus and his medical records, that his liver was biopsied to determine the severity of damage caused by the virus, and that he was seen by specialists. He has therefore failed to show that the defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 887, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Randall\u2019s allegations that he should have been examined sooner and that he should be receiving treatment allege mere negligence and disagreement with the decision not to treat his disease at this time. Such allegations are insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Furthermore, as Randall has not shown that the alleged delay resulted in substantial harm, he has not shown an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Randall has failed to demonstrate deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs constituting an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (internal quotation and citation omitted). His complaint therefore lacks an arguable basis in law. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
