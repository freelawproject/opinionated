He argues that the Government did not present sufficient evidence to establish that his identity is Ruben Hernandez-Rodarte. Specifically, Hernandez-Rodarte asserts that the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert, Terry Kimbell, did not meet the standards set in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">The Government presented evidence to show that Kimbell was an expert in the area of fingerprint analysis and that his testimony was reliable and relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s true identity. Therefore, the objective of <em>Daubert </em>\u201cto ensure the reliability and relevance of the expert testimony\u201d was met in this case. <em>See United States v. Norris, </em>217 F.3d 262, 269 (5th Cir.2000). Hernandez-Rodarte has not shown that the district court\u2019s admission of Kimbell\u2019s testimony constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Because Hernandez-Rodarte did not move for a judgment of acquittal, review of his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to determining whether there was a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 895 (5th Cir.2002). To find a miscarriage of justice, the court must find that the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence of guilt or the evidence must be so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). The Government presented evidence that the defendant\u2019s identity was Hernandez-Rodarte, that he unlawfully purchased a forged, counterfeit birth certificate in the name of Sevastian Castillo, that the defendant\u2019s fingerprints matched those of Hernandez-Rodarte, and that Hernandez-Rodarte was a Mexican citizen who had previously been deported. Hernandez-Rodarte has not shown that the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence of guilt\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201cso tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>See Avants, </em>367 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
