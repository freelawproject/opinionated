Krebs and Consulting Investigators, Inc., as defendants. William Boyle dismissed his claims against all defendants. Dolores Boyle dismissed her claim against Krebs. The jury returned verdicts for Boyle against both Wenk and Consulting Investigators, Inc., in the amount of $7,500. Consulting Investigators, Inc., did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-14\">Abrams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALv\">The sole issue raised by this appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence in an action for the intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. The defendant, John H. Wenk, asserts that it was error for the judge to deny his motion for a directed verdict, and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>verdict to deny his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 50, 365 Mass. 814 (1974). Wenk claims that his conduct, while rude and clumsy, was neither \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d nor was it \u201cbeyond all possible bounds of decency.\u201d Hence he concludes it was error to submit Dolores Boyle\u2019s claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress to a jury. We find no error; therefore, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In reviewing the denial of Wenk\u2019s motion for a directed verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we view the evidence most favorable to Boyle. See <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., </em>376 Mass. 874, 876 (1978). Moreover, we must determine \u201cwhether \u2019anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting from <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Wenk was employed by Consulting Investigators, Inc., to do private investigative work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wenk was asked to investigate the health and capacity for work of one John Walsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Walsh is the plaintiffs brother-in-law; he and his wife live in an apartment upstairs from the Boyles\u2019 home. In the course of his investigation Wenk called the Boyle home and began asking personal questions about Walsh. The plaintiff suggested to Wenk that he call Walsh directly; she also asked Wenk not to call again as she had just been discharged from the hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In spite of the plaintiffs request, the next week Wenk called the plaintiffs home at 1 a.m. The plaintiff was alone with her children,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and she was disquieted by the late hour of the call. She told Wenk not to call again and hung up. After the call the plaintiff was fearful, upset, and unable to sleep. The next week Wenk appeared at the Walsh apartment; Mrs. Walsh invited Boyle upstairs. When asked, Wenk admitted that he had been calling Boyle. The plaintiff told Wenk that he \"had [her] terrified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Then Wenk asked Walsh what he did for a living, and Walsh answered that he \"robbed banks.\u201d In Boyle\u2019s presence, Wenk retorted that he had been \"in prison too for rape.\u201d The police were summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">When two police detectives arrived, the police observed that Boyle was crying and agitated. The detectives asked Wenk to identify himself, and Wenk responded, \"I\u2019m a police officer.\u201d When challenged, Wenk admitted he was engaged in private investigative work.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Boyle, Wenk, the Walshes, and the detectives went to the police station. Boyle was weeping. At the police station she became weak and sick due to hemorrhaging. Blood was observed on Boyle\u2019s chair after she left the station to seek medical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Boyle was under a physician\u2019s care for an extended period of time after these events. Boyle also sought the assistance of a psychiatrist. There was ample medical evidence as to Boyle\u2019s injuries, as well as evidence of a causal relationship between Boyle\u2019s emotional condition and the phone calls from Wenk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Wenk asserts that as a matter of law these facts do not evidence the \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct necessary to support a claim for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. See <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244, 255 (1971).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He emphasizes that recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ery is barred unless his conduct was \"beyond all possible bounds of decency,\u201d and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>George, supra </em>at 254-255. <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 145 (1976). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment d (1965). Further, Wenk claims, hurt feelings resulting from bad manners, or relatively minor annoyances do not justify recovery for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. See <em>George, supra </em>at 253-254. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment d (1965). See generally Magruder, Mental and Emotional Disturbance in the Law of Torts, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 1033, 1053-1064 (1936). We do not quarrel with Wenk\u2019s statement of the applicable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">However, in our view, Wenk did engage in a pattern of conduct which a jury could find was extreme and outrageous, exceeding mere insult or minor annoyance. Wenk\u2019s conduct may reasonably be viewed as an attempt to intentionally shock and harm a person\u2019s \"peace of mind\u201d by invading the person\u2019s mental or emotional tranquility.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The flaw in Wenk\u2019s argument is that he isolates each individual incident and ignores the fact that the jury are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the totality of circumstances. See <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). Repeated harassment, such as that engaged in by Wenk, may compound the outrageousness of incidents which, taken individually, might not be sufficiently extreme to warrant liability for infliction of emotional distress. See <em>George, supra </em>at 246; <em>Duty </em>v. <em>General Fin. Co., </em>154 Tex. 16, 18 (1954); <em>Samms </em>v. <em>Eccles, </em>11 Utah 2d 289, 290 (1961); Prosser, Insult and Outrage, 44 Calif. L. Rev. 40,48-49 (1956). Contrast <em>Public Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>66 Ill. 2d 85, 92-93 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Significantly, Wenk\u2019s conduct continued even after Dolores Boyle, in the first call, had told him not to call again.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>George, supra </em>at 245-246; <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Associates Fin. Servs. Co. of Kansas, Inc., </em>215 Kan. 814, 817, 825 (1974). The issue whether Wenk\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous is raised by his continued harassment of Boyle after he knew that she had just returned from the hospital. Conduct otherwise reasonable may become tortious when directed at an individual known to be particularly susceptible to infliction of emotional distress. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment f, Illustrations 9-11 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Though there is no evidence that Wenk knew the precise nature of Mrs. Boyle\u2019s physical susceptibility, his knowledge that she had just returned from the hospital put him on notice that she might be more vulnerable to harassment or verbal abuse. See <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Associates Fin. Servs. Co. of Kansas, Inc., </em>215 Kan. 814, 825 (1974) (victim with multiple sclerosis); <em>Delta Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Ganabas, </em>93 Ga. App. 297, 298-299, 300 (1956) (victim was child aged eleven years). Prosser, 44 Calif. L. Rev. 50. Martin, A Creditor\u2019s Liability for Unreasonable Collection Efforts: The Evolution of a Tort in Texas, 9 S. Tex. L.J. 127, 138-140 (1967). Yet Wenk persisted in intentional conduct which caused Boyle to suffer serious physical and emotional damage. It is for the jury in such instances to decide whether Wenk\u2019s conduct was \"rude and clumsy\u201d or \"extreme and outrageous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We are mindful of the need for limits on recovery for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress: \"No pressing social need requires that every abusive outburst be converted into a tort; upon the contrary, it would be unfortunate if the law closed all the safety valves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>through which irascible tempers might legally blow off steam.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Magruder, <em>supra </em>at 1053. Moreover, the courts must be particularly wary in this area to avoid fictitious claims. <em>Agis, supra </em>at 143.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hochman, \"Outrageousness\u201d and Privilege in the Law of Emotional Distress \u2014 A Suggestion, 47 Cornell L.Q. 61, 63 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">However, where a person engages in intentional conduct which is designed to, and actually does, result in severe emotional and physical damage, the possibility of trivial or fictitious claims does not justify denial of recovery to the victim. <em>Agis, supra </em>at 143-145. <em>State Rubbish Collectors Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Siliznoff, </em>38 Cal. 2d 330, 338-339 (1952). <em>Samms </em>v. <em>Eccles, </em>11 Utah 2d 289, 291 (1961). W. Prosser, Torts 50-51 (4th ed. 1971). There is an issue for the jury if reasonable people could differ on whether the conduct is \"extreme and outrageous.\u201d <em>Agis, supra </em>at 145-146.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Finally, Wenk argues that the judge mistakenly believed that \"it was the sole prerogative of the jury\u201d to determine liability in a case alleging infliction of emotional distress. This contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The judge did express doubts concerning the sufficiency of the evidence and indicated that he might grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict if the jury found for Dolores Boyle. The judge\u2019s comments indicate that he carefully scrutinized the evidence before ruling on Wenk\u2019s motions. Ultimately the judge concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to consider whether Wenk\u2019s conduct was in fact extreme and outrageous. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment h (1965); <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>215 Va. 338, 342 (1974).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> We transferred Wenk\u2019s appeal to this court from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\"> Liberty Mutual Insurance Company hired Consulting Investigators, Inc., who in turn hired Wenk, to investigate John Walsh\u2019s health and capacity for employment. Boyle listed Liberty Mutual as a defendant in her amended complaint, but subsequently voluntarily dismissed that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\"> Boyle had been discharged from the hospital two days earlier after giving birth to her second child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> Boyle\u2019s husband was working a night shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b606-11\"> Wenk is not challenging the sufficiency of the medical evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\"> Due to Boyle\u2019s physical injuries, this case is analogous to <em>George </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244, 255 (1971). Cf. Agis v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140,146-147 (1976). Boyle did not allege a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. See <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, </em>375 Mass. 555, 558-562 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> We note that the Legislature has labeled unreasonable attempts to collect personal or family debts by communication at an unreasonable hour, or with unreasonable frequency, or by use of offensive language. G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Wenk\u2019s conduct seems to have been more than a spontaneous outburst. His conduct appears to have been a calculated tactic designed to pressure reluctant persons to reveal information useful to his investigation. See Wade, Tort Liability for Abusive and Insulting Language, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 63, 72 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> In <em>Agis, </em>we allowed recovery for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress, absent resulting physical injury. Where, as with Dolores Boyle, the complained of conduct results in severe physical injury, there may be less likelihood of a fictitious claim. See W. Prosser, Torts at 60 (4th ed. 1971). Prosser, Insult and Outrage, 44 Calif. L. Rev. 40, 53 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> Wenk argues that in a case alleging infliction of emotional distress, a two-step process is required \u2014 first the judge must determine whether the conduct may reasonably be viewed as extreme and outrageous, and second, that the jury must determine whether the conduct was in fact extreme and outrageous. This is precisely the test outlined in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment h (1965). See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Dungan, </em>20 Cal. App. 3d 295, 308 (1971). There is no indication in the record that the judge misunderstood or misapplied this test, which is the same test applied whenever a party to a civil proceeding makes a motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
