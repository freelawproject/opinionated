This resulted in an assessment of additional tax which Dow seeks to recover by the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">I. <em>Statement. </em>The facts are stipulated. Dow, with its principal place of business in Midland, Michigan, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemicals, metals, plastics, and consumer products in the United States and abroad. It conducts its foreign business through a number of subsidiary corporations incorporated and doing business in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific area. Reflecting these foreign activities, Dow included in gross income on its Federal income tax return for the taxable year ended December 31, 1969, the first two items which, in their bearing on the State tax, are the subject of the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The first, in an amount of $8,539,158, represented Dow\u2019s \"Subpart F income\u201d as defined in \u00a7 952 of the Internal Revenue Code. Subpart F income, to be discussed in detail below, may be epitomized as income of certain types earned by a domestic corporation\u2019s foreign subsidiaries in a given taxable year, although hot necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>distributed to its shareholders in that year. Dividend distributions in the amount of $6,610,418 were actually received by Dow from its foreign subsidiaries in 1969 but, under Code \u00a7 959(a), were excluded from the Federal gross income reported for 1969 because they were comprised in the $8,539,158 of Subpart F income earned and reported for 1969. Additional dividends totaling $3,740,-485 were received in 1969 and were also excluded because they had been comprised in Subpart F income earned and reported in years preceding 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Second, Dow included in Federal gross income an amount of $411,256 under Code \u00a7 78, representing the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by its subsidiaries on Subpart F income. This \"foreign tax gross-up\u201d is included in gross income in order to ensure proper calculation of the foreign tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is agreed that Dow\u2019s treatment of both Subpart F income and foreign tax gross-up was appropriate under the Federal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Dow has been qualified to do business in the Commonwealth since 1947. In the taxable year 1969, it had Massachusetts sales of $36,616,802; its ninety-three Massachusetts employees received $1,136,034 in salaries or other compensation; and it owned real and tangible personal property in the Commonwealth of a value of $2,410,588.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">On its 1969 State corporate excise return, filed on October 15,1970, Dow included Subpart F income and foreign tax gross-up in gross income, just as it had on its corresponding Federal return. At the same time it deducted both items as dividends pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1). Purporting to act under the same provision, it deducted a third item, the $3,740,485 representing dividends actually received in 1969 but earned and included in Subpart F income reported in the Commonwealth in previous years.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">In 1973 the Department of Corporations and Taxation assessed Dow an additional $13,983.87 of tax: $10,873.72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>represented the increase of tax caused by disallowance of the three claimed deductions, and the remainder was interest on that increment. Dow paid the assessment and then applied to \"the State Tax Commission (now designated the Commissioner of Revenue, St. 1978, c. 514) for an abatement in the same amount. The application was denied on June 13, 1975. Dow filed a timely appeal to the Appellate Tax Board which, without opinion, affirmed the decision of the Commission. Dow appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">II. <em>Summary of conclusions. </em>We reverse in part and affirm in part. Although both Subpart F income and foreign tax gross-up were properly included in Massachusetts gross income, they were deductible as dividends under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1). However, the claimed deduction for dividends actually received in 1969 was properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We reason as follows. The corporate excise adopts the Federal definition of gross income but, to determine taxable net income, allows a deduction for \"dividends\u201d included in net income in the taxable year. Subpart F income is included in Federal gross income; and there is no obstacle to the Legislature\u2019s treating the earned income of a foreign corporation as income taxable to its domestic parent, even if the parent chooses not to have that income distributed in the taxable year. Subpart F income must therefore be included in Massachusetts gross income. But that income is included in gross income only because it is treated federally as if it had been currently distributed; it should be similarly treated under State law and deductible as a dividend. Disallowance of a dividend deduction for undistributed Subpart F income would in fact prevent the taxpayer from ever receiving a deduction for that income since it could not be included in income when actually distributed; the disallowance would thus subvert the statutory purpose of preventing multiple taxation of corporate income.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The foreign tax gross-up on Subpart F income represents no gain to the taxpayer; it is a fictional Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>addition to gross income designed to help compute the Federal foreign tax credit. But its Federal treatment as a dividend included in income carries over to the State law, so that it should be included in gross income for the State purpose and deducted as a dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Finally, dividends actually received in the taxable year but comprised in Subpart F income in previous years may not be deducted. Inclusion in net income in the taxable year, as noted above, is a prerequisite for the dividend deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">III. <em>Discussion. </em>This case involves the interaction of three statutory schemes: the Massachusetts corporate excise, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30-52; the Subpart F provisions of the Code, \u00a7\u00a7 951-964; and the provisions relating to the foreign tax credit, Code \u00a7\u00a7 78, 901-908, 960. Exposition is necessarily lengthy although the principles guiding decision are not complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">A. <em>The corporate excise. </em>By St. 1966, c. 698, our corporate excise was substantially rewritten to provide new methods of determining taxable net income and apportioning that income to Massachusetts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The income component of the excise is determined by calculating gross income, applying certain deductions, allocating the resulting figure to Massachusetts through an apportionment formula, and multiplying the product by a percentage specified in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39. Gross income for the excise is \"gross income as defined under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year\u201d (with exceptions not relevant here). G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a). Net income is obtained by subtracting from gross income the deductions allowed by the Federal Code, except that the Federal deduction for dividends received (confined to 85% of dividends received from domestic corporations, Code \u00a7 243) is not taken over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>as such in the State law; nor are the Federal deductions for losses sustained in other years, or for taxes imposed by other States or foreign countries allowed by the State law. The State law does not allow the credits permitted by the Federal Code; this applies to the foreign tax credit as described in Code \u00a7\u00a7 901, 902, and 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">To determine State taxable net income, however, certain additional deductions are permitted by the State law. Dividends may be deducted if they were included in net income under the scheme described above, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1) \u2014 this deduction is not confined under Code \u00a7243.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The taxable net income thus finally attained is apportioned to Massachusetts through use of a commonly adopted<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> formula measuring the taxpayer\u2019s values in the Commonwealth in relation to its values world-wide. Some such apportionment is constitutionally required in order that \"the income attributed to the State for tax purposes ... be rationally related to \u2019values connected with the taxing State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 273 (1978), quoting from <em>Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 317, 325 (1967). See <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>John H. Breck, Inc., </em>336 Mass. 277 (1957).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>c. 63, \u00a7 38, taxable net income is multiplied by the average of fractions representing (i)the corporation\u2019s total sales within the State divided by its total sales worldwide; (ii) the value of the corporation\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned, rented, or used in the Commonwealth divided by the value of its like world-wide property; and (iii) the amount of compensation paid in the Commonwealth divided by the amount paid world-wide. If in a particular case these \"allocation and apportionment provisions ... are not reasonably adapted to approximate the net income derived from business carried on within the Commonwealth,\u201d the taxpayer may proceed under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, to attempt to use another method shown to be more reasonable. See <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>374 Mass. 230 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">To return to the current facts: After deducting Subpart F income, foreign tax gross-up, and the dividends actually received but contained in Subpart F income in previous years, Dow computed its taxable net income for 1969 as $105,575,996. Dow\u2019s business activities in the Commonwealth accounted for about 2.5070% of its total sales, 0.1914% of its total real and tangible personal property, and 0.3093% of its total payroll. (Here no account was taken of the sales, property, or payroll of Dow\u2019s foreign subsidiaries.) The average of the three percentages is 1.00255%, which, applied to Dow\u2019s taxable net income, yielded $1,058,448. An additional extraneous deduction resulted in a final figure of $942,104, producing a tax liability of $80,550. Disallowance of the three claimed deductions increased taxable net income allocated to the Commonwealth by $127,178 and tax liability, as noted above, by $10,873.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The present controversy turns primarily on the treatment of Subpart F income and foreign tax gross-up. The Commissioner characterized both as income includible under \u00a7 30 (5) (a) but as not dividends deductible under \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1). Dow disputes both characterizations, and we consider these matters below. Our conclusions thereon relieve us of having to deal with Dow\u2019s alternative contention that if the Commissioner\u2019s views were accepted, the assessment would not properly measure income derived from business in the Commonwealth, with consequent violations of the apportionment requirements of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and analogous provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">B. <em>Subpart F income. </em>(1) <em>Description. </em>Before the enactment of the Subpart F provisions of the Code, the income of foreign corporations controlled by American corporations was subject to taxation in the United States only when it was returned \u2014 or \"repatriated\u201d \u2014 in the form of dividends. For this reason domestic corporations found it advantageous to conduct foreign activities through subsidiaries rather than through branch offices whose income was taxed as earned: thereby payment of domestic tax could be deferred until the shareholders controlling the subsidiaries found it expedient to repatriate. A large number of \"enterprises organized abroad by American firms ... arranged their corporate structures \u2014 aided by artificial arrangements between parent and subsidiary regarding intercompany pricing, the transfer of patent licensing rights, the shifting of management fees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>similar practices which maximize the accumulation of profits in the tax haven \u2014 so as to exploit the multiplicity of foreign tax systems and international agreements in order to reduce sharply or eliminate completely their tax liabilities both at home and abroad.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1447 to H.R. 10650, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1962) (quoting from 1961 tax message of President Kennedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">To meet the perceived problem of deferral of domestic tax through foreign corporate \"tax havens,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Congress in 1962 enacted \u00a7\u00a7 951-964 of the Code. By these provisions specified categories of income of foreign corporations must be included in the gross income of their American shareholders (individual or corporate) in the taxable year in which the income is earned without regard to whether it is then distributed: it is \"deemed\u201d distributed even if in fact retained abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\"[T]he rules of Subpart F reach and never leave a lofty plateau of complexity that the Internal Revenue Code had previously attained only in occasional subsections.\u201d B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders par. 17.31 (1971). We provide a bare summary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subpart F applies to \"controlled\u201d foreign corporations, defined in \u00a7 957 as those, 50% or more of whose voting power is owned by United States shareholders. Any United States shareholder owning 10% or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>more of the voting power of a controlled foreign corporation must include in gross income his \"pro rata share\u201d of that corporation\u2019s Subpart F income in the taxable year. This share is in turn defined as the amount \"which would have been distributed with respect to the stock which such shareholder owns ... if on the last day, in its taxable year, ... the [controlled foreign] corporation ... had distributed pro rata to its shareholders\u201d its Subpart F income in that year. Code \u00a7 951 (text reproduced in the margin<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Subpart F income does not comprehend all the income of the controlled foreign corporation. It consists of two principal categories, income derived from the insurance of United States risks and foreign base company income, of which the latter is the more important. This latter is composed of three major subcategories.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first, foreign personal holding company income, comprises passive investment items such as royalties, dividends, interest, and gains on the sale of investment assets. \u00a7 954(c). The second, foreign base company sales income, is defined as income derived by the controlled foreign corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>from the sale or purchase of personal property to, from, or on behalf of a \"related person,\u201d that is, a shareholder owning more than 50% of the corporation\u2019s voting shares. \u00a7 954(d). The third, foreign base company services income, consists of income derived from the performance of technical, managerial, architectural, scientific, commercial, and other services undertaken outside the foreign corporation\u2019s place of incorporation for or on behalf of a related person. \u00a7 954(e). Subpart F income does not include ordinary income arising from the transaction of business with persons other than the 50% shareholders. In this way the relevant provisions are functionally related to the problem at which they are aimed, the use of foreign corporations to defer the payment of domestic tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>(2) Subpart F income as \u201cincome </em>\u201d <em>within G.L. c. 63, </em>\u00a7 <em>30 (6) (a). </em>Dow cannot question that Subpart F income must be included in its gross income under the Federal Code, but contends that it need not be under Massachusetts law. We think the language of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a), </em>is an impassable barrier to Dow: gross income is defined (we repeat) as \u201cgross income ... under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year.\u201d This reflects a legislative intent, running through many State tax provisions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to assure uniformity between State and Federal taxation. See <em>Daley </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm'n, </em>376 Mass. 861, 863 (1978). Dow argues that, in the year in which it is reported, Subpart F income is not necessarily received by Dow or any other United States shareholder, although it is then earned by the foreign subsidiaries; therefore Dow may have received no benefit from the income and cannot be required to include it in Massachusetts gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The effect of the argument would be to exclude, not merely Subpart F income, but, as well, dividends of that class actually received. As noted above, such received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>dividends are excluded from Massachusetts gross income because they are excluded from Federal gross income under Code \u00a7 959(a): Dow was permitted in 1969 to exclude from Federal and State gross income more than $10,000,000 of dividends received because these had been reported on both returns as current or previous Subpart F income when earned by the subsidiaries. If Subpart F income should not be included in gross income, as Dow contends, the result \u2014 reading the Federal provisions into the State law \u2014 would be to exclude from all State tax accountability a substantially identical amount of dividends actually received. (In its brief Dow concedes that the Subpart F income in 1969 not received by it that year \"may be presumed to have been received subsequently.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Dow\u2019s argument obscures the fact that the Subpart F provisions operate to prevent undesirable tax deferral. To that end it is entirely appropriate and lawful to treat Subpart F income as part of gross income. The taxpayer in <em>Estate of Whitlock </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>494 F.2d 1297 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 839 (1974), contended that as an American shareholder it could not be compelled to include Subpart F income in gross income for Federal purposes: this, said the taxpayer, could not be considered income taxable under the Sixteenth Amendment. The court held against the taxpayer and \"agree[d] fully\u201d with the Tax Court\u2019s view that \"undistributed current corporate income at the stockholder level\u201d could properly be treated as income. <em>Estate of Whitlock </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>59 T.C. 490, 507 (1972). Accord, <em>Garlock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>489 F.2d 197, 202 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 911 (1974); <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 917, 927-930 (1973). See Treasury Memorandum from Robert H. Knight to Secretary Dillon, Hearings on the President\u2019s 1961 Tax Recommendations Before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 1, 313-322 (1961). See also <em>Eder </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>138 F.2d 27 (2d Cir. 1943) (tax on undistributed net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>income of foreign personal holding company under Code \u00a7 543). Compare <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fitts, </em>340 Mass. 575 (1960), where beneficiaries were taxed on dividends received by trustees but not distributed; we laid stress on the taxpayers\u2019 effective control of the trust.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Morville House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>369 Mass. 928 (1976), is inapposite. There we rejected the Commissioner\u2019s claim that Federal \"interest reduction payments\u201d were to be included in gross income of the developers of a low-and-moderate income housing development undertaken pursuant to G. L. c. 121A. The payments were made by the Federal government to mortgagees of federally guaranteed mortgages on such projects, thus reducing the burden on the developers and attracting their initiative. Chapter 121A then contained no definition of gross income, but the Commissioner did not object to using the definition in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a), </em>incorporating a general Federal definition (there was no provision addressed to the specific subject matter, as Code \u00a7 951 is trained at Subpart F income). We pointed out that \"government subsidies generally are not considered as generating taxable income to the recipient of the economic benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933. Further, the payments were made direct to the mortgagee and were part of a transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>between the mortgagee and the government; the developers assumed no personal liability to the mortgagee in case of default. It could not be said that the developers realized any <em>\"present </em>material benefit equivalent to the receipt of income,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 935 (emphasis in original); they were merely \"incidental beneficiaries of an accommodation worked out by the lender and the provider of the operating subsidy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The present case does not resemble <em>Morville House.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">(3) <em>Subpart F income as a dividend. </em>The Subpart F provisions of the Code describe a dividend which is deemed to have been distributed in the taxable year. Indeed, Subpart F income is included in gross income only because it is treated as a dividend. This is made plain by the text of Code \u00a7 951 quoted above: Subpart F income is the amount \"which would have been distributed with respect to the stock,\u201d and so forth. Nonetheless, the Commissioner says Subpart F income should not be held a dividend deductible under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, because that section, first, is limited to dividends of domestic corporations; second, cannot be read to cover a \"deemed\u201d distribution even if that same distribution is treated as income.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">(i) General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1), provides that \"[dividends included therein [i.e., net income under the corporate excise as defined in \u00a7 30] shall be deducted\u201d to obtain taxable net income.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By its terms the statute makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>distinction between foreign and domestic dividends. On the contrary, other provisions of c. 63 show a general disinclination to distinguish between corporations doing business in other States and corporations doing business in foreign countries; instead there is an assimilation of the two classes. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (2) (defining \"foreign corporation\u201d to include both classes); G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(13) (defining \"State\u201d to include \"any foreign country\u201d). We should not follow the Commissioner\u2019s invitation to fabricate an exception to the text in the absence of \"a most persuasive positive demonstration of legislative purpose.\u201d See <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Norfolk County </em>v. <em>Norfolk County Retirement System, </em>377 Mass. 696, 701 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The attempted demonstration by the Commissioner runs thus. The reason for the intercorporate dividend deduction is to prevent multiple taxation of corporate income. Without the deduction, three categories of taxpayers \u2014 the subsidiary corporation, the parent corporation, and the parent\u2019s shareholders \u2014 would each be subject to taxation on the same basic income. The State dividend deduction serves to ensure that the income may be taxed only to the original earner (the subsidiary) and the parent\u2019s shareholders. According to the Commissioner, this rationale is inapplicable when the subsidiary is incorporated in a foreign country. Neither the Federal Code nor the corporate excise statute purports to tax the foreign subsidiaries on their income; that income is taxed solely to its United States shareholders when distributed or so deemed. If foreign dividends were included in taxable net income of the parent \u2014 and held not to be deductible by it under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 \u2014 the income, says the Commissioner, would still be taxed only twice, to the parent and the parent\u2019s shareholders. That result, she contends, would not subvert the statutory purpose of preventing undue multiple taxation of corporate income. The Commissioner notes, further, that the Federal divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>dend deduction in Code \u00a7 243 is expressly limited to dividends from domestic corporations and urges that her proffered interpretation would promote uniformity between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s proposal, besides offending against the statutory text, appears to proceed on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the corporate excise and the Internal Revenue Code. Foreign subsidiaries are in fact subject to tax in the countries in which they are incorporated. The corporate excise, by allowing a deduction for dividends from these subsidiaries and thus preventing the possibility of triple taxation, performs the same general function in the State scheme as does the foreign tax credit in the Federal scheme.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have no warrant for destroying this symmetry by arbitrarily ruling foreign dividends out of the dividends category altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">(ii) The corporate excise statute provides no definition of \"dividend\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and we have some liberty to follow the reason of the thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Commissioner observes that Code \u00a7 316(a) defines dividend generally as a distribution out of earnings and profits, and that Subpart F income is not such a distribution. The Subpart F provisions of the Code do not expressly use the term \"dividend\u201d to describe the amount to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>distributed. Moreover, Subpart F income lacks certain usual characteristics of a dividend found in our cases: it has not necessarily been distributed from the foreign corporation\u2019s earnings or profits, <em>Williston </em>v. <em>Michigan S. &amp; N. Ind. R.R., </em>13 Allen 400, 404 (1866), or voted upon by any board of directors, <em>Willson </em>v. <em>Laconia Car Co., </em>275 Mass. 435, 441 (1931); it has not necessarily reduced the capital value of the foreign corporation, <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>273 Mass. 187, 200 (1930). The Commissioner concludes that Subpart F income, as a \u201cdeemed\u201d distribution, should not be treated as a dividend deductible under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We return, however, to the proposition that the Sub-part F device is aimed at the problem of tax deferral. Functionally it accelerates the recognition of earned income as dividends.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the legislative history, Subpart F income is described as a dividend to the United States shareholders,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and it is on this basis that it is included in gross income. Other provisions of the Code conform to this understanding. Under \u00a7 952(c), Subpart F income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>may not exceed \"the earnings and profits\u201d of the foreign corporation in the taxable year. The amount of Subpart F income must, under \u00a7 951(a)(2)(B), be reduced by actual dividend distributions received by any person, other than the taxpayer, who had owned the taxpayer\u2019s stock during some part of the taxable year. And the foreign tax credit provisions, applicable to actual dividends, are applied in similar form to Subpart F income. \u00a7 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">To accept the Commissioner\u2019s contention would indeed have the effect of destroying the purpose of the dividend deduction of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38(a). A deduction may be taken only for dividends included in net income in the taxable year. If a deduction for Subpart F income were to be disallowed, the consequence would be to prohibit a deduction for that income even when distributed. For dividends actually received \u2014 but excluded from net income because comprised in Subpart F income reported in current or previous years \u2014 are not included in Federal income, thus are also excluded from State income, and hence could not be deducted therefrom. (The point is exemplified by the more than $10,000,000 in dividends actually received by Dow in 1969.) The Commissioner\u2019s position would simply reinstate the multiple taxation intended by the State scheme to be eliminated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The view we take accords with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emhart Corp., </em>443 Pa. 397 (1970), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 981 (1971), the only case cited in which the issue has been raised. There the taxpayer sought to deduct Subpart F income under a statutory provision authorizing a deduction for \"dividends received from any other corporation.\u201d Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, \u00a7 3420b 1(b) (Purdon 1964). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania contended that the deduction should be limited to - dividends \"received\u201d and should not embrace deemed distributions not actually received by the taxpayer. In <em>Emhart, </em>as here, intercorporate dividends could not be deducted unless they were included in Federal gross income. The court noted that \"if a corporation fails to take the deduction in the year it included the dividend in its federal return, it is unclear whether the corporation can ever take advantage of the deduction in a later year, for while the corporation will have 'received\u2019 the dividend, it will not have included that sum in its federal return \u2014 a prerequisite for the [State] deduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. The court found that failure to permit the deduction for Subpart F income could not be reconciled with the \"clear legislative determination that a corporation at some point is entitled to a deduction for dividends received from other corporations, presumably to avoid a double tax at the corporate level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">To conclude, although the Commissioner properly required inclusion of Subpart F income in gross income, she erred in failing to allow a deduction under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>C. <em>Foreign tax gross-up. </em>(1) <em>Description. </em>Under the Federal Code, domestic corporations are taxed on their world-wide income. They are also subject to tax by every other country in which they do business. To ease the resulting burden on international investment, the Code allows United States citizens and corporations paying income, war profits, or excess profits taxes in foreign countries to choose to take a \"foreign tax credit\u201d against Federal tax in the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued in the taxable year.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This operates as a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the domestic tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Where \u00a7 901 provides a credit for foreign taxes actually paid by a domestic taxpayer, \u00a7 902 goes on to allow a credit for foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by a foreign corporation of which any domestic corporate taxpayer owns at least 10% of the voting stock. The rationale for the \"indirect\u201d credit is that this shareholder has effectively paid \u2014 and is therefore \"deemed to have paid,\u201d \u00a7 902(a) \u2014 the foreign tax through a reduction in the foreign income available for repatriation in the form of dividends. See E. Owens &amp; G. Ball, The Indirect Credit 3-6 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Figuring the amount of the indirect credit has its difficulties. For example, if a foreign corporation, in respect of $100 earned in before-tax accumulated profits, paid $40 in local tax, and distributed $60 as a dividend to its domestic parent, it would be thought excessively generous or lenient to permit the parent to take all of the $40 as a credit. So the Supreme Court decided in <em>American Chicle Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 450 (1942), and interpreted \u00a7 902 to require the parent to compute the indirect credit by multiplying the foreign taxes paid by a fraction consisting of dividends received, divided by accumulated profits (defined in \u00a7 902[c][l] as total income without re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>duction for foreign or domestic taxes) \u2014 in the example stated, $40 X $60/$100 = $24.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This situation bred further difficulties. If the foreign tax rate was lower than the United States rate, the <em>American Chicle </em>rule could be thought to overcompensate the domestic shareholder by producing an over-all tax rate lower than the United States tax rate. See E. Owens, The Foreign Tax Credit 113-118 (1961). The rule was also thought unreasonably to favor corporations using foreign subsidiaries over those with foreign branches.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To remedy the situation, Congress in 1962 enacted the \"foreign tax gross-up.\u201d Under the new \u00a7 78 (quoted in the margin),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a fraction of the taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign subsidiary must be included \"as a dividend\u201d in the gross income of the domestic taxpayer electing to take the foreign tax credit. The fraction (set forth in \u00a7 902) consists, in the numerator, of the dividends actually received by the taxpayer, and, in the denominator, of so much of the foreign corporation\u2019s accumulated profits as exceeds the foreign tax. The effect of the gross-up provision in the example given would be, first, to require the domestic parent to include $100 as income and, second, to permit it to take the full $40 as a foreign tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>credit. The $40 added to the actual dividend distribution of $60 represents the foreign tax gross-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Under \u00a7 960 of the Code, the same ideas are used to enable a domestic shareholder to take an indirect credit for foreign taxes deemed paid on undistributed Subpart F income. In calculating the credit under \u00a7 960, the Sub-part F income included in gross income is \"grossed-up\u201d \u2014 fictionally increased \u2014 by the foreign taxes deemed paid. In the present case, the $411,256 that Dow reported as foreign tax gross-up represents the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by its foreign subsidiaries on the $8,539,-158 included as Subpart F income. But, having included that amount in gross income, Dow was permitted under \u00a7 960 to take the same amount<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> as its credit against Federal tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">(2) <em>Treatment of foreign tax gross-up under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30 (5) (a) and 38 (a) (1). </em>We turn to the State law. Dow\u2019s contention that the foreign tax gross-up may not be considered as income proceeds on the general proposition, not in dispute, that in order to be taxable as income an item must represent some benefit or accretion of wealth which may be fairly imputed to the taxpayer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Dow maintains that, unlike Subpart F income, the gross-up is not income to Dow\u2019s foreign subsidiaries; and it is not income to Dow. Indeed, in some circumstances the effect of the gross-up provision may be to require a domestic parent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>include in Federal income, as the deemed income of its foreign subsidiary, an amount greater than the accumulated profits of that subsidiary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Dow asserts that the gross-up is only an arithmetic procedure that may not be treated as taxable income \u2014 unless accompanied by the foreign tax credit whose proper calculation it is designed to assure and from which, according to Dow, it cannot be separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s chief response is that the indirect foreign tax credit on Subpart F income is in fact a benefit to Dow. The benefit takes the form of a reduction in Dow\u2019s Federal tax liability, and this reduction, the Commissioner suggests, may be treated as taxable income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a). The Commissioner observes that in <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, </em>130 Vt. 544 (1972), the Vermont Supreme Court seems to have accepted this view. It is instructive to note that the Vermont court went on to hold that if the gross-up was to be included in income \u2014 and Vermont law did not allow a corrective deduction for dividends \u2014 the apportionment formula applied to the taxpayer must be modified. <em>Id. </em>at 556-557. As the court explained in a later opinion, the modification was required in order to prevent \"an arbitrary and unfair representation of the 'extent of the business activities of a corporation within this state.\u2019 \u201d <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, </em>133 Vt. 93, 98 (1974).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In 1971 the Vermont Legislature had acted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>exclude gross-up from taxable income for the future. 1971 Vt. Acts, c. 73, \u00a7 12, amending Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, \u00a7 5811(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We must ask whether the logic of the Commissioner\u2019s argument would not extend to permit State taxation of all the various diminishments of Federal tax liability derived from credits or deductions granted by the Federal Code. But such reductions do not conform to conceptions of taxable income.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We need not, however, attempt to deal with the large and pervasive issues suggested by the Commissioner\u2019s thesis. For it seems the Commissioner seizes on the foreign tax credit and calls that \"income\u201d in order to distract attention from the fact that the gross-up involves at least an hypothesized dividend which may be deductible under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The gross-up-foreign tax credit symbiosis is a means of calculating a suitable Federal tax credit for the United States parent and in truth it is a strain to deal with any part of it as \"income\u201d for State purposes. However, we must be faithful to the corporate excise which incorporates the Federal definition of gross income, and that comprehends the gross-up. The gross-up is expressly assimilated by Federal law to a dividend: \"[A]n amount equal to the taxes deemed to be paid ... shall be treated ... as a dividend received by such domestic corporation from the foreign corporation.\u201d \u00a7 78. We think it retains its character as a dividend under the State law and becomes deductible as such.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In a sense, the State divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>dend deduction serves a function regarding the gross-up comparable to that supplied by the Federal foreign tax credit although the dollar incidences to the taxpayer may vary.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Commissioner protests the allowance of the deduction because it would, in her view, subvert the legislative purpose of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b) </em>(iii), which disallows deductions for \"taxes ... imposed by any state\u201d (read to include foreign country, \u00a7 30 [13]). But there is a fundamental difference between allowing a deduction for gross-up and allowing a deduction for taxes paid to other States. Unlike the State taxes, the gross-up is deemed a dividend and therefore included in gross income as an additional item of income. Allowing a deduction for gross-up has the effect of off-setting the inclusion of foreign taxes as an additional item of income, not of permitting a deduction of foreign taxes from gross income normally computed. If a corporation doing business in the Commonwealth earns $100 in another State of the union and pays $40 in taxes to that State, the effect of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (6) (iii), will be to require the corporation to include $100 in taxable income subject to apportionment and to disallow a deduction for the $40 in taxes paid. By contrast, if the corporation has a foreign subsidiary with $100 in Subpart F income, and pays $40 in foreign tax on that income, the consequence of the Commissioner\u2019s position with respect to the gross-up would be to require the corporation to include $140 in income and to disallow a deduction for the $40 added to the $100 actually earned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The purpose of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(5)(\u00bf&gt;)(iii), is to prohibit deduction of $40 from the $100 of gross income as ordinarily conceived, not of that amount when it has been added to gross income \u201cas a dividend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On another tack, the Commissioner complains that it is merely fictional to speak of the gross-up as a dividend, and the State should not so regard it. But the inclusion of the gross-up as income under State law is based on the Federal fiction. The Commissioner is adopting the fiction for purposes of inclusion but seeks to reject it for purposes of exclusion, thus taxing as income an item included as such only because it helps to assure proper computation of a credit disallowed by State law. We cannot accept the Commissioner\u2019s reasoning or result.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Our conclusion that the foreign tax gross-up is deductible as a dividend accords with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emhart Corp., supra, </em>and with <em>Getty Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of Revenue, </em>1 CCH Del. Tax Kept. par. 200-286 (Del. Tax App. Bd. 1975), where the gross-up was held within a State statute allowing a deduction for \"[dividends received ... on shares of stock for which foreign tax credit is provided under the applicable provisions\u201d of the Code, the Board stating that \"the words 'dividend received\u2019 mean, for the purpose here, \u2018dividend deemed to have been received.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>D. <em>Deduction for dividends previously included in Sub-part F income but actually received in 1969. </em>What was said at B above suffices to dispose of Dow\u2019s contention that it properly deducted the $3,740,485 actually received in 1969 but included in Subpart F income in previous years. The dividend deduction of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1), is confined to dividends included in taxable net income for the year in which the deduction is claimed. The Commissioner properly disallowed the claimed deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The disposition will be as indicated in II above. The case is remanded to the Commissioner of Revenue for computation of the proper amount of the abatement owed to Dow for the erroneous inclusion of Subpart F income and foreign tax gross-up in taxable net income subject to apportionment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> Unless otherwise noted, we use the word \"foreign\u201d to refer to foreign countries, not States other than Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> See generally Dane, Taxation of Corporations and Banks: 1966 Legislation, 52 Mass.

This letter, however, hardly establishes an administrative practice entitled to deference, and Dow challenged the interpretation as early as 1969.
