In so deciding we make a long anticipated but relatively minor change in the law of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The plaintiff law partnership Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced this action against the defendant SCA Services, Inc. (a company doing a waste disposal business), to recover fees for legal services performed for one Berton Steir. The claim is based on a provision of an agreement between the defendant and Steir (among others) by which the defendant undertook to pay legal fees incurred by Steir in circumstances and under conditions to be detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The record made on the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, converted through the reception of affidavits into a motion for summary judgment (see Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824-826 [1974]), was, briefly stated, as follows. In March, 1976, a dispute arose within the board of directors of the defendant corporation, dividing the board four members to four. The dispute centered on allegations that one Christopher P. Recklitis, formerly president and treasurer of the corporation, had engaged in a series of transactions from 1972 to 1975 by which he diverted funds unlawfully from the defendant to himself or his controlled corporations. Under the scheme alleged, Recklitis contrived to withdraw moneys from the defendant as loans and used them to pay personal debts, while falsely informing the defendant\u2019s auditors that the loans had legitimate corporate purposes. Further, Recklitis caused various properties owned by him to be purchased by the defendant at grossly excessive prices. He also used corporate funds to make unauthorized and unreported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>bribes and payoffs. The defendant became aware of some of these alleged misdeeds in 1975 and retained counsel to carry out an investigation. It was completed in March, 1976, and in consequence the defendant brought separate actions against Recklitis, Stanton L. Kurzman, a member of the board, and Steir, formerly president and at the time of suit chairman of the board. This third suit against Steir charged him with breach of fiduciary duties, negligent mismanagement, and intentional waste of corporate assets; there were allegations that Steir knew of some of Recklitis\u2019s illegal activities and had assisted him in their perpetration. About the same time in 1976, Steir, Kurzman, and two other members of the board instituted two actions against the defendant herein. (The grounds do not appear from the present record.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">With the board at an impasse, as noted, and cross-litigations pending, settlement negotiations commenced on June 24, 1976, which on August 13, 1976, resulted in a contract among the eight directors and the defendant. It was agreed that the four law suits (those mentioned other than that against Recklitis) would be dismissed with prejudice and without costs, and there were to be mutual releases of all those claims, of which the parties to those suits had actual notice, that had been or could have been asserted therein. Kurzman, Steir, and the two directors aligned with them agreed to resign as board members or officers of the defendant or its subsidiaries, and to deliver irrevocable proxies of shares of the defendant owned by them to designated proxy agents. The defendant was to enter into a contract with Steir by which Steir would serve as a consultant to the defendant; and the defendant was to pay the resigning directors the legal expenses incurred by them before the date of the settlement agreement, as well as the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they had laid out in the performance of their duties as directors or officers of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We come now to the further provision of the settlement contract which is in issue in the present case. By that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>provision, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant agreed to \"continue to indemnify and hold harmless\u201d each of the resigning directors for \"all losses, liabilities or expenses\u201d incurred by him resulting \"from any acts or omissions to act... while a director, officer or employee of [the defendant] or any of its subsidiaries ... and each of the [resigning directors] may select his own counsel whose reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid on a current basis directly by [the defendant], all to the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law.\u201d The obligation was expressly stated to include legal fees and expenses to arise from a then pending investigation of the defendant by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The agreement was executed by the eight directors and the defendant. The plaintiff law firm had represented Steir throughout the preceding negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In pursuance of the agreement, the defendant twice paid the plaintiff its submitted statements of fees and expenses for representing Steir in the SEC matter. The defendant made the payments direct to the plaintiff, upon the plaintiffs statements addressed to the defendant, followed by Steir\u2019s letters of request to the defendant. The defendant pursuant to the agreement made similar payments direct to other attorneys representing Steir, as well as to attorneys retained by the other resigning directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>But on the plaintiff\u2019s statements of March 1 and May 28, 1977, respectively for $18,345.34 and $10,137.03, the defendant refused payment. The defendant had apparently learned of an SEC determination to bring suit; it took the position that it would decline further payments to the plaintiff (or other attorneys for Steir) until Steir vindicated himself in the SEC case or restored to the defendant the $125,000 it claimed Steir had wrongfully abstracted from it. On August 8, 1977, the SEC in fact commenced a civil action in a United States District Court against Recklitis, Kurzman, Steir, and others, based in substance on the alleged Recklitis and related depredations. The defendant, however, has continued to make payments to attorneys representing Kurzman because, it says, Kurzman has made good to the defendant the amounts he earlier misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The plaintiff brought the present action on July 25, 1977, praying a declaratory judgment. Before answer, the plaintiff applied for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendant from failing to pay the March and May bills, or bills that would be submitted for later work on Steir\u2019s behalf. The injunction issued (without opinion) on condition that the plaintiff post bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant\u2019s answer, besides denials, asserted a number of affirmative defenses: that the plaintiff was not a party to the settlement agreement and therefore could not sue to enforce it; that indemnification was unlawful in the circumstances by Massachusetts, Delaware, and Federal law; that the provision sued on had been procured by misrepresentations (including failure to disclose material facts) on the part of Steir. Also asserted was a claim to set off the $125,000 against any recovery to which the plaintiff would be otherwise entitled. The defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings on the first affirmative defense mentioned \u2014 that the plaintiff, not a party to the agreement, was disabled from suing to enforce it. Affidavits were filed on both sides with respect to the negotiation of the critical provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Treating the motion as one for summary judgment, the judge held for the defendant, applying Massachusetts law as to the standing of third-party beneficiaries. Thereupon the plaintiff moved to amend its complaint to substitute Steir for itself as plaintiff in the action and correspondingly as the party to the preliminary injunction. The motions were denied. Later the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to enforce liability on the bond obligation in the amount of $34,526.31. The plaintiff appealed from the summary judgment, and from the order denying its motions to substitute; it also appealed from judgment for the amount stated. The appeals were consolidated and are brought here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We discuss a choice of law issue and then pass to the question of the plaintiffs standing to sue. Other issues resolve themselves accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">1. <em>Choice of law. </em>The judge was correct in concluding that the question of the right of the plaintiff to sue on the contract should be decided in accordance with the law of Massachusetts. Choice of law was important for the judge below, as he conceived that the law of Massachusetts on the beneficiary\u2019s right differed from that of Delaware. As we now declare the law of Massachusetts, it is probably similar to Delaware\u2019s; but since we cannot be altogether sure of Delaware\u2019s hypothesized precise disposition on the particular facts, choice of law may remain significant, and we discuss it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Traditionally this court has held, as a general rule, that material issues arising in actions to enforce contracts are to be answered accoiding to the law of the place where the contract was made (see <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Gunstock Acres, Inc., </em>370 Mass. 378, 381-382 [1976]; <em>Dicker </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>360 Mass. 735, 736 [1972]; Fine, Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>chusetts Contract Cases and Problems in the Choice of Law, 43 Mass. L.Q. No. 3, at 46 [1958]), and that rule has been held to comprehend the issue of third-party beneficiary rights. See <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Morrison, 2 </em>Met. 381, 398-400 (1841). It has been recognized that reference to the law of the place of making can produce awkward or arbitrary results where that place had no or little other connection with the contract or the parties (see A.T. von Mehren &amp; D.T. Trautman, The Law of Multistate Problems 183-193 [1965]), and almost all States have replaced place-of-making or other one-factor tests with a more functional approach. See <em>Breslin </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>134 N.J. Super. 357 (1975) (\"interest\u201d analysis); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188 (1971) (\"most significant relationship\u201d); R. Leflar, American Conflicts Law \u00a7 150 (3d ed. 1977). Similar ideas have been at work in our recent decisions transforming the rule about applying to a tort the law of the place of the happening. See <em>Pevoski </em>v. <em>Pevoski, </em>371 Mass. 358, 359-361 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The facts of the present case deprive us of an opportunity to elect among the extant doctrines, for not only was the contract executed in Massachusetts, but the plaintiff is a Boston partnership, the defendant\u2019s principal place of business is in Massachusetts, Steir resides in Massachusetts, and all but the early negotiations of settlement took place here. It is true the defendant was incorporated in Delaware but it has no other substantial contact with that State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (The facts were brought out in affidavits.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There is argument that the reference in the contract to \"the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law\u201d ought to be taken as an agreement that Delaware law should govern all issues emanating from the settlement agreement, including the issue of who might maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>suit. Cf. <em>Maxwell Shapiro Woolen Co. </em>v. <em>Amerotron Corp., </em>339 Mass. 252 (1959); G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-105(1); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 (1971). We join the judge below in thinking the quoted words indicate no such understanding; they are read most plausibly as a reference to the Delaware corporation law to fix the permissible extent of a corporation\u2019s indemnification of its employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Other language would have been used if the parties had the broader purpose. See <em>Massengale </em>v. <em>Transitron Elec. Corp., </em>385 F.2d 83, 86-87 (1st Cir. 1967). (Of course, there is nothing unusual about the laws of different States applying respectively to various phases of a single transaction or incident. See <em>Pevoski </em>v. <em>Pevoski, supra </em>at 360-362.) Nor can we accept the suggestion that the plaintiff\u2019s standing to sue is an issue related to \"internal corporate affairs\u201d to be governed by the law of the State of incorporation. See Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">2. <em>Suit by third-party beneficiary. </em>As recently observed in <em>Falmouth Hosp. </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>376 Mass. 580, 582 (1978), the law of the Commonwealth before the mid-Nineteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Century looked with considerable favor on enforcement of a contract by an outsider for whose benefit it was made;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that was the view generally taken in this country.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But in <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>1 Gray 317, 321 (1854), this court, impressed by English authority,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> wrote that \"a plaintiff, in an action on a simple contract, must be the person from whom the consideration of the contract actually moved, and... a stranger to the consideration cannot sue on the contract. The rule is sometimes thus expressed: There must be a privity of contract between the plaintiff and defendant, in order to render the defendant liable to an action, by the plaintiff, on the contract.\u201d But an abstract notion of \"privity\u201d serves no better purpose here than elsewhere in the law: compare the attack on privity as a limiting conception in the tort law. Prosser, The Assault upon the Citadel, 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960). If privity requirements reflected a disinclination to compel a contracting party to meet in litigation a person with whom he had not chosen to do business, they were a reminder of a simple, neighborly society already on the way out, and now long vanished. See L. M. Friedman, Contract Law in America 121-122 (1965). At all events, American courts, under the inspiration of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>20 N.Y. 268 (1859), have held quite generally that \"creditor\u201d beneficiaries may sue on contracts to which they were not parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Professor Corbin says: \"If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>promisee in a contract contemplates the present or future existence of a duty or liability to a third party and enters into the contract with the expressed intent that the performance contracted for is to satisfy and discharge that duty or liability, the third party is a creditor beneficiary\u201d entitled to enforce the contract. 4 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 787, at 95 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This court has in fact frequently recognized the right of suit of creditor beneficiaries fitting Corbin\u2019s description, but it has been in the form of \"exceptions\u201d to (or formulas of evasions of) the supposed general prohibitory rule of the <em>Mellen </em>case. Thus we have been able to find that the promisor had \"in his hands money which, in equity and good conscience, belongs to\u201d the creditor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Or that the promisee could sue as \"trustee\u201d for the third party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Or that the promisee\u2019s right of exoneration was an asset recoverable from the promisor by a creditor\u2019s suit in equity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Other exceptions, some of them statutory, were more particularized.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Scholars have catalogued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>assembled the exceptions to show that despite our formal adherence to the <em>Mellen </em>doctrine, we have actually reached nearly the same results as other jurisdictions which have rejected it. See L. L. Fuller &amp; M. A. Eisenberg, Basic Contract Law 890-891 (1972); Note, The Third Party Beneficiary Rule in Massachusetts, 8 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 130 (1973); Bernhard, Third Party Beneficiary Rights in Massachusetts, 49 Mass. L.Q. 159 (1964); Note, Contracts for the Benefit of Third Persons in Massachusetts, 28 B.U.L. Rev. 476 (1948). But of some of the exceptions, it has been said, with justification, that they are \"rationalization[s] after the event\u201d with \"obvious weaknesses\u201d of analysis. 4 A. Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 790, at 121.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And there has been uncertainty as to the scope of various exceptions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The rather confusing patchwork should be supplanted by the general rule now prevalent, which avoids circuity of action and is calculated to accord with the probable intentions of the contracting parties and to respond to the reasonable reliance of the third-party creditor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As we now adopt the general rule,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we need not pause to consider whether the present case can by any possibility be squeezed into one or other of the \"exceptions\u201d; the plaintiff shows a most restrained enthusiasm in trying to do this. We do not hesitate to apply a general rule \"retroac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tively\u201d to the present case, for we have repeatedly reserved the point whether we would repeal so much of <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Whipple </em>as remained; the handwriting has long been on the wall.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It happens, moreover, that no recent case has been cited in which the <em>Mellen </em>doctrine was used to deny recovery to a beneficiary of the creditor variety.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We have yet to consider in relation to the particular facts whether the plaintiff qualifies as a creditor beneficiary entitled to sue the promisor, or, on the contrary, is no more than an \"incidental\u201d beneficiary without such a right of suit. We search for indicia of intention against the background of the transaction. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 133 (Tent. Drafts Nos. 1-7,1973). The defendant argues that the contract provision was one for indemnification alone, and in such situations the third party has usually not been accorded a right of action against the indemnitor to recover the payments due the indemnitee. \"The performance promised must be one that will in fact discharge the promisee\u2019s (or another party\u2019s) obligation to a third person; if it will not do this, the third person may be a creditor of the promisee,but he is not a creditor beneficiary of the contract. Such is the case where the defendant has promised an obligor (or debtor) to indemnify him and save him harmless with respect to the obligation or debt.\u201d 4 A. Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 787, at 102. This view is reflected in many decisions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Now it is true that the provision at bar says that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>defendant is to \"indemnify and hold harmless each of the parties\u201d (resigning directors), and it may also be noted that Steir in his covering letters referred to \"amounts which [the defendant] may reimburse me or pay for my account.\u201d The defendant would conclude that the expressed intent was to benefit Steir, not his attorneys, and any benefit flowing to the plaintiff should be regarded as \"incidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">This, however, would disregard the fact that the parties agreed the payments under the clause would be made \"directly\u201d to Steir\u2019s counsel. The defendant concedes that this language \"changes the pocket into which the indemnification payments flow.\u201d The difference is not trivial. If payments were to be made to Steir, performance by the defendant would not discharge Steir\u2019s obligation to the plaintiff; the contrary is true when payments are to be made direct to the plaintiff, and it becomes very plausible to allow the plaintiff his action against the defendant. The distinction is taken in numerous decisions and in both Restatements of Contracts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The result is not al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>tered merely because words of indemnity have been used (here in company with the \u201cdirectly\u201d language). \u201cThe mere form of the words should not be conclusive ...; surrounding facts may indicate that payment direct to the creditor was the kind of indemnification that the parties intended.\u201d 4 A. Corbin, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 787, at 102. <em>See Acoustics, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Sur. Co., </em>74 Nev. 6 (1958); <em>Rochell </em>v. <em>Moore-Handley Hardware Co., </em>239 Ala. 555 (1940). It is suggested (with affidavit support) that the indemnification wording shows the defendant intended to benefit Steir. That is true in a sense, but it is not inconsistent with an intention to benefit the plaintiff, and one rather clearly expressed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We observe that our holding that the plaintiff has a locus standi on the facts disclosed by no means assures it ultimate recovery. As noted, the defendant in its answer has set out a number of defenses including the alleged illegality of the provision sued on, and its alleged procurement through misrepresentations. We do not reach the question of the soundness of any of the defenses or of their availability as against the plaintiff. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 140 (Tent. Drafts Nos. 1-7, 1973); 4 A. Corbin, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 818. Cf. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Prebuilt Co., </em>329 Mass. 166 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The summary judgment for the defendant will be reversed. We leave undisturbed the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>denying the plaintiffs motions to substitute, as those motions were evidently made on the assumption, arguendo, that the plaintiff could not itself maintain the action, and the assumption is now held incorrect.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judgment against the plaintiff on the bond obligation was based on the judge\u2019s supposition that the preliminary injunction had been improperly issued because the whole action must fail; as the action stands, that judgment will be vacated. That should not be taken automatically to reinstate the preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, if so advised, may reapply for interlocutory relief which should be considered in the light of this opinion and the facts as they may then appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> We use the collective designation of the partnership, as do the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> \"SCA shall continue to indemnify and hold harmless each of the parties of the first part for any and all losses, liabilities or expenses, if any (other than .. .),\u2022 suffered or incurred by such party arising out of or resulting from any acts or omissions to act by such party while a director, officer or employee of SCA or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective date hereof and each of the parties of the first part may select his own counsel whose reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid on a current basis directly by SCA, all to the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law.
