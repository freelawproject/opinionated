L. c. 15, \u00a7 1G.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Attorney General decided to resort to litigation and, joining with him the Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education, he commenced the present action in October, 1978, in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County against MIAA, the interrelated Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Council (Council), and an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>dividual occupying important positions in both organizations. The plaintiffs prayed a declaration that the quoted rule violates the Massachusetts Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and regulations promulgated under that statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and requested corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>sponding injunctive relief. After answer, the parties joined in a stipulation of facts, and a single justice reserved and reported the case upon the pleadings and stipulation. We outline the facts as they appear without significant dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Virtually all public secondary schools in the Commonwealth are members of MIAA and, by virtue of what is in effect a delegation of authority by local school committees under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47,* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MIAA governs and regulates competitive sports among these schools. Some private secondary schools are likewise members and enter into the same competition. All member schools undertake to submit to the rules promulgated by MIAA; they pay dues to MIAA in proportion to their student populations. (MIAA also shares in the receipts from Statewide tournaments, many of which are held on State-owned property.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Framing of the rules which cover all aspects of interscholastic sports, including practice time, recruitment, and age, academic, and residence requirements for player eligibility, is in the hands of the Council, whose members, parties defendants here, are drawn from a Statewide association of school committees, and from associations of school superintendents, administrators, and principals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>MIAA may recommend rule changes to the Council, and it is the MIAA\u2019s executive body, called the Board of Control, that is responsible for enforcement (including interpretation) of the rules, with power to impose a variety of sanctions upon offending member schools, ranging from warning or censure to a year\u2019s suspension from interscholastic play. Because the rules are comprehensive in scope, it is evident that their policies reach beyond the interscholastic sphere and to some considerable extent also influence the intramural athletic activities of the member schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The rules \"recognize\u201d for interscholastic play sixteen boys\u2019, and thirteen girls\u2019 sports: the names coincide except that baseball, football, hockey, riflery, and wrestling are listed only for boys, and field hockey and softball only for girls.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Originally part II, \u00a7 1, rule 17, entitled \"Boys and Girls on the Same Team,\u201d provided for strict sex segregation. By 1976, evidently reflecting regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education, and, more generally, the adoption of ERA in that year, rule 17 had been amended so that a student could not be barred from competing for a place on a team because of sex unless the school provided a \"separate but equal\u201d team.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Some schools proceeded on that basis to admit male students to a \"girls\u2019 \u201d team where there was no counterpart \"boys\u2019 \u201d team. As there were no boys\u2019 interscholastic softball teams, Newton South High School in spring, 1978, pursuant to rule 17, allowed two male students to play on its girls\u2019 team. This provoked the Massachusetts Division of Girls\u2019 and Women\u2019s Sports to protest to MIAA\u2019s predecessor organization, and then, on June 6, 1978, to commence suit against that organization with a view to preventing Newton South from competing in the girls\u2019 State softball tournament.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With that action pending, MIAA recommended to the Council that a subdivision d be added to rule 17 which would prohibit boys from playing on girls\u2019 teams. It was adopted (with a nonsymmetrical clause regarding girls playing on boys\u2019 teams), effective July 1, 1978, in the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\"With due regard to protecting the welfare and safety of all students participating in MIAA athletics: 1) No boy may play on a girls\u2019 team. 2) A girl may play on a boys\u2019 team if that sport is not offered in the school for the girl.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The State Board of Education took the view that rule 17(d)(1) could not stand legally in its blanket form, and the present action eventuated. The state of affairs on which the new rule impinged, and the policing of the rule, are described in the stipulation of the parties. When the rule was announced, Easthampton High School, which had no swimming team for boys, was allowing boys on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the girls\u2019 team (the record does not disclose how many boys). There was a similar situation at Pioneer Valley Regional High School in field hockey,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and at Amherst Regional, Greenfield, and Northampton high schools in volleyball. The previously all-female David Hale Fanning Trade School in Worcester had then recently admitted forty-eight boys in a total enrollment of 585. As the school could not field teams exclusively for boys, it allowed boys to play on the girls\u2019 softball and basketball squads (again, as with other schools, there is no indication of how many boys participated).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In summer and fall of 1978, administrators at Fanning, Greenfield, and the school district encompassing Pioneer Valley requested waiver of the new rule,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or of an interpretive memorandum issued by MIAA on October 31 stating that \"[s]chools with girls\u2019 teams on which a boy or boys participated during any interscholastic competition must record each contest where 17-d-l was violated as a loss.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The waiver requests were denied,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the Green<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>field and Pioneer Valley volleyball teams, which would have been eligible for tournament competition on their actual won-lost records, were unable to qualify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Concluding our statement of the case, we have first to note that the parties agree, and we concur, that rule 17(d)(1) must be viewed as \"State action\u201d for legal purposes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, we may be permitted the comment that the rule attacks a small problem with heavy artillery. In the general run of cases there has been no difficulty, as \"separate but equal\u201d teams accommodate the students of both sexes, and no question is raised in this case about the legality of separate but equal teams.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rule 17(d)(2) accepts that where there is no opportunity for a girl on that basis, she may compete for a place on the boys\u2019 team. The converse problem apparently has arisen in only a handful of schools and only where there was a girls\u2019 team but no boys\u2019 team in a particular sport. There has been no demonstration by those defending rule 17(d)(1) that male participation on girls\u2019 teams after 1976 was other than limited or that it involved any serious distortion or disruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">1. <em>Prima facie invalidity of a total ban. </em>In a recent <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>374 Mass. 836 (1977), we gave our view of a proposed amendment of G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>would have disallowed all participation of girls with boys on the \u201ccontact sports teams\u201d of football and wrestling. The Justices\u2019 opinion was that \u201c[t]he enactment of [the proposed bill] would violate art. 106 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth [ERA], The absolute prohibition in the proposed legislation cannot survive the close scrutiny to which a statutory classification based solely on sex must be subjected. A prohibition of all females from voluntary participation in a particular sport under every possible circumstance serves no compelling State interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842. (The Justices reserved the question whether a statute \u201cmore limited in its impact\u201d would serve such a State interest; in particular we did not say whether women could be excluded from men\u2019s teams in a particular sport if they were provided with equal facilities.) Judging from decisions around the country, we think the view we expressed as to wholesale exclusion of girls from boys\u2019 interscholastic teams where no girls\u2019 teams were provided would be accepted by the courts in jurisdictions having ERA (see <em>Darrin </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>85 Wash. 2d 859 [1975]; <em>Packet </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>18 Pa. Commw. Ct. 45 [1975]),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and generally also by courts applying the less emphatic equal protection or due process clauses of State and Federal Constitutions. See <em>Brenden </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. 742, </em>477 F.2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Michigan State Bd. of Educ., </em>472 F.2d 1207 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>Leffel </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>444 F. Supp, 1117 (E.D. Wis. 1978); <em>Yellow Springs Exempted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Village School Dist. Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Ohio High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>443 F. Supp. 753 (S.D. Ohio 1978); <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Meiklejohn, </em>430 F. Supp. 164 (D. Colo. 1977); <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>Kansas State High School Activities Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>377 F. Supp. 1233 (D. Kan. 1973); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Nebraska School Activities Ass\u2019n, </em>341 F. Supp. 258 (D. Neb. 1972); <em>Haas </em>v. <em>South Bend Community School Corp., </em>259 Ind. 515 (1972).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The equal protection guaranty and a fortiori an equal rights amendment condemn discrimination on grounds of sex \u2014 whether male or female. Thus in an earlier <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>373 Mass. 883 (1977), we said that a proposed statute intended to bar boys from a \"girl officers regiment\u201d at a public high school would be unconstitutional by reference to the ERA (it was invalid, we said, under the equal protection standard of review as well). Discriminations against men as such have been condemned in many cases, for example: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613 (1975) (the law could not pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ish unwed fathers, while exempting mothers from punishment for the act of begetting: decision before ERA). <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268 (1979) (husbands could not be barred from obtaining alimony available in similar circumstances to wives). <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190 (1976) (impermissible to allow girls to buy 3.2% beer at age eighteen but boys not until age twenty-one). Indeed, even if equal rights provisions could be viewed primarily as a means of eradicating discrimination against women, they tend to protect men as well, because disadvantages suffered by males are often premised on a \"romantic paternalism\u201d stigmatizing to women.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although women have been the usual victims of sex discrimination, there are significant exceptions to this generality, for example, legislation imposing harsher criminal penalties on men.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the field of athletics, where opportunities in the past have grossly favored males,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it remains the fact that some of the less athletic men have been denied active participation in competitive sports in part because of sex segregation. The prejudice to an individual male is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>described in a recent opinion holding \u2014 on special Federal grounds not urged by the parties herein \u2014 that a high school boy should be allowed to compete for a place on the girls\u2019 volleyball team, the only one representing the school in interscholastic volleyball.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">It may be predicated, then, that the absolute bar to male participation imposed by rule 17(d)(1) \u2014 appearing in remarkable contrast to the generally recognized right of girls as stated in rule 17(d)(2) \u2014 is prima facie invalid under ERA or our cognate statute barring sex discrimination in the educational sphere.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the defendants, after an effort to avoid the whole problem by intimating that the prohibition is in reality not sex-based at all (considered at point 3 [a] below), seek to justify it by suggesting that it forwards the important goals of protecting the safety of players (point 3 [b]), and preserving emergent girls\u2019 sports programs from feared inundation by male athletes (point 3 [c]). We examine at point 2 the attitude to be taken constitutionally toward such claimed justifications, and particularly a justification in terms of remedying or compensating for an historical injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>2. <em>Standard to be applied to attempted justifications. </em>We have held under ERA that classifications on the basis of sex are subject to a degree of constitutional scrutiny \"at least as strict as the scrutiny required by the Fourteenth Amendment for racial classifications\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 21 [1977]),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and noted that such classifications are not permissible unless they meet two conditions: they must \"further a demonstrably compelling interest and limit their impact as narrowly as possible consistent with their legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> No compelling State purpose could be identified in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>374 Mass. 836, 842 (1977), to justify excluding all females from any voluntary participation with boys in football and wrestling, and a proposed statute with such a ban was thought invalid on its face. Conversely, no State purpose justified banning boys from the girl officers regiment. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>373 Mass. 883, 887 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We did not confront in either <em>Opinion </em>a discrimination based on sex \u2014 now, pursuant to ERA, a category in a constitutional tier at least as high as race \u2014 which could lay a claim to having a benign or remedial attitude toward the historically oppressed class. That problem we meet here, in so far as the defendants seek to justify the disability they want to fasten on male students on the ground that it is designed to guard the burgeoning athletic programs for females. Certainly it can be said that no stigma attaches to the boys who would be shut out; they are not branded as unworthy to play alongside girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><em>Regents of the Univ. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 287-305, 356-362 (1978), is a point of reference. In the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of race or ethnicity \u2014 a program of admission to a State medical school calculated to favor minority applicants \u2014 five of the Justices had to consider what if any adjustment of the \"strict scrutiny\u201d approach should be made where it was claimed for a discrimination that it constituted \"affirmative action\u201d assisting in some degree classes previously disfavored, that it was aimed not at perpetuating inequality but, on the contrary, at eradicating the remains of past discrimination. This was but another way of asking what must be the strength of a justification tendered to overcome the basic abhorrence of classification grounded on race.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">One of the Justices in <em>Bakke </em>applied an undiminished \"strict scrutiny\u201d standard to the case notwithstanding the special justification asserted for the discrimination in favor of minorities. 438 U.S. at 287-305 (Powell, J.).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The other four Justices settled on a level of scrutiny that was \"strict \u2014 not' \"strict\u201d in theory and fatal in fact,\u2019 because it is stigma that causes fatality \u2014 but strict and searching nonetheless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> At another place in that joint opinion, the Justices spoke of whether the classification \"serve[d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>important governmental objectives and [was] substantially related to achievement of those objectives\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 359), a level of inquiry borrowed from equal protection decisions in the realm of gender. See <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>430 U.S. 313, 317 (1977); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This somewhat relaxed standard would still call for a judgment whether the discrimination served an important public purpose and, if so, whether it was proportioned to that purpose and did not result in excessive inequality. The latest expression by the Court on the justification that would be needed to sustain a sex preference indeed says it must be \"exceedingly persuasive.\u201d <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979). It is a notable fact, too, that the Court has not intimated that it would apply any lowered standard of review to cases of discrimination explicitly based on sex merely because a remedial or benign explanation was offered.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Conceivably an MIAA rule might be so nicely drawn with attention to purpose and scope that a choice among standards might become critical in deciding the rule\u2019s validity. But precise election among standards may not be of the essence here, where we confront an absolute prohibition of a boy\u2019s joining a girls\u2019 team in any sport and under any conditions. We doubt that such a rule could be sustained under any mentioned approach, or variant.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>373 Mass. 883, 887 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>(1977). Least of all may it be sustained in the Commonwealth with a specifically directed ERA, not simply a general equal protection guaranty. Under ERA it is especially fitting, and, we think, required, that any purported justification for a classification based on sex, even one claimed to involve \"affirmative action,\u201d should be weighed with great care.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">3. <em>Purported justifications, </em>(a) <em>Sex as a \"proxy\u201d for function. </em>The defendants seem to suggest in the course of their argument that the discrimination under attack is in reality not one based on sex but rather on functional differences deriving in the main from biology, and is thus not proscribed by the ERA. No doubt biological circumstance does contribute to some over-all male advantages. But we think the differences are not so clear or uniform as to justify a rule in which sex is sought to be used as a kind of \"proxy\u201d for a functional classification. See <em>Caban </em>v. <em>Mohammed, </em>441 U.S. 380, 389-391 (1979), and the dissent of Justice Stevens at 403-408; <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268, 281-283 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Our point is illustrated by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra. </em>There the court struck down a criminal statute that punished fathers but not mothers for begetting children out of wedlock; but we upheld the part of the law designed to establish paternity and the obligation of child support because it reflected functional differences, biologically based, between males and females: childbearing renders obvious the identity of the mother, while the father may easily escape recognition. The classification was \"more than ... sex-based.\u201d It reflected \"significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>circumstantial differences between the fathers and the mothers of illegitimate children\u201d; its scheme did not rely on \" 'archaic and overbroad generalizations, but, instead, the demonstrable fact that male and female ... [parents of illegitimate children] are <em>not </em>similarly situated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617-618, quoting in part from <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>419 U.S. 498, 508 (1975) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>MacKenzie </em>suggests that if all high school boys outstripped all high school girls in all athletic endeavors, total separation might be justifiable; the line would be drawn in truth between students in different ability-groups. But this hardly resembles the situation in athletics today (as, indeed, rule 17[d][2] itself seems to recognize), and it becomes every day less descriptive of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The general male athletic superiority based on physical features<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> is challenged by the development in increasing numbers of female athletes whose abilities exceed those of most men, and in some cases approach those of the most talented men.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Coordination, concentration, strategic acumen, and technique or form (capabilities of both sexes) intermix with strength and speed (where males have some biologic advantages) to produce athletic results. Cf. <em>Brenden </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. 742, </em>477 F.2d 1292, 1300 (8th Cir. 1973). Classification on strict grounds of sex, without reference to actual skill differen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tials in particular sports, would merely echo \"archaic and overbroad generalizations.\u201d <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Ballard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Thus rule 17(d)(1) must be taken to be the intentional use of sex as a discriminant, a practice forbidden by ERA unless somehow excused or justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">(b) <em>Safety. </em>The defendants argue that the gender-based absolute exclusion is necessary to achieve an important State interest, protection of players\u2019 safety. Indeed, \"protecting the ... safety of all students\u201d appears in the preamble of the rule (in company with the vague term \"welfare\u201d) as the rule\u2019s objective. It may be enough to say \u2014 as the plaintiffs do \u2014 that the defendants have not satisfied their burden of supporting the claim with facts. See <em>Bakke, supra, </em>438 U.S. at 305, 320. Nevertheless we analyze the claim by reference to law and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendants\u2019 argument on the score of safety or health was implicitly rejected in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>374 Mass. 836 (1977), where the proposed ban on girls\u2019 participation in football and wrestling was considered invalid. A girl is surely not less exposed to injury as a member of a predominantly male team, than as one of a team predominantly female but with some male players. In any case, a girl is entitled as much as a boy to choose to take a risk, subject always to safety rules and appropriate supervision and equipment. As was said in <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Meiklejohn, supra, </em>430 F. Supp. at 169, where it was held that considerations of safety did not justify excluding a qualified girl from a soccer team in interscholastic competition: \"Any notion that young women are so inherently weak, delicate or physically inadequate that the state must protect them from the folly of participation in vigorous athletics is a cultural anachronism unrelated to reality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The defendants offer in their brief a statement by a medical advisor (there is no citation to a publication) that attempts a connection between the presence of male athletes on a team with injury to females. It is replete with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>stereotypical assumptions and generalities. Cf. <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Darlington Little League, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 344, 349-350 (1st Cir. 1975) (rejecting medical testimony intermixing cultural with physical observation). But if we were to indulge an assumption of such a relationship in the rougher sports, what of golf, gymnastics, riflery, skiing, track, cross-country running, swimming, tennis? Risks are not constant. Under ERA, a sex-based exclusion must show a closer \"fit\u201d than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">(c) <em>Protection of girls\u2019 participation in sports. </em>Although the preamble seems otherwise directed, the prohibition of rule 17(d)(1) is now sought to be justified as a measure of \"affirmative action\u201d needed, so it is alleged, to prevent the swamping of girls\u2019 teams by boys of skill and prowess superior to those of girls. But the rule is out of proportion to any looming danger. It represents a sweeping use of a disfavored classification when less offensive and better calculated alternatives appear to exist and have not been attempted.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">We neither know, nor are apprised by the record, that the apprehended peril is such as to require so sweeping a prohibition.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> But even if the claimed fear of inundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>because of male advantages in many sports were more solidly based in fact, it would not justify the categorical exclusion of males from any sport, or divisions or \"events\u201d of a sport, in which, over-all, they enjoy no or only a slight advantage over females. Gymnastics and swimming (as well as riflery) may be examples.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">No less important is the fact that the rule overlooks approaches, short of broad prohibition, that could solve any anticipated problem of boys in substantial numbers displacing girls from competition to the serious detriment of the development of athletics for girls. Use of standards focusing on height, weight, or skill rather than solely on gender represents one such approach: males would thus be admitted who could not dominate the mixed teams or overwhelm the opposition.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Admission could perhaps be regulated by handicapping in a sport like golf. On another level also, lesser measures than complete exclusion suggest themselves. Where boys\u2019 teams were not feasible, admission of boys to girls\u2019 teams could be limited, not to exceed reasonable numbers. In particular situations, rotating systems might be adopted by which qualified boys were admitted but only a certain number could play in a given game.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We emphasize that resort to a separate team for boys acts as a backstop for many if not all alternatives which result in introducing boys into girls\u2019 teams. That is to say, if enough boys are interested in a sport to try out for, and threaten to oust girl players from, a particular team, the school authorities are on notice that a boys\u2019 team may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>in order. Should the number of boys be not quite enough for a separate squad, the problem would sometimes be amenable to solution by forming a consolidated boys\u2019 team representing neighboring schools (see n.17). As noted earlier, the legality of segregation in separate but equal teams is not challenged here.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We do not overlook the difficulties in maintaining fair competition when mixed teams enter the lists, but it would be premature to assume that the difficulties are insurmountable. That assumption might itself stem from stereotypes which ERA rejects. Some of the mixed teams will have been so constituted in the first place that they will compete with no advantage. Handicapping as well as selective pairing of teams may be feasible for other cases. During a period of experimentation and change, some unevenness in the competition may result, but that calls merely for a modicum of toleration and some imaginative willingness to try new combinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Our mention of alternative patterns is intended merely to throw light on the question of the constitutional validity of the Draconian choice made by the defendants.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We acknowledge very freely that the defendants are far abler than ourselves to decide what means they need to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to promote athletics, and girls\u2019 athletics in particular, once the constitutional limits have been set down. As Justice Blackmun said in Bakke: \"The administration and management of educational institutions are beyond the competence of judges and are within the special competence of educators, provided always that the educators perform within legal and constitutional bounds.\u201d 438 U.S. at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">4. <em>Summing Up. </em>The State Board of Education, through the Attorney General, has rightly questioned a rule of the MIAA which would bar boys from playing on girls\u2019 interscholastic teams \u2014 an absolute rule applying by its terms even when no comparable boys\u2019 team exists. Any rule which classifies by sex alone is subject to close examination under the concept of equal protection of the laws, as that has been strengthened by the popularly adopted ERA and the statute on educational opportunity. Upon such examination, no current situation confronting MIAA has been pointed to that would warrant so drastic a rule of exclusion. An alleged \"safety\u201d justification for the prohibition must fail. A further justification alleged was that, without a total ban on all participation by boys, girls\u2019 sports would be overrun by boys who as a class are physically better equipped for athletic competition. Undoubtedly there is a problem here which is entitled to sympathetic consideration and to the extent necessary may even call for \"affirmative action.\u201d On analysis, however, it appeared that the problem was marginal; where it arises, it can be met by measures less offensive and less sweeping than a complete sex barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It can be expected that the present decision will make little practical difference in the traditional conduct of interscholastic athletic competition, for that will proceed in the great majority of instances on a basis of \"separate but equal\u201d teams whose validity is assumed here. We do not believe our decision will interfere with the development of competitive athletics for girls. On the contrary, to immunize girls\u2019 teams totally from any possible con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tact with boys might well perpetuate a psychology of \"romantic paternalism\u201d inconsistent with such development and hurtful to it in the long run.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The present decision is addressed to the facts as they now appear. We acknowledge that future changes in the situation, not now perceptible, may call hereafter for a different solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The case will be remitted to the single justice for the entry of judgment declaring rule 17(d)(1) to be invalid and appropriately enjoining its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\"> Section 1G, inserted by St. 1965, c. 572, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part that the Board of Education \"shall see to it that all school committees comply with all laws relating to the operation of the public schools and in the event of noncompliance the commissioner of education shall refer all such cases to the attorney general of the Commonwealth for appropriate action to obtain compliance.\u201d See <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>370 Mass. 37, 60 n.27, 62 (1976).
