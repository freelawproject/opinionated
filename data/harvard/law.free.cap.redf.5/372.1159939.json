Dawson testified that he was one of the witnesses to the will; that he heard the will read at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>time it was executed, but could not remember all of it,\u2014 it was so long ago ; that he remembered that the Canton street property was left to the testator\u2019s wife and the Grand street property to his son absolutely,\u2014he to have possession of it when he came of age, his mother to have the benefit of it until he came of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Thomas J. Dawson, the other subscribing witness, heard the will read and slightly remembered the contents of it. His recollection was that the property in Canton street was left to Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, and the property in Grand avenue to his son Robert.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">George Miller did not read the whole of the will, only read some portions of it:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Q. \u201cFrom your recollection of reading that will, can you state what it said ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">A. \u201cI can\u2019t state. I think that Mrs. Brown pointed out to me, in the presence of her daughter, the portion I read, where it said the property should be left to the son and the daughter should get nothing; then we\" had a general conversation about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Edward F. O\u2019Reilly, the lawyer who drew the will, testified that the testator had two houses in Canton street which were embodied in the will, which he gave to his wife, and there was a house in the Seventh ward,\u2014he thought in Grand avenue,\u2014that was given to his son, and he thought testator mentioned at the same time that he had a daughter ; that he thought that the testator said that he gave his daughter something previous to that, and that would compensate her for not having anything in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Q. \u201c Were there any further provisions in the will than you have mentioned ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>A. \u201c Not to my recollection, except that all his lawful debts should be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is impossible to find that the provisions of the will have been <em>clearly </em>and <em>distinctly </em>proved by two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It is not necessary that the witnesses should remember the exact language used by the testator ; but they must be able to testify at least to the substance of the whole will, so that it can be incorporated in the decree, should \u25a0the will be admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In the principal case, what were the terms of the devise of the Canton street property to the wife? Was it for life, or until she should marry again, or absolutely ? Was she to have the possession of the property in Grand street during the minority of the son ? To whom was the personal property bequeathed ? The witnesses do not agree on these points. The son of the testator, who had the possession of the will for several years after Ms father\u2019s death, who claims to be the person most interested in having it admitted to probate, and who seems to have read it more recently than the other witnesses, ought to be the person most familiar with its provisions. It is likely, however, that he was not to come into possession of the property devised to him, until he had reached the age of twenty-one, as testified to by Thomas W. Dawson, who is corroborated on this point by what the testator told Miller, in speaking to him of the contents of his will, that he would leave his property to his son, and that his daughter should not get anything, <em>that is, after Ms son came of age.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">According to the evidence, the substance of the will, then, probably was that the Canton street property was devised to the widow for life if she did not marry again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and, upon her death or marriage, it was to go to the son ; that the Grand street property was devised to the son, to take \u00a1possession of it when he became twenty-oue years of age, and his mother to have the benefit and possession of it until then; that the personal property was bequeathed to the son. But no <em>two </em>witnesses have proved all these provisions. Probate must therefore be refused (Sheridan <em>v. </em>Houghton, 6 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>234).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
