Prac. </em>[2 ed.], 769). The power exists, independently of any express provision of law, or rule of court, but it is recognized by the general rules, which are applicable to all courts of record (Code, \u00a7 17; rule 50). The amount allowed is to be a reasonable compensation for the services rendered. Sometimes the taxable costs are given, when they are deemed sufficient; very often a larger amount. It has never been understood that the provisions of the Code, which recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the right of guardians <em>ad litem </em>to be allowed costs, had the effect of limiting their compensation to the taxable costs. No such construction has ever been given to section 474, which speaks of the costs and expenses allowed to the guardian by the court, and it cannot justly.be claimed for section 2558, subd. 3, which excepts an infant\u2019s guardian from the effect of the prohibition to the court to award costs to an unsuccessful contestant of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
