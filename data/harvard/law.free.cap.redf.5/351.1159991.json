LIVINGSTON,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ani\">January, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<parties data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b365-8\">Schumaker <em>v. </em>Quaritius. <em>In the matter of the judicial settlement of the account of </em>Christian Quaritius, <em>executor, etc., of </em>Henry Schumaker, <em>deceased.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b365-10\">Where the indorser of a promissory note appoints the holder his executor, and dies before its maturity, his estate is discharged from liability by the failure of the executor duly to present the note to the maker for payment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-11\">Application by executor for the judicial settlement of his account. John and Henry Schumaker, infant sons of testator, appeared by guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-12\">On the settlement, the executor sought to prove his claim against the estate on certain promissory notes held and owned by him, which were made by the testator\u2019s son-in-law, and indorsed by the testator. The testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>made his will appointing the holder of the notes his executor, and died before either of them became due. The executor neglected- to present the notes for payment, to the maker, when they respectively became due.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-4\">D. B. Ames, <em>for executor.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\">F. L. Backus, <em>special guardian for infants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-6\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"AvB\">As against the maker of a note, it is not necessary <em>to </em>present the note for payment when it becomes due, in order <em>to </em>hold him on it; it is his business to be ready to pay it at any time afterwards ; but it is different with regard to the indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In general terms, the contract of the indorser is that he will pay the note, <em>provided </em>it is not paid by the maker when duly presented for payment at maturity, and due and reasonable notice of such non-payment shall have been given to the indorser <em>(Story on Notes, </em>\u00a7 135). Due presentment of the note to the maker for payment at maturity is, therefore, a condition <em>precedent </em>to the liability of the indorser (Cayuga Co. Bank <em>v. </em>Warden, 1 <em>N. Y., </em>413, 417); and the insolvency of the maker will not dispense with its performance <em>(Story on Notes, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 203, 252; Jackson <em>v. </em>Richards, 2 <em>Caines, </em>343; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Griswold, 7 <em>Wend., </em>165, 169).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">To this general rule there are exceptions, which it is not necessary to notice here, as they have no application to this case. The notes in question, not having been presented for payment to the maker when they respectively matured, the executor has no claim on them against the estate of his testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
