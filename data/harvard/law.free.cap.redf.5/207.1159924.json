Pro., \u00a7 2750, of creditors\u2019 proceedings to dispose of a decedent\u2019s real property for the payment of debts, etc., applies to a case where letters had been issued upon his estate, more than three years before September 1, 1880, and the personal representatives had not accounted to the Surrogate, under the Revised Statutes, before that date; since, in such a case, no right had accrued, to be saved by <em>L. </em>1880, cli. 245, \u00a7 3, or by section 3852 of the Code.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b221-9\">Chapter 4 of that Code has no application to proceedings of this nature.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">This was a petition by the U. S. Life Ins. Company, a creditor of the decedent, for the disposition of decedent\u2019s real property, for the payment of- debts, opposed by Mary A. Jordan, the administratrix and an heir-at-law, and others ; the only question raised being whether the application was barred by section 2750 of the Code, letters testamentary having been issued in 1876, and the representative not having accounted before September 1, 1880.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-11\">Edgar S.

And I am inclined to hold, with him, that \u201cunless some limit be imposed upon the exercise of this power, the hidden lien of the creditor will continue to run until he thinks fit to enforce it, while, in the meantime, those to whom the estate has descended are uncertain of their rights, and are restrained in the enjoyment of their property,\u201d and \u201cthat public policy requires that a power of such formidable import should be strictly construed.\u201d This view is confirmed by the time limited by section 2750, above cited. ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">By <em>Laws </em>1880, ch. 245, \u00a7 3, subd. 2, it is provided that the repeal effected thereby does not affect any right, defense or limitation lawfully accrued or established before that act took effect; and that every such right remained as valid and effectual as if said act had not been passed, but that said subdivision did not apply to a case provided for in chapter 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. To the same effect is section 3352 of the new Code. Hence, if the petitioner\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to petition in this matter had \u201clawfully accrued,\u201d when title 5 of chapter 18 took effect, to wit: September 1, 1880, the limitation contained in section 2750 does not apply ; for it is clear to my mind that chapter 4 does not apply to such proceedings, either in terms or intent. I am con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>firmed in this opinion by the fact that the act of 1837, as amended, was not repealed by <em>Laws </em>1877, ch. 417, but was repealed by the act of 1880, above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">But an examination of <em>Laws </em>1837, ch. 460, \u00a7 72, as amended by <em>Laws </em>1843, ch. 211, being \u00a7 60 of 3 <em>R. S. </em>(6 ed.), 117, shows that the right of a creditor <em>to </em>apply for such sale was dependent upon the fact that the executor or administrator, as such, had accounted to the Surrogate pursuant to chapter 6, part 2, title 3 of the Revised Statutes, and that it appeared that there were not sufficient assets to pay the debts of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It affirmatively appears, by the petition in this matter, that no such accounting was had before September 1, 1880, nor has there been such since; and it seems to me clear that no \u201cright had lawfully accrued\u201d to the petitioner, to be saved by the act of 1880 or section 3352 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The provisions of section 2750 seem to me to be most salutary, and to relieve against a lax practice heretofore prevailing, tending to render uncertain titles of heirs-at-law, and I should be very unwilling, by enforcing any technicality, to weaken the force of that section, as to the limitation of time relating to such proceedings. I' am of the opinion that the petition in this matter does not confer jurisdiction upon this court, to take proceedings for the disposition of the decedent\u2019s real property for the payment of debts, and that the proceeding should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
