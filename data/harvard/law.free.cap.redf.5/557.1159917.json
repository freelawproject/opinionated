The St. John's Guild was organized under the act for the incorporation of benevolent, etc., societies, <em>Zrmos </em>1848, ch. 319, which invalidates a gift to any corporation formed thereunder, contained in a will executed less than two months before the testator\u2019s death. The ninth clause described an institution not existing; but there was located, at the place mentioned, a corporation organized under the act of 1848, named \u201c The Foundling Asylum of the Sisters of Charity in the City of Mew York.\u201d The validity of these bequests having been put in issue, <em>Held,</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b571-13\">1.

That clause (9), though not void for uncertainty as to the legatee, was void under the act of 1848, it being not competent for the testator to evade the policy of that statute, by the simple device of making the gift to an individual, and the bequest being, in legal effect, one to the \u25a0last mentioned foundling asylum; and that clause (10) was void, for a like reason.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">, Upott proceedings for the probate of decedent\u2019s will, Marie Emelie Oelestine Effray, an infant daughter of decedent, by her special guardian, expressly put in issue the validity of certain bequests, pursuant to Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2624. The facts appear sufficiently in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-6\">W. B.

It contains certain dispositions of personal property, the validity and effect of which have been put in issue. By section 2624 of the Code, it is made my duty to pass upon this issue, before admitting the will to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The question arises under <em>Laws </em>1848, ch. 319, \u00a7 6, which provides that \u201cno devise or bequest to any corporation formed under the act shall be valid in any wise, which shall not be made and executed at least two months before the death of the testator.\u201d Mr. Effray died on the day following the .execution of the will. It is not disputed, therefore, that any bequests which are given to corporations, formed under the act of 1848, are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">1. The testator, by the seventh clause of his will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>bequeaths \u201cunto St. John\u2019s Guild, a corporation created by and existing under the laws of the State of New York, the sum of $5,000.\u201d It appears by the evidence that St. John\u2019s Guild is a corporation established under the act of 1848. The bequest to that institution is indisputably void.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">2. By the ninth clause of his will, the testator bequeaths \u2018\u2018 unto the person acting as the treasurer for the time being, meaning the treasurer, if there be one, of the Foundling Asylum for Babies, Lexington avenue and Sixty-eighth street, New York city, to be applied to the uses of said asylum, the sum of $3,000.\u201d At the corner of Lexington avenue and Sixty-eighth street, there is no such institution as the Foundling Asylum for Babies; but evidence has been produced before me that, at the place indicated, there are buildings occupied by a corporation established under the law of 1848, and called the Foundling Asylum of the Sisters of Charity in the City of New York. That institution is the only one at or near the premises specified, and I find it to be the one which the testator designed to make the object of his bounty (Lefevre <em>v. </em>Lefevre, 59 <em>N. Y., </em>434; New York Institution for the Blind <em>v. </em>How\u2019s Executors, 10 N. <em>Y., </em>84; Hornbeck\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>American Bible Society, 2 Sandf. Ch., 133).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">It is urged, on behalf of the infant next of kin, that the foregoing bequest, like that to St. John\u2019s Guild, is void. It is claimed, on the other hand, by the foundling asylum, that the bequest is not to the corporation, but to the individual, who, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, might be the treasurer of the institution, if it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>then have a treasurer, and, if not, to the individual who should be acting as such treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In New York Institution for the Blind <em>v. </em>How\u2019s Executors (10 <em>N. Y., </em>84), and in Chamberlain <em>v. </em>Cham<em>b</em>erlain (43 <em>N. Y., </em>437), a bequest to trustees of certain corporations was held to be in legal effect a gift to the corporations themselves. So, too, in Hornbeck\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>American Bible Society (2 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>133), a legacy to certain treasurers of various societies was held to be a gift to those societies. And in Manice v. Manice (43 <em>N. Y., </em>314), a bequest of a certain sum \u201cto the treasurer for the time being of Yale College, which sum I request the trustees of said college to invest,\u201d etc., was regarded as a bequest to the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">It seems to me that the present case is clearly within the:scope of the foregoing decisions. The claim that the gift is to the individual or person who may be treasurer at.the testator\u2019s death, and that the reference to such person as treasurer was only by way of description, might possibly have some force, but for the words \u201c to be applied to the uses of said asylum.\u201d In view of that clause, it cannot be claimed, and indeed is not sought to be claimed, that the treasurer could treat the bequest as a personal legacy to himself. But it is argued that the phrase, \u201c to be applied to the uses of said asylum,\u201d may be construed as if it read \u201capplied to such uses as the asylum applies its moneysthat is, that the will makes the person, who is treasurer, a trustee for a class of beneficiaries which he may select, and which must be similar to the class for whose care and maintenance the Foundling Asylum was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">However commendable may have been the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the testator, I cannot think that, by.a device so simple, the manifest policy of the statute has been successfully evaded, and the intent of its provisions frustrated. It seems clear to me that this bequest must be declared invalid, as in legal effect a bequest to the Foundling Asylum. For the same reason, the tenth clause of the will, whereby the testator gives a similar legacy to the treasurer of the House of the Gfood Shepherd, must be adjudged void.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The eighth clause would also be invalid, if the \u201cSociety Francaise des dames de l\u2019Eglise de St. Vincent de Paul a New York,\u201d was a corporation established under the act of 1848 ; but it is shown to be an unincorporated society, and no grounds have been urged against the validity of this bequest. I hold that is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
