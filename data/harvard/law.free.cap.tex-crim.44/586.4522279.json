In the box were two jugs of whisky, one of which, a two-gallon jug, had a card upon it addressed to Dan Eoberts, in care of Dan Berry, and marked $6. That afterwards, on the same evening the box was received, the hack driver who brought the whisky to witness handed witness a note from the defendant stating that defendant had sent him (witness) a box marked dog poison and asked witness to deliver the goods and collect for same; that it looked like an imposition on witness, but that the boys had told him (defendant) that it would be all right; that witness delivered the two-gallon jug of whisky to Dan Eoberts, but did not remember whether the delivery was made before he received the letter of instructions from the defendant or not. That four or five days after he (witness) delivered the whisky to Dan Eoberts, witness received from Dan Eoberts $9.35. That witness gave the 35 cents to the mail driver for bringing the whisky down from Guthrie and sent $9 to defendant as an accommodation to Dan Eoberts. Witness never solicited orders for defendant and did not solicit this order sent to Dan Eoberts, and witness was not the agent of the defendant and did not act as defendant\u2019s agent. That the box witness received from defendant was not marked O. 0. D., and neither of the jugs'were marked C. 0. D. Witness states that he handled the express at the drugstore that comes on the mail hack; that he did not consider the whisky a C. 0. D. shipment, but that, taken in connection with the letter of instructions from defendant to witness to deliver the whisky and collect the same, he did consider the whisky a C. 0. D. shipment; that witness received the box labeled dog poison containing the two jugs of whisky in Benjamin, Texas, which is in precinct No. 1 of Knox County, Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-7\">The defendant in his own behalf testified that about the 15th of April last, I gave a jug of whisky to the hackman at Guthrie to be delivered to Dan Eoberts at Benjamin. The jug had a card attached to it and on the card was the following: \u201cTo Dan Eoberts in care of Dan Berry.\u201d This jug was a two-gallon jug of whisky closed up in the box and marked on the outside of the box \u201cDog Poison.\u201d I marked the box in this way so no one would molest it. I delivered the box to the mail carrier from Guthrie to Benjamin; I did not pay the mail carrier to bring the.box to Benjamin; when I put the whisky in the box at Guthrie I charged the whole account of $9 to Dan Eoberts, as he was the person who had ordered same from me. The box was not sent by express and was not shipped C. 0. D. Dan Berry was not my agent, and at no time did I ever request him to act as my agent in^the delivery of any whisky to Dan Eoberts or anyone, and I did not have Dan Berry or anyone else soliciting any orders or order for whisky in. Benjamin about the 15th of April or at any other time. The next day after I sent the whisky to Benjamin I wrote the witness Dan Berry a note in which I stated to him to collect the money for me for the whisky sent Eoberts. I do not know whether I said anything about the delivery of the goods or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>not at the time I wrote the note. I suppose the whisky was delivered \u2022to- Dan Roberts, as it had had plenty of time to have been delivered. I can not swear that it had been delivered. I am not sure I wrote and sent the note the day after I sent the box containing the whisky, but think I did. The mail driver brought me the $9 and paid same to me at Guthrie, Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">Dan Berry, a witness for the State, recalled, testified that on the same evening that he received the box containing the whisky, the mail carrier came back to the drugstore and gave him the note about the whisky.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-6\"><em>Glasgow &amp; Kenan, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-7\"><em>Howard Martin, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEC\">The question in the case is, where was the sale made? The State says it was made at Benjamin, for the reason that Berry was the agent of appellant in the transaction. The facts show him to be such, although Berry himself may say he was not the agent of appellant. Appellant delivered the whisky in Benjamin C. O. D., that is collect on delivery, although the package was not \u2022 so marked or labeled. Appellant and Berry seem to think that a shipment is not C. O. D. unless the package shipped is marked or labeled C. O. D. See Acts 27th Leg., 1901, p. 262; Northcutt v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 584.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b606-8\">HENDERSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa6D\">Appellant was convicted of violating the local option law, and his punishment assessed at a fine of $25 and twenty days confinement in the county jail; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Appellant excepted to the action of the court instructing the jury that local option was in force in said precinct No: 1 of Knox County. He claims that this matter was in issue on the trial of the case, and the court could not assume the existence of local option and so instruct the jury. We find in the record an order passed by the. commissioners court ordering said election. We also find the order counting the vote and declaring the result of said election, and also the order of publication, putting local option in force. All these orders appear to be regular in form. Appellant by bill of exceptions, however, says he objected because the minutes of the commissioners court, in which said orders appeared, had never been signed by the judge or the commissioners, and had not been attested by the clerk, and that said objection put said matter in issue, and that the judge was not authorized to charge, as he did, that local option was in force in said precinct. If it be conceded that the objection stated in the bill of exceptions is equivalent to a certificate of the judge that the ground existed, to wit, that the minutes were not signed, then this was not necessary to give validity to said orders. Being found in the minutes of the commissioners court, it was not necessary that the county judge and commissioners should sign said orders. Lillard v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 53 S. W. Rep., 125. We do not believe that the validity of the local option election or orders of the court were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>put in issue, and the court was authorized to instruct the jury as it did. Chapman v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 167; Williams v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 238; Benson v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 44 S. W. Rep., 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">On the trial of the ease, while Dan Berry was on the stand, and after he had testified to having received the whisky and turned it over to Dan Roberts, and having received the money from Dan Roberts, paying the freight, and paying the balance to appellant, and also having testified to a letter received from appellant, and exhibiting it in evidence, he was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel the following question, \u201cDo you handle the express at the drugstore that comes on the mail hack?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cI do.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cDid you consider the whisky a C. O. D. shipment?\u201d Here counsel for the State objected, and the witness was permitted to answer, stating, \u201cI did not,\u201d whereupon counsel for the State asked the following question, \u201cTaking the letter of instruction to deliver the whisky and collect for the same, in connection with the shipment, did you not consider the whisky a C. 0. D. shipment?\u201d to which witness answered, \u201cI did.\u201d This last question and answer was objected to on the part of appellant because it elicited an opinion of the witness. It would seem that this last answer was an opinion which both the State and appellant were seeking to obtain -of this witness as to how he considered said package. He had previously answered that having received the whisky marked as it was, as an express agent, he did not consider it a C. 0. D. shipment. He was then asked that receiving the package, in connection with the letter which was sent him, how he considered it. And this was objected to as stated, because it elicited the opinion of the witness. We think the letter of instructions which accompanied the package shows very clearly that it required the witness to whom the package was consigned to collect the money in connection with the delivery of said package, and, whether or not it be considered as an opinion of the witness, it is a very clear interpretation of said letter which had been introduced in evidence, and the testimony given by the witness on this point was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Appellant contends that the sale was not in precinct Ho. 1 of Knox County, but was consummated at Guthrie, in King County; and he complains in this connection that the court gave the following charge: \u201cIf you find from the evidence that defendant B. F. Davidson sent the whisky by the mail carrier, addressed to Dan Roberts, in care of Dan Berry, and at the same time sent Dan Berry a letter or note requesting the said Berry to deliver the whisky and collect the money for the same, and then, in pursuance of the request to deliver the goods, said Berry did deliver the goods and did collect the money; or if you should find from the evidence that defendant shipped the whisky into precinct number one to Dan Roberts, the witness, in care of Dan Berry, to be delivered C. 0. D. by said Berry, or collect on delivery; and if you so find from the evidence\u2014then the sale would be a sale at the place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>delivery, and you will convict defendant,\u201d etc. And he insists that the court, in lieu of said charge, or at least as expressing his theory, should have given the following requested charge, to wit: \u201cThe jury are charged that, before you will be warranted in convicting the defendant, you must find from the evidence in this case that defendant sent the whisky to Dan Berry to be delivered to the witness Dan Roberts, C. O. D., cash on delivery, and if you do not so find you will acquit defendant.\u201d We think that the charge as given differed but little in effect from the requested charge; that is, the charge given instructed the jury to convict if they found that the whisky was sent to precinct No. 1 C. O. D., whereas the requested charge instructed the jury to acquit unless they did find that the whisky was sent into precinct No. 1 as a C. 0. D. package. However, the charge as given was a little fuller, in that it referred to the letter of instructions accompanying said package. We do not believe that it was necessary to give the requested instruction, because the jury in the charge given was instructed as to the only grounds upon which they were authorized to convict, and if they did not so find an acquittal followed as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We have examined the record carefully as to the question of sale, in connection with the locus of its consummation. While the witness Berry disclaims any agency from appellant, yet the letter of instructions which accompanied the whisky and was delivered to him, and under which he acted, clearly constituted him the agent of appellant in delivering the whisky and receiving pay therefor. The acts of Berry were performed at Benjamin, in precinct No. 1 of Knox County. He was evidently not authorized to deliver the whisky without receiving pay therefor, as the letter of instructions directed to him clearly indicates; that he acted in that matter for appellant, who lived at Guthrie, King County, and who sent the whisky to Dan Berry to be delivered to Dan Roberts, when he paid for the same; that is, as we understand the letter of instructions to Berry, appellant was not willing to intrust the matter to Roberts, the purchaser of the whisky, nor was he empowered to deliver the same to him, unless the money therefor was paid to Berry, who was authorized to receive and remit it to appellant, the consignor of the whisky. This, as we understand it, was a sale consummated at Benjamin. It was not like the case of Bruce v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 53, which depended on its own peculiar circumstances. Nor is it necessary to discuss whether a C. O. D. package of whisky .is a sale at the point of 'destination or to determine how far the Legislature is authorized to go in defining a sale, as in the Act of the Twenty-seventh Legislature, page 262, chap. 96, amended article 402a. We are inclined to the opinion, however, that the Legislature can not change the rule of law with reference to what it takes to constitute a sale or to fix the locus of such sales. Under the facts here as shown above, this sale was not consummated until the money should be paid to appellant\u2019s agent, and this was done, as above stated, at Benjamin, when the title to the whisky was transferred. This, as we understand it under the authorities, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>stituted the transaction a sale at the above named place. See Northcutt v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 584; Bogel v. State 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 389. In the last case we would remark that the question did not seem to turn upon the question as to whether a C. O. D. package is a completed sale at the point of shipment or at the point of delivery, but rather involved the question as to an actual sale by an agent in the local option precinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We have carefully examined the record, and, finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
