There are several interesting questions presented for revision, which we deem unnecessary to discuss, under the view taken of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">Without going into details, the State\u2019s case is that appellant inducedBoach to turn over to him $600, with which to purchase a saloon for Boach and himself. Hnder the testimony of Boach, after the money was turned over to. appellant he failed to purchase the saloon; that appellant and Boach were to be partners, and after the $600 was paid back they were thenceforward to divide the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that he purchased an interest in what he terms the James saloon, for himself and Boach; and introduced the admissions of Boach to the effect that he was satisfied with the purchase and intended to .wind up his business affairs and work in said saloon himself; that appellant did place his brother in the saloon, who worked there for a while.</p>\n<p id=\"A8v\">Omitting defensive theories, and placing it entirely upon the State\u2019s case, as made by Boach\u2019s testimony, it does not show this to be a case of embezzlement. The identical question was decided by this court in Dancy\u2019s case, 53 S. W. Rep., 886; see also Reed\u2019s case, 16 Texas Crim. App., 586. These cases are so nearly like this that we deem it unnecessary to enter into a discussion of the question involved, but simply refer to them. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
