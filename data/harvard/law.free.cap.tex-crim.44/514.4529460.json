But if it be conceded that under article <em>723, </em>Code of Criminal Procedure, it is too late to raise the question in this court, then our contention is that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. This issue was presented in the lower court and in this court, and aside from this we take it that the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict may be raised at any time, and also that any averment in the indictment essential to a conviction must be proved, as alleged variance sometimes is so closely akin to a want of affirmative proof that the issue may- be raised either way by suggesting variance or that the verdict is contrary to the law or evidence. Our contention is that the verdict on the issue of ownership and possession is both contrary to the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-18\">It affirmatively appears from the record that Savie Richardson, Sr., was alive at the time of the trial and residing near Cleburne, the county seat; that the horse in question was taken from his premises and his barn; that Savie Richardson, Jr., was a minor under-the age of 19 years. The minor son is himself presumed by law to be under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>actual control of his father; of course, his property is. If the son had instituted suit for the property (the horse), it must have been abated when the record disclosed his minority. The law would not have permitted him to prosecute the suit in the absence of a guardian or next friend on the theory, of course, that a sound public policy demanded and required an adult to supervise and look after the property rights of the infant and enforce his rights by law. The infant can not contract except for necessaries. If he had traded the horse the father could revoke and rescind the trade. The father can control and direct the services of the minor; he can enforce compensation in his own name for the minor\u2019s services. Therefore he can use his property acquired during minority for his services. This horse was purchased by the boys, taken to the father\u2019s premises and left there, from this record, presumably under his control, care, management and direction, certainly in his possession. It was taken from his possession, not from the possession of the minor. This court has recently held that where the owner is alive his want of consent must affirmatively appear in the record, and circumstances, however strong they may be, will not be sufficient to show this material allegation. The father was within a mile and a half of the courthouse; he is not produced. Appellant, believed the horse belonged to Richardson, Sr. This is his first statement to Thompson. The law presumes that Richardson, Sr., was the owner alleged in the indictment. In Quill v. Bradley (a Massachusetts case), the following language is used: \u201cIt seems that where father and son of the same name' reside in the same town the omission of junior in a writ against the son is good cause of abatement.\u201d We have not the authority at hand, but the soundness of the rule is evident from a statement of it. The father is entitled to the name without any description because he acquired it first; he has been known by it longest in the community where both lived. It is invariably the youngest man who is designated by some descriptive term. This seems to be the rule and the reason for the rule, without reference to minority. Applying the rules heretofore referred to, to minority and infancy, it must be kept in mind that the varying ages of infants is not important. The law prescribes one rule by which the property rights of infants in fact as well as in name are to be affected and protected. To illustrate: The writer is the possessor of a boy about one year old who bears his name. The earthly possessions of the aforesaid boy consist of one dog. It would be ridiculous and absurd in event of the dog\u2019s theft to allege ownership in the child, or in the absence of some descriptive term to say that, the law would not presume ownership and possession in the father, and that the pleader did not so intend when putting the accused on notice of the offense with which he was charged. To further illustrate, suppose in the case at bar the State had produced as a witness Richardson, Sr., who had testified that the property, while acquired by his minor son, was in fact in his possession and control on his premises and in his barn, all of which appears from the undisputed evidence. It could not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>have been logically or consistently urged that ownership and possession was not properly laid and want of consent affirmatively shown. Possession of joint owners may be in both at the same time, but not in father and minor son, or master and servant. So, to summarize, we insist that the law presumes Bichardson, Sr., to have been owner named in the indictmenat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">The facts show he had possession and fail to show his want of consent. He lived within a mile and a half of the courthouse, wherefore the verdict is contrary both to the law and the evidence. On the other branch of this issue we call attention to White\u2019s Penal Code, section 1505, page 605, where the rule is stated and the authorities collated on the subject of fraudulent intent in this wise: \u201cThe fraudulent intent of the taking is the essential ingredient, the very gist of the crime of theft, and this intent must exist at the very time of the taking, for no subsequent felonious taking will render the previous taking felonious. -A fraudulent taking of the property of another embraces this idea, that the taker knew it was not his own, and also that it was done to deprive the owner of it. This is usually evidenced by its being done in such a manner and under such circumstances as to avoid detection or responsibility to the true owner. The manner and circumstances under which the property was taken, held, used and spoken of by the defendant, and whether or not there was upon his part any attempt at concealment, are circumstances to be considered and weighed in determining with what intent the property was taken by the defendant.\u201d Measured by these humane rules, the testimony in this case is too uncertain and doubtful to authorize a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">The appellant made no possible effort at concealment; the purposes for which he took the horse is undisputed. He held, used and spoke of the horse as belonging to another; he made no effort to dispose of the horse by sale or exchange; he was left in the county where appellant had lived for fifteen years and was well known, in a pasture find within twenty miles of the scene of the taking. That there was to be no further effort to use the horse in making his escape is evident from it being turned loose in a pasture. He did not have the horse when arrested, and this is convincing on his having abandoned it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-7\">The testimony of the witness, Bud Young, is reasonable, natural and probably true, and although the appellant may have lied as to whether he or \u201cBlack and Shine\u201d originally took the horse, it occurs to us that this should not deprive him of all the reason and reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the whole testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-8\"><em>Howard Martin, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b535-9\">DAVIDSOH, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6K0\">This conviction was for horse theft, the penalty being three years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The witness George Perry was permitted to testify to facts criminative in their nature, after both sides had closed their testimony; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>objection urged being that it was not in rebuttal. The court explains the bill by stating that when the cause was called for trial State\u2019s counsel informed the court that the old negro, George Perry, was absent in Bosque County, sick, and perhaps unable to attend court. The court informed counsel that, if his presence could be procured before the close of the case, he would be permitted to testify, and as soon as the witness came in he was used as a witness. When necessary to the administration of justice, testimony may be admitted for either side before the conclusion of the argument. The statute authorizing this has been upheld by an unbroken line of decisions. Briefly stated, the evidence disclosed that appellant was a convict upon the county farm, and made his escape. During that night the horse in question was taken from the lot where placed by the owner, carried out through the' field, and was ridden into Bosque County by appellant. Another county convict escaped at the same time\u2014a negro, going under the euphonious name of \u201cBlack and Shine.\u201d Appellant claims that \u201cBlack and Shine\u201d informed him that he had a friend from whom he could borrow a horse, on which they could ride out of the county; that \u201cBlack and Shine\u201d disappeared, and came back with a horse, and they went together some distance, and parted company, appellant riding the horse into Bosque County, to the house of a friend, and the next day turned him into a pasture, with instructions that he be returned to the alleged owner, or the father of the alleged owner. The evidence further discloses that \u201cBlack and Shine\u201d wore a very large shoe; that appellant wore about a No. 6 or 7; and that the track of the man who took the horse from the lot, and led him through the field, was a No. 6 or 7. Appellant also claimed that he simply rode the horse for the purpose of making his escape, with the intent to return or have him returned to the owner; in other words, that he was simply stealing a ride, and not the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Various objections are urged to the charge of the court, especially that portion of it which informs the jury, if they should believe from the evidence that another person borrowed the horse in question from the owner, and placed it in possession of defendant, or if they entertained a reasonable doubt whether defendant\u2019s connection with the horse arose in this manner, they should acquit. This is objected to because it limited the jury to the consideration of appellant\u2019s belief of the fact. This was rather favorable to defendant, because it was not a fact that the horse was borrowed by the negro \u201cBlack and Shine,\u201d and the court would have erred if, he had confined the jury to -a belief on their part that the fact did exist. The court was, therefore, correct in instructing the jury, if defendant received the horse under the belief that it was borrowed by \u201cBlack and Shine,\u201d he would not be guilty of theft. This was appellant\u2019s contention. This was his statement, and the issue was submitted upon the defendant\u2019s statement, as one of his theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The court also instructed the jury to the effect that, \u2018if defendant took the horse, and did so with the intention not to deprive the owner of the value of it, but simply to ride to Bosque County, or there was a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>able doubt of that proposition, they would acquit. This was another contention of appellant, made so by his own testimony; and the court clearly submits it favorably to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">We have carefully examined this record, and do not believe there was any error committed. Every issue presented by the testimony, as we understand the facts, was clearly, pertinently, and even favorably submitted by the charge. While appellant raised the question of the horse having been gotten by \u201cBlack and Shine,\u201d so.that he and \u201cBlack and Shine\u201d might ride away from the officers; and the further theory that he took the horse for the purpose of riding to Bosque County to elude the officers\u2014yet the other facts, do not sustain this.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b537-7\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGo\">At a former day of this term the judgment herein was affirmed. It is now contended the court committed error in failing to apply the law to the issue of ownership, and that this is appargnt of record, and fundamental in its nature, which would require \u00e1 reversal. This might be answered by the decisions construing article 723, Code of Criminal Procedure, to the effect that it is too late to suggest such error for the first time on appeal. It should have been taken advantage of by bill of exceptions or in motion for new trial in the court below. But, independent of these decisions and of this article, we do not believe there is any merit in the question suggested. This matter comes in this way: The indictment alleged the ownership to be in Savie Richardson and John Richardson. The evidence discloses that there were two parties, father and son, by the name of Savie Richardson. The contention is that, where such is the case, the law would presume the ownership to be in the father, and not the son. If this be correct, it is but a presumption which could be overcome by proof. The word \u201cJunior,\u201d or \u201cJr.,\u201d or words of similar import, are ordinarily mere matters of description, and form no part of a person\u2019s legal name, and to omit or add such appellation or cognomen is harmless error, both in civil and criminal proceeding. Geraghty ,v. State, 110 Ind., 103; Ross v. State, 116 Ind., 495; People v. Cook, 14 Barb., 259; Padgett v. Lawrence, 10 Paige, 170; Com. v. Perkins, 1 Pick., 388; Cobb v. Lucas, 15 Pick., 7; Cargill v. Taylor, 10 Mass., 203; State v. Grant, 22 Me., 171; Coit v. Starkweather, 8 Conn., 293; Fleet v. Youngs, 11 Wend., 522; Prentiss v. Blake, 34 Vt., 465; Keith v. Ware, 6 Vt., 680; Blake v. Tucker, 12 Vt., 39; Headley v. Shaw, 39 Ill., 354; State v. Weare, 38 N. H., 314; Commonwealth v. Parmenter, 101 Mass., 211. In Simpson v. Dix, 131 Mass., 179, it was held that, where a conveyance is executed to the grantee of a certain name, and there are two persons, father and son, of that name, no presumption will be indulged that the conveyance is to the father, and evidence is admissible to show who in fact was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tended as the grantee. The evidence in this ease further shows that the father and son lived upon the same place; that the son lived with the father; that the horse was kept in the bam on the place, which is owned by the father. And it was further shown that the horse in question was in fact the property of the two sons, Savie and John Richardson, and that the father had no interest in the animal. Even had objection been urged upon the trial below, it would not have been well taken under the authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The only remaining question urged on rehearing is the supposed insufficiency of the evidence. There were several theories advanced by appellant in reference to his taking the horse to ride away from the officers and escape further serving his time on the county farm in obedience to the judgment of the court punishing him for a misdemeanor. However, there is evidence refuting these theories, and showing a fraudulent taking. Under this state of facts or condition of the record, this court would not be authorized in disturbing the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
