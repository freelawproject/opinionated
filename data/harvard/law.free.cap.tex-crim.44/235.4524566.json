S. King, county attorney of Nacogdoches County, presented the information upon the affidavit of Jim Bowling, whereas said information is signed Geo. S. King, county attorney. In regard to the latter question, we do not believe it to be the subject.of a motion in arrest of judgment. If any advantage could be taken of this matter, it should be presented in limine. It is not a matter of substance, but simply a matter of form. In fact we are of opinion that it was not necessary that the name of the county attorney be set out in the beginning of the information at all; it would have been sufficient to state, \u201cnow comes the county attorney of Nacogdoches County, and presents the information upon the affidavit,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">In regard to the first proposition, the information recites that an election \u201chad been held\u201d in the subdivision mentioned, and that such election \u201chad\u201d resulted in favor of prohibition in said subdivision. We are of opinion that this contention is without merit. The information does charge that appellant \u201cdid,\u201d in said county and subdivision, etc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sell intoxicants after the qualified voters of such subdivision had voted to that effect in said election. Under all the approved forms in charging this offense, this character of information has been held to be sufficient. The testimony fully supports the State\u2019s case, and shows that appellant sold intoxicants withii^ the prohibited territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
