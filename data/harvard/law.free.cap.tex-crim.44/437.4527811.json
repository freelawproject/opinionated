This complaint clearly shows on its face that it was the intention to have affiant make his mark, but failing to do this renders the complaint a nullity and void. See Pierce v. State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 232; Code Crim. Proc., art. 466.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-20\"><em>Rob\u2019t A. </em>John, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b455-21\">DAVIDSON, Pbesidifg Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-ie\">Appellant was convicted of violating the local option law, and his punishment assessed at-a fine of $25 and twenty days confinement in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-22\">Among other things, the motion for new trial attacks the complaint and information (1) because the complaint was not sworn to as required by the statute; and (2) that neither the complaint nor'information were ever filed in the county court. Article 277, Code of Criminal -Procedure, sets out the requisites of a complaint, the fourth subdivision of which is- that \u201cit must be in writing and signed by the affiant, if he is able to write his name; otherwise he must place his mark at the foot of the complaint.\u201d The record shows the complaint was sworn to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>subscribed before the county attorney on the 5th of May, 1902, and on that day filed by W. S. Terrell, justice of the peace of precinct No. 1, Collin County. We find the signature, or what purports to be the signature, to the complaint, in this language: \u201cJohn his Steele.\u201d mark</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">It does not show that affiant made his mark, and we are asked to presume, because the expression \u201chis mark\u201d is found in cofmection with his name, that therefore he was unable to write his name, and that there was an omission in not signing it by his mark. If, as a matter of fact, he did not write his name, this should have been shown. Where a party relies upon matters of fact to quash a complaint, information, or indictment, the verity of the fact, if it exists, must be shown by the attacking party. The presumption of regularity obtains, unless the contrary is shown, in matters of this sort, when attacked in motion for new trial, or in arrest of judgment, or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">As the record is presented to us, the affidavit and information were not filed by the clerk of the county <em>court; </em>that is, his filemark was not placed on either instrument. The point was made in motion to arrest the judgment, as well as in motion for new trial, that this was fatal to conviction. This matter matter comes too late after conviction. It should have been urged in limine. The same rule applies in regard to filing affidavit and information as in case of indictment. The court, therefore, did not err in overruling this contention. Jessel v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">It is also contended that the evidence is not sufficient to support the conviction. The State\u2019s evidence shows that the purchaser of the intoxicant from appellant became very much intoxicated from drinking it\u2014so much so that he was arrested and confined, and subsequently punished. Appellant contends that the liquid he sold was cider manufactured in the town of McKinney out of nonintoxicants, and that no amount of it could produce intoxication. If the State\u2019s testimony is true\u2014and the jury believed it\u2014the liquid sold was intoxicating, for there is no question that the purchaser drank it and became very much intoxicated, and he swears that this is the liquid that produced the intoxication: Under this state of case, this court is not authorized to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">There being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
