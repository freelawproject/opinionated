(2) Because the alleged false oath upon which perjury is assigned is not one required by law; \u00f3r necessary for public justice; or for the prosecution or defense of a private right. (3) Because the indictment does not allege that the alleged false oath was made in the course of a judicial proceeding, nor that the same was a material inquiry at the time it is alleged to have been made. Wherefore defendant prays the court to quash said bill of indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">The motion to quash was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">The opinion sets out the important facts adduced in evidence at the trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Pounders &amp; Burford </em>and <em>Glass, Estes &amp; King, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq1\">To be sufficient, the indictment must aver that the oath was legally administered under the circumstances in which an oath or affirmation is required by law, or was necessary for the prosecution or defense of a private right, or was necessary for the ends of public justice. See Penal Code, art. 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-3\">The indictment must allege that the alleged false statement was material, and the proof must show that it was material. Smith v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-4\">To be assignable as perjury, it is essential under the law of Texas that the matter alleged in the indictment to be false be material. Williams v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 301; Agar v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 605; Brooks v. State, Id., 582.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aon\">We respectfully submit that the matter in this indictment alleged to be false, viz., whether or not Tom Horn stole said money, was not and is not material. The inquiry material in this case was as. to whether or not the money alleged to have been stolen was secreted in Tom Horn\u2019s house, or Virgil Hazlewood\u2019s room in defendant\u2019s house, to the end that it might be brought into court to be restored to the owner. In a complaint for a search warrant the complainant should give the name of the person accused, not necessarily the name of the person he accuses, but the name of the party accused, no matter how or by whom. In this case there was no warrant of arrest applied for, and none was issued; neither Horn nor Hazlewood was arrested. The defendant may have hoped by searching for the money he had lost, he would secure sufficient testimony to have the parties arrested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">If perjury is committed in the course of a judicial proceeding the indictment must allege that fact, and must also allege that the court or tribunal had jurisdiction of the matter under investigation either as oyer and terminer, or as an examining court. This was an affidavit made in the course of a judicial proceeding. 2 Texas Crim. App., 479. The indictment does not allege that the affidavit was made in the course of a judicial proceeding, nor that the court had jurisdiction of the matter under investigation. Langford v.

Without entering into a discussion of the various questions assigned, we are of opinion after a careful examination, that it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">It is urged that the court\u2019s charge is fatally eroneous, in submitting the question of the materiality of the evidence to the jury, as a fact to be determined by them. We believe this exception is well taken. The materiality of testimony upon which perjury is assigned usually is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>question for the court, and not the jury. While it may be true that it might be a mixed question of law and fact in some cases, this is not true as to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">Appellant tendered a special instruction to the court, in which he requested the submission of his theory; that is, if they should find he believed at the time he made the affidavit that the statements were true, he should be acquitted. Under the facts, this charge should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">He further requested the jury be charged that, if defendant believed he had. reasonable grounds upon which to predicate the affidavit that Tom Horn and Virgil Hazlewood took his money, they should acquit. A few facts might be stated, to show that this charge should have been given. Milner testified: That in going out from town in a wagon with defendant and Hazlewood, defendant proposed that Hazlewood and Milner should assist him in concocting a scheme by which they would get a couple of fine mares from Horn; that appellant on the following day should put' $110 in his pocket, and go to the residence of his stepson, Stevens, and display this money, and pretend to be very drunk, then take Horn riding, and thereafter deliver the money to his wife, and bring an accusation against Horn, charging him with theft of the money. Defendant was then to obtain, as a compromise with Horn, the mares; appellant paying Milner $25, and Hazlewood $10, for their aid and assistance in the execution of the scheme. Appellant went to Stevens, and subsequently took Horn riding, and was either very drunk or pretended to be so. That Horn went with appellant to appellant\u2019s residence, and Hazlewood assisted him in carrying appellant into the house, where they placed him on the bed. During the night, appellant waked up about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and discovered his money was gone. He immediately woke his wife and made inquiry of her in regard to it, as well as of Hazlewood, who was sleeping in the house. Hazlewood and Horn were tenants of appellant. Appellant began to inquire about his money; instituted search and investigation early in the morning, after he missed it at night. Horn went to Hazlewood and told him that the elder Milner intended prosecuting him (Hazlewood) for disturbing the peace, and advised him to leave the country. Appellant\u2019s son and appellant instituted investigation as to whether the elder Milner had instituted proceedings against Hazlewood, and discovered that to be false. Appellant\u2019s son went to Hazlewood about the matter, and Hazlewood promised to see the elder Milner and make inquiries himself, started in that direction, was gone a short while, and returned. Becoming suspicious, the younger Luna followed the tracks of Hazlewood, and discovered that he did not go to see Milner about the matter, and so informed him. Hazlewood admitted that he did not, and further stated that Horn had gotten him into all this trouble, and he that was going down in the field and \u201cwhip hell out of him,\u201d and, pointing to Horn\u2019s house, said, \u201cHe has gotten me into all this trouble, and he now has your father\u2019s money in his house.\u201d Hazle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>wood fled the country. These are the circumstances' that induced appellant to make the affidavit charging Horn and Hazlewood with the theft of his money, and asking for a search warrant. Hnder this state of case, the charges requested by appellant should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Appellant offered to prove by Hazlewood that he made an assault upon witness with a knife, and told witness, if he (defendant) knew that he (Hazlewood) had gotten his (defendant\u2019s) money, he would cut witness\u2019 throat; that^ on account of said threats, Hazlewood left the country. This testimony should have been admitted. The State predicated perjury upon the fact that he charged Horn and Hazlewood with the theft of the money. It is always a question, upon a trial for perjury, whether the statements were willfully and falsely made. If defendant had reason to believe Hazlewood and Horn\u2014either or both\u2014 got his money, the falsity of the testimony against him might be met by this as a circumstance in his favor. This testimony, occurring the following morning after he missed his money at night, went to show the condition of defendant\u2019s mind, and his belief in regard to what became of his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Another bill shows that after Horn had testified that he went into the field where Hazlewood was at work, and told Hazlewood that Milner was going to prosecute him for disturbance of the peace, defendant offered to prove that on the evening of the same day Horn again went to Hazlewood, where he (Hazlewood) was at work in the field, and told him that he (Hazlewood) was a single man, and ought to leave the country before said Milner indicted him for disturbing the peace on June 1, 1901, and that said Horn then and there advised Hazlewood to leave the country. The first conversation, which was admitted, was of the same character, but not so extended, as the latter. This testimony, if true, shows that Horn was trying to induce Hazlewood to leave the country, and was a circumstance, connected with the other circumstances, which would tend to prove appellant\u2019s theory that Hazlewood and Horn were acting together, and suggested to appellant the belief that they got his money; and it should have been admitted. These facts were known to appellant when he made the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">For the errors indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
