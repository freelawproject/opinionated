Motion\" was made by the district attorney to dismiss the appeal, because the bond was not in compliance with the statute. The statute requires the party prosecuting such appeal to enter into bond conditioned, among other things, that he will make his personal appearance before the \u201cnext term\u201d of the court to which he prosecutes his appeal. The bond executed was conditioned that he make his personal\u2019appearance \u201cat the present regular term,\u201d instead of \u201cat the next regular term.\u201d The motion to dismiss was sustained. The case of Fentress v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 79, is in point and decisive of this question against appellant. Dn the authority of that case, the judgment herein is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
