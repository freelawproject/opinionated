And the statement of the court to the jury, as shown in his qualification or explanation of the bill, that the evidence was admitted \u201cas a part of the conversation between the witness Tully and the defendant before his arrest, and was npt admitted as a cleclaration of the wife of defendant against him,\u201d did not change the nature, the character or effect, or limit the effect or character of the testimony, or render it admissible for any purpose (defendant not having testified in his case) under articles 774, 775, Code of Criminal Procedure, p. 107, Revised Statutes, 1895.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">Declarations of the wife against her husband, except in certain statutory exceptions, are inadmissible against him for any purpose. Wholly inadmissible - evidence can not be introduced and its effect limited by the court so as to render it admissible. The declarations and statements of the wife, being inadmissible against her husband, can not be introduced as a part of a conversation between him and a witness, and the purpose of such testimony go limited by the court as to change its nature, character or effect and render same admissible for any purpose whatsoever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">The State introduced in evidence, over objections of defendant, the following conversation between defendant and the witness Tully: \u201cWhen you returned to your buggy, where' you left defendant before going into his house, what did you say to him, defendant? Answer: I asked him if his wife was a truthful woman, and defendant replied that she was. What did you then say to him ? Answer: I told him that his wife had just stated to me that he had cleaned the gun that morning about 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d Defendant objected to said testimony, because if .true (and Tully testified it was), then in fact and in effect said evidence was proof of a declaration of defendant\u2019s wife against him, and in no way competent whatever the purpose or reason for its admission, and whether introduced as a conversation between witness and defendant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>not.

I then arrested him.\u2019 To which counsel for defendant objected, for the following reasons, viz: Because the question as to whether or not the gun had been recently cleaned was material, and the State, by the introduction of said evidence (if what the witness told the defendant his wife had said was true) was in fact and in effect proof of declarations of the wife against her husband, and in no way competent evidence of the wife against her husband, and was prejudicial to defendant; it having been shown that defendant\u2019s wife had stated to the witness that defendant had cleaned the gun about 6 o\u2019clock the morning of his arrest, said evidence having been heard and considered by the jury; and the court overruled said objections. The defendant excepted to said rulings, and herewith tenders his bill of exceptions.\u201d Which is approved with the following explanation: \u201cThe witness Tully was testifying\u201d to a conversation with the defendant at his house just before his arrest, and, as a part of such conversation, witness testified that he asked the defendant if his wife was a truthful woman; to which defendant replied that she was; and witness then told him his wife had said the gun had been .cleaned or washed by defendant that morning about 6 o\u2019clock, which evidence was admitted in evidence as a part of the conversation between the witness and defendant, before his arrest, which led up to his arrest, and was not admitted as a declaration of the wife of defendant and against him, and I so declared at the time.\u201d It will be seen from an inspection of the bill of exceptions, that among other reasons appellant urges for the inadmissibility of the testimony is, \u201cit having been shown that defendant\u2019s wife had stated to the witness that defendant had cleaned the gun about 6 o\u2019clock the morning of his arrest.\u201d We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>understand this to be the statement of a fact, certified to by the judge; but merely a reason urged by appellant why the testimony should be rejected. In the testimony as contained in the bill, there is no statement by the witness Tully that the wife of defendant had told him that defendant had cleaned the gun that morning about 6 o\u2019clock; but the witness merely testified that he told defendant that his wife told him that he had cleaned the gun about 6 o\u2019clock. Then, we have for consideration the bare question whether a' false statement by a witness to the effect that the defendant\u2019s wife had told him a certain thing, and the defendant\u2019s answer thereto, comes within the inhibition of the statute which prohibits the wife testifying against her husband. The first clause of article 774, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides: \u201cNeither the husband nor wife shall in any case testify as to communications made by one to the other while married,\u201d etc. Article 775, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides: \u201cThe husband and wife may in all criminal actions be witnesses for each other, but they shall in no case testify against each other except in a criminal prosecution for an offense committed by one against the other.\u201d We think the court erred in admitting this testimony. While it is not a confession or statement of appellant going to incriminate himself that the sheriff uses artifice or deception to secure it is admissible, yet where the sheriff uses what purports to be the d\u00e9claration of the wife in order to obtain from appellant an incriminating statement, such declaration of the sheriff and answer of the appellant are inadmissible. We would not be understood as holding, however, that the State would be precluded from proving the bare fact that when asked by the sheriff whether or not he had cleaned the gun that morning, appellant answered no, since this, coupled with the previous confession to another witness, would tend to incriminate appellant, in that it would show a contradiction and a studied effort to conceal a fact supposed by appellant to be criminative. But it would not be admissible for the sheriff to state that appellant\u2019s wife had said that defendant had cleaned the gun that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Because the court erred in admitting this testimony, as contained in, the bill of exceptions above set out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
