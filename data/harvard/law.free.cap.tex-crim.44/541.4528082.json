Appellant filed a motion to quash the complaint and information, first, because it charged no offense against the laws of the State; second, that it does not appear from the jurat of the officer taking the complaint that same was sworn to by a credible person; and, third, it does not appear affirmatively that the election was held in justice precinct Ho. 8, Ellis County. It is not necessary for the jurat to show that the, witness is a credible person. The law merely provides that the same must be sworn to by a credible person, and, in the absence of any proof on this question, we will presume that the county attorney took the affidavit from a credible person. The affidavit and information are in the usual form, and clearly indicate that the election was held in justice precinct Ho. 8 prior to the filing of the complaint, and that the same was held according to law. The court did not err in overruling the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">Ho error appearing in the record the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
