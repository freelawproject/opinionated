Cryer v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 621; Duffer v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 38 S. W. Rep., 997; Lively v. State, Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">We are not aware that the second objection has ever been passed upon, but the tendency of our decisions in construing this statute is to require a substantial compliance with the terms thereof. In Cummings v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 406, it was held that the recognizance requiring the appearance of an appellant to abide the judgment of the Court of Appeals was defective, on the ground that it failed to properly name the court of last resort having jurisdiction of the appeal. Here, in naming the court, the word \u201cCriminal\u201d is transposed, so as to term the appellate court the \u201cCriminal Court of Appeals,\u201d instead of the \u201cCourt of Criminal Appeals.\u201d There is no such court\" as that used in this recognizance. The Legislature, in prescribing the form of recognizance, used the name of the court having appellate jurisdiction of the case\u2014a name prescribed by law. The form is plain in terms, and its objects was to simplify recognizances, and by the least care in perfecting an appeal the prescribed form can be complied with. We hold that the designation of the court here used was not in compliance with said article of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the recognizance is defective on that account. The motion is accordingly sustained, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
