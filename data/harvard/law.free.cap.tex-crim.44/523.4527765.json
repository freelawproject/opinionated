The dead body should be specified or designated by the name by which it was known, in order to identify the transaction, and point out the particular offense with which accused is charged; and, if this can not be done, then sufficient reason should be alleged in the pleading for the failure to so specify. The information upon this ground is clearly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
