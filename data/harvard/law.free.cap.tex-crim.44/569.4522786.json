They had a misunderstanding about 50 or 60 cents, which deceased offered defendant and defendant refused to accept. Deceased\u2019s conduct was most violent, abusive and threatening. Defendant tried to get him to go home and leave him alone. Finally defendant and his porter closed up the house, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the parties left, deceased following defendant and continuing his abusive conduct, drawing a knife and threatening to cut defendant\u2019s head off. Defendant testified that when he got into the alley he thought deceased had left him, and was going home. But he says: \u201cAfter I had gone back down the alley, and had just gotten in the gate, deceased caught me by the coat collar from behind with his left hand. I turned, and as I turned I saw deceased pulling his right hand out of his right coat pocket. He raised it in a position as if to strike. I jumped and jerked back, pulled my pistol, and it went off three times, and kept going off.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">There was no person other than defendant present at the time of the shooting.

She further testified in this connection: \u201cWe drove up in front of his hop joint, and I stayed in the buggy, while he got out, went into the house, and directly he and Walker returned to the buggy. Walker handed Will the beer, and said: \u2018Will, you must lie low now. The grand jury meets soon.\u2019 My husband remarked, T won\u2019t swear a lie for nobody.\u2019 Defendant then dropped his head, looked down, turned around, and went back info the house.\u201d She further testified: \u201cOn Saturday, before my husband was killed, my husband and myself drove up in front of Walker\u2019s place of business and stopped. My husband got out, went into the house, and shortly after-wards he and defendant returned to the buggy, and defendant handed my husband a pint of whisky, which my husband paid defendant for.\u201d Numerous objections were urged to the introduction of this testimony\u2014 among others, that these acts constituted other offenses and collateral transactions which tended to shed no light upon the question at issue, and were prejudicial. The court qualifies this bill by stating \u201cthat' the evidence was offered for the purpose of showing a motive on the part of defendant to kill Kliner, and the jury were told that they could not consider it for any other purpose.\u201d The State was further permitted to introduce in evidence the minutes of the county commissioners court, showing the putting into effect of local option in Eastland County. This was also objected to for various reasons. The court explains this bill by stating \u201cthat the evidence was offered in connection with the evidence of Mrs. Kliner as to defendant\u2019s statement to deceased that he must lie low, as the grand jury would meet soon, and the jury was informed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the time that they could only consider the fact of local option being in force in Eastland County for the purpose of showing a motive on the part of defendant to kill deceased, and that they would consider it for no other purpose.\u201d This testimony was clearly inadmissible. The homicide occurred on the night of the 23d of December. These matters occurred long prior to the killing, and were in no way connected with it. Extraneous facts and crimes are sometimes admissible when they go to show the intent, develop the res gestae, or connect defendant with the crime for which he is beings tried. Walker and deceased, Kliner,' were friends, and had been for quite a length of time. On the occasion of the difficulty, Kliner was drinking, and, some of the witnesses say, quite drunk. He was very abusive and aggressive in his conduct towards appellant, threatening to kill him and using violence and epithets toward him. Appellant sought to avoid and pacify deceased, but was followed by deceased. He left his place of business, closing the door, and requested his porter to carry deceased in one direction, while he (appellant) went in the opposite direction. Deceased insisted, and followed him up. Appellant returned to the lot in the rear of his business house while pursued by deceased. On their return to the rear of the building the homicide occurred. There was no eyewitness to the transaction, and it was at night. Appellant\u2019s statement and evidence claim self-defense from aggressive movements, acts, and demonstrations of deceased. Deceased was shown to be a violent and dangerous man, having previously killed Purcell. All the witnesses who testify in regard to his character show that when drinking he was a violent and dangerous man, and one who would likely execute a threat. There is nothing in the record tending to show appellant was afraid deceased would prosecute him for violating the local option law. In fact, he seemed to be accustomed to these prosecutions. Therefore we hold the testimony in.no way tended to throw any light on this transaction, and only served to prejudice the minds of the jury against accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">Another bill of exceptions .recites that while witness Bollinger was testifying he was permitted to state: \u201cI know John Walker [defendant] . Have known him for two years. Some time prior to the killing of Kliner\u2014I don\u2019t remember the exact time\u2014I had a conversation with him in the town of Cisco, Texas. He called me out from the barber shop, and said to me he would rather have a murder case against him than a whisky case in Eastland County. This was just before Walker\u2019s local option cases were to come up in the county court.\u201d Various objections were urged to the introduction of this testimony. It was certainly very damaging, and without any apparent connection with the homicide. It showed him to be a violator of the local option law, and his dread of prosecutions for violating said law. It may have left, and doubtless did leave, the impression on the jury that he had less compunctions of conscience in taking human life, and less dread of a prosecution for that heinous offense, than for violating the local option law. A severer criticism of his character could not well be imagined. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>prejudicial in the extreme. The court undertook to control all this testimony by relegating it to the question of motive. This was a charge on the weight of evidence. It assumes the fact that the motive for the killing was to avoid the prosecution which might be predicated on the evidence of deceased, without a fact in the record to connect those transactions with the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">For the errors indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
