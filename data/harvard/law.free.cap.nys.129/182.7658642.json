Defendant, in accepting the written proposal, wrote: \u201cSame to be done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in a workmanlike manner.\u201d The defense was that the work was not properly done. The court gave judgment for. the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The plaintiff\u2019s assignor was not bound to satisfy the\u2019defendant. It was only bound to do the work in a manner that ought to satisfy. [2] Testimony was' excluded tending to show that, assuming the condition of the fence as set to be as defendant\u2019s witnesses testified, it would cost a certain sum to remedy those defects. This was error. It is true that plaintiff can recover only if he had substantially performed his contract. But if the defects are not pervasive, do not amount .to a deviation from the general plan, and are not so essential that they may not be remedied without difficulty, then the contract will be held substantially performed, and the plaintiff, who in good faith intended to comply with the contract, will be allowed to recover the contract price, less the amount requisite to indemnify the owner for the expense of conforming the work to the contract.

Supp. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Without passing on the question of fact as to whether the contract was substantially performed or not, I think there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
