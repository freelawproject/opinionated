The court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not negligent was probably based upon the evidence that the cases were secured by a rope and by three rungs on the end of the truck, and that a hole in the street so jarred the truck as to displace the rung and allow the case to fall. The hole was a foot and a half wide, about half of a foot deep and ten feet long, as the driver states, and the truck entered it with such force as to displace the rung and carry it \u201caway in on the floor of the truck,\u201d to stop the truck instantly, turn the horses around somewhat, and almost throw the driver from the truck. The driver testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-21\">\u201cAs 1 swung into Duane street, I heard a terrible jar, and I stopped and looked. * * * I felt the jar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">The driver seems to have been so inattentive that he did not see the hole previous to the terrible jar, and, although he states that his-horses were walking slowly, the management of them was such that the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>was allowed to jounce into the hole in such .manner as to produce serious consequences to it and resulting injury to the pedestrian. Reasonably careful driving is not indicated by this history, and the finding exculpating the defendant is not supported by the evidence. The negligent driving, and not the hole, was-the proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff was injured to some extent, and while his testimony of payments to the doctor and the apothecary was incompetent, in absence of evidence of the necessity of the drugs and services, there was proof of some damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
