It is conceded that the defendant corporation was merely an accommodation indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-19\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendant was a guarantor, as well as an indorser, need not be considered, in face of the express provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>section 113 of the negotiable instruments law (Consol. _ Laws 1909. c. 38), and the fact that the indorsement is a bare unqualified indorsement. It is not necessary to determine whether the learned trial judge was justified in believing that the defendant had received due notice of protest, although nonreceipt of such notice is strenuously insisted upon by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The indorsement is plainly ultra vires as to the defendant corporation. It is not pretended that the corporation has any such power by its charter, and the indorsement was not made or given in connection with any business transaction with the defendant. It was purely for the accommodation of Leonard, who happened to be one of its customers. The fact that he gave a second mortgage on some chattels to the defendant as security for the liability supposed to be incurred by- the indorsement does not modify the ultra vires character of the act. National Park Bank v. German-American Co., 116 N. Y. 281, 22 N. E. 567, 5 L. R. A. 673; Fox v. Rural Home Co., 90 Hun, 365, 35 N. Y. Supp. 896, affirmed 157 N. Y. 684, 51 N. E. 1090.
