Y. On the 19th of May, 1909, one of the plaintiffs went to the defendant\u2019s place of business and obtained from him the following order (except the numbers, sizes, and prices) for children\u2019s clothing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-16\">Order No. May 19, 1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-17\">M.............: Ship to B. Gardner, Hammondsport, N. Y. How Ship:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-18\">Erie. When: Oct. 1st. Terms: Nov. 1st, 7/10, 5/30, 4/60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">Action was brought, the venue being laid in the county of New York, to recover the price alleged to have been agreed upon at the time the order was given. The answer admits the giving of the order, and alleges that the terms of the same were not complied with by the plaintiffs; that they neglected and refused to deliver the clothing on or before the 1st of October, 1909, and made no attempt to deliver the same until after October 15th of that year, and that the same were never, in fact, delivered to defendant, and that he has never received or accepted the same. After issue had been joined, the defendant, for the convenience of witnesses, moved to change the place of trial from the county of New York to the county of Steuben. The' motion was denied, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">The contract was made in Steuben county, and the goods were, according to the order, to be there delivered. The principal issues to be tried\u2014in fact, substantially the only issues\u2014are (1) whether.the goods were ever delivered to the defendant at all; and (2) if so, whether at the time called for by the order. Upon these issues it is \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>perfectly obvious the witnesses must be largely obtained in Steuben county. This, taken in connection with the \u25a0 fact that the transaction arose in that county, was sufficient to require that the trial should be there had. Brody v. Weed &amp; Co., 137 App. Div. 754, 122 N. Y. Supp. 625; Shaff v. Rosenberg, 116 App. Div. 366, 101 N. Y. Supp. 892; Denzer v. Grewen, 133 App. Div. 706, 118 N. Y. Supp. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
