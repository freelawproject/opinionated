Stempel &amp; Son, to recover $50 alleged to have been paid the defendant under a mistake of fact. The plaintiff Max Stempel, upon cross-examination, was asked whether a Mr. Kapp was a \u201cmember of the firm of the National Supply Company,\u201d and he answered that he was not, but that he was the manager of that company, and had an interest in its profits. The defendant\u2019s counsel then moved to dismiss the complaint, \u201con the ground of misjoinder of parties in this action, and there is nothing before the court that there is anything due to the National Supply Company.\u201d This motion was granted, subject to the exception of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\"><bracketnum>[1. 2]</bracketnum> There was no plea in the answer that there was a misjoinder of parties, and in the absence of this plea, or a demurrer, the objection was waived. Egbert v. Hanson, 34 Misc. Rep. 760, 71 N. Y. Supp. 1135. Apart from this, however, there is nothing in the record to suggest that there was any merit in the objection. The fact that Max Stempel admitted on cross-examination that he was interested in the National Supply Company furnished no justification for dismissing the complaint in the present action, in which the National Supply Company was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
