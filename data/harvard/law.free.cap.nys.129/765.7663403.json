A witness for the plaintiff testified that about.two hours after the accident she found a piece of leather on a nail in one of the treads of the stairway from which the little child appears to have fallen, and that that piece of leather fitted the heel of the child\u2019s shoe. The plaintiff draws the inference that the child was going down stairs, caught her heel on the nail, and pitched headlong over the bannister. It does not appear how tall the child was, but the bannister was 30 inches high. It would therefore appear to have been physically impossible for the accident to have happened in the manner claimed, and if there was anything about the construction of the stairs that made the accident possible the plaintiff should have shown it.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
