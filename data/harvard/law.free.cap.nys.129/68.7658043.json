The total purchase price was $200, and defendant had already paid $30.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Respondent (defendant) contends that plaintiff is not entitled to recover at law what he calls the \u201cpurchase price\u201d of real estate until a deed has actually been tendered or delivered, intimating that plaintiff\u2019s remedy may lie in equity for specific performance. It is true that there is some conflict in the authorities on that point. Cong. Beth Elohim v. Central Presb. Church, 10 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 484, 494, 500, and the cases which follow it indicate that a recovery for such a cause of action cannot be had at law. Richards v. Edick, 17 Barb. 260 (.disapproved in the case last cited, but cited with approval in the Court of Appeals, Beckrich v. City of North Tonawanda, 171 N. Y. 292, 299, .64 N. E. 6), is to the contrary effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">But, regardless of the conflict, it is apparent that these cases have reference only to an action brought to recover the- entire purchase price, and that the reasoning would not apply to one to recover mere intermediate installments. Suits to recover the latter before tender of the deed are expressly approved in Paine v. Brown, 37 N. Y. 228; Eddy v. Davis, 116 N. Y. 247, 22 N. E. 362; Loeffler v. Bleier, 63 Misc. Rep. 352, 117 N. Y. Supp. 163; Loeffler v. Snyder, 65 Misc. Rep. 62, 119 N. Y. Supp. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide .the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
