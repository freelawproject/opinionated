The pleading did not put in issue the title to real property in the sense contemplated by section 179, supra. The alleged owner is not a party to this action, and-a judgment herein in favor of either party can in no way affect the rights of such alleged owner. Heiferman v. Scholder, 134 App. Div. 579, 119 N.
