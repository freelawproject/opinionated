In 1897 Mr. Conti was appointed interpreter for the Brooklyn Police Courts by the Brooklyn common council by virtue of chapter 623, Laws of 1875, which authorized the common council to appoint such interpreters, prescribe the duties, fill vacancies, fix salaries, and to remove them from office for cause. Under the Greater New York charter, he was continued with other Brooklyn interpreters, some 12 in number, who appeared to have been recognized as having a special tenure under control of the municipal assembly, the successor to the Brooklyn common council. When the Magistrates\u2019 Courts were formed, he was also continued there as interpreter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-20\">The question is now raised as to his status in the Magistrates\u2019 Courts created by chapter 659, Laws of 1910, which declares that all interpreters (with deputy clerks, stenographers, etc.) may be removed by the board of magistrates \u201cafter an opportunity of making an explanation\u201d (section 103). The relator, however, urges that this power of removal after explanation (which follows the wording of section 22 of the civil service law [Consol. Laws 1909, c. 7]) is not applicable to interpreters already serving in the old Magistrates\u2019 Courts, but affects only those interpreters whom the new boards of magistrates may appoint. The Legislature, however, have met this by section 56 (Laws 1910, c. 659), which provides that: \u201cAll 'clerks, assistants, stenographers, interpreters, and other employ\u00e9s of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts shall be continued without reappointment, subject to removal, as provided in this act.\u201d And this legislative intent to subject all the court officers to a common uniform power of removal, without discrimination for or against those continued \u25a0 from prior office, is found in other parts of the inferior criminal courts act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Where prior incumbents are continued in office, the very provision therefor declares this continuance subject to removal \u201cas provided by this act,\u201d as in the case of police clerks (section 55) and of officers and employ\u00e9s of the Court of Special Sessions (section 17). Obviously such power of removal is not only required for the dignity and efficiency of the court, but a uniform condition for the exercise of the power of removal after an opportunity for explanation becomes a needed protection for the incumbent. The final repealing clause (section 120) does not mention this act of 1875, although it may be considered to come within the general reference to acts inconsistent or in conflict therewith. The repealing clause did not take effect on the passage of the bill in June last, but is declared not to go into effect until on and after September 1st The relator therefore urges that the act of 1875, under which he was appointed, is still in force, or was not repealed in August at the time he applied for this writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In creating the new courts, the Legislature had power to determine the manner of appointment and the method of removal\u2014so far as not in conflict with the civil service provisions of the Constitution\u2014and unquestionably the right to change the tenure of office of a court interpreter (People v. McCarthy, 10 Abb. N. C. 418), so that he should be given \u201can opportunity of making an explanation,\u201d instead of being subject to removal merely \u201cfor cause\u201d as by tjhe act of 1875. This change took effect on the passage of the act of 1910, so that, when the relator was continued in office, he became at once subject to the powers of removal then enacted. Here the point is as to the power of the board of city magistrates, not as to a possible conflict with the authority of some other body. The power to remove any court interpreter in their courts is clearly conferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Even if the provisions designed by repealing inconsistent statutes to harmonize the series of prior acts have not fully taken effect, and a conflict remains, the latest expression of the legislative will controls. Stack v. City of Brooklyn, 150 N. Y. 335, 345, 44 N. E. 1030. The power to remove and to try the relator and to hear and consider his explanation, if any, of the charges against him, was vested in the board of city magistrates of the Second division at the time of the relator\u2019s application, and therefore the magistrates could not be prohibited from exercising their jurisdiction. The motion for writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b489-7\">Argued before JENKS, P.
