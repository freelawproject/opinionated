The instrument reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">\u201cWall or Fence Permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-13\">\u201cBrklyn, Sept. 1, 1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">\u201cIn consideration of $50.00 cash payable yearly in advance the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby leases to Reeve Sign Co. the entire side wall No. 1410-12-14 Bedford Ave. opp. Prospect PI. for \u2022advertising purposes for the term of one years with privilege of renewal for \u2022one years at same rate. In case of sign being obstructed or house being sold money returned for unexpired time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-15\">\u201cName, Wm. E. Duryee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-16\">\u201cAddress, 1410 Bedford Av.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-17\">\u201cState whether owner or tenant: Owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">On the back of the instrument appears the following, subscribed by the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-19\">\u201cMay 16. [The year is missing owing to the corner of the paper having \u2022been torn off, but it is assumed that the year is 1910.] I hereby assign this lease to the Centaur Company. Reeve Sign Co., H. Reeve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-20\">No point is made by either party in reference to this alleged assignment, and the defendant makes no claim that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest. It may be considered, therefore, that the parties agree that the rights conferred by the document are not assignable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">While the paper is called a \u201clease,\u201d it is obviously a mere \u201clicense.\u201d See cases cited in my opinion in Stockham v. Borough Bill Posting Co. (decided herewith) 129 N. Y. Supp. 745. In any event, as was said by Judge O\u2019Brien, writing for the Court of Appeals on the construction of a similar instrument, in Reynolds v. Van Beuren, 155 N. Y. 120, 123, 49 N. E. 763, 42 L. R. A. 129:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-22\">'\u2018While this paper is called a \u2018lease,\u2019 it is manifestly nothing more than a mere license by the tenant in possession to the defendants to go upon the roof of the building and place advertisements upon the sign. It conveys no \u2022estate or interest whatever in the realty and no possession or right of possession to the building or any part of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> Nor did the document create an \u201ceasement.\u201d As was said in G. L. &amp; P. J. R. R. Co. v. N. Y. &amp; G. L. R. R. Co., 134 N. Y. 435, 439, 440, 31 N. E. 874, 875:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cAn \u2018easement\u2019 is a right without profit, created by grant or prescription, which the owner of one estate may exercise in or over the estate of another for the benefit of the former.

Wilson, 8 Ellis &amp; B. 123.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201cA \u2018license\u2019 is a personal, revocable, and nonassignable privilege, conferred either by writing or paroi, to do one or more acts upon land without possessing any interest therein.

Whitney, 15 Wend. 380 [30 Am. Dec. 60]; Cook v. Stearns, 11 Mass. 533; Prince v. Case, 10 Conn. 375 [27 Am. Dec. 675]; Washburn, Ease. 6, 7; Goddard, Ease. 3; 13 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. 539.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In Crosdale v. Lanigan, 129 N. Y. 604, 29 N. E. 824, 26 Am. St. Rep. 551, it was held, as per headnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">\u201cA paroi license to do an act on the land of the licensor, while it Justifies anything done by the licensee before revocation, is revocable at the option of the licensor; and this, although the intention was to confer a continuing right and money has been expended by the licensee upon the faith of the license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It appears in the case at bar that the plaintiff paid the license fee for one year and placed upon the wall signs which remained there for seven months. The defendant then leased the property, and his tenant obstructed or painted out the plaintiff\u2019s sign by painting another sign over it. The defendant offered to allow judgment to be taken against him, pursuant to section 148 of the Municipal Court Act (LawsT902, c. 580), for the sum of $20.85, being the pro rata amount of the license fee for the unexpired term, which offer was not accepted by the plaintiff. Judgment was rendered for the sum of $100 damages and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">It seems clear to me that the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover was limited, both by law and by the express terms of the contract, to the pro rata amount of the license fee; and the judgment should, therefore, be modified by reducing the recovery to the sum of $20.85, and as thus modified affirmed, with costs, and with costs to the appellant in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">WOODWARD, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b778-12\">BURR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">I concur in the modification of the judgment to the extent suggested in the opinion of Mr. Justice HIRSCHBERG. The character of instruments similar in form to that which is the basis of this action has been under consideration of this court in three other cases, decided simultaneously herewith. Stockham v. Borough Bill Posting Co., 129 N. Y. Supp. 745, Borough Bill Posting Co. v. Levy, 129 N. Y. Supp. 740, and American Bill Posting Co. v. Borough Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Posting Co., 129 N. Y. Supp. 740. In those cases a majority of the entire court reached the conclusion that the instruments there under consideration were neither leases nor licenses, but that they created an interest in the nature of an easement in gross. In this case it is of little consequence, so far as the result is concerned, whether the paper is called a lease, a license, or an easement, since there was contained in it. an express agreement that, if the sign painted upon the wall was obstructed, the money should be returned for the unexpired time. Certainly the result of painting over the sign painted by plaintiff was an obstruction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\">It is not important in this case to determine whether the interest conferred by the instrument under consideration was assignable or not. Although an indorsement appears upon the back of the paper indicating an intention to assign the same, there is no proof either of the execution or delivery of it, and the fact that the instrument remained in the possession of plaintiff, and was produced by him upon the trial, would indicate that the proposed assignment had never been carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">It may be proper to observe, also, that while the definition of an easement, contained in the opinion of Judge Vann in G. L. &amp; P. J. R. R. Co. v. N. Y. &amp; G. L. R. R. Co., 134 N. Y. 435, 31 N. E. 874, applies to an easement in favor of a dominant against a servient tenement, manifestly it was not intended to and does not refer to an easement in gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">JENKS, P. J., and RICH, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
