The second separate and partial defense charges plaintiff and certain other theatrical managers with having entered into a pooling combination to control theaters and theatrical productions, and sets forth an indictment of such managers, including plaintiff, as well as a statement, purporting to have been issued by the district attorney, regarding the existence of the pooling combination and its effect. The defense is not connected in any way with the alleged libel, and appears to be designed to reduce the damages, by showing that plaintiff\u2019s char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>acter is such that a libel could not greatly injure him. Respecting this defense Mr. Justice Whitney, at Special Term, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\">\u201cThe second defense is an attempt to mitigate damages, not by showing plaintiff\u2019s general bad character, but by showing that he proved himself an undesirable person in certain business relations not connected with or involved in the subject-matter of the publication. This is not permissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We agree entirely with the learned justice in this regard, and, for the reasons stated by him, the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fourth separate defense reiterates the objectionable matter contained in the second separate defense, and, if it included nothing else, would be equally open to demurrer. But it also contains the allegations, frequently to be found in answers in actions for libel, tending to show, in mitigation of damages, that the statements complained of were communicated to defendant by persons and from sources which it had theretofore found to be reliable, and which it then believed to be reliable, and that in publishing the article complained of defendant relied upon the statements made to it, and believes the said article to be true. The fourth separate defense is demurred to as a whole, and must be considered as such; and, since it contains matter which is relevant as a defense, it is.not subject to demurrer because it also contains irrelevant matter. The plaintiff, however, can be amply protected at the trial by proper objections to the proof of the objectionable matter embraced in the defense. The demurrer to this separate defense was therefore properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The complaint alleges that for some time prior to February 1, 1909, the firm of which plaintiff is a member had advertised in defendant\u2019s newspaper, but from and after said date ceased to do so; \u201cthat thereupon the said defendant, contriving and maliciously intending to injure this plaintiff,\u201d etc., published the libel complained of on March 10, 1909. The purpose of this allegation is, of course, to show express malice on defendant\u2019s part. The third separate defense gives at some length the history of a quarrel between defendant and one Oscar Hammerstein, a theatrical manager, said to be a member of the Theatrical Managers\u2019 Association of Greater New York, of which plaintiff is said also to have been a member. It is said that <em>as a </em>result'of the aforesaid quarrel the members of said Theatrical Association, including plaintiff, with a view to coercing defendant in the conduct of its business, agreed to discontinue their advertising in defendant\u2019s newspaper from and after February 1, 1909. There appears to be no relation or connection between the facts thus pleaded and the libel sued upon, and certainly, if all the facts stated in the defense are true, they furnish no justification for the libel which defendant published' concerning plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The defense is sought to be upheld on the ground that the facts charged in it were provocative, and hence furnished some excuse, if not a justification, for attacking plaintiff by means of the libel complained of. The answer contains no allegation that the libel was published in the heat of passion, or was provoked by any act on the part of plaintiff; but, even if it had so alleged, the defense would still be insufficient, because of the length of time, a month and ten days, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>elapsed between the discontinuance of the advertisements and the publication of the libel, certainly more than a sufficient time for the defendant\u2019s passion to have cooled. The demurrer to this defense should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from, in so far as it sustained the demurrer to the fourth separate defense, is affirmed; in so far as it overruled the demurrer to the third separate defense, it is reversed, and the demurrer to that defense sustained, without costs in this court to either party, with leave to plaintiff to withdraw demurrer to the fourth defense, and with leave to defendant to serve an amended answer within 20 days after entry of the order on this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
