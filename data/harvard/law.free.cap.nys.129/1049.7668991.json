He had an interview with the defendants, at the conclusion of which they signed and delivered to him the following writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-22\">\u201cNew York, Sept, 17th, 1907.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-23\">\u201cMr. Henry Corn\u2014Dear Sir: We hereby lease from you the fifth and sixth floors in the building now being erected by you at 32, 34 and 36 West 18th street, New York City, for the term of five years, beginning Feby. 1st, 1908, at the annual rental of $8,375 (eight thousand three hundred and seventy-five dollars), the leases for same to be drawn in the usual form employed by you and to be executed as soon as presented to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-24\">\u201cYours truly, Samuel Bergmann.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-25\">\u201cD. Turkel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-26\">Kohn then took the writing to the plaintiff, who wrote at the bottom of it the words, \"Accepted, Henry Corn.\u201d No notice of the acceptance was given to the defendants until the 20th of September, when a lease was tendered to them, which they refused to execute, and they never did execute a lease, go into possession of the premises mentioned, or pay the rent. This action was brought to recover the damages alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>There have been two trials. On the first the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the writing was insufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds, but on appeal the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. Corn v. Bergmann, 138 App. Div. 260, 123 N. Y. Supp. 160. On the last trial the defendants had a verdict and the plaintiff again appeals, claiming that the judgment should be reversed for errors in the admission of evidence. [1] One of the errors alleged is that testimony was admitted against the plaintiff\u2019s objection tending to show that, when the writing was delivered to 'Kahn, he stated it was understood it was an offer only, which might be accepted or rejected by the plaintiff, and, before he came to a conclusion, he would have to look up the defendants\u2019 references; that the defendants then stated to Kohn that they must know by the 19th of September whether the offer was accepted and Kohn then said he would let them know by noon of the 19th; that, if he did not do so, \"the deal would be off altogether\u201d; that, not having been informed on the 19th of the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance, they thereafter refused to execute a lease. It is urged the court erred in receiving testimony to this effect because it tended to modify and change a written contract; that is, the written offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">I am of the opinion that the testimony was admissible. The writing, at most, was but an offer, and did not become a binding contract until accepted by the plaintiff. The provision in the writing that \u201cthe leases for same to be * * * executed as soon as presented to us\u201d gave the plaintiff a reasonable time within which to present the leases, but the writing itself did not specify any time within which the plaintiff had to accept the offer. Therefore, that could be supplied by paroi. Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961; Brigg v. Hilton, 99 N. Y. 517, 3 N. E. 51, 52 Am. Rep. 63; Eagle Iron Works v. Farley, 83 App. Div. 82, 82 N. Y. Supp. 503; affirmed 178 N. Y. 595, 70 N. E. 1098. Defendants had a right to prove that at the time the offer was given it was orally agreed that, if not accepted by a certain time, it should be of no effect. Such agreement did not vary the writing. On the contrary, it was in the nature of a condition precedent to there being any contract at all. If this agreement were made, and the jury found it was, then the minds of the parties never met upon the subject of a lease, because the condition was not complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Parol evidence tending to show that a writing is delivered under certain conditions which have not been complied with is admissible. Higgins v. Ridgway, 153 N. Y. 130, 47 N. E. 32; Reynolds v. Robinson, 110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. 127; Juilliard v. Chaffee, 92 N. Y. 535; Bookstaver v. Jayne, 60 N. Y. 146; Benton v. Martin, 52 N. Y. 570. The Benton Case is cited with approval in the Higgins Case; Judge Martin, who delivered the opinion, saying that case held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-7\">\u201cThat instruments not under seal may be delivered to one to whom they are payable upon conditions, the observance of which is essential to their validity; that the annexing of such conditions to the delivery is not an oral contradiction of the written obligation; that, as it needs a delivery to make an obligation operative, the effect of it and the extent to which the instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>ment is to become operative may be limited by the condition attending its delivery. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\">In the Bookstaver Case it was held that any instrument not under seal may be delivered upon conditions, the observance of which between the parties is essential to its validity. The defendants, therefore, within the rule laid down within these authorities and many others that might be cited to the same effect, had the right when they delivered the writing to Kohn to attach to such delivery a condition that they must be notified by 12 o\u2019clock on the 19th, otherwise the offer would be ineffectual. The court therefore did not err in admitting testimony to show such oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I am, however, of the opinion that the court did err in permitting defendants\u2019 witness Hornstein, the broker who introduced Kohn to the defendants, and who was present at the interview referred to,, to testify that he had a conversation with Kohn on the 20th of September, when Kohn informed him that the defendants would not execute a lease because he (Kahn) had not presented the lease or notified them of plaintiff\u2019s acceptance on the 19th; that Hornstein then said to Kohn \u201cYou agreed to go yesterday, why didn\u2019t you go?\u201d\" to which Kohn replied, \u201cI was in court all day.\u201d This testimony was introduced evidently for the purpose of supporting defendants\u2019\" version of the transaction that they were to be notified of the acceptance on the 19th. Obviously, it was incompetent as an admission against the plaintiff. Kohn was plaintiff\u2019s agent to procure a lease, and, when he made the admission referred to, he clearly was not acting within the scope of his authority. His admission could not therefore bind the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">In Goetz v. Metropolitan Street Ry. Co., 54 App. Div. 365, 66 N. Y. Supp. 666, it is said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">\u201cDeclarations of an agent are not competent to charge a principal upon proof merely that the relation of principal and agent existed at the time when the declarations were made. Something more must be shown. \u2018It must further appear that the agent at the time the declarations were made was engaged in executing the authority conferred upon him, and that the declarations related to and were connected with the business then depending so that they constituted a part of the res gestee.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Here Kohn denied that the writing was delivered with any conditions or that any oral agreement was made. The testimony of Hornstein that Kohn made the admission to which he testified was erroneously admitted, and the jury may have relied upon that in determining whether the oral agreement were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> I also think the court erred in permitting Hornstein to contradict Kohn as to a collateral matter brought out on the latter\u2019s cross-examination. Kohn testified on cross-examination that he had made an attempt prior to the trial to subpoena Hornstein as a witness,, but was unable to do so because he did not know his address, that he had seen him some time during the preceding spring, but had not spoken to him, and that he did not at that time know where to locate him. Hornstein was then permitted to testify that when Kohn saw him was not in the spring, but in the summer; that they conversed' together and that he said to Kohn, \u201cYou had better put down my ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>\u2022dress, where you can find me if you want to\u201d; that Kohn did so, and then Hornstein said, \u201cMy office is right on the other corner.\u201d This testimony was introduced solely for the purpose of attacking the credibility of Kohn. It had no connection whatever with the issue being tried, and the only effect of it was to contradict Kohn upon a \u25a0collateral matter elicited upon his cross-examination. It was therefore inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">In Lumley v. Torsiello, 69 App. Div. 76, 74 N. Y. Supp. 567, this court said, in speaking of evidence offered merely to contradict a statement of a witness upon a collateral matter brought out on cross-examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">\u201cIt is true that she testified that she had never written these letters to the defendant; that she had never written to him at all, but this testimony was flrawn out by the defendant upon the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination, and was purely a collateral fact, having no relation to the transaction upon which the cause of action was based, and the defendant was not entitled to ask the plaintiff upon cross-examination as to such a collateral fact and then introduce evidence tending to show that her statements were not true, for the purpose of contradicting her or impeaching her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">See, also, Potter v. Browne, 197 N. Y. 288, 90 N. E. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The judgment and order appealed from therefore are reversed and \u2022a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
