We think the evidence of the plaintiff was not credible. He denied that he signed a receipt for the money paid him, but subsequently admitted his signature to such receipt. The receipt showed the absolute sale of the machine to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Proof was also offered by the defendant to show that the sale made &lt; to him was absolute, and not conditional, and this testimony was corroborated by a witness called by the plaintiff. The claim of the plaintiff that the machine was sold under an oral conditional sale agreement is without credible support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs, and without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue for any part of the balance alleged to be due. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
