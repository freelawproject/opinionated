The action was brought to recover sick benefits under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">The policy provided that, in consideration of a premium of $1 per month, the defendant would pay a sick benefit of $1 a day, providing notice in writing was given within 10 days from the beginning of the illness or date of the accident. Paragraph- M of the policy is as follows : \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-20\">\u201cWritten notice of * * * any illness must be given to the company * * * within ten days from * * * the beginning of the illness. Failure on the part of the assured or beneficiary to comply strictly with said notice requirement shall liriiit the liability of the company to one-fifth the amount of indemnity it would otherwise have to pay under the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>In Whiteside v. North Am Co., 200 N. Y. <em>320, </em>93 N. E. 948, the Court of Appeals held that such a provision was binding. It remains, however, to consider whether the company waived the benefit of the clause. It is urged by respondent that an insurance company can effectually waive a forfeiture by failure to file proofs of loss within the time specified without an agreement based on a new consideration, or where the circumstances do not amount to an estoppel. Brink v. Hanover Fire Ins. Co., 80 N. Y. 108. And, if such a condition is once-waived, the company cannot recall the waiver and insist on the forfeiture. As was said in the Brink Case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\">\u201cThey may refuse to pay without specifying any ground and insist upon any available ground, but, if they plant themselves upon a specified defense and so notify the assured, they should not be permitted to retract after the-latter has acted upon their position as announced and incurred expenses in consequence of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">See, also, Walker v. Phoenix Co., 156 N. Y. 628-633, 51 N. E. 392; Goodwin v. Mass. Co., 73 N. Y. 480; Kiernan v. Dutchess Co., 150 N. Y. 190-195, 44 N. E. 698; Hermann v. Niagara Co., 100 N. Y. 411, 3 N. E. 341, 53 Am. Rep. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Here the company bases its defense on failure to pay a premium, following up a letter it sent plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cWe have your preliminary notice of your disability due to illness. Your disability commenced January 24th; the January premium was not paid until the 20th; therefore your policy was not in force at the time the disability commenced. We shall therefore be unable to entertain your claim, arising from this disability at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">But this is a total denial of liability under the contract. It does not follow that the company did not have the right to urge this provision M, which provides for a reduction in the amount of the sum payable-if provision M is not complied with. If provision M had provided <em>that </em>there should be no .payment under the policy if the notice were not given under provision M, then respondent\u2019s theory about waiver might apply; but as provision M provides, not for no payment, but for a different payment, in case its provisions are not complied with, there-was no waiver of the provisions of M in asserting that the policy was. not in force because of failure to pay premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to-abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
