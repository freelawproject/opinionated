The answering affidavits are not credible, and I feel that the affiants are mistaken when they state that the witnesses were in the courthouse at the very time that the tenant\u2019s attorney was asking an adjournment on account of their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">The order should be reversed, the judgment and final order vacated, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
