Such representations in the application the defendant realized could not be true, and so stated, but voluntarily took the risk of issuing a policy for the amount of $2,500 until further information could be obtained. When further information was obtained, the defendant did not offer to surrender the policy, because it had been procured by fraud, but treated it as a valid one, giving the 10 days\u2019 notice of cancellation stipulated in the policy. The fire occurred before that notice expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It was not error to permit the plaintiff to ask Soden, on cross-examination, if he did not tell the plaintiff that he was acting for the company. It was part of the conversation had, and was not received for the purpose of showing agency, and the court instructed the jury that it did not prove that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
