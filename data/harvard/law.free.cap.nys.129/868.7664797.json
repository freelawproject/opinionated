The County Court held that this was error, reversed the judgment, and directed a new trial before the same justice at a time and place fixed in the order of reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">The error for which the judgment of the justice was reversed was an error of law. The power of the County Court to direct a new trial, upon reversal of a judgment of a justice of the peace, where, as in this case, the appellant did not demand a new trial in the County Court, is provided by section 3063 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and is limited to cases where the reversal is because the judgment is contrary to or against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">We agree with the learned County Court in his conclusion that the justice of the peace erred in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and that the judgment was properly reversed; but we are of the opinion that it had no authority to direct a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">The order is modified, by striking out its provisions directing a new trial, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party in this court.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
