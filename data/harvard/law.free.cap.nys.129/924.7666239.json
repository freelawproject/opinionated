The defendant moved to amend his answer by setting up the statute of frauds, and subsequently moved the court to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the contract was void under the statute of frauds. These motions were denied, and the jury brought in a verdict for $500 in favor of the plaintiff, whereupon the defendant moved for a new trial upon the ground that he should have been permitted to amend his answer, and that the verdict was contrary to law, on the like ground. This motion was granted, and the plaintiff appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The plaintiff sustained the burden of proof, and by a fair preponderance of the evidence established the agreement set forth in the complaint, and the trial judge was not justified in setting aside the verdict upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Neither was he justified upon the ground specified in his memorandum, namely, that the amendment should have been allowed; and this, for the reason that upon plaintiff\u2019s evidence in the case the contract was not one which by its terms could not be performed within one year from the making thereof. Raws of 1909, c. 45 (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 41) \u00a7 31. It is' true that plaintiff did not actually begin work until the following day; but there is no evidence from which the jury could find that the agreement did not terminate on the 16th day of May, 1911. In such case the agreement need not be in writing. Schmerenbeck v. Funke, 17 N. Y. Supp. 717.<footnotemark>\u00b9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFO\">. [2] We think there was no ambiguity upon this point; but, if so, it was for the jury to determine when the contract of employment began and when it terminated. Closson v. Thompson Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 112 App. Div. 273, 97 N. Y. Supp. 1113. Defendant was not deprived of any right by the refusal of the court to permit the amendment, and it was error to set aside the .verdict and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the verdict of the jury and the judgment entered thereon should be reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b9\">\n<p id=\"b953-11\"> Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as'a memorandum decision without opinion in 63' Hun, 627.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
