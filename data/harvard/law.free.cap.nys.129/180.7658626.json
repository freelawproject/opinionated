Plaintiff\u2019s wife slipped on the ice on the stoop of the house where she was a tenant. If the ice was due to any condition the maintenance of which would be. chargeable against the defendant as negligence, there should be no difficulty in obtaining the testimony of tenants of the tenement house who would be obliged to ascend the stoop to reach their apartments, yet there is absolutely no testimony to show that the ice was not due solely to the condition of the weather. The plaintiff testifies, it is true, \u201cThe stoop was all dirty on account of ice,\u201d and \u201cit was dirty several days before\u201d; but in answer to the next question, \u201cWhat do you mean by dirty?\u201d he answered \u201cIt was full of ice and snow.\u201d Thereafter on recross-examination he testified, \u201cSeveral days before that it was always full of ice.\u201d The wife herself testified, \u201cThere was ice on the last step,\u201d and gave no other description of the stoop.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">Sabato Carbone says, \u201cI saw <em>fresh </em>ice on the steps of the stoop,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and on the previous day \u201cit was covered with ice,\u201d and \u201cthe <em>ice began to fall two days before that.\" \u201cAs the snow was falling the ice was freezing.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Diodorus Salvatore testified, \u201cThere was ice on the step, and there was also ice on the sidewalk,\u201d and about two hours before the accident \u201cit was full of ice.\u201d On cross-examination, in answer to the question, \u201cAnd at the time when you looked there, was the ground covered with ice?\u201d he stated, \u201cEverything was full of ice.\u201d This is absolutely the only evidence produced by the plaintiff to show that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In view of the fact that it appears from the official weather reports\u2019 that for two days previous to the accident the weather had been inclement, that sleet and rain fell and froze on the ground, and that the streets were covered with ice, I fail to see how the testimony- that two days before the accident and at the time of the accident the stoop was covered with ice is any evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Where the proof fails to show a condition due to the landlord\u2019s negligence or which could have been remedied by reasonable care on, his part, the plaintiff should not be permitted to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> It is well established that the mere fact that the steps were &gt; covered with ice is insufficient to hold the landlord, unless the ice was j permitted to accumulate there through his negligence, and in this rec- { ord I find no proof of such a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
