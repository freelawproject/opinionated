Upon the trial the defendant attempted to prove the facts al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>leged in his defense, but was not permitted to do so by the rulings of the court. Notwithstanding these rulings, which were incorrect, the court bel\u00f3w awarded judgment in favor of the defendant. It is manifest that upon the proof taken there is no basis for the judgment rendered. In the absence of evidence, we cannot assume that the defendant could have proved the defense alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; but, as the evidence which the defendant sought to offer was improperly excluded upon the objection of the plaintiff, the reversal will be without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, without \u00f3osts to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
