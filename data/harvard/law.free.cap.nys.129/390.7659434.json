Appellant attempted and offered to prove that the note in question was made by him without consideration and for the accommodation of the payee, and upon the express representation by the payee that he intended to use the same for a specific purpose, namely, the purchase of certain stock, which representation was false, and known by the payee to be false when made, and that the note was by the payee diverted to another purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">The learned court below declined to receive that evidence until the defendant should \u201cfirst show that the plaintiff had knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>infirmity in the note.\u201d However, section 98 of the negotiable instruments law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 38) expressly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\">\u201cWhen it is shown that the title of any person who has negotiated the instrument is defective, the burden is on the holder to prove that he or some person under whom he claims acquired the title as a holder in due course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">See sections 94, 95, and Engle v. Hyman, 54 Misc. Rep. 251, 104 N. Y. Supp. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Under section 94, the title to the note in the hands of the original payee would be defective, if the signature to the note was obtained by fraud or other unlawful means, or if it was negotiated in breach of faith. That the note in question was open to this defense is settled by Adams v. Gillig, 199 N. Y. 314, 92 N. E. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
