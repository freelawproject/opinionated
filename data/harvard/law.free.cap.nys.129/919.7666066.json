If defendant was entitled to any relief from this written contract on the ground of fraud or mutual mistake, the Municipal Court would have no jurisdiction to grant equitable relief of that character. But the evidence does not warrant such relief. Defendant admits an agreement with a broker to procure him a loan, for which he was to pay the' broker 5 per cent., and the uncontradicted evidence is that the broker, acting in defendant\u2019s behalf, made application to the plaintiff. This made defendant responsible to plaintiff, and in addition it appears that the broker consented that the amount of plaintiff\u2019s bill should be deducted from the commissions to be paid to him. Upon defendant\u2019s own testimony, and the uncontradicted testimony in behalf of plaintiff, plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">JENKS, P.
