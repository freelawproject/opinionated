The action was by the trustee in bankruptcy of William A. Sturgeon to set aside, as void under the provisions of the bankruptcy act, the assignment of certain stock to the appellant. The justice at Special Term found the assignment to be void, but, instead of directing its delivery to the assignee, rendered judgment against the appellant for a sum assumed to be the value of the stock, and also adjudged to the plaintiff costs and an extra allowance. On appeal to this court the judgment was modified, the order of modification reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-18\">\u201cOrdered and adjudged that the judgment so appealed from be and the same is hereby modified, so as to give the plaintiff relief as follows, <em>and not othemoise, </em>and so that all provisions of the said judgment inconsistent therewith, or giving the plaintiff any further relief be stricken therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Then followed a provision that appellant should deliver over the stock to plaintiff, and should account to him. for all dividends received thereon, and, finally,, the judgment, as so modified, was affirmed, without costs to either party in this court. When it came to entering the modified judgment upon this order, there was inserted, in addition to the provisions contained in the order of this court, the provision contained in the original Special Term judgment, awarding plaintiff his costs and an extra allowance. The purpose of the present motion is to strike out this latter provision. The motion should have been granted. The obvious effect of the order of this court was to strike out of the judgment everything except the adjudication that the transfer of the stock was void, and to substitute an entirely new provision as to the relief which should be accorded to the plaintiff. The order expressly precluded plaintiff from receiving any other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> So, also, the judgment for an extra allowance would be inconsistent with the modified judgment, which dealt only with the-stock in specie, and affixed no value to it upon which an allowance could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
