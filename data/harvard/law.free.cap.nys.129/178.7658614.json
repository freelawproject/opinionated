Under this contract the plaintiffs, had made and delivered to defendant on Februa'ry 24th 14 V1-2 dozen, of the coats, and had at their place of business on March 4th 14 7/i2 dozens completed, but not delivered. The contract price of manufacture of the 32 c/i2 dozens was $284.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Plaintiffs were indebted to defendant for the yarn used in the sweaters, and some other small items, in the sum of $136.43. Defendant\u2019s son, on March 4th, went to plaintiffs\u2019 place of business, checked off the sweaters he found there, and gave plaintiffs the check in suit, which represented the difference between the contract price of the coats manufactured and delivered up to that time and the amount the plaintiffs were then owing the defendant. Before the check was presented for payment to the bank upon which it was drawn, the defendant stopped its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">The answer alleges as a defense the contract, the warranty as to the manner of manufacture, length, style, and weight of the coats; that the sweaters delivered were not in accordance with the requirements of such warranty, and w\u00e9re worth $78.65 less than they would have been, had they been as warranted. This defense is followed by a counterclaim for the breach and nonperformance of the contract, in consequence of the refusal to deliver the sweaters, to defendant\u2019s damage of $900. An affirmative judgment was demanded on the counterclaim for $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Upon the trial evidence was given by the defendant in support of the facts pleaded, both as a defense and as a counterclaim. At the conclusion of the trial the court reserved decision, and later rendered judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\u201cJudgment is hereby rendered, after trial on the merits, in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant for the sum of $148.41; costs, $2.00; allow. $15.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Upon these facts the appellant contends that, the court having failed to make any disposition of the counterclaim set up in his answer, the judgment must be reversed, and this contention finds support in the requirements of section 230 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580). See Pinsker v. Pinsker, 44 App. Div. 501, 60 N. Y. Supp. 902; Cable Flax Mills v. Early, 72 App. Div. 213, 76 N. Y. Supp. 191; La Grange v. Merritt, 88 App. Div. 279, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1092; Morehouse v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 185 N. Y. 520, 528, 78 N. E. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">It is apparent that the counterclaim was not considered. The recovery is for the amount of the check and accrued interest. The matters involved in the defense and in the counterclaim are different. The record contains, evidence applicable to both the defense and counterclaim. The trial court undoubtedly reached the conclusion that the defense was not sustained, but overlooked the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Without considering the other questions presented, we are agreed that the judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">JENKS, P. J., and BURR and WOODWARD, JJ., concur. HIRSCHBERG, J\u201e dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
