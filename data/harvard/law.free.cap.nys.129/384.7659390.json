Y. Supp. 187. His right to a perpetual injunction, however, does not necessarily follow that decision. In that case it did not appear that the defendant company was engaged in any public service, as it now appears in respect of this company. By the concession in the case the defendant has the only electric light plant by which the public is served at Oneonta, and it supplies the demand for electric lights in public places, business houses, and residences therein. The plaintiff\u2019s damage from 1902 to 1909 has been found to be only $75. That damage was so slight, for which the plaintiff has his remedy at law, that a court of equity will not decree a perpetual injunction, which will place the defendant in a position whereby it cannot perform the public service in which it is engaged. The judgment should therefore be modified, so as to suspend the operation of the injunction as long as the defendant shall be engaged in furnishing electric light to any municipality, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">Judgment modified, so as to suspend the operation of the injunction as long as the defendant shall be engaged in furnishing electric light to any municipality, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-17\">BETTS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKq\">dissents, and votes for affirmance of the judgment in its entirety, without modification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
