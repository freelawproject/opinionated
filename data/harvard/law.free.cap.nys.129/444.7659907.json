J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atf\">The interlocutory judgment herein was rendered' upon July 28, 1909. The final judgment was made November 6, 1909,. and entered November 28, 1909. In August of the same year, and before the final judgment of divorce had been made and entered, the-plaintiff took the defendant to his home, and there lived and cohabited with her as husband and wife, and continued that relation after the-final judgment was entered, and until March of the succeeding year. By section 1758 of the Code of Civil Procedure a divorce should be denied, although the adultery be proven, \u201cwhere the offense charged has been forgiven by the plaintiff,\u201d which fact may be proven by the-voluntary cohabitation of the parties with the knowledge of the fact. By section 1774 a party is entitled as of course to a final judgment three months after the entry of the interlocutory judgment, \u201cunless-for sufficient cause the court in the meantime shall have otherwise ordered.\u201d If the fact of the voluntary cohabitation had been known to-the court at the time of the entry of the final judgment, the final judgment would undoubtedly have been denied. The fact that it was concealed from the court at that time gives full warrant to the court, upon-the discovery of this fact after the entry of final judgment, to vacate- and set aside the same. The order appealed from should, therefore,, be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion, granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
