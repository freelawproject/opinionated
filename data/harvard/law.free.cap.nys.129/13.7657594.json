L,aws 1909, c. 63), for refusing to transmit telephone messages. The defendant contends that, upon the undisputed facts and findings contained in the decision, the defendant is not liable for the forfeiture imposed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Whether that is so or not, I think the defendant is not in a position to raise that question. Motions for a nonsuit \u00e1nd the direction of a verdict in'its favor were made on behalf of the defendant, but were not ruled on by the trial court, as both parties consented that the jury be discharged, and the case was submitted for decision to the judge, who thereafter made his decision in writing, making findings as required by Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 1010, 1023; but no exceptions thereto were filed, so far as the record discloses. Under such circumstances, I think the question cannot be reviewed here on this appeal. Code of Civil Procedure, \u2022\u00a7 994; Frederick v. City of Johnstown, 47 App. Div. 221, 62 N. Y. Supp. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">While a motion for a new trial was made and entertained on the judge\u2019s minutes, under section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that does not aid the defendant, as that section applies only to a trial by jury, and this was a trial by the court. Waydell v. Adams, 23 App. Div. 508, 48 N. Y. Supp. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The judgment and order must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All , concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
