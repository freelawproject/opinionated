From the judgment and order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the defendant appealed to this court. On December 4, 1907, while such appeal was pending and undecided, the defendant died testate. \u2022 On January 10, 1908, the judgment and order were reversed, and a new trial granted. 123 App. Div. 657, 108 N. Y. Supp. 140. On January 16, 1908, the last will and testament of the deceased defendant was admitted to probate in New York county, and letters testamentary duly issued to the executors therein named, who qualified and entered upon the discharge of their duties and are yet serving. On March 5, 1908, the plaintiff moved the court at Special Term for an order directing the substitution of the executors and a continuance of the action, and for amendment of process and pleadings. The motion was denied, and from the order accordingly entered this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">The sole question presented is whether the reversal of the judgment and order was \u201cupon questions of law only.\u201d The only question considered on the appeal was, in the language of Mr. Justice Miller, \u201cthe exception to the denial of the motion to dismiss,\u201d which was characterized as \u201cthe question of law.\u201d A motion to dismiss, like a motion for a nonsuit, presents a question of law only, which is whether, admitting all of the facts presented, and giving to the plaintiff the advantage of every inference that can properly be drawn from the facts presented, an issue of fact is presented for the determination of the jury.

E. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for the substitution of the executors of the deceased defendant, the continuance of the action against them, and the necessary amendment of process and pleadings, granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
