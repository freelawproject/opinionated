Edward. No offer to settle or compromise the claim was made. An answer was served, but was withdrawn before trial, and three commissioners were appointed to ascertain the compensation to be made to the petitioner. The award of the commissioners was set aside and new commissioners were appointed who filed a report awarding to the petitioner the sum of $750. The report of the commissioners was confirmed. The order confirming the report provided' that the petitioner should \u201crecover $276.56 costs and disbursements in this proceeding to be taxed by the clerk against the village of Ft. Edward.\u201d The costs were taxed without notice at the sum of $276.56, and notice of retaxation was given. Upon the retaxation, the clerk struck out the following items: Costs before notice of trial before commissioners $25, costs after notice and before trial before commissioners $15, commissioner\u2019s fees first commission $156.06. The petitioner thereafter moved for a new taxation of costs and the motion was denied, and from the order denying the motion this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b479-10\">Afgued before SMITH, P.

The amount agreed upon for such damages or the award therefor, together with the costs, if any, allowed to the claimant, shall be charged against such village. Unless the award of the commissioners in favor of the claimant shall exceed the amount of the offer to settle or compromise such claim, he shall be liable for all the costs of the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">It is plain from this provision that the allowance of costs in this case, for all proceedings prior to the appointment of the commissioners, was in the discretion of the court, under section 3240 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is also apparent that under the provisions of section 3372 of the Code, which regulate the costs in a condemnation proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the petitioner was entitled to recover costs of the proceeding, subsequent to the appointment of the commissioners, to be taxed by the clerk at the same rate as is allowed, of course, to the defendant when he is a prevailing party in an action in the Supreme Court. I am therefore unable to conceive any reason why the appellant was not entitled to have her costs retaxed by the clerk at $276.56, the amount awarded in the final order in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> With respect to the force and effect of the order denying the motion for a new taxation, it is only necessary to say that it did not affect the appellant\u2019s right to the costs awarded by the final order. Hewitt v. City Mills, 136 N. Y. 211, 32 N. E. 768. It was entered upon notice at the conclusion of the proceeding, and was a judicial determination of a substantial right. It is true, as the respondent contends, that a court possesses inherent power to correct a mistake or clerical error, but this rule has no application in a case where there is' no allegation, or pretense of a mistake or omission in respect to the facts or the law. It follows that the order of the Special Term should be reversed, and that all the items contained in the bill of costs, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $276.56, should be allowed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
