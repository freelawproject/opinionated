Defendant\u2019s attorneys declined to accept service on behalf of said officers, or to produce them for examination, or to disclose their addresses, except to say that one of them was in Plainfield, N. J. Under these circumstances an order was made staying all proceedings on the part of defendant pending the production and examination of said officers. This order was m\u00e1de on notice, and was in full force and effect when the motion to vacate the order of examination was made. That motion was certainly a proceeding in the action, and as such was forbidden to be taken. On this ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>alone, without considering any other question (upon which we express no opinion), the motion to vacate should not have been entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
