The plaintiff states facts, and then asks for relief which presents two aspects, but which is based upon the same facts, viz., the unlawful appropriation of plaintiff\u2019s property. Whether or not he would be entitled to all or any of the relief asked for must be determined on the trial. But we do not think that two causes of action are stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
