The bond was given pursuant to the provisions of section 686 of the charter, and the action thereon is authorized and regulated by the provisions of section 687 of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">It was charged that Levin threatened to abandon and had abandoned his wife and children without adequate support, and that they' were in danger of becoming a burden on the public; and on being convicted thereon, it was duly adjudged that for a period of one year from the 9th day of February, 1909, he pay to the commissioner of public charities the sum of $20 weekly for and towards the support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>of his wife and children. The bond upon which the action is based was conditioned for the payment of said amount weekly to said commissioner \u201cfor and towards the support\u201d of the wife and children of Levin. The action was for three weekly installments, but on the trial it appeared that Levin had paid $15 on account thereof. It is conceded that the judgment was erroneously entered for the full amount of $60, whereas it should have been for only $45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The appellants attempt to present for decision the question as to whether payment to the wife of the amount required by the order of the magistrate, and to secure payment of which the bond was given, instead of to the commissioner, would be a defense to the action, in view of the amendment to said section 687 made by chapter 357 of the Laws of 1908, which, so far as material to the question, provides that it shall not be necessary to prove the payment of money by the commissioner for the support of the wife, or wife and children, but that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-5\">\u201cthe neglect to pay the sum ordered to be paid by competent authority for the support of the wife or children shall be a breach of the undertaking and the measure of damages shall be the sum ordered to be paid and which was withheld' at the time of the commencement of the action with interest thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Doubtless the payment to the wife for her support, or the support of herself and children, of the full amount required by the magistrate, and' as required, would be a complete defense to an action on the bond, and payment in part would be a partial defense; but the determination of the magistrate with respect to the amount required for that purpose is not open to inquiry on an action on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">The appellant Levin was permitted to express an opinion to the effect that $15 was sufficient for the support of his wife and children and to state that he had \u201cprovided for her.\u201d As already observed, the amount required to be paid was not- open to review in this action, and his statement that he had provided for his wife is not a statement of fact, but a conclusion, and was properly stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">It follows, therefore, that the determination should be modified, so as to direct that the judgment be reduced to $57, including costs, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
