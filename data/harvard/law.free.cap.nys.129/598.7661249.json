When the action was at issue, the plaintiff moved for an open commission to take the testimony of two witnesses, Walter Garlick and Adam Schaad.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">The affidavit accompanying the notice of motion states that the witnesses are necessary and material, that they reside in the state.of New Jersey, and that they were, respectively, the superintendent and assistant superintendent at the defendant\u2019s factory at the time of the accident. There is no specific allegation that at the time of the application for a commission they, or either of them, were not within this state, as required by sections 887 and 894 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The necessity of compliance with this provision of the Code has been often adjudged. See Matter of Adams, 31 App. Div. 298,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>52 N. Y.
