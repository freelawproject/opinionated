Laws 1869, c. 888, and the acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto. Commissioners were appointed, who repotted that it was necessary to drain the lands described in the petition, that the outlet of the pond described therein, and located upon the lands of Luise C. Knauth, should be deepened and cleared out, and that the dam of said pond should be removed, so as to permit the free passage of water therefrom. Luise C. Knauth appealed to the County Court of Rockland county from the determination of the commissioners, which affirmed the same. From such order of affirmance, she has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the decision of the commissioners, and the order of the County Court confirming the same, are contrary to the weight of the evidence. We have no jurisdiction to pass upon this question. Laws 1886, c. 636, \u00a7 9; Laws 1909, c. 20 (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 15) \u00a7 39; In re Ryers, 72 N. Y. 1, 28 Am. Rep. 88; In re Swan, 97 N. Y. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">None of the exceptions to rulings upon questions of evidence merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
