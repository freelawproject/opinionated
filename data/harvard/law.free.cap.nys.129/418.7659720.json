The house is a five-story tenement building, No. 221 East 113th street, borough of Manhattan, city of New . York, with apartments for two families on a floor. The accident occurred on the morning of the 12th day of December, 1910. The plaintiff, a tenant on the second floor, was in the toilet in his apartment. While there the plaster ceiling, about 1 <em>y2 </em>square yards, fell on the back of the plaintiff\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony is that he talked to the housekeeper about this toilet about the 30th of November\u2014\u201ctold her that it rained in; was wet in the toilet; the floor was wet; \u2018it is raining in,\u2019 and the house- . keeper said, T will see that that be fixed,\u2019 and it was not fixed.\u201d Plaintiff explains what he means by \u201craining in\u201d by stating, \u201cWhen it rained, the water remained on the wall,\u201d and in reply to the questions: \u201cWhereabouts was this water raining? From where did it come? From what part?\u201d says, \u201cFrom the roof,\u201d and again, \u201cFrom the leak * * * in the corner where the pipe is,\u201d apparently referring to a water pipe which ran from the top to the bottom of the house and through this toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">Another tenant on the same floor testified to a conversation she overheard between plaintiff and the janitor, when the plaintiff was complaining about the pipe\u2014\u201cthe leak in the pipe.\u201d A Mrs. Garcewich, presumably plaintiff\u2019s wife, was doing the talking. \u201cShe told her [the janitor] about the toilet, that it was raining in, and Mrs. McMann [the janitor] gave her to understand that the leader of the pipe was broken; that it was to be attended to; she would have it fixed,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The plaintiff lived on the - second floor; three stories intervening between his apartment and the roof. That this accident, therefore, could have been caused by a defective roof is hardly probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The conversation testified to between Mrs. Garcewich and the janitor is not legal proof as to a defect in the water pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">'[2] There is no duty resting upon a landlord to repair, or to keep in repair and in tenantable condition, demised premises, except such as may be created by the agreement of the landlord so to do. Witty v. Matthews, 52 N. Y. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The plaintiff has failed to show any such agreement on the part of the landlord, nor does plaintiff bring himself within the exception to the above rule, viz., that the injuries inflicted were due to the negligence of the landlord in keeping in proper repair the part of the premises over which he reserved control.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
