This defense was duly pleaded by defendant; and plaintiff admits that the tax was not paid. He does claim, and offfered to show on the trial, that the omission to pay the tax was on his part inadvertent, and due to ignorance that such tax was required to be paid, and was without any intention of evading the provisions of the law. This evidence was excluded, and plaintiff duly excepted. It seems also to have been conceded that, after the commencement of the action, plaintiff went to the secretary of the corporation with the requisite amount of stamps to pay the tax and offered to affix them. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court directed a verdict for defendant, and plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">Plaintiff urges that his transfer of stock to defendant was not immoral, nor illegal, except only so far as it was by the statute made so by reason of his failure to pay the tax, and that no intention of the Legislature to penalize by a forfeiture of one\u2019s property an unwitting violation of the statute should be imputed without convincing evidence of such intention. The Eirst Department has considered the effect of this statute and its application to an action to enforce a claim based upon a transfer of stock upon which the required tax had not been paid. Bean v. Flint, 138 App. Div. 846, 123 N. Y. Supp. 385. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>case Miller,' J., after reciting the provisions of the statute in question, continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-3\">\u201cIt will be observed that the statute radically differs from those under which it has been held permissible to validate the transfer by subsequently affixing stamps. This statute not only omits to provide for doing that, but distinctly provides that the transfer shall not be made the basis of any action, or legal proceedings, unless the tax is paid \u2018at the time of such transfer.\u2019 The payment of the tax might easily be evaded, if a\" transfer could be rendered valid by subsequently affixing stamps, and so by language, which does not admit of construction, the Legislature has provided as stated. We think, therefore, that the failure to pay the tax and affix stamps at the time of the transfer is fatal to plaintiff's right of recovery, provided the question is before us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">It is true that in this case it was held that defendant was not entitled to the benefit of this defense; but this resulted solely because of his failure to plead it. It is apparent that the effect of such a defense, if properly pleaded, was not only carefully considered by the court, but was directly passed upon, and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> That uniformity of decision in this court may be fostered, if for no\" other reason, this branch of the court should, even in a doubtful case, accept as controlling the previous unanimous decision in another department, which is not otherwise authoritatively questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Plaintiff\u2019s further claim that this provision of the statute is unconstitutional, if it precludes him from recovering upon his contract when he pays the tax, which he has failed to pay only through inadvertence, it being, as is claimed, in effect a forfeiture of his property and a taking thereof without due process of law, does not seem to be tenable. The effect of the statute is not to impose upon the offender, who violates its provisions, either intentionally, or through ignorance, forfeiture of property; but is rather to deny to him the right to enforce by the power of the courts of the state a contract, which he, by his own omission or neglect, has made unenforceable. Like a contract made in this state by a foreign stock corporation, which is doing business in this state without having filed the required statutory certificate, the contract itself may not be invalid; but enforcement of it in the courts of this state cannot be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled and judgment ordered for defendant on the directed verdict, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
