Y., and by a contract negotiated and made in the city of Rochester, N. Y., it rented to the defendant certain films, to be delivered to and used by her at her theater in the latter city. The action is on an assigned claim for rent of films, alleged to be due and owing under said contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">The defense interposed is that the films on which rental is claimed to be due were found on delivery not to be according to the contract, and were returned, and that the contract was on that ground rescinded. The terms of the contract, which was negotiated and made in Monroe county and to be performed there, as well as the performance thereof, are controverted. On conflicting affidavits with respect to the convenience of the material witnesses these are deemed important conditions, and on the facts here presented require that the place of trial should be changed to Monroe county.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
