The dismissal was upon the ground that plaintiff had failed to prove a cause of action, in that he had not proven his employment by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There is sufficient evidence of employment to require proof on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff testified: That the defendant asked him what his commission on exchange of properties would be. He told her 2 per cent. She not only expressed no dissent, but said she had generally had to pay 2% per cent. She asked plaintiff several times to keep Mr. Robbins interested in her house, which he did. She told Robbins, in plaintiff\u2019s presence, during the negotiations, that she had to give plaintiff $300 commissions, and after the transfer was effected she offered to pay him $125 for his services. It was not until after the contract had been signed, and the rights of the parties fixed, that defendant expressed any intention of not paying commissions to plaintiff. While it appears that Robbins, the other party to the exchange, had offered to give the plaintiff $150 commissions, it does not appear that he accepted or received it. Plaintiff testified that he told defendant of this offer. [2] There is no defense of a double commission. Such question was not raised on the trial. Defendant cannot be permitted to raise the question for the first time on appeal. Duryee v. Lester, 75 N. Y. 442; Abel v. Disbrow, 15 App. Div. 536, 44 N. Y. Supp. 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I think the exception to the rulings of the court sustaining respondent\u2019s objections to questions as to whether the witness heard certain conversations over the telephone, whether such a conversation took place, and whether in such conversation the defendant said anything about her business with plaintiff, presents reversible error. The witness was asked as to her personal knowledge and what she heard, which was clearly competent. . The weight to be given her testimony in this respect is another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">THOMAS, CARR, and WOODWARD, JJ\u201e concur. JENKS, J., concurs, on first ground stated in opiniop.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
