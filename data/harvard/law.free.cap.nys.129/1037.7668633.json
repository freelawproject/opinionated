Section 1353 of the Code of Civil Procedure especially requires that an appeal from a final judgment must be heard upon a certified copy of the notice of appeal, of the judgment roll, and of the case or notice of exceptions, if any, filed as prescribed by law or the general rules of practice. Under this section the respondents are entitled as a matter of right to have the entire judgment roll before the court on the hearing of the appeal. In this case it is stated that there.are several appeals from the judgment by different defendants. These appeals should all be consolidated and heard upon one record, so that the questions can be disposed of at- one time. Of course, if the parties consent, portions_ of the judgment roll not pertinent to the several appeals can be eliminated from the record on which the appeal is to be heard; but without such consent the whole judgment roll to be printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The motion is therefore denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
