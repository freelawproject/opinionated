Levy has not sold the property, nor does he require it for building purposes; but on December 2, 1910, he entered into an agreement with the American Bill Posting Company, giving to it similar privileges, and upon December 9th tendered to the Borough Bill Posting Company \u00a73.85, which was stated to be the rebate for unexpired time for fence privilege, and notified it in writing that he revoked the advertising privilege granted to it. Thereafter, and on January 6, 1911, Levy and the American Bill Posting Company tore down plaintiff\u2019s signs and billboards, and the American Bill Posting Company proceeded to erect a fence and signboards, which the Borough Bill Posting Company tore down. Each of the bill posting companies threatening to destroy the billboards and signs of the other, these two actions were commenced, and on the 14th of February, 1911, the court at Special Term, in the first above-entitled action, enjoined the defendants from interfering with the use of the fences, signs, or billboards of the Borough Bill Posting Company, the plaintiff in that action, and refused in the second above-entitled action the injunction which the American Bill Posting Company, the plaintiff therein, prayed for.

The Borough Bill Posting Company contends that, if not a lease for a definite term, the instrument constituted a personal contract between the parties thereto, and, because an action for damages affords inadequate remedy, it may come into equity for a specific performance thereof. Beer v. Canary, 2 App. Div. 518, 38 N. Y. Supp. 23; Goldman v. New York Advertising Co., 29 Misc. Rep. 133, 60 N. Y. Supp. 275. This seems to have been the view adopted by the learned judge at Special Term. There may be difficulty in maintaining this position, due to the fact that in-its action the Borough Bill Posting Company is seeking relief in effect by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>way of specific performance, and as an incident thereto by way of injunction, against one not a party to the contract; and if the contract is simply a personal one, and not one which establishes some interest in the land, it is seeking relief against one who is not a privy to either of the parties thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Conceding that the instrument in question is not a lease, we think that it is more than a paroi license, and that it gives to the Borough Bill Posting Company an easement in gross for one year from the date thereof, which is irrevocable during the period specified.

Whitney, supra, plaintiff sued to recover damages for the overflowing of his lands by the erection of a dam by the defendant. Among other defenses, defendant claimed a paroi license from plaintiff. A verdict for defendant was sustained upon other grounds; but in the course of the opinion Chief Judge Savage, in attempting to draw the distinction between a license and an easement or a lease, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">\u201cIf A. agrees with B. that he may enter upon his land, and occupy it for a year, that is not, properly speaking, a license merely; it is more\u2014it is a lease. ' * * * Where an interest greater than a temporary occupation was to be created, it might be an easement, as a right of way; such an easement is, or may be, a permanent interest in the land over which the right of way exists, and must be founded upon grant or prescription, which supposes a grant. Such an interest is not properly a license; it may be assigned, and cannot be revoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">In Cook v. Stearns, 11 Mass. 536, quoted with approval in Mumford v. Whitney, supra,'the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">\u201cLicenses to do a particular act do not in any degree trench upon the policy of the law which requires that bargains respecting the title or interest in real estate shall be by deed or in writing. They amount to nothing more than an excuse for the act, which would otherwise be a trespass. But a permanent right to hold another\u2019s land for a particular purpose, and to enter upon it at all times without his consent, is an important interest, which ought not to pass without writing, and is the very object provided for by our statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">\u25a0\u201cLicenses, which in their nature amount to the granting of an estate <em>for ever so short a </em>time, are not good without deed.\u201d The reason for the rule is that they are not, strictly speaking, licenses, but conveyances of an interest in the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">That the word \u201cpermanent\u201d is here used, not in the sense of perpetual, but- as relating to some specified period, be it short or long, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>is asserted in Cook v. Stearns, supra, and made clear in the case of Pierrepont v. Barnard, 6 N. Y. 279, 288. In that case, in illustrating the difference between an easement and a license, the court says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThe marked and leading distinctions between them are that in the former there .is a permanent interest in the land <em>for some specified period, </em>amounting to an estate in the land, which is assignable, is irrevocable, and gives a right at all times to enter and remain in possession, during its continuance; while the latter is a mere authority to enter upon the land of another for a temporary purpose and to do a particular act or series of acts upon the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In Bagg v. Robinson, 12 Misc. Rep. 299, 304, 34 N. Y. Supp. 37, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cAn interest in land for a specified period is an \u2018easement\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In this case-we have an instrument which satisfies the requirements of the statute of frauds (Laws 1909, c. 52 [Consol. Laws, c. 50] \u00a7 242). Construing this instrument in the light of the foregoing authorities, it is apparent that the parties contemplated the one to grant and the other to receive a privilege which was to be continued for a definite period, to wit, one year, with a right of renewal, unless this privilege is sooner terminated by conditions which do not exist in this case. It contemplates a privilege which is not only specific but exclusive in its character, and authorizes the Borough Bill Posting Company, not only to make use of the fence or signboards to be located on the property therein described, but also the erection of other fences and signboards by it on said premises, which should remain its property, and which it should have the right to remove at the expiration of the period, and it necessarily involves the right to go upon the premises in question to accomplish each of these purposes. We think, therefore, that this is more than a license, that it is an easement, and, there being no dominant estate to which the easement might attach, it is an easement personal in its character, or, as it is sometimes called, an easement in gross. Although such an easement is a personal privilege, it is more than a revocable license. It confers an interest in the servient tenement which is at least an equitable charge or burden in favor of the grantee. Jones on Easements, \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The appellant the American Bill Posting Company relies upon three cases to support its contention that the effe'et of the instrument in question is to create a license only, revocable at will. None of these is sufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">In United Merchants\u2019 Realty &amp; Imp. Co. v. N. Y. Hippodrome, 133 App. Div. 582, 118 N. Y. Supp. 128, all that the court decided was that a privilege for a year to make use of the roof of plaintiff\u2019s building to display advertisements thereon did not create the conventional relation of landlord and tenant, so that failure to remove one of these signboards at the end of the term enabled the plaintiff as the owner of the building to treat defendant as a tenant holding over. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">\u201cWhatever may be said to be the relation between the parties during the continuance of the agreement, the fact that the defendant did not remove the bulletin board from the top of the plaintiff\u2019s building during the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>that the agreement was in force .was not a holding over of the premises \u25a0 which entitled the plaintiff to elect to continue the agreement for another year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\u2022 Reynolds v. Van Beuren, 155 N. Y. 120, 49 N. E. 763, 42 L. R. A. 129; was an action for damages by a person who, while passing along the street, was injured by a signboard blown from the roof of a building during a storm accompanied by a strong wind. It appeared that defendant did not erect the signboard, and was not responsible for its maintenance, but simply had the privilege of going upon the roof and placing advertisements thereon. Such a privilege was much narrower and' more restricted than the one in the case at bar. In determining that such an agreement between defendant and the owner of the building was not a lease, the court did say that it was a mere license. But in that case the court was concerned rather to consider defendant\u2019s responsibility to the injured party than to accurately define the character of the instrument in question, for, after speaking of it as a license, the court says that plaintiff cannot take advantage of its terms for the reason that he \u201cis a stranger to the agreement, <em>whatever it may he held to mean. </em>He is not a party or privy to it, and, if it be shown that the defendants failed to perform their agreement with the tenant, that does not prove that they have done any wrong to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In Lowell v. Strahan, 145 Mass. 1, 12 N. E. 401, 1 Am. St. Rep. 422, the court, in construing an authority given to a party, to affix a sign to the outer wall of a building, say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cAn agreement of this nature cannot be construed as a lease; it must create <em>either a license or an easement.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The court did not in that case determine which.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">In Goldman v. New York Advertising Co., supra, in construing an agreement giving defendant the right to place an advertisement upon the westerly wall of a house for a year, and holding that it was not liable in damages to the owner of the property for failing to erase the same, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cIt is unnecessary for the determination of this appeal to decide whether the paper here in question created a license or an easement, or was merely a simple contract between the parties. It is sufficient that it was not a lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">We think, therefore, that Joseph Levy, the owner of the premises,, had no right to revoke the privilege conferred upon the Borough Bill Posting Company during the period specified in the- agreement, and that the orders in each of the above-entitled cases should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">JENKS, P.
