But this would not justify the permission given by the fire commissioner, if it contravened the language or spirit of the statutes. I am unable, however, to find any provision of law cited by the-learned counsel for plaintiff in their carefully prepared brief which prohibits the granting of the permission heretofore given by the commissioner. The adequacy of the consideration therefor does not come before the court for-determination; nor do the acts complained of constitute a loaning or granting of property by the municipality to a private corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">In deciding that plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought, I do not determine that defendant corporation has any right to maintain the overhead wires which it concededly has strung. On the contrary, I believe them to be-maintained in clear violation of the law. But relief as to that situation cannot be given in this action upon the present state of the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Judgment in favor of defendants, with costs.
