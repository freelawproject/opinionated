The substantive law of California governs. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 1945, 326 U.S. 99, 108-109, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-27\">The claimed loss is alleged to have resulted from the rifling of appellee\u2019s cash box by a person or persons unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-28\">The insuring clauses of the policy include provision that: \u201cIf a loss is alleged to have been caused by the fraud or dishonesty of any one or more of the Employees and the Assured shall be unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>to designate the specific Employee or Employees causing such loss, the Assured shall nevertheless have the benefit of this Insuring Agreement, provided that the evidence submitted reasonably * * * establishes that the loss was in fact due to the fraud or dishonesty of one or more of said Employees * *</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Appellant denied appellee\u2019s claim under the quoted insuring clause and, following trial of the issue, the District Court found that \u201cthe evidence adduced reasonably establishes that [the loss] was due to the dishonesty of one or more * * * employees, rather than to the act of a stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The single ground asserted for reversal rests upon the contention that appellee failed to sustain \u201cthe burden * * to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an employee * * * was guilty of theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">This failure of proof is said to result from the fact that \u201ceach employee who was in any way connected with the moneys * * * testified unequivocally that he or she was not guilty of any dishonesty\u201d, and \u201cthat testimony is fortified by the strongest of all rebuttable presumptions, namely, that a person is innocent of crime * *</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Appellant concedes, however, that \u201ccircumstantial evidence may outweigh the strongest of disputable presumptions * * * and direct evidence as well.\u201d See Scott v. Burke, 1952, 39 Cal.2d 388, 398, 247 P.2d 313, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Appellee\u2019s loss being admitted, the sole question remaining for determination by the District Judge as trier of fact was whether one or more employees, rather than one or more strangers or outsiders, took the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Even if it could properly be assumed that the presumption of innocence is of probative force to be weighed in favor of a finding that none of the employees are guilty of the crime, the weight of it is exactly cancelled by the universal availability of the presumption to outsiders as well. See: Holt v. United States, 1910, 218 U.S. 245, 253, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021; Agnew v. United States, 1897, 165 U.S. 36, 49-50, 52, 17 S.Ct. 235, 41 L.Ed. 624; Coffin v. United States, 1895, 156 U.S. 432, 455-460, 15 S.Ct. 394, 39 L.Ed. 481; United States v. Nimerick, 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 464, 467-468, 152 A.L.R. 620, certiorari denied 1941, 313 U.S. 592, 61 S.Ct. 1117, 85 L.Ed. 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Thus the specific question becomes: whether the trial judge was clearly wrong in finding that the circumstantial evidence pointing to one or more of the employees outweighed the direct-evidence denials made by those employees who had ready access to the money. Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. rule 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">It is uncontradicted that the money in question, some $15,000 in currency, was: taken from a locked cash box, from a drawer of a locked desk, from the office of appellee\u2019s manager at Oakland Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">It is likewise uncbntradicted that neither doors nor windows of the building, or of the manager\u2019s office, nor the desk, nor the cash box, disclosed any evidence of forcible entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">However, the manager\u2019s secretary testified that after the loss occurred her father-in-law demonstrated to her that he was able to open the outer door of the building without a key; also that after the loss she learned for the first time that, the manager\u2019s desk drawer could be opened without a key. And the manager testified that \u201cafter the robbery\u201d he learned for the first time that there were \u201cother keys\u201d reposing in an unlocked drawer of a spare desk in appellee\u2019s outer office, which would fit the cash box in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">In the light of this testimony, it may simplify consideration if we view the case as if it were conceded that on the night of the loss both outsiders and employees had equal access to the missing currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">As the name indicates, appellee is engaged in the business of transporting passengers by air. Among other places, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>appellee maintains an office in a small building at Oakland Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The evidence discloses that during the period material here this office consisted of a single room with a dividing partition separating the front or outer office from the rear or manager\u2019s office. A door fronting on the airport street opens into the front office; there is a connecting door through the partition into the manager\u2019s office; and a rear door opening from the manager\u2019s office into a hangar.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The partition dividing the two offices, and the outer walls of the building as well, are of opaque construction from the floor up to less than waist height, and of translucent glass on up to the ceiling or roof. It was the practice to leave the inside lights on throughout the night, and this was done on the Friday night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Across the street is a 24-hour service station of a large oil company, always brightly lighted at night. It is undisputed that after dark the silhouetted movements of any person inside appellee\u2019s premises, including the manager\u2019s office to the rear, could readily be seen from the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The employees working out of appellee\u2019s office at Oakland Airport consisted of: (1) the manager, who was responsible for the safekeeping of the money; (2) the manager\u2019s secretary, who had worked with him for some years before employed by appellee; (3) the manager\u2019s brother-in-law, who was in charge of \u201cmeeting incoming aircraft and loading outbound aircraft\u201d; (4) a man in charge of selling tickets; and (5) the latter\u2019s brother, who worked only part time.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In 1953, on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, appellee had sold an unusually large number of tickets to mem bers of the Marine Corps on holiday leave. The total received was in excess of $15,000 in currency. At the close of Wednesday\u2019s business, the employee in charge of ticket sales delivered the cash box containing the money to the manager in the presence of his secretary. The next day, Thursday, was Thanksgiving Day, and of course a bank holiday.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">So unaccustomed was the Oakland office to handle such a large sum of money that early Wednesday evening the manager telephoned appellee\u2019s comptroller at the latter\u2019s home across the Continent in Arlington, Virginia, and inquired for instructions as to handling. According to the uncontradicted testimony of the comptroller, he and the manager \u201cdiscussed considerable alternate possibilities and * * * I instructed him to take the money to Western Union and purchase a Western Union money order for it, and have it sent to himself in order that he might complete his cash report at his leisure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The secretary took the money to the airport Western Union office but, upon learning that the cost of \u201cwiring\u201d the money would be \u201cin the neighborhood of $50\u201d, concluded to recommend to the manager that the comptroller's instructions be not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The secretary thereupon took the money to the manager, who had meantime gone into a nearby cocktail lounge. There the manager decided to follow his secretary\u2019s recommendation rather than the comptroller\u2019s instructions, and it was arranged to place the money in the safe of the \u201cTransocean Restaurant and Bar,\u201d and take a receipt for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">There the money remained until Friday morning, November 27th, when appellee\u2019s manager retrieved it from Transocean\u2019s safe and took it back to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Although the manager\u2019s secretary admittedly had on previous occasions deposited lesser sums to appellee\u2019s credit in a bank in neighboring Alameda, there is no evidence of any suggestion that any part of the $15,000 be so deposited on Friday, although the banks remained open throughout that day until six o\u2019clock in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">Late Friday afternoon the manager and the man in charge of ticket sales decided to spread the currency out on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the floor of the manager\u2019s office and count it. Meanwhile the secretary, who had been working on the cash report, left for the day around seven o\u2019clock Friday evening, while the manager and the ticket seller were \u201cstill in the process of counting money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Later Friday evening, after they had finished the count and had placed the money in the cash box and had locked the box, the manager and the ticket seller entered upon a discussion as to where they should place the cash box for safe keeping until the morrow. As to this the ticket seller testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cQ. And do.you recall what the substance of that conversation was, what he said and what you said? A. Well, I can generally, yes. The safe at Transocean was discussed again. * * * I suggested the safe in the gas station. which is right across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201cQ. \u25a0 What other suggestions did you make? A. Transocean, Trans-ocean Safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201cQ. Yes. And did * * * [the manager] make any comments or suggestions as to handling of the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asv\">\u201cA. He suggested that he could take it home with him, that he had a rather vicious dog at home, quite sure nobody would get near the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">\u201cQ! What was finally done with the cash box? A. It was placed in the middle right-hand drawer [of the manager\u2019s desk] and the drawer was locked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Further testimony of the ticket seller reveals that the manager presumably had the only available key to the desk, while the ticket seller presumably had the only available key to the cash box.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">The manager testified that after leaving Friday night in company with the ticket seller, he returned to his office, telephoned appellee\u2019s Washington office about some routine matter, then telephoned his wife and left, arriving home before ten. The next morning, Saturday, he went to his office as usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">The manager\u2019s brother-in-law testified! that at noon on Friday the manager \u201clet me have the rest of the day off, told me-to come back Saturday around noon.\u201d The ticket seller continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-18\">\u201cQ. Now, when did you next go back to that office ? A. The following morning about 11:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-19\">\u201cQ. That was Saturday morning, the 28th? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-20\">\u201cQ. Where did you live at that, time? A. In Berkeley. * * *'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-21\">\u201cQ. Had you plans, when you. left on Friday night, had you planned to return to work on. Saturday morning? A. I don\u2019t, think so. I don\u2019t think I had. I. couldn\u2019t answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-22\">\u201cQ. Do you recall why you went-over on Saturday morning? A.. Yes; because * * * [the secretary] called me about 10:30 and told! me to pick her up and take her to the-bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-23\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-24\">\u201cQ. Now, will you tell us what-happened after you got there at 11:30 that morning, as near as you. can recall? A. Well, as near as I can recall, they were working on the-cash report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-25\">\u201cQ. When you say \u2018they\u2019 were,, who do you mean? A. Well, * *\u2022 [the secretary] and I can\u2019t remember whether * * * [the manager] was at the time or not. * * *-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-26\">\u201cQ. And this was, oh, about. 11:30? A. Quarter of twelve.. And at 12:30, or approximately 12:30 it was decided to count the-cash again, and * * * [the manager] gave me the key to his desk: and * * * [his brother-in-law] at the time was working at * * *\" [the manager\u2019s] desk, or he was im the back office, and I remember I had trouble with * * * [the-manager\u2019s] key. Then * * *- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>[the brother-in-law] helped me. You have to open the center drawer before you can pull out the side drawers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cQ. Was the cash box locked when you took it out of the desk? A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201cQ. And you unlocked it? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">* * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201cQ. What was missing? A. The currency. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">\u201cQ. Well, was there anything left in the box? A. Coin and \u25a0checks, postal money orders, checks. <em>\u00bb </em>if *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-16\">\u201cQ. When you discovered that, I understand * * * [the secretary] was in the room, * * * [the manager] was in the room, and * * * [the manager\u2019s brother-in-law] was in the room? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-18\">\u201cQ. What did you say when you saw this money missing? A. I can\u2019t remember * * * I know I said something; it was something pertaining to * * * [the manager]. I thought he had taken it home with him, you see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-19\">\u201cQ. And you recall * * * \u2019[the manager] saying anything ? A. Well, not now. He said something -* * * \u2018You\u2019re joking, you\u2019re kidding,\u2019 or something along those lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-21\">As to the highlights of that Saturday morning, the secretary testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-22\">\u201cQ. And what was the reason for calling him [the ticket seller] ? A. I wanted an escort to the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-24\">\u201cQ. You knew he lived in Berkeley, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-25\">\u201cQ. That is a considerable distance from the Oakland Airport? A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-26\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-27\">\u201cQ. While you and * * * [the manager] were in that office \u00a1Saturday morning, did * * * [he] ask you to go and see if the cash box was in his desk? A. Yes, sir; he did * * *. [The manager] handed me the keys to his desk, said, * * * \u2018will you please check and see if the cash box is still in the desk.\u2019 I went to the desk, looked at the box, locked it and returned the keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t take that cash box out of the desk? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-28\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-29\">\u201cQ. * * * And where was the cash box opened up? A. As I recall, there was some difficulty in opening the desk at the time, so * * [the manager\u2019s brother-in-law] went over to * * * [the ticket seller] and helped him open the desk. Then they both brought the cash box into the front office and * * * [the ticket seller] had the key to the cash box, so he opened it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-31\">\u201cQ. Now do you remember, can you remember if he said anything when he opened that cash box and looked in it? A. Yes, sir, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-32\">\u201cQ. What did he say? A. \u2018All right * * * where is the money?\u2019 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-33\">\u201cQ. Do you recall if * * * [the manager] said anything in respect to this statement of * * * [the ticket seller] ? A. * * * He had just turned absolutely gray. He said, \u2018It should be in there.\u2019 And then \u2014 No, wait a minute. I can recall he said, \u2018You are kidding.\u2019 And * * * [the manager] just turned gray.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-35\">Against the uncontradicted direct evidence given by the employees there stands only an inference \u2014 a deduction or conclusion which reason and common sense lead the trier to draw from facts which have been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-36\">After hearing the witnesses, viewing their demeanor and manner, the able and experienced trial judge drew the inference which led him to find: \u201cthe evidence adduced reasonably establishes that [the loss] was due to the dishonesty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>of one or more * .* * employees * * * <em>99</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">As stated at the outset, we have considered the case as if both outsiders and employees had equal access to the missing currency on the night of the loss. That assumption refers of course to physical accessibility, and not to knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">While the fact that appellee did an abnormally large cash business on Wednesday may have been known to outsiders, only the employees presumably had knowledge that the proceeds were not banked in the normal course of business on Friday, but were kept in the office in defiance of the comptroller\u2019s instructions, to be spread out on the floor and counted again, and then left for the night in the manager\u2019s desk drawer. With banks closed for the week-end at 6 o\u2019clock on Friday, it is reasonable to infer that a stranger would hardly expect to find a full cash box in a drawer of the manager\u2019s desk on Friday night or Saturday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Rule 52 directs that: \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.Proc., rule 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Accordingly it is settled that a finding will not be held \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d unless \u201c \u2018the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 1952, 343 U.S. 326, 339, 72 S.Ct. 690, 698, 96 L.Ed. 978; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 1948, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">A careful review of the entire record at bar leaves us with the conviction that the challenged finding of the learned District Judge was far from clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
