One is that the evidence of plaintiff does not make out a case of losses by theft but only one of losses from swindling and that the invoked section contains no provision for deducting these. Another is that in the act of parting with his money, \u2022 plaintiff Bromberg was himself a party to, and engaged in, a swindling scheme, and that recovery is forbidden by considerations of public policy, as well as the consideration that a suit for moneys wrongfully had and received through a wrongful tax exaction is based upon equitable principles and equity will \u2022not aid a swindler. A third point not made below is that the taxpayer had the burden and made no attempt to discharge it, of showing that he had tried to and could not recover his losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-18\">.The taxpayer meets each of these grounds head on with the insistence that none of them is well taken. In addition he asserts of the third that, not made below, it may not be made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-19\">For the reasons hereafter stated, we agree with taxpayer throughout. We reject appellant\u2019s first claim that the loss was not within the theft deduction provided by Sec. 23(e) on reason and on authority. We reject it on-reason because the word \u201ctheft\u201d is not like \u201clarceny\u201d, a technical word of art with a narrowly defined meaning but is, on the contrary, a word of general and broad connotation, intended to cover and covering any criminal appropriation of another\u2019s property to the use of the taker, particularly including theft by swindling, false pretenses, and any other form of guile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject the contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>on the authority of Alison v. United States, 344 U.S. 167, 73 S.Ct. 191, 97 L.Ed. 186, holding that theft includes embezzlement, and of Morris Plan Co. v. Commissioner, 42 B.T.A. 1190; Muncie v. Commissioner, 18 T.C. 849; Miller v. Commissioner, 19 T.C. 1046; Earle v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 366; and Borden v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 44. In fact there are no decisions to the contrary. Under this line of decisions it has been long and well established that whether a loss from theft occurs within the purview of Section 23(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the corresponding provisions of prior acts, depends upon the law of the jurisdiction where it was sustained and that the exact nature of the crime, whether larceny or embezzlement, of obtaining money under false pretenses, swindling or other wrongful deprivations of the property of another, is of little importance so long as it amounts to theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"> His second point is, we think, equally without merit for the reason given by the district judge, that there was in reality no scheme to defraud others to which taxpayer was a party. There was only the fraudulent pretense of Goldberg, the thief, that there was and the use of that fraudulent pretense to obtain custody and control of taxpayer\u2019s money ostensibly as agent or joint adventurer with him but really with the purpose, which was later given effect, of depriving the taxpayer of it by felonious appropriation to his own use. In Akers v. Scofield, 5 Cir., 167 F.2d 718, we held that a swindler could not claim that the title to money he obtained by theft and false pretenses had not passed to him so as to make the money taxable to him as income, just as it was held as to Goldberg that he was liable for income taxes on the money he obtained from the taxpayer in this case. That case does not at all support, it does not even deal with appellant\u2019s contention here, that because of taxpayer\u2019s acceptance of and willingness to go along with Goldberg\u2019s proposition, the taxpayer is deprived of the deduction which without qualification the statute affords him. The argument advanced by the collector, based upon the claim that public policy defeats the deductions, we think is Pecksniffian. The United States, recognizing the transaction as resulting in income to the thief prosecuted him criminally for failing to report the money obtained thereby. It would, we think, be illogical in the extreme to deny the taxpayer the right to claim a deduction with respect to the money which the government taxed to Goldberg as his income and for the nonpayment of income taxes on which it prosecuted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Finally, we are in <em>no </em>doubt that taxpayer is right with respect to the third point, that in order for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for a loss from theft, he must show that he has made an effort to and cannot obtain restitution. The statute makes no such requirement, and when the nature of the matter dealt with, thieving and thievery, is considered, it seems clear, we think, that only if there were a specific provision imposing this requirement, would a court be authorized to hold that it exists. Cf. Earle v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">.

Representing himself <em>to </em>be the son of Ben Jones, the Calumet stables trainer, Goldberg induced the plaintiff to send him various sums to be added to a pool which was to be bet on a benefit race, the winner of which was allegedly predetermined. According to Goldberg\u2019s misrepresentation, the race was being run for the benefit of the widow of a Calumet jockey who had recently drowned. The plaintiff was told that a $200,000 pot would be wagered at odds of 15 to 1 and the jockey\u2019s widow would receive most of the winnings, with the balance to be divided among the contributors. Goldberg represented that the race was being run with the permission of the State Racing Commission. In fact, all of the representations of Goldberg were false. No such race was planned or held, nor was the money ever wagered. It was retained by Goldberg for his own personal use. The plaintiff was misled by these misrepresentations and would not have parted with his money but for the misrepresentations. The plaintiff has not been reimbursed for any of these losses by insurance or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\u201cDuring August, 1948, plaintiff sent Goldberg, or others acting for him, sums equalling $10,000, which plaintiff understood were to be wagered on a race, lie was later informed that the money was lost. It does not appear whether there was such a race or whether the money was actually wagered. The evidence, however, does disclose that the plaintiff would not have sent Goldberg $10,000 except for his mistaken belief that he was dealing with \u2018Jimmy Jones\u2019 whom he felt to be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">\u201cIn Sept., 1948, Goldberg, as \u2018Jimmy Jones\u2019 misrepresented to plaintiff that he was starting a new pool to be wagered on a \u2018fixed\u2019 race. Relying on this misrepresentation the plaintiff sent Goldberg $2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">\u201cIn January, 1949, plaintiff, again relying on misrepresentations of Goldberg, sent Goldberg $550. Plaintiff had received tips on two races in return for one-half his winnings. The plaintiff did not make the bets and it developed that had such bets been made, plaintiff would have won $2,000. Goldberg told plaintiff he had paid two jockeys $550 to insure this victory. Plaintiff reimbursed Goldberg the $550 in order to settle the $1,000 claim by Goldbei'g. It is not clear from the evidence whether or not Goldberg paid the jockeys but there is ample evidence to the effect that the plaintiff would not have sent the money but for the misrepresentation of his identity by Goldberg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">\u201cIn January, 1949, Goldberg, again representing himself as Jones, requested Plaintiff to send him $1000 to purchase a car, so that he might travel to Miami where he hoped to recoup Plaintiff\u2019s losses for him. Relying on the misrepresentation, plaintiff sent Goldberg $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">\u201cAll of the aforesaid transactions wore part of a swindle by Samuel Goldberg and resulted in losses by the plaintiff, none of which have been reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">\u201cNo actual scheme for fixing races ever existed. The plaintiff was not a part of or co-conspirator in an actual scheme which could be said to contravene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sharply defined public policy of the State or Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"AsU\">\u201cIn 1949 the plaintiffs received $450 in dividends from Federal Savings &amp; Loan Associations. These dividends were paid to plaintiffs on account of deposits made by them prior to March 28; 1942.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u201cConclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"AuE\">\u201cThe Court has jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"Ame\">\u201cExhibits Nos. 23 to 29, 38 to 40, which were offered at the trial, were admissible in evidence and have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">'-\u2018The losses sustained by the plaintiffs constituted losses from theft under the law of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"AanU\">\u201cThe losses resulting from theft were properly,deductible under Sec. 23(e) (3) of the .Internal Revenue Code, of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">\u201cThere is no.provision in Sec. 23(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code which would permit .disallowance of a deduction on the gr.ound that its allowance would frustrate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u201cThe dividends received from Federal Savings &amp; Loan Associations were not taxable income to the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-16\">.This accords with the definition in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary and in Vol. 3, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawles Third Revision, 3267, as \u201ca popular term for larceny. It is a wider term than larceny and includes other forms of wrongful deprivation of property of another * * * acts constituting embezzlement or swindling may be properly so called.\u201d Of. Vol. 41, Words and Phrases, Theft, pp. 480 to 486. Many authorities are collected showing that the term \u201ctheft\u201d has wide meaning, including the obtaining of property by swindling, false pretenses and other tricks. See also the great number of cases to the same effect in the Cumulative Pocket Part. In Cox v. World Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., Mo.App., 239 S.W.2d 538, 540, it is said: \u201c \u2018Theft\u2019 \u201d is an \u201c \u2018Act of stealing; * * * the felonious taking and removing of personal property, with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it; # * \u2018A popular term for larceny [but] a wider term than larceny and includes other forms of wrongful deprivation of property of another [such as] embezzlement or swindling.\u2019 \u201d In People v. Jones, 36 Cal.2d 373, 224 P.2d 353, 355: \u201cCrimes of larceny, embezzlement, obtaining money by false pretenses and kindred offenses are now all included under the designation of theft, * * * but the elements of the several offenses have not been changed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-9\">RIVES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AfD\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">In permitting the deduction of losses from \u201ctheft\u201d, I.R.C.1939, Sec. 23(e) (3), I.R.C.1954, Sec. 165(c) (3) and (e), I do not think that Congress intended to make the inquiry so broad as to include all forms of dishonesty, cheating, and swindling. See 41 Words and Phrases, Theft, p. 480 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The taxpayer turned over the money to Goldberg for the purpose and with the intent that it should be used to defraud other persons who might bet their money upon horses in ignorance of the fact that the races had been fixed. Now when he finds that, instead of defrauding others, he himself is the party defrauded, he is in no position to call on the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>to bear a part of his loss. Stone v. White, 301 U.S. 532, 534, 57 S.Ct. 851, 81 L.Ed. 1265; Commissioner v.
