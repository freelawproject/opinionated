They brought this suit in the District Court to enjoin the National Labor Relations Board from certifying the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers of America, C. I. 0., as bargaining representative for a unit of the Company\u2019s employees. The complaint alleges that the Union and the employer entered into a \u201cStipulation for Certification upon Consent Election\u201d; that a Board representative insisted that they also agree upon the list of employees included within the bargaining unit and therefore eligible to vote; that the employer\u2019s attorney, relying on the Union agent\u2019s representation that he was familiar with the duties of the various employees, agreed that appellants DePratter, Tra\u00edna, Mobley and Diaz were not eligible and as a result they either did not attempt to vote or were turned away when they attempted to do so; that appellant Miller\u2019s vote was challenged by a Union observer and not counted; that out of 114 votes cast at the election, there were 58 votes for the Union, 55 votes against the Union and one vote challenged; that since all five appellants wished to vote against the Union, the Board\u2019s denial of their right to vote \u201cas provided by law and the Constitution of the United States\u201d was \u201cillegal and arbitrary action\u201d which resulted in the election of the Union as exclusive bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the court is without jurisdiction (1) to review a representation proceeding under \u00a7 9 of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">In connection with the latter ground, the following is pertinent. Before instituting this suit, appellants DePratter, Mobley, Tra\u00edna and Diaz filed a motion to intervene in the representation proceedings before the Board so that they might join the employer in objecting to the Regional Director\u2019s recommendation. The Regional Director had recommended that these appellants be held ineligible to vote since they were excluded from the bargaining unit agreed to by the employer and the Union. This suit, however, was begun without awaiting the Board\u2019s decision thereon. It was not until after the District Court had dismissed this action that the Board rendered its decision. It permitted intervention but concluded that the agreement of the employer and the Union to exclude the intervenors from the bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>gaining unit was controlling with respect to appellants\u2019 right to vote in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We need not decide whether appellants\u2019 failure to exhaust their administrative remedy before institution of this suit requires affirmance of the dismissal below, since it is clear in any event that the District Court is without jurisdiction to review the instant \u00a7 9 representation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The judicial review provisions of the National Labor Relations Act do not extend to such proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before we can decide whether these proceedings are reviewable in an original equity suit in the District Court, there must be a showing \u201cof unlawful action by the Board and resulting injury * * * by way of departure from statutory requirements or from those of due process.\u201d Inland Empire District Council, etc. v. Millis, 1945, 325 U.S. 697, 700, 65 S.Ct. 1316, 1318, 89 L.Ed. 1877. We think no such showing has been made here. Unlike Farmer v. United Electrical Workers, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 178, 211 F.2d 36, certiorari denied, 1954, 347 U.S. 943, 74 S.Ct. 638, 98 L.Ed. 1091, it cannot be said that the Board\u2019s action \u2014 here a determination of the appropriate bargaining unit \u2014 was \u201cplainly beyond the scope of [its] statutory authority * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contrary is true. The unit resulting from the Board\u2019s action consists of employees who work full time at production work and excludes employees who \u2014 like at least four of the appellants \u2014 spend part of their time at production work and part at other tasks. It is within the Board\u2019s discretion to approve such a unit in a consent election.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">The judgment of the District Court dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-15\">. 49 Stat. 453 (1935), as amended, 61 Stat. 143 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">.
