Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was denied. Upon his plea of not guilty he was tried before the court without a jury and found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Appellant was fined $100.00 and sentenced to imprisonment for one month. This appeal was taken from that judgment and sentence thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The indictment charged a refusal by appellant to answer a pertinent Committee question concerning where he was then employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">At the Committee hearing its counsel asked appellant, \u201cWhere are you employed ?\u201d It was a refusal to answer this question that became the basis of the indictment. After some colloquy between Committee members and appellant (in which counsel for the Committee and appellant also joined) appellant stated he would not answer as the Committee \u201cis already fully aware of where I am employed.\u201d Appellant then added that he would not be \u201ca party to dragging my employer into this smear campaign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Upon being asked the question again, and being directed to answer, appellant replied, \u201cI am going to decline to answer that question on the grounds of my rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Appellant was then asked, \u201cAre you employed at the Illinois Glass Co., 601 36th Avenue, Oakland, so that the record will state correctly?\u201d To this question appellant replied, \u201cSame answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">Counsel for the Committee then asked, \u201cYou feel that to answer \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 to that question would incriminate you?\u201d Appellant replied that he was guilty of no crime, that he had nothing to fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">The Chairman of the Committee then asked appellant why, if he had committed no crime, \u201cyou should feel that you are entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment * * * ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">Upon his continued effort to explain his reliance upon the Fifth Amendment, appellant was informed, \u201cThere is no question before the witness.\u201d Immediately thereafter, appellant was asked, \u201cHave you ever been a member of the Communist Party \u2014 Political Affairs Committee of Alameda County ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">Since the conviction and sentence of appellant by the lower court, the Supreme Court of the United States in Quinn v. United States, 1955, 349 U.S. 155, 75 S.Ct. 668, 99 L.Ed. 964, and in two eases decided the same day, Emspak v. United States, 1955, 349 U.S. 190, 75 S.Ct. 687, 99 L.Ed. 997; Bart v. United States, 1955, 349 U.S. 219, 75 S.Ct. 712, 99 L.Ed. 1016, has held that when a witness before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>a committee refuses to answer a question and adequately indicates to the committee that his refusal to answer is based upon the privilege against self-incrimination, then in order to lay a foundation for a prosecution the committee must \u201coverrule\u201d the claim of privilege based upon the Fifth Amendment and specifically direct the witness to answer the question. To use the Court\u2019s own language, \u201cIn short, unless the witness is clearly apprised that the committee <em>demands </em>his answer notwithstanding his objections, there can be no conviction under \u00a7 192 for refusal to answer that question.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Quinn v. United States, supra, 349 U.S. at page 166, 75 S.Ct. at page 675; Jackins v. United States, 9 Cir., 231 F.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">We believe that Quinn v. United States, supra, requires a reversal of this conviction as it appears that the Committee did not indicate its refusal to accept the claim of privilege against self-incrimination, and did not \u201cdemand\u201d that the witness answer the question. Rather, the Committee seems to have abandoned the question and proceeded to inquire about other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Believing as we do that the Quinn decision, supra, requires a reversal it is not necessary to discuss or decide other contentions of appellee that appellant was not entitled to the privilege; that the question was innocent on its face; that appellant failed to justify his refusal to answer; that appellant waived the privilege, and that the appellant claimed the privilege as \u201ca pure afterthought\u201d to his other reasons for refusing to answer. These contentions were advanced as additional reasons for affirming the judgment of the lower court. Whether these contentions are right or wrong can make no difference in disposing of this case since the Committee did not \u201cdemand\u201d that appellant answer the above noted question following his refusal \u201cto answer * * * on the grounds of my rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The judgment is reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
