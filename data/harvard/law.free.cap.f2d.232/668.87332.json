More accurately, it is whether the public Treasury shall be required to pay since the cost, including litigation expense, if imposed, is fully reimbursable, Powell v. United States Cartridge Co., 339 U.S. 497, 70 S.Ct. 755, 94 L.Ed. 1017. The case, which otherwise presents many complex, important additional matters of partial or complete defense not reached or passed on <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> comes down to this because, in our judgment, it turns on the good faith escape provisions of the Portal-to-Portal Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Since the District Court held<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this defense was not made out, we must examine the evidence in some detail. Work under the construction contract began April-May 1942 and was completed April 6, 1943. Actual operations of the Advance Base Depot under the Management and Operating Contract began July 1, 1942. Only the period from July 8, 1942, to August 1943 is involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Responsibility for such construction projects was in the Bureau of Yards and Docks which, acting for the Secretary of the Navy, had the full status of an Agency of the United States, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 429. The Bureau of Yard3 and Docks was represented by the Contracting Officer whose decision, for all practical purposes, was final.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the Contractor was certainly justified in carrying out their orders, the initial inquiry relates to the actions taken by the Bureau or its plenary agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">It simplifies the problem to start with an agreed point and work back to the beginning. On May 17, 1943, the Bureau declared, and the Contractor was advised, categorically that the Fair Labor Standards Act did not apply to Government cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>There was nothing about that action, however, which indicated that that was the declaration of a new policy. On the contrary, it was merely the precise application of the policy long established.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Among those testifying were former naval officers having personal knowledge of these matters both in the Bureau and on this job. Commander Goodrich, an experienced lawyer, longtime employee of the United States Department of Labor, Assistant Director of the Labor Relations Division, Bureau of Yards and Docks, who had direct and immediate responsibility for these affairs and was in continuous contact with CPFF Navy projects throughout the United States and with all of the Executive Departments, was emphatic that, from the beginning, it was the Navy\u2019s policy that these contracts were not under the Act. He had, on many occasions, relayed that policy to contacting officers, including those on this project, and had himself prepared for the Bureau\u2019s signature these letter-rulings in April-May 1943. Commander Dickeman, Officer-in-Charge and Contracting Officer June 1, 1942 through November 25, 1942, on this project, from the beginning of the war had been on construction duty and knew that a firm policy was established. He had been on duty at Pearl Harbor where he first became aware of the dispatch by Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Bureau, and preparatory to his taking command in Gulfport had again been advised in the Bureau\u2019s office of this policy. And, straight from the Chief himself, came irrefutable proof. On February 21, 1941, Admiral Moreell sent a dispatch to the Commandant, 14th Naval District, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201c * * * Dept has just received from Dept of Labor opinion that construction of Naval Air Bases in Western Pacific is not within coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act X. Bureau interprets this to apply to all construction under fee contracts X. Comdt is authorized to proceed accordingly X.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Admiral Moreell further testified that this was his interpretation on behalf of the Bureau and was the policy followed throughout his incumbency (up through November 30, 1945) on all such contracts and, at his direction, he ordered that all CPFF contractors be so advised.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, this policy-practice did not rest upon the thin strand of one radiogram. It was reflected by many other contemporaneous and subsequent directives which by terms and practical operations were completely contrary to F. L. S. A.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Whatever uncertainty there might be concerning knowledge of it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the Contractor, there is none concerning the Bureau\u2019s policy and practice. The evidence, with overwhelming corroboration,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is all one way.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We test the communication of this policy-practice to the Contractor in the general setting of the contract. This committed almost absolute rule to the Contracting Officer especially on matters requiring reimbursement. Without his approval, no cost would be repaid, and if repaid without adequate basis, a process of continuing audits assured the Government credit. The total labor cost, on this and similar projects, was of course a principal item. This in turn depended primarily on the scale of pay, the program for straight or overtime operations, and the method for determining overtime, if allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On Commander Dickeman\u2019s assuming command, June 1942, as Officer-in-Charge (Contracting Officer), he immediately set about to assume his rightful responsibility. In conference soon after his arrival, on the matter of wages he informed the Contractor (both through one of the partners, Reed, and the Project Manager Schutt) of the Bureau\u2019s policy that F. L. S. A. did not apply. Both Reed and Schutt confirm the receipt of these instructions'. Reed fixed it .definitely right after Diekeman took over and before August-September 1942. Nothing detracted from these positive assertions except the natural inability of these witnesses eight years later to pinpoint the precise date, time, or circumstance of these conferences and detail the exact words used. The plaintiffs urged that anything so important would have been in writing, and the absence of categorical written memorandum casts substantial doubt on the truthfulness of this testimony of oral communication. This would be, of course, a left-handed way of reading into the Portal-to-Portal escape the necessity of <em>written </em>evidence, a contention universally rejected. Compare \u00a7 9 with \u00a7 10; Lassiter v. Guy F. Atkinson, 9 Cir., 176 F.2d 984, 992, 21 A.L.R.2d 1313. And it completely ignores the atmosphere of a nation struggling, through a citizen armed force, impressed suddenly into new and strange responsibilities, to arm and equip itself with the greatest possible dispatch, with economy if possible, but with waste if necessary. Decisions on every level were made and communicated with informality and time-saving shortcuts. The possibilities of losses from non-use of the normal rigid procedures for the handling of Government business was itself one of the risks of . waging war. The nation\u2019s business and industrial skill had immediately to be exploited. The urgency was to get, train, equip and move men<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the fighting fronts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>There was little opportunity for the nicer and safer procedures of peacetime. If a Squad Leader could commit his eight, a Platoon Leader his forty, a Company Commander his two hundred men to almost certain casualties by an oral command, certainly a Contracting Officer in Gulfport, Mississippi, could act by voice as well as hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Moreover, there is positive and overwhelming corroboration. Commander Dickeman\u2019s instructions had immediate, tangible manifestations. Establishing a Wage Board to recommend wage scales, he informed the Board that F. L. S. A. did not apply, and that the normal workweek would be 48 hours. On receipt of the Board\u2019s report and recommendation, he promulgated by formal <em>directive</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a wage scale and labor policy effective July 8, 1942, which, plainly contrary to F. L. S. A., if it applied, forbade overtime at all, and, in November allowed \u201covertime\u201d at straight time rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The plaintiffs must be the last to challenge that this was done in fact, or that it was an effective determination that F. L. S. A. did not apply, for their very claims arose because of the wage policy change established by that order. And, contemporaneously, writings made years before the Portal-to-Portal Act was passed, or its defense of good faith reliance was ever heard of, show that this directive was the means by which Commander Dickeman made the Bureau\u2019s policy on non-overtime effective.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Lassiter v. Guy F. Atkinson, supra, 176 F.2d at page 922; Northwest Air Lines v. Jackson, 8 Cir., 185 F.2d 74, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 812, 72 S.Ct. 26, 96 L.Ed. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">These decisive actions completely refute the idea implicit in the District Court\u2019s findings that prior to July 11, 1942, no discussions were had between the Contracting Officer and Contractor on the inapplicability of F. L. S. A., the matter of no overtime and the Bureau's refusal to allow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">This brings it down, then, to the, contention that these directives were not a sufficient declaration. It is to sf\u00bby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that for the agency action to be ground for the escape, it must have been expressed in <em>terms </em>specifically rejecting the Fair Labor Standards Act by name. We find nothing in the Portal-to-Portal Act to sustain that artificial view; and, on the contrary, find much to refute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"> Congress, by the use of the words, \u201cany administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation, of any agency of the United States, or any administrative practice or enforcement policy of any such agency * * risked redundancy to make it certain that the availability of Governmental action as the reason for the employer\u2019s act or omission should not depend upon its form. Likewise, the last sentence of Section 9, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 259, continuing the defense even though the ruling policy or practice is subsequently \u201cdetermined by judicial authority to be invalid or of no legal effect\u201d indicates that the legality of the order is altogether irrelevant. If an order naming the F. L. S. A. and giving a wrong interpretation of the Act is available as the escape, if followed, then the addition or deletion, the statement, partial or complete, of reasons underlying the order becomes quite unimportant. The order or ruling was to be judged solely in the light of its command and effect and not upon its apparent reasonableness or correctness. If the necessary consequence of the instruction was to cause a course of action either contrary to F. L. S. A. or in conflict with its requirements, then that edict amounted, at least, to an agency practice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">This analysis, with the rejection, detailed above, of the trial judge\u2019s so-called fact finding that the Bureau\u2019s policy had never been orally communicated to the Contractor thus affords a dual basis for our decision. We think that the directive of July 11, 1942 (and its amendments) was all that was required. It certainly established the <em>practice </em>by the Bureau that the overtime required by F. L. S. A. would not be paid. Since it was the Bureau which set labor policies for its CPFF contractors, all that the Contractor needed to know was the decision. Whether it was wise, or unwise, was not for it. It needed to know only what it could <em>pay, </em>for that which it <em>could pay, </em>it could get back.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">The good faith reliance of Contractor is not really open to question. What was it to do? Had it paid F. L. S. A. overtime, it would have violated the July 11, 1942 directive. This would have been a flagrant disobedience subjecting it to the peril of contract penalties or forfeiture. More important, the Contracting Officer\u2019s approval to the claims for payroll reimbursement, withheld because of his directive, would have left Contractor paying them out of its own funds. Whether it was mistaken or not, the Contracting Officer\u2019s act, there being no suggestion of conscious wrongdoing or fraud, was absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>binding, United States v. Wunderlich, supra; United States v. Moorman, 338 U.S. 457, 70 S.Ct. 288, 94 L.Ed. 256, and the contract 30-day appeal would have been unavailing since the Bureau\u2019s policy was then and continued long to be fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The plaintiffs acknowledged on argument that good faith did not require that the employer bear these costs out of its own funds. They insisted, though, that it was Contractor\u2019s duty to remonstrate with these Governmental agencies. It is absurd to say that it is the citizen who must prick the sovereign\u2019s conscience to advise it what its own law is and means. And if it had to, what was it to do? Must it have borne counsel fees for research and the inevitable and almost continuous conferences held for several years on this engaging subject by the Labor, Justice, War, Navy and other Executive Departments? Had the Contractor made his plea, what evidence is there to indicate that it would have been of any value? What reason is there to suppose that if pressed by Contractor in July 1942, the Navy Department\u2019s answer would have been any different from the April-May 1943 letters? What reason was there for the Contractor thinking, in the first place, that F. L. S. A. did apply? Certainly, there was nothing but confusion in the Executive Branch. And in the Judiciary, as late (1948) as our decision in this very case, we thought these contracts were immune. The Supreme Court avoided decision that same year, Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 68 S.Ct. 1031, 92 L.Ed. 1347, and it was not settled until 1950 by Powell v. United States Cartridge Co., 339 U.S. 497, 70 S.Ct. 755, 94 L.Ed. 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Contractor was entitled to look to the Navy for its instructions. The Navy gave positive directives in keeping with its general interpretive policy. The Contractor relied upon instructions which were unequivocal. If it desired to remain as Contractor, it had no alternative but to comply, and Section 9 for prior acts in contrast to Section 10 for future acts gave no preeminence to the letter from the Wage and Hour Division expressing in April 1943 a view contrary to the Navy directives, Lassiter v. Guy F. Atkinson, supra; Kam Koon Wan v. E. E. Black, supra; Addison v. Huron Stevedoring Corp., supra. Carrying out orders under such circumstances when there was nothing else to do is bound to be in good faith whether tested by the objective, Campbell v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., D.C.W.D. Pa., 96 F.Supp. 189, Kam Koon Wan v. E. E. Black, supra, or a more subjective, Addison v. Huron Stevedoring Corp., supra, standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The defense under Section 9 was amply sustained, and it validly extinguishes all liability. Thomas v. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp., 3 Cir., 174 F.2d 711. The consideration of this whole record leaves us with the certain and definite impression that the trial judge\u2019s decision is not the truth and right of the case. Both by the intrinsic analysis which we have made and by the overriding impression of an injustice from the result, the fact findings and conclusions based on them will not withstand the scrutiny of F. R. C. P. 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A., and we reject them as clearly erroneous. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746; Sanders v. Leech, 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 486, 487; Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Section 9 extinguishes the entire claim and makes it, strictly speaking, unnecessary to discuss Section 11, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 260. Since it presents a matter closely related to Section 9, we think it appropriate to make clear that, independent of our decision on Section 9, Wolferman, Inc., v. Gustafson, 8 Cir., 169 F.2d 759; Brown v. Dunbar &amp; Sullivan Dredging Co., supra, we would reverse and render for the appellants the judgment awarding penalties and attorneys\u2019 fees on the penalties. In contrast to Section 9 which requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>good faith reliance upon an administrative regulation, order, ruling, or practice, Section 11 demands only that the act was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing it was not in violation. This inquiry is committed to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the trial court, a decision which we would alter only on most compelling circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">While the employer does not need the administrative ruling, policy or practice as a condition to the relief under this section, the existence of it is a factor bearing on his conduct. Surely, it is a reasonable thing for a Contractor, faced with a <em>fiat </em>forbidding the payment of overtime, to obey it when it emanates from a responsible, authoritative representative of the United States Government. And, as we have pointed out, a belief that CPFF contracts were not under F. L. S. A., while eight years and two courts later was finally held to be erroneous, certainly had \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d The suggestion that records were false or inaccurately kept is without any foundation. Detailed records were kept intended honestly to reflect the actual hours of work. To be sure there was a refusal to pay F. L. S. A. overtime, but it was an outright, candid position, forthrightly taken without stealth, subterfuge, or furtive machinations to make the facts appear to be something other than what they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We take it that the discretion under Section 11, while giving the widest latitude, yet imposes on the trial judge the duty of a reasoned, articulate judgment. To allow penalties here is to defy reason: whether the directive of July 11, 1942 was, or was not, a Section 9 ruling or practice, what could the Contractor have done in the face of it? Did he not have to obey it in fact if he were to retain the contract and was he not entitled to assume that he could place faith in the legal correctness of information coming from the branch of his Government responsible for this contract rather than some other ?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The judgment is reversed and here rendered for Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">. The contracts were for (1) the construction of a training camp for Navy Construction Battalions (\u201cSeabees\u201d) and a Naval Advance Base Depot at Gulf-port, Mississippi, and (2) the maintenance and operation of the Advance Base Depot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\">. Brought originally by 121 plaintiffs, recovery was originally allowed for 117, but on appeal this Court reversed, 1948, 168 F.2d 257, on the basic ground that the employees were not engaged in commerce under the Act. Chief Judge Hutcheson dissented on this phase. On the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court, November 15, 1948, took action, per curiam, 335 U.S. 865, 69 S.Ct. 105, 93 L.Ed. 410:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cThe petition for writ of certiorari is granted.

That Admiral Ben Moreell, if called as a <em>witness, </em>would <em>testify </em>as stated in his affidavit dated June 13, 1947, heretofore filed by the defendants with the clerk of this court in response to plaintiffs\u2019 aforesaid motion to produce. Plaintiffs, however, reserve the right to object to the competency, materiality, or relevance of such <em>testimony </em>of Admiral Moreell.\u201d (emphasis supplied) The trial court sustained plaintiffs\u2019 objection that this was hearsay and not the best evidence. This was patent error in disregard of the stipulation and without any foundation; it was not hearsay since it was within the personal knowledge of the individual, more than any other, who would know. The reservations in the stipulation meant to preserve to plaintiffs only those objections which would be available had the Admiral been on the witness stand in open court. Since the issue was the <em>policy </em>of the Bureau and not the writings, themselves, in which it might be reflected, the papers, assuming their existence, were not \u201cbest\u201d or even \u201cbetter\u201d evidence, see Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed. p. 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b721-13\">. See e. g., Circular Letters 12-42 January 21, 1942, for so-called overtime for annual, monthly, and weekly salaried employees of CPFF Contractors for hours beyond their normal work-week (not the first 40 hours); and No. 139^3, May 27, 1943, amending No. 12-42 stating overtime in terms of hours in excess of 40 but establishing a formula which, without minimum guarantee, in fact resulted in the same pay for the normal work-week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">.

The court could not simply disregard this, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Martin, 283 U.S. 209, 51 S.Ct. 453, 75 L.Ed. 983; Quock Ting v. United States, 140 U.S. 417, 11 S.Ct. 733, 851, 35 L.Ed. 501; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Chamberlain, 288 U.S. 333, 340, 53 S.Ct. 391, 77 L.Ed. 819; Foran v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 165 F.2d 705, in the absence of contrary evidence (i. e., affirmatively showing no such policy, or some other one). Their reliability and truthfulness is in no way impugned: long since retired from the Navy, neither had any self-interest to gain or lose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\">. Commander Diekeman, pressed for explanation on the absence of written directives, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">\u201cA. For the simple reason that we were at war at that time. We were in an emergency condition and our every effort was being bent toward getting work done expeditiously. That was my effort to handle routine red tape that applied under Naval circumstances and conditions of that kind. Just for instance \u2014 I reported to the Base on the 1st of June and I am quite certain in the first week I was here I get telephone calls from the Bureau that the first batch of Seabees would arrive on the 20th of June. In less than three weeks time we had to get hurriedly ready for 1100 men. Obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>you couldn\u2019t be thinking about a lot of \u25a0written orders under circumstances like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">.

December 15, 1942, Contracting Officer reported to Bureau of Yards and Docks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-14\">\u201c2. At the start of the construction work under subject contract, all weekly salaried employees were compensated at tbe rate of time and a half for overtime performed when they worked more than 40 hours per week. Effective July 8, 1942 tlie then Officer-in-Charge [Dickeman] directed that no overtime would be paid to weekly salaried employees regardless of tlie number of hours worked except for overtime performed on Sundays, when that overtime work was authorized, for which Sunday work compensation on straight time basis would be allowed. These instructions were modified on November 6, 1942 to the extent that weekly salaried employees were to be compensated after that date on a straight time hourly rate for overtime in excess of 48 hours a week that they worked. To compensate for the fact that commencing July 8, 1942 weekly salaried employees were placed on an unlimited time basis without additional compensation for hours worked in excess of 48 hours, increases in pay were granted weekly salaried employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-20\">This is recopied almost verbatim in the Contracting Officer\u2019s letter April 1, 1943, to the Bureau concerning the Nash claim, see footnote 7, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">.
