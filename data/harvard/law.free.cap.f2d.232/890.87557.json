Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 225 F.2d 674 \u2014 is distinguishable from Cohan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 540; and that, as in the Chesbro Case, the evidence offered was of such flimsy character that the tax court was not bound to accept it, inasmuch as the testimony concerning the claimed deductions rested upon the credibility of the taxpayer who concededly had been long engaged in illegal activities;</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The decision of the tax court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
