In seeking reversal of a judgment pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict, in appellees\u2019 favor, appellants say that, all the. competent evidence showed that, there was no marked cross-walk at the-intersection of Wisconsin and 34th, and! that the trial court erred in submitting-that issue to the jury. We think, however, that evidence offered by appellees; to show the existence of the cross-walk was competent, and presented a conflict which the jury was properly permitted to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-23\">Appellants also complain of the prejudicial nature of the closing argument for appellees with respect to a claimed item of damage. Counsel remarked that appellants were trying to. \u201cpile it on,\u201d and added, \u201cHow small?' How cheap? How cheap can you get?\u201d' While the propriety of these remarks is. questionable, we do not consider them, in the particular circumstances of this case, to have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
