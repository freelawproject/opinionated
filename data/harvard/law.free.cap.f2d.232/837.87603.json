This is an appeal from an order denying a motion filed under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, to set aside the judgment and sentence entered on the conviction. The motion alleged that the judgment and sentence is void because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had failed to comply with the laws of the State of Colorado relating to foreign corporations and was unlawfully doing business in that state, therefore the contract of insurance with the bank was void and the bank was uninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and no federal offense had been committed. This contention is without merit. The Federal Statute creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 264, authorizes that corporation to issue insurance certificates to qualified state banks. The Colorado Statutes specifically authorize state banks to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tract for insurance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Colorado Revised Statutes 1953, Chapter 14 Art. 9, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">As to the Federal criminal jurisdiction for offenses committed against member banks, see Weir v.
