At a comparative hearing before the trial examiner, it appeared that the Postmaster General had issued a fraud order against appellant about fifteen months earlier. Upon consideration of the circumstances underlying the issuance of that order, the trial examiner determined in his initial decision that (1) appellant \u201cis lacking in the requisite character qualifications to become the permittee <em>* * </em>* [and therefore] he is not entitled to comparative consideration with the competing applicant\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(2) the intervenor\u2019s application should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On June 4, 1954, the Commission affirmed the examiner\u2019s findings of fact and decision with respect to appellant but held in abeyance the decision on intervenor\u2019s application. Subsequently on August 9, 1954, the Commission granted intervenor\u2019s application and this appeal followed denial of appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Upon the record as a whole, including the trial examiner\u2019s findings, we cannot say that the Commission acted arbitrarily and beyond its statutory authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Its action is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-22\">. Intervenor moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that appellant failed to file a timely appeal from the denial of his application. We agreed with the Commission, however, that appellant could obtain review of the denial upon this appeal. Accordingly we denied intervenor\u2019s motion to dismiss,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AcM\">. See Federal Communications Comm. v.
