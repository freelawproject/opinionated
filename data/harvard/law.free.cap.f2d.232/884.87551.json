Indeed, before the present action was filed, appellant had instituted a complaint pursuant to section 5715.19 of the Revised Code of Ohio. For Ohio procedure, see, sections 5715.21, 5715.22, 5717.01, 5717.03, 5717.05, 5717.06, Revised Code of Ohio. By section 2723.01 of the Revised Code, the Courts of Common Pleas of Ohio may enjoin the illegal levy or collection of taxes and assessments, and may entertain actions to recover such taxes, when collected. See, further, sections 2723.03-2723.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">The courts of Ohio are open to appellant to contest the alleged unlawful discrimination under Ohio taxing statutes; and, in the event that the highest court of Ohio should decide against it, appellant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States upon an allegation that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">In the posture of the case as presented, we think United States District Judge Connell correctly ruled that the district court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
