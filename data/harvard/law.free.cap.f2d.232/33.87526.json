To properly understand the issues we face, the background of this litigation must be told.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The story starts on February 29, 1952, when the Department of the Army instituted a loyalty proceeding against appellant by notifying her that she was being removed from her position as a clerk-typist under an indefinite Civil Service appointment, because \u201cinformation received at this Depot, as a result of a loyalty investigation, indicates that there is a question of your loyalty to the Government of the United States.\u201d On April 14, 1952, she was restored to her job. On the following day, the Army commenced a security proceeding by a notice of suspension which stated: \u201cImmediate suspension is deemed necessary in the interest of national security under authority of Public Law 733, 81st Congress,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pending adjudication of your case * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">On May 13, 1952, the Chairman of the Army\u2019s Loyalty-Security Screening Board wrote appellant that information had been received which required formulation of charges against her with a view to effecting her removal under Public Law 733. Nine specific charges were stated and all appeared under the heading \u201csecurity.\u201d Three days later, however, appellant was again \u201creturned to duty\u201d; this time, as the notice stated, \u201cbecause letter of charges were [sic] not received from Loyalty-Security Screening Board.\u201d But this reprieve ended after six days with another suspension when it appeared that appellant had received the May 13 letter containing the charges against her. Appellant answered the <em>security </em>charges contained in the May 13 letter and requested a hearing. A hearing was held by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Army Loyalty-Security Hearing Board at Fort Meade, Maryland, on September 16 and 17, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Before this hearing took place, however, the Civil Service Commission had instituted a <em>loyalty </em>investigation by letter of August 4, 1952, from its Fourth Regional Loyalty Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter advised appellant that, during an investigation of her suitability for appointment as a clerk-typist, information had been received which required clarification. Appellant answered the enclosed interrogatory and requested a hearing. This hearing was held on September 26, 1952, ten days after the Army <em>security </em>hearing at Fort Meade, referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">By letter of December 9, 1952, the Regional Board advised appellant that it found (1) reasonable doubt of her loyalty and (2) \u201cunsuitab[ility] for Federal employment because of your <em>false </em>statements concerning <em>material loyalty matters </em>at the hearing * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant appealed to the Commission\u2019s Loyalty Review Board. In response to her inquiry, that Board described the false statements referred to by the Regional Board, as set forth below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a hearing, the Review Board advised appellant\u2019s attorney by letter of May 1, 1953 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">\u201c* * * on all the evidence, there is not a reasonable doubt as to Mrs. Burrell\u2019s loyalty to the Government of the United States, thereby reversing the Regional Loyalty Board on the loyalty issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201cHowever, the Civil Service Commission affirmed the ineligible decision on grounds of suitability <em>other than loyalty. </em>Therefore, the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>partment of the Army has been directed to remove Mrs. Burrell from the service. * * *\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">It appears, from the papers before us, that the Commission\u2019s affirmation of the \u201cineligible decision\u201d was embodied in an order dated April 28, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Thus what began as an investigation into appellant\u2019s loyalty ended in' a determination that she was loyal, but that her removal was nevertheless required on grounds of suitability other than loyalty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Five days later the Army wrote appellant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cAs your counsel has been advised, final decision on the security case has been held pending final action by the Civil Service Commission on the loyalty and suitability issues. Since you are to be or have been removed by order of the Civil Service Commission under Civil Service regulations, further action on the security case and decision on whether you should be removed under Public Law 733, 81st Congress have become unnecessary. Consequently, no further action on the security case will be taken and <em>it is considered closed.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">On May 12, 1953, appellant protested the termination of the .security case without decision, and requested a decision in accordance with the Army\u2019s regulations which required the Loyalty-Security Hearing Board to determine either that removal would serve the interest of national security or that it would not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The protest appears to have been ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Appellant brought this suit on August 27, 1953, for relief against various Government officials and members of the Loyalty Boards. She prayed, <em>inter alia, </em>for a declaration that she was improperly suspended and removed from her position as payroll clerk at the Curtis Bay Sub-Depot of Letterkenny Ordnance Depot and that she was entitled to reinstatement; and for an order directing reinstatement and back pay. On cross-motions, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees. Appellant brought this appeal and filed her brief on October 27, 1954. Appellees requested and were granted six extensions of time for filing their brief. In granting the sixth extension to April 18, 1955, we indicated we would grant no more. Then, on the last day of the extension, appellees filed a motion to remand the case to the District Court \u201cwith directions to vacate the order [granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment] and to refer this matter back to the Civil Service Commission for a supplemental ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">The motion stated that, in declaring appellant ineligible, the Commission acted under its regulation which provides that eligibility may be denied for <em>\u201cintentional false </em>statements.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion pointed out that although \u201cappellant\u2019s status as an indefinite appointee was protected by [this regulation] * *. The <em>required </em>finding of intentional falseness <em>has not been made </em>or rejected by the Commission.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] The stated purpose of the motion was to allow the Commission to supply this required finding retroactively. At oral argument, counsel for appellees requested that, if the motion was denied, we should finally dispose of the case without their brief, since their position had been fully presented in connection with the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">Before we were able to act, however, appellees filed the suggestion of moot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ness on September 27, 1955. In pertinent part, the suggestion states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u201cOn September 26, 1955, both appellees and appellant were informed by the Civil Service Commission that the Commission (1) had vacated its own prior decision and (2) a decision of the Fourth Civil Service Region, both of which were adverse to appellant; and (3) had ordered the Department of the Army to reinstate appellant to her former position in government employment. The Commission has, by this action, granted all the relief which could have been granted by the District Court.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s reply states that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cBy letter dated 28 September 1955, two days after appellees filed their suggestion of mootness, the Civilian Personnel Officer for the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot, informed the appellant as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c \u2018You are advised that this Activity has received a letter from the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission advising that upon reconsideration of your case they have vacated the previous decision concerning your removal from the Depot, ineligibility for Federal employment, and debarment on the ground of unsuitability. The attached Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, is your official notification that the removal action, dated 6 May 1953, is cancelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">\u201c \u2018As stated on the Standard Form 50, cancelling the removal action, <em>you revert to the suspension status effected on 22 May 1952 under Public Law 733, which was the condition of employment at the time of your </em>removal. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">\u201c \u2018You will be notified by the Office, Secretary of the Army of further developments pertaining to your security case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">The appellant\u2019s reply adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">\u201cTo date, appellant has not been returned to duty and pay status nor has she been informed of \u2018further developments pertaining to [her] security case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\"> It is clear, of course, that the Commission\u2019s recent order of September 21, 1955, vacating its discharge action of April 28, 1953, renders moot appellees\u2019 request to refer the case back to the Commission for a supplemental finding. But we conclude that this recent order does not moot the case and that we should proceed to a final disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-19\">When appellant filed the complaint herein, the controversy with respect to her asserted right to relief of reinstatement \u201cto her position as payroll clerk\u201d was both real and ripe.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Commission\u2019s subsequent action has produced only reinstatement by the Army to \u201cher suspension status.\u201d This, to put it mildly, is considerably less than the relief she seeks. Henee a real and ripe controversy remains.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Appellees urge that the case is nevertheless moot because the court is without jurisdiction to order any reinstatement relief against the Army. Jurisdiction is said to be lacking because appropriate officials of the Army, who were named in the complaint, were not served or properly served. This contention does not bear scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">If the circumstances of the Commission\u2019s direction to reinstate appellant and the Army\u2019s failure to comply had occurred while this case was still pending before the District Court, appellant would have had the opportunity to obtain leave of that court to bring Army officials formally before the court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It follows, we think, upon plain principles of equity, that appellant should not be deprived of such opportunity and put upon another long \u201cmerry-go-round of litigation\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> simply because these circumstances, which she could hardly have anticipated, occurred after this appeal was brought. We therefore conclude that appellant should be accorded this opportunity in further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We think disposition of this appeal must also include a decision respecting the validity of the Commission\u2019s discharge order of April 28, 1953, since that decision \u201cmay affect the rights of the litigants.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its order of September 21, 1955, the Commission left no doubt that its discharge order was vacated, not because it appeared that the order was invalid, but because it appeared \u201c* * * that the [unsuitability] matters dealt with in [the discharge] proceeding would fall more properly within the coverage of Executive Order' No. 10450 * * *,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This makes plain that the Commission does not agree with appellant that the discharge order was invalid when entered and that she has therefore been illegally kept from her position as payroll clerk for more than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">An adjudication of the invalidity of the discharge may affect appellant in two important ways. First, it may have a material bearing on the controversy over reinstatement which is still extant. This derives from the reasonable possibility that the Army\u2019s present failure to reinstate appellant may rest, at least in part, on the matters involved in the Commission\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Second, an adjudication may also have a practical effect on appellant\u2019s right to collect back pay for the period of her illegal discharge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Tucker Act,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of course, only the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to determine the merits of appellant\u2019s monetary claim. But we recognized in Almour v. Pace that \u201cthe District Court can properly declare individual rights, even though the plaintiff also possesses and is seeking to advance a monetary claim,\u201d where, as here, the plaintiff has \u201crequested an order which would affect his status or establish his rights <em>as to the future </em>visa-vis some governmental agency.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We turn now to consider the merits of the discharge issue. Appellees\u2019 now mooted motion to refer the case back to the Commission for a supplemental finding was clearly premised on their view that the finding of \u201cintentional\u201d falseness is not only required but also that it must be express. Under this view, of course, the Commission\u2019s determination of unsuitability is invalid since it made no such express finding. But in a written memorandum, filed by appellees on August 30, 1955, in connection with certain questions we propounded after that motion was argued and submitted, they urged that, although the finding is required, it need not be express but may be derived, by implication, from the ultimate determination of unsuitability. We think this contention must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The primary purpose and concern of the Commission proceeding related to the issue of loyalty, not suitability. The Commission\u2019s Loyalty Review Board, although it had before it the regional board\u2019s finding that appellant had made \u201cfalse statements\u201d concerning material loyalty matters, determined the loyalty issue in her favor. It is hardly realistic to assume that the Review Board could or would have done so had it found that she lied \u2014 made <em>intentional false statements </em>\u2014 in answers to the critically important questions relating directly to the primary issue of loyalty. Nor can it be assumed, in the absence of an express finding, that the Commission, acting simultaneously and upon the same record with respect to these questions, could or would have so found. Moreover, in the record now before us, there is no evidence from which we can draw support for such a finding. That record consists only of appellant\u2019s answers to interrogatories and oral testimony by her and her husband. It contains no testimony against her.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The Supreme Court \u201chas recognized that \u2018a badge of infamy\u2019 attaches to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>public employee found disloyal.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Though appellant was ostensibly cleared on loyalty charges, the charges on which she was found unsuitable are of the same stuff and stain. The Commission\u2019s action kept the word of promise to the ear but broke it to the hope. And now-two and one-half years later- \u2014 -it finds that \u201cthe matters dealt with * * * would fall more properly within the coverage of Executive Order No. 10450,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to wit, the loyalty-security order.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Moreover, we are unable to find a jot or tittle in the record before us of the Commission and District Court proceedings concerning the regulation which prescribes \u201cintentional\u201d falsity as a ground of ineligibility and upon which appellees relied in this court, in their motion to remand, as the sole authority for the Commission\u2019s action. Hence it does not appear that the Commission was even aware of the applicability of the regulation when it considered and reached its determination of unsuitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Without deciding whether or in what circumstances we could ever imply the crucial finding of intentional falsity in a case of this sort, we cannot imply it in the foregoing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We hold the Commission\u2019s action invalid for lack of a required essential finding. We therefore reverse and remand to the District Court with directions to vacate its order granting summary judgment for appellees; to grant appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment declaring the Commission\u2019s discharge order of April 28, 1953 invalid; to grant appellant opportunity to serve the appropriate officials of the Department of the Army; and thereafter to consider what further relief, such as reinstatement, may properly be awarded in the further proceedings required by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\">. Public Law 733, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 64 Stat. 476 (1950), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 22-1, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 652 of this title, or the provisions of any other law * * * the Secretary of the Army * * * may, in his absolute discretion and when deemed necessary in the interest of national security, suspend, without pay, any civilian officer or employee of the * * * Department of the Army * * *.

No explanation of why appellant was restored to her job on April 14, 1952, appears in the record. It should be noted, however, that the restoration and immediate suspension changed appellant\u2019s status from that of a removal on grounds of <em>loyalty </em>to a suspension on grounds of <em>security, </em>and thus brought the Army\u2019s action under the provisions of Public Law 733, set forth in note 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\">.
