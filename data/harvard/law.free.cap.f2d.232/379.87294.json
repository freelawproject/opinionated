Code, \u00a7 22-2201, 1951 Ed., Supp. III, and. with unauthorized use of a vehicle, D.C. Code, \u00a7 22-2204, 1951 Ed., both growing-out of the same act. He was convicted on both counts. The trial court sentenced him to imprisonment from two-to five years on the unauthorized use count, and from two to seven years on. the grand larceny count, directing that these sentences run concurrently. Defendant appeals, urging, among other things, that it was error to submit both counts to the jury as they grew out of' the same set of facts and circumstanc.es, and that the offense'of unauthorized us\u00e9is included in that of grand larceny. We find no error on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-19\">The same act may at times, constitute two offenses and justify findings of guilty on two counts, and separate sentences thereon may be imposed, providing they run concurrently. The-penalty provided by the Code covering-the offense of grand larceny is from one to ten years; the penalty for unauthorized use is a fine or imprisonment not. exceeding five,years, or both. The sentence under the grand larceny count was-no greater than the court had the right to impose. A different result would probably be necessary if the sentences-had been imposed to run consecutively. On the propriety of convictions under both counts of an indictment chargingincludable offenses where the sentences-are made to run concurrently, see Ekberg v. United States, 1 Cir., 1926, 167 F.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Defendant complains of the refusal of the trial court to declare a mistrial because of argument of government counsel with reference to the question of the legality of repossession of automobiles. It was the theory of the prosecution that defendant and a companion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had stolen an automobile; the defense was the defendant had been directed by a man engaged in the automobile business, for whom defendant had previously repossessed cars payments on which were in arrears, to pick up the car in question and that he had taken it in good faith even though it later developed that payments on the car taken were not in arrears. While on the witness stand, Lieutenant Williams, assigned to the auto squad and a witness for the prosecution, answered on cross-examination as to the procedure for repossessing cars where there had been default in payment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201c * * * Actually, a person is supposed to get a United States marshal to replevin the car, to actually take the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cQ. Unless the contract specifies otherwise ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">[\u201cThe Assistant United States Attorney] : I object as a matter of law; even if the contract specifies otherwise, it is a civil claim and has to be prosecuted by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">* * * -x- # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201cQ. Then, sir, let me put this question to you. Is it a fact, then, if a person who is not a private detective makes a repossession, he does not violate any law, although he may violate some regulation that the police have set up ? A. My own thought on this thing is \u2014 I couldn\u2019t give you the law on it \u2014 it would be up to the U. S. Attorney to do it. My own thought on this thing is the whole thing is illegal, the whole reposssession business is illegal, but it is just one of those things. There are a lot of things illegal that just go on and on and nobody is prosecuted under those laws, and we have cleaned it up quite a bit. Most of the men that repossess cars are private detectives. They report the cars in to us that they repossess. They report in that the car has been repossessed and the owners are satisfied. When we have a complaint, we take it to the U. S. Attorney\u2019s office and settle over there whatever matter they feel can be settled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL8\">While at this point defense counsel asked the court to say to the jury that they should disregard the witness\u2019 testimony \u201cas regards what the law is,\u201d the court stated he would \u201cinstruct the jury at the proper time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">During the argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">\u201c* * -x- And the defense of Evans is that he went out there to pick it up under an assumed right. He thought he had the right to pick it up because Mr. Cabral had told him to repossess that car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">\u201cNow if all those facts were true, it would be a very possible legitimate defense of this case,' \u2014 not that repossessing cars is in any way legal. That in itself is illegal. People just can\u2019t help themselves to other people\u2019s property without taking the due process of law that everyone is entitled to. Even if you failed to make your time payments on an automobile, they just can\u2019t come out and seize your automobile without first notifying you that you have failed to pay and then going in and suing on the contract and getting a court execution on the contract and having a marshal go out and repossess the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-16\">\u201cA man has no right to go out and take another man\u2019s property, as these people have assumed to do. As the police officer explained to you, however, discount companies have taken it upon themselves to break the law in this respect. That doesn\u2019t make it right, but they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>it, and in order to control them, Lieutenant Williams told us that they require them to have a private detective and that whenever they repossess a car, they notify the Police Department of which car they are going to repossess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">While at the bench, counsel made motion for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cMr. McKenzie: Before we leave, so we wouldn\u2019t have to come back, I again move now to withdraw a jur- or on the basis of the argument of the District Attorney that repossessing cars is a crime. He stated flatly to the jury that repossessing cars is criminal. There is no proof of that in this case one way or the other, and I think we are entitled to a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cThe Court: Did you say that in that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201c[The Assistant United States Attorney]: No. I said it is not legal, and there is proof that it is not legal. Lieutenant Williams testified to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201cThe Court: All right, your motion will be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">While defense counsel probably would have been better advised to have asked the court to instruct the jury to disregard that part of the argument objected to, rather than to have asked for a mistrial, the fact is that the argument was definitely injurious to the defendant. The jury were allowed to believe that in any event, even if his version of the taking was correct, the defendant was at the time of the taking of the automobile engaged in an illegal act. In other words, the jury were permitted to believe that, even if the defendant had no criminal intent, he was engaged in an illegal enterprise; and it requires no stretch of the imagination to<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see the effect on the minds of the jury of such an argument \u2014 one based on a wrong premise. It is true, of course, that Lieutenant Williams\u2019 testimony that \u201cthe whole thing [repossession] is illegal\u201d was brought out on cross-examination; however, the court was asked to tell the jury to disregard the testimony as to \u201cwhat the law is\u201d and he did not do so. The jury were not instructed to disregard the testimony or argument on this point, and they went to the jury room with the thought in mind that defendant had, at all events, been guilty of an illegal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The government urges that the admission of the testimony in question\u2014 even if inadmissible \u2014 was harmless error as the jury were instructed that the government had to prove every element of the crime, including intent, beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not agree. The stigma of claimed illegality of the defendant\u2019s action was taken by the jury into the jury room and could not but have had an adverse effect. This requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-17\">. The companion was acquitted by the same jury which convicted Evans.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
