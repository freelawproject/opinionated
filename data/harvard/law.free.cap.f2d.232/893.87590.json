The case was ably and thoroughly contested in the trial court by counsel for the parties. A careful review of the record convinces us that no error prejudicial to the appellant was committed by the district court, either in the admission or exclusion of evidence or in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-25\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
