He also invoked the protection of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s bar against self-incrimination in his refusal to answer specific questions as to whether he had brought with him each of the items called for in the subpoena, including the question: \u201cDid you bring with you the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive, as set forth in your subpoena duces tecum?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">On November 5, 1954, the grand jury requested the District Court to compel production of the records and answers to the questions. To obtain a ruling on his claim that identification of the records or answers to specific questions concerning their existence would tend to incriminate him, appellant offered to submit the records for the court\u2019s inspection. The court rejected the offer and refused to rule on the merits of the claim until appellant produced and identified the records before the grand jury. It directed appellant to bring the records before the grand jury, identify them and answer the questions he had refused to answer. Then it directed \u201cthat if then, when the records are before the Grand Jury and identified, that if the witness makes a claim of privilege, appropriate steps may be taken to bring those records before the court to enable the Court to understand and determine whether or not there is merit to the claim of privilege or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Immediately thereafter appellant reappeared before the grand jury. With the exception of the papers described in item 3 of the subpoena, he stated either that he had brought the records, identifying them by reference to boxes or envelopes in which they were contained, or that there were no such records. But with respect to the item 3 papers, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cQ. Now, did you bring in the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201cQ. Where are they, Mr. Traub ? A. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t you hear [the judge] say he wanted you to bring in the records that are set forth in the subpoena? A. Yes. I haven\u2019t any vouchers and bills to support the fees from \u201947 to \u201953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u201cQ. What did you do with them ? Did you destroy them? A. I refuse to answer that question, relying upon my privilege extended to me under the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">\u201cQ. You are refusing to bring them in? A. I did not, Mr. Goldschein. I say I haven\u2019t got them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH4\">Later, after consulting with counsel outside the grand jury room, appellant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-16\">\u201cWith the exception of a few pending unpaid bills for 1953, which can be made available on Monday, 1 have brought with me all the records called for under item 3 of the subpoena <em>which I had in my possession at the time the subpoena was served, on me.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">The questioning then proceeded in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-18\">\u201cQ. Well, now, Mr. Traub, will you tell the Grand Jury where those records are now? I am talking about the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive, listed in the subpoena. A. I refuse to answer that question on the ground, relying upon my privilege extended me under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution; on the further ground that any answer may tend to incriminate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-19\">* * * *\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-20\">\u201cQ. Did you have the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953 as called for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>this subpoena when you came up in Washington last month? A. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that any answer may tend to incriminate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cQ. And you won\u2019t tell us where, those vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive, are, will you? A. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that any answer may tend to incriminate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cQ. Will you tell us where those are that were not in your possession at the time you received the subpoena? A. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that any answer may tend to incriminate me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">He was thereupon temporarily excused by the grand jury which directed him to return with the item 3 records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">When appellant reappeared on February 28, 1955, he reiterated his claim that the privilege protected him from testifying before the grand jury. In response to many questions concerning production of the vouchers and bills referred to in the subpoena, appellant steadfastly insisted that he had produced all in his possession or control at the time the subpoena was served upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">On March 7, 1955, the grand jury returned a written presentment charging him with criminal contempt for obstructing justice and for disobeying the court\u2019s order of November 5</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">\u201c(1) by wilfully and deliberately refusing to obey the order of this Court to produce before the Grand Jury the papers, books and records called for by the subpoena, specifically the \u2018vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive,\u2019 and (2) by refusing to obey the order of the Court to tell the Grand Jury whether or not he had brought with him all such papers, books, and records, specifically the \u2018vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-17\">A plea of not guilty was entered. After denying appellant\u2019s demand for a jury trial, the court adjudged him in contempt in an oral announcement framed in language almost identical to that of the presentment. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">About a month later, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it construed its November 5 order, directing appellant to produce documents and to answer questions, as encompassing \u201call the documents called for by the subpoena,\u201d not merely those in appellant\u2019s \u201cpossession and control at the time the subpoena was served on him.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The conviction for failure to produce all the documents listed in item 3 of the subpoena is invalid for at least two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"> First, it is not clear whether the court\u2019s direction to produce referred to all the documents or only those in appellant\u2019s possession and control when the subpoena was served upon him. At the hearing in which the direction was issued, the court made statements pointing both ways. Appellant\u2019s asserted belief that the direction referred only to the latter is supported by the court\u2019s statements that appellant \u201chasn\u2019t been asked to produce any non-existent records\u201d; that the subpoena called merely for \u201cthe records that he has\u201d; and that \u201cwe must take his word for it as to whether or not he has responded to the requirements of the subpoena\u201d; that \u201cif he can\u2019t be sure that he has every piece of paper that has been subpoenaed he can make that clear in his answer.\u201d There was, therefore, an ambiguity in the court\u2019s direction, read as a whole, which precludes the essential finding of willful and contumacious resistance to the court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The attempt to remove this ambiguity in findings of fact sustaining the contempt charges is without effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To serve as a valid basis for contempt, the court\u2019s direction must be clear and unequivocal at the time it is issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\"> Second, appellant testified before the grand jury that he had produced all the documents designated in item 3 of the subpoena that were in his possession and control when the subpoena was served upon him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A subpoena duces tecum can require no more.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since it was not shown that his testimony was perjurious, or that he obstructed justice by destroying or causing the destruction of the missing records in anticipation of the subpoena,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> his testimony must be accepted as establishing compliance with the subpoena. We are aware of no principle under which an adjudication of contempt may be sustained in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">The conviction for refusal to testify must also fail. The only question which the court specifically directed appellant to answer is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">\u201cDid you bring with you the vouchers and bills to support fees re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ceived from 1947 to 1958, inclusive, as set forth in your subpoena duces tecum?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Appellant\u2019s entire testimony before the grand jury, which we previously described, indicated that, although he had brought all the records that were in his possession or control, he did not have, and therefore did not bring, all the records called for.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When appellant reappeared before the grand jury following the court\u2019s direction, he was asked: \u201cNow, did you bring in the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive.\u201d He replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Shortly thereafter he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t any vouchers and bills to support the fees from \u201947 to \u201953.\u201d Then appellant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201cWith the exception of a few pending unpaid bills for 1953, which can be made available on Monday, I have brought with me all the records called for under item 3 of the subpoena which I had in my possession and control at the time the subpoena was served on me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Appellant repeated the substance of this statement several times. We think these responses are sufficient to show there is no basis in fact for the charge that he willfully refused-to answer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The Government\u2019s brief states that the specific question just discussed \u201cis the <em>only </em>question which appellant is charged with contempt for failing to answer.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet, it urges, appellant\u2019s refusal to answer other questions relating to the existence and location of the missing records is a ground for sustaining the present conviction. The Government explains the apparent inconsistency in its position by the following novel contention : A witness who fails to produce all the papers listed in a subpoena is guilty of contempt unless he demonstrates that he is acting in good faith. This demonstration of good faith requires that he answer questions relating to the existence and location of papers he has. not produced even though the answers, will incriminate him. In other words, the witness can choose his own brand of hemlock. He can destroy himself either by failing to produce records called for by a subpoena (even if they were not in-his possession or control when the subpoena was served); by refusing to answer questions (even if he has claimed! the protection of the privilege and there-has been no judicial determination that it is not available); or by giving incriminating answers. This view is plainly-untenable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Appellant rested his refusal to answer questions relating to the existence and location of the missing records-, upon his claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is unnecessary to decide whether appellant is entitled to-the protection of the privilege since, as we mentioned earlier, the court never directed him to answer those questions and rejected his request for a ruling on-the merits of his claim before the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>charges were brought.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We hold that no contempt can lie unless the refusal to answer follows an adverse ruling by the court on the claim of the privilege and a clear direction thereafter to answer. Carlson v. United States, 1 Cir., 1954, 209 F.2d 209, 214.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">For the foregoing reasons the conviction on appeal is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-26\">. 62 Stat. 701 (1948), 18 U.S.C. <em>% </em>401 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-10\">. On November 24, 1954, appellant filed a motion for return of his books and papers which he had delivered to the grand jury. The motion was denied February 28, 1955. That case is now pending on appeal in this court (No. 12596) and does not affect our consideration of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-11\">. The government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits: (A) the official transcript of court proceedings on November 5 (which included the complete transcript of appellant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury on November 3); (B) the subpoena served on appellant; (0) the transcript of appellant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury on November 5, 1954; and (D) the transcript of appellant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury on February 28, 1955. The only evidence offered by appellant (with one minor exception not pertinent here) related to substantiation of the merits of his claim of the privilege. But the court excluded this evidence on the ground that the claim was premature because the records had not been produced before the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-21\">. Finding of Fact No. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-22\">\u201cThe Order of this Court of November 5 to the said witness Traub to bring in and identify before the Grand Jury the papers, books, and records called for by the subpoena, which included the aforesaid vouchers and bills and to answer certain questions concerning whether or not he had brought with him the aforesaid documents called for by the subpoena including the question \u2018Did you bring with you the vouchers and bills to support fees received from 1947 to 1953, inclusive, as set forth in your subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>duces tecum?\u2019 <em>referred to all the documents called for by the subpoena </em>and that therefore the said Traub disobeyed the Order of the Court by restricting his response to the subpoena and to the aforesaid question to the vouchers and bills in his possession and control at the time the subpoena was served on him * <em>* * \u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">.
