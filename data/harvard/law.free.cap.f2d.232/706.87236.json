Smith, with his wife, appellee, as beneficiary. The question is whether the policy was in force on the death of the insured, December 11, 1949, and the answer turns on whether the policy became effective on October 27, 1948, -the date of its approval and issuance in the home office, or November 11, 1948, when it was delivered to the insured by the writing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">On a stipulation of facts, the trial court held that the policy did not become effective until the date of delivery on November 11, 1948, and that the insured\u2019s death therefore occurred within the grace period of the policy. For the reasons stated in the trial court\u2019s opinion in D.C., 139 F.Supp. 904 the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
