Graham-Paige Motors Corporation, D.C., 132 F.Supp. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-23\">1. The trial judge, we think correctly, adopted the reasoning of Judge Samuel Kaufman\u2019s decision, denying a summary judgment, reported in D.C., 104 F.Supp. 957, in holding that Graham-Paige, for purposes of Section 16(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78p, became the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of 10% of the Kaiser-Frazer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>stock at the very moment when Graham-Paige purchased that stock. Before Judge Kaufman, the S. E. C. filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae in </em>support of what became Judge Kaufman\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">2. We agree with the trial judge that the purchase of the stock occurred on February 10, 1947, and that therefore sales made before August 8, 1947 were within the statutory period. The date when a purchaser becomes a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d is that on which he \u201cincurred an irrevocable liability to take and pay for the stock\u201d, when his \u201crights and obligations became fixed\u201d. Blau v. Ogsbury, 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 426, 427. Here Graham-Paige was to pay, in part, $3,-000. 000 in cash. It did not have that sum when the contract with Kaiser-Frazer was made but in the contract agreed to use its best efforts to borrow that sum from a certain bank in accordance with a letter agreement. This letter agreement provided that the bank\u2019s obligation to make the loan was on condition that the Henry J. Kaiser Company would guaranty it. The agreement with Kaiser-Frazer provided, in effect, that, if Graham-Paige was unable to obtain the loan from the bank in accordance with the letter agreement, Graham-Paige had the election to terminate the agreement with Kaiser-Frazer. As the trial judge said [132 F.Supp. 105]: \u201cThere is no evidence * * * that the Henry J. Kaiser Company became bound to execute the guaranty at any time prior to the closing meeting held on February 10, 1947 when it did so.\u201d It follows that, until that date, Graham-Paige had not incurred \u201can irrevocable liability to take and pay for the stock.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">In Blau v. Ogsbury, supra, the question was when the holder of an option to buy stock became the \u201cbeneficial owner.\u201d We held that it was not (a) the date when he acquired the option, nor (b) the day when, having exercised it, he paid for the stock and obtained legal title to it, but (c) the day when he exercised the option with the result that he had then a fixed right and obligation under an ex-ecutory contract. See also Park &amp; Tilford v. Schulte, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 984, 987 where we said that, upon the exercise of an option, the optionee becomes an \u201cinsider\u201d and thus within the Congressional purpose to \u201cprotect the outside stockholders against at least short-swing speculation by insiders with advance information.\u201d Our reasoning was that one who holds an unexercised option is not usually in a position to obtain such information from the company. Here Graham-Paige, as long as it had an election to back out of the agreement to purchase, was not an \u201cinsider\u201d under Section 16 (b). That election continued until the Henry J. Kaiser Company signed the guaranty of the loan on February 10, 1947.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>3. The trial judge found \u2014 we think correctly \u2014 that Graham-Paige\u2019s statements of profit in the amount of $434,787.86 sufficed to establish a prima facie case for plaintiff. Significantly, the judge refused to make a finding, requested by defendant Graham-Paige, that there were no profits. But the judge apparently assumed that plaintiff, despite his prima facie case, continued to bear the burden of proving that there were profits and in what amount; therefore, as defendant\u2019s proof left the judge uncertain in this respect, he decided for the defendant. So we incline to understand the judge\u2019s reasoning as indicated, <em>e. g., </em>by his statement that, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s prima facie proof * * * has been shown to be unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">If so, we think the judge erred. In Gratz v. Claughton, 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 46 we held that, under Section 16(b), a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d who buys and sells within the statutory period is to be regarded as a fiduciary who breaches his duty of loyalty <em>(i. e. </em>his duty not to engage in self-dealing) and who, in such circumstances, must account for his profits. Elsewhere we have held that, once a cestui shows a breach of such a duty and prima facie proof of a maximum amount of profits made by the fiduciary, then the fiduciary has the burden of proving to what extent the profits were less than this maximum \u2014 especially where the fiduciary\u2019s breach is responsible for the difficulty or impossibility of proving the amount with certainty \u2014 and that consequently, if the fiduciary\u2019s proof leaves the amount uncertain, judgment goes against him for the maximum figure. See Perlman v. Feldmann, 2 Cir., 219 F.2d 173, 177, 178; York v. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, 2 Cir., 143 F.2d 503, 517; Phelan v. Middle States Oil Corp., 2 Cir., 220 F.2d 593, 600-601, 613; President and Directors of Manhattan Co. v. Kelby, 2 Cir., 147 F.2d 465, 476; Upson v. Otis, 2 Cir., 155 F.2d 606; cf. Bigelow v. R. K. O.

Sealright Corp., 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 972, 979.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> However, since it is not entirely clear what the judge would have found \u2014 as to whether Graham-Paige discharged its proof-burden \u2014 had he read! the foregoing, in the interest of justice we remand with directions that he make' a specific finding on that issue, in the light of what we have said above.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. Defendant argues that the word \u201cpurchase\u201d in Section 16(b) must be defined according to Section 3(a) (13) which provides, \u201cWhen used in this chapter, <em>unless the context otherwise requires </em>* * * The terms \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018purchase\u2019 each include any contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire.\u201d The words we have italicized destroy defendant\u2019s contention. For the relevant portion of Section 16(b) deals with a person who is directly or indirectly \u201cthe beneficial owner\u201d of more than 10% of any class of any registered equity security. Since Graham-Paige was not irrevocably bound to purchase until February 10, 1947, it was not previously the \u201cbeneficial owner,\u201d directly or indirectly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-14\">. The S. E. C.\u2019s position on when a person becomes a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d by the purchase of stock coincides with our interpretation. In an opinion, the General Counsel stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201cIn my opinion an officer, director or stockholder is to be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of a security at the time when he takes a firm commitment for the purchase thereof, and to divest himself of such beneficial ownership at the time when he takes a firm commitment for the sale thereof. If it is necessary that certain conditions be satisfied prior to the consummation of the purchase or sale, and if it is uncertain whether such conditions will be satisfied, then it would appear that the officer, director, or stockholder would not acquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>beneficial ownership, or divest himself thereof, until such time as such conditions are satisfied and the undertaking to purchase or sell becomes a firm commitment.\u201d 11 Fed.Reg. 10968.(1946).

The judge ruled that, because there could be but one buyer of the Graham-Paige assets, the willing-seller-willing-buyer rule of fair market value was inapplicable. Perhaps we need not consider that ruling in view of the ground of our decision. But it may b\u00e9 well to say that we think this ruling erroneous. The willing-seller rule is not abrogated by the-absence of a market; the trier of the-facts must look to other relevant evidence of the price which a buyer would) pay. See United States v. Toronto, Hamilton &amp; Buffalo Nav. Co., 338 U.S. 396, 402, 70 S.Ct. 217, 94 L.Ed. 195; United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 374-375, 63 S.Ct. 276, 87 L.Ed. 336; De La Rama S.S. Co. v.

Section 16(b) reaches only the \u201cprofit realized by him [i. e., the beneficial owner] from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security * * *.\u201d Since profit on purchased stock is not \u201crealized\u201d until its sale, this \u2014 the operative clause of the Section \u2014 standing alone might be read as applying to profit realized by a person who was a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d at the time of his sale, irrespective of his status as a beneficial owner at the time of his prior purchase of the stock. Apparently because it recognized that this might be taken as the meaning of the operative clause, Congress added a final sentence to \u00a7 16(b), shown in the text of the Section as printed in an earlier footnote, wherein it gave its own construction of the operative clause. It there said that the subsection \u201cshall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such <em>both at the time of the purchase and sale </em>* * *.\u201d Although Congress did not supply the typographical emphasis appearing above, its language, especially when read in connection with the operative clause, plainly showed that it did in fact emphasize the very phrase that I have italicized. Thus in plain unambiguous language Congress said that the section does <em>not </em>apply to this defendant who though a beneficial owner at the time of sale \u201cwas not such both at the time of the purchase and sale\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">I cannot go along with my brothers who adopt the reasoning and ruling of Judge Kaufman\u2019s opinion reported in 104 F.Supp. 957, 959, which Judge Dimock took as stating the law of the case. In that opinion, it was said that \u201cThere is an ambiguity\u201d in the exclusionary sentence quoted above and, later, that the alleged ambiguity was located in the phrase \u201c \u2018at the time.\u2019 \u201d This simple phrase was thought to afford a choice between two constructions, <em>viz.: </em>\u201cprior to\u201d on the one hand, or \u201csimultaneously with\u201d on the other hand. My brothers approve Judge Kaufman\u2019s choice of the latter \u201cconstruction.\u201d On that basis they hold the transaction here involved to come within \u00a7 16(b). They thereby seem to commit the court to one or the other of these two propositions: (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>that any purchase by an outsider of a 10% interest in a stock equity gives rise to a conclusive presumption that the purchaser had inside information as to the affairs of the corporation, or (b) that a sale for profit by a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of stock in his corporation may give rise to a conclusive presumption of a breach of fiduciary duty even though the seller was under no fiduciary duty at all when he had previously purchased the stock sold. Quite independent of my difficulty in believing that Congress could have intended to subject \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d to conclusive presumptions of such drastic scope, I think that neither of the propositions posed above are tenable. For the simple language which my brothers find ambiguous is to me crystal clear. The grammar would have been better, but the meaning no clearer, if it had read \u201cat the time both of the purchase and of the sale.\u201d Nobody points to other provisions of the statute or to anything in its legislative history which conflicts with the plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">To give any other \u201cconstruction\u201d to such language is, in my opinion, to attribute to Congress an intent at variance with that to which it gave expression. In the face of such clear language there is no need for courts to plumb the depths of the collective legislative mind and no power in the courts to adjust the expressed intent of Congress to its supposed objective. In the case of Lake County v. Rollins, 130 U.S. 662, 9 S.Ct. 651, 652, 32 L.Ed. 1060, it was said, \u201c * * * where a law is expressed in plain and unambiguous terms, whether those terms are general or limited, the legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly expressed, and consequently no room is left for construction.\u201d In Packard Motor Car Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 792, 91 L.Ed. 1040, the court said, \u201c * * * it is for Congress, not for us, to create exceptions or qualifications at odds with its plain terms. * * * However we might appraise the force of these arguments as a policy matter, we are not authorized to base decision of a question of law upon them. They concern the wisdom of the legislation; they cannot alter the meaning of otherwise plain provisions.\u201d See also Ex parte Collett, 337 U.S. 55, 69 S.Ct. 944, 959, 93 L.Ed. 1207; Helvering v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., 296 U.S. 85, 56 S.Ct. 70, 80 L.Ed. 62; and Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line v. United States, 300 U.S. 98, 57 S.Ct. 356, 81 L.Ed. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The opinion below cites United States v. C. I. O., 335 U.S. 106, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 92 L.Ed. 1849, wherein it was held that the word \u201cexpenditure\u201d as used in \u00a7 304 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 2 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 251, should be interpreted in the light of the Congressional purpose. But that was because the word \u201chas no definitely defined meaning\u201d. Also cited was S. E. C. v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 64 S.Ct. 120, 123, 88 L.Ed. 88, for the proposition that \u201cthe purpose of Congress is a dominant factor in the determination of a statute\u2019s meaning * * and <em>where a choice may be made between two possible constructions, </em>that construction should be chosen which would serve to effectuate Congressional purpose rather than defeat it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) There the problem was whether the transaction in question came within the phrases an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d or \u201cin general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security\u201d as used in the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d in \u00a7 2(1) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77b (1). The court spoke of these definitions as being \u201cof * * * variable character\u201d and \u201cdescriptive terms\u201d which required interpretation \u201cin conformity with its [the] dominating general purpose\u201d of the Act. That case, too, I think not apposite here. For the exclusionary sentence of \u00a7 16(b) did not provide \u201ctwo possible constructions,\u201d nor were its provisions couched in \u201cdescriptive terms\u201d of \u201cvariable character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">My brothers\u2019 \u201cconstruction\u201d is apparently chosen because thought to be more consonant with the Congressional purpose \u201c \u2018to protect the outside stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>holders against at least short-swing speculation by insiders with advance information.\u2019 \u201d Shaw v. Dreyfus, 2 Cir., 172 F.2d 140, 142; Park &amp; Tilford Inc. v. Schulte, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 984. I accept, of course, this statement of the Congressional purpose. Notwithstanding, I think that the construction adopted by the court is in direct conflict not only with the simple language of the Act but also with its basic rationale and scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">By the Act, Congress recognizes that officers and directors of a corporation generally have access to advance information as to its condition and prospects which when released to the public may sharply affect the market value of its stock. It seeks to hold these fiduciaries accountable to the corporation for personal profits made by them through trading in its stock <em>on the basis of such advance information. </em>And so, in recognition of the difficulty of proving that they actually had advance information which actuated their trading, the Act conclusively presumes that one who, while an <em>officer or director, </em>makes both a <em>purchase and sale </em>within so short a period as six months was actuated by advance information actually received. Congress recognized further that large stockholders also often have a dominant voice in management and hence have access to advance information. Such stockholders, as well as officers and directors, thus have the qualifications of \u201cinsiders.\u201d Consequently, Congress adopted a provision whereby those owning 10% or more of the stock should as \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d be included amongst the insiders, apparently thinking that provision to be at least roughly consonant with the realities of intracorporate relationships and desirable in that it would serve as an accurate definition of the class adequate for the guidance of the commercial public, and would facilitate the proofs necessary for enforcement litigation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">But the basic rationale of the Act was such that only completed swing transactions gave rise to the presumption of unethical use of advance information: if one purchased stock on one day, became a director on the next, and sold some of his stock on the next, any resulting profit was not recoverable by the corporation apparently because a sale alone was thought to be insufficient basis for a drastic presumption that it had been made in violation of a fiduciary duty. In principle, the same rationale is equally applicable to beneficial owners who do not become such until a given purchase is consummated. Under that rationale, the presumption will arise only when both the purchase and the sale were made by one who at the time was a fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">It is true that if the Act gives consistent effect to this rationale, it makes it possible for one who actually had advance information but was not a beneficial owner at the time of his purchase, to evade the Act, as was observed by Judge Kaufman in his opinion below. And under the same rationale, it excludes from accountability persons, like the defendant here, who until their purchases were consummated lacked even access to advance information. On the other hand, the Act, under my brothers\u2019 \u201cconstruction\u201d sanctions one or both of the propositions stated in an earlier paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">It was of course for Congress, not the courts, to weigh the conflicting policies affecting the scope which it should give to the Act. It decided to bring \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d within the Act. But the extent to which they should be held accountable was unmistakably indicated by the final exclusionary sentence of \u00a7 16 (b). It obviously thought it better, at least for the time being, to leave in the Act a loophole for some who, under the basic rationale, deserved to be held to accountability, than to suck into a suffocating dragnet many who, under the same rationale, could not justly be so held.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">. a Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u201cFor the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, director, or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer, any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity .security of such issuer (other than an exempted security) within any period of less than six months, unless such security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner, director, or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six months. Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-14\">.
