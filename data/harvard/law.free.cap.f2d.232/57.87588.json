Allentown Broadcasting Corp., 349 U.S. 358, 75 S.Ct. 855, (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b105-33\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aan\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-34\">The contest is between mutually exclusive applicants for radio station construction permits, appellant proposing to serve the community of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the intervenor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>community of Easton, Pennsylvania. The Federal Communications Commission decided that Easton's need for a new station is greater than Allentown\u2019s and that the intervenor can better serve that need than the appellant. When the cause was last here, we reversed the Commission's decision. The cause reaches us again on remand from the Supreme Court, which reversed our decision but did not order reinstatement of the Commission\u2019s decision. I do not read the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion to leave us with only the ministerial duty of reinstating the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Nor does the Commission itself so read it. The Coihmission agrees that the Supreme Court's mandate requires us now to consider whether the Commission has properly weighed the various factors which determine whether a grant to a particular applicant would serve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In our decision [94 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 222 F.2d 784], now reversed by the Supreme Court, we had held, <em>inter alia, </em>(a) that the \u201cchoice of local service\u201d principle can be applied by the Commission only where the respective abilities of the applicants are about equal, and (b) that a hearing examiner\u2019s findings based on demeanor of witnesses are reversible by the Commission only upon a very substantial preponderance of the evidence. The Supreme Court held us in error as to both of these points and remanded the cause to us \u201cfor reconsideration of the record but freed from rulings declared erroneous in [its] opinion.\u201d Our assigned task now is to review the record and to decide whether the Commission\u2019s decision is consonant with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The Supreme Court agrees with the Commission that, in a case like this one, the question of comparative ability of the applicants arises only after it is determined which community has the greater need. In addition, the Court, found substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission's determinations that Easton has the greater need and that the intervenor is the only applicant proposing to serve that need. If the latter findings were dispositive, the Court would not have remanded the case to us \u201cfor reconsideration of the record but freed from rulings declared erroneous in [its] opinion.\u201d That mandate-necessarily implies that, even though intervenor is the only applicant proposing to serve the Easton community, it may not automatically receive the grant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The Commission\u2019s decision awarding-the grant to intervenor may not stand if made without consideration of a factor significant to the public interest<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission found the intervenor to-be the publisher of the only newspaper in its community, the permittee of the only television station and the licensee of one of two FM radio stations. I have-examined the Commission\u2019s decision with care, but find nothing to show that it, gave any consideration to the question whether the public interest would be served by increasing the intervenor\u2019snear monopoly of communications media and its large portion of the public broadcast domain in its community.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Commission admits that this issue was squarely presented to it by the appellant. Yet, in its conclusions, the Commission disregarded this issue and confined itself to the questions whether management of the intervenor\u2019s radio station and newspaper would be \u201csubstantially separate\u201d and whether, in the past, the intervenor had used its near monopoly in a manner contrary to the public interest. Despite considerable evidence that the intervenor had taken advantage of its powerful position to the detriment of the only existing standard broadcast station in Easton, the Commission concluded there was \u201csome indication of a lack of intention to freeze out\u201d that sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tion. And despite testimony that intervenor looked upon a radio station as \u201ca very, very valuable complement to our newspaper activities\u201d and that intervenor\u2019s newspaper management handled \u201caccounting and everything like that\u201d for the FM station, the Commission found that the operation of intervenor\u2019s newspaper and radio interests \u201cis and will be substantially separate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Even assuming these conclusions are supported by the evidence, what is here significant is the absence of a more important conclusion relating to the effect upon the public interest of a grant which necessarily increases intervenor\u2019s extensive interest in communications media in Easton. The policy of competition which the Communications Act expressly favors <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is designed to avoid concentration of control of the valuable electronic public domain. Diversification assures the public of more than a \u201c \u2018single or monopolistic source for its information about current affairs,\u2019 \u201d and is \u201can important component of the public interest.\u201d Clarksburg Publishing Co. v. Federal Communications Comm., 96 U.S.App.D.C. at page 218, 225 F.2d at page 518. Since concentration is a potential evil, protection of the public interest is not assured merely because an applicant has not yet exploited its monopoly position and promises not to exploit its enhanced monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Ownership of one station does not necessarily preclude grant of another, for Congress has not made it an automatic disqualification. But ownership of multiple facilities must be carefully weighed by the Commission before it makes a grant. There may be circumstances in which the Commission could find that factor decisive in denying a grant, even if the result is postponement of service to the community.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which need for the proposed service is so compelling that the Commission could find it outweighs the factor of multiple ownership. But if that is the basis for the grant, the Commission is, of course, required to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The Commission\u2019s function is to weigh all the competing considerations pertinent to the public interest, and the balance it strikes, unless it is arbitrary, may not be disturbed on appeal. The fault I find is that the Commission has neglected to perform its function.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">. See Clarksburg Publishing Co. v.
