The defendant denied that this constituted .an infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s trademarks or unfair competition. The defendant alleged that it has been engaged in the milling business for more than 50 years; that its principal products throughout this period have been breakfast cereals and animal feeds; that its total sales have amounted to billions of dollars and its sales of breakfast cereals to over one hundred million dollars; that for more than 50 years a marking of contrasting colored squares, known as the \u201ccheckerboard\u201d marking and registered in the United States Patent Office as the defendant\u2019s trade-mark for the various products sold by the defendant, has been used continuously by it and has come to be known by the public as the generic trade-mark for the defendant\u2019s products, and that it appears upon every unit of the products, of which the plaintiff complains. The defendant further alleged that it had used the mark \u201cChecker\u201d since 1922 on animal feeds and had registered that mark in the Patent Office; that the defendant had also used the registered trade-mark \u201cCheckr-\u201d on breakfast cereals since 1927; and that, \u201cshould the average purchaser of breakfast cereals associate the mark \u2018Chex\u2019 with the term \u2018check\u2019 or combining forms thereof, * * * the average purchaser of breakfast cereals will necessarily associate the mark \u2018Chex\u2019 with defendant rather than with plaintiff.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The issues raised by the pleadings were tried to the court. There was little dispute as to the evidentiary facts, and many of them were stipulated. The controlling issue in the case was, as it usually is and has been in all such cases, see McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 252-256, 24 L.Ed. 828; Kann v. Diamond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Steel Co., 8 Cir., 89 F. 706, 707, whether there was any confusing or deceptive similarity between the marks used by the defendant upon its shredded rice and shredded wheat breakfast foods, namely \u201cRice Chex\u201d and \u201cWheat Chex\u201d, on cartons with a checkerboard design, and the marks used by the plaintiff \u2014 in the sale of its puffed rice and puffed wheat products \u2014 upon its cellophane packages and cartons, namely \u201cChecker Rice Puffs\u201d and \u201cChecker Wheat Puffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The original corporate name of the plaintiff was Gandolfo-Ghio Manufacturing Company. It was incorporated in 1896. The name was changed to Checker Food Products Company, which name has been used since 1927. Its president purchased some of its capital stock in 1934, and eventually acquired all of such stock. After 1934 the plaintiff was selling spaghetti, macaroni, egg noodles, cream meal, pancake flour, soup mixes, puffed wheat, and puffed rice. Most of these items were sold under the Checker label. The name \u201cChecker\u201d has been used on products of the plaintiff since about 1920. The plaintiff (then Gandolfo-Ghio Manufacturing Company) on September 20, 1920, applied for registration of the trade-mark \u201cChecker\u201d for spaghetti, macaroni, vermicelli, and noodles, and it was registered in the United States Patent Office on December 13, 1921, as No. 149,384. The registration was renewed December 13, 1941, to Checker Food Products Company. Puffed wheat and puffed rice are the major products now being sold by the plaintiff. They are not manufactured by the plaintiff, but by a corporation the capital stock of which is also owned by the plaintiff\u2019s president. The plaintiff\u2019s fiscal year ends August 31st. The largest amount the plaintiff derived from its sales of puffed wheat and puffed rice in any year from 1944 to 1951 was $153,-097.76 in 1945. There was a sharp falling off in the sales of these products of the plaintiff after the war. In 1950 sales amounted to $75,072.64, and in 1951 to $94,748.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The plaintiff sells puffed wheat and puffed rice in 46 states and in the District of Columbia. Outside of the metropolitan area of St. Louis, sales are made through food brokers. The plaintiff advertises by giving premiums and sales incentives to dealers, and in newspapers, and may have done some radio advertising. It runs some advertisements in cooperation with customers. It packages its products in cellophane bags or in small cartons wrapped with waxed paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Since 1938 the plaintiff has had no dispute or litigation with the defendant. From 1937 or 1938 until the spring of 1950, the defendant made no claim against the plaintiff for the use of any name and the plaintiff made no such claim against the defendant. There had been some prior litigation. See Ralston Purina Co. v. Checker Food Products Co., Mo.App.1935, 80 S.W.2d 717, in which the Ralston Purina Company charged the Checker Food Products Company with unfair competition, and in which it was held that there was no reasonable probability of confusion between the then style of dress and designation adopted by the parties for their respective products, at page 720 of 80 S.W.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">In the early part of April, 1950, the defendant offered to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s rights in the name \u201cChecker\u201d for $20,000. The offer was refused by the plaintiff\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The use by the defendant of the name \u201cRice Chex\u201d came to the plaintiff\u2019s attention about December, 1950, or January, 1951, and the use of the name \u201c\"Wheat Chex\u201d was first noticed about August, 1951. Demand was made upon the defendant to cease using those names.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Prior to using the names \u201cChecker Rice Puffs\u201d and \u201cChecker Wheat Puffs,\u201d the plaintiff had sold these same products in 1937 and 1938 under the names \u201cChecker Rice Pops\u201d and \u201cChecker Wheat Pops\u201d. It used the name \u201cChecker Exploded Rice\u201d from about 1938 to 1948. Since then it has used the names which it asserts the defendant has simulated by selling its shredded wheat and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>shredded rice products as \u201cWheat Chex\u201d and \u201cRice Chex\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The plaintiff introduced some evidence tending to support its claim that the names it used in marketing its products were confusingly similar to the names used by the defendant and that purchasers asking for the plaintiff\u2019s products had been handed defendant\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It was stipulated that the \u201cDefendant is presently and has been widely known for many years as one of the nation\u2019s foremost manufacturers of breakfast cereal foods, and has a national reputation as one of the foremost manufacturers of breakfast cereal foods.\u201d The defendant was incorporated about January 8, 1894, as Robinson-Danforth Commission Company. In 1899 its name was changed to Robinson-Danforth Milling Company, and to Ralston Purina Company in 1902. Its net cereal sales from 1903 to January 1, 1951, exceeded $163,-000,000. Its shredded rice product now being sold as \u201cRice Chex\u201d was first sold in 1950; and prior to January 1, 1951, sales of that product amounted to more than $883,000, and from January 1,1951, to February 29, 1952, 'amounted to more than $1,900,000. The defendant\u2019s shredded wheat product now being sold as \u201cWheat Chex\u201d was first placed on the market in 1935, and total sales of that product up to January 1, 1951, amounted to more than $34,000,000. From January 1, 1951, to February 29, 1952, sales of \u201cWheat Chex\u201d amounted to more than $4,000,000. The defendant first packaged its shredded wheat product as \u201cWheat Chex\u201d on January 22, 1951. Since its incorporation, the defendant's principal products have been foods for human consumption (mainly breakfast cereals) and animal feeds. The rice product of the defendant sold as \u201cRice Chex\u201d is a biscuit-type product made of shredded rice, and is not a puff. The product \u201cWheat Chex\u201d is a biscuit-type product made of shredded wheat, and is not a puff. The plaintiff\u2019s product sold as \u201cChecker Rice Puffs\u201d is not a biscuit-type product and is not made of shredded rice, nor is the plaintiff\u2019s product which is sold as \u201cChecker Wheat Puffs\u201d a biscuit-type product made of shredded wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">For at least 50 years defendant has used a checkerboard motif as a trademark on substantially all of its products, including breakfast cereal foods. Total sales of all its products have amounted to billions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The defendant\u2019s first registered trademark, No. 35,569, was dated December 11, 1900, for \u201cCheckerboard\u201d and a checkerboard design for cereal food products. Since that time the defendant has registered trade-marks for its various products, perpetuating its right to use that design for identifying them. It. has also registered and used such trademarks as \u201cCheckr-\u201d, \u201cChecker\u201d, \u201cCheck-R-Chix\u201d, \u201cChek-R-Fect\u201d, and many others of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">It was stipulated that these registrations were valid, subsisting and owned by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s registration of the trade-mark \u201cChex\u201d, dated May 27,1952, was applied for July 22, 1950, and is No. 559,285.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The defendant, at the trial, introduced evidence tending to show that there was no confusion and no confusing similarity between its accused trade-marks as applied to its shredded rice and shredded wheat products and the trade-marks used by the plaintiff in marketing its puffed rice and puffed wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Enough has been said to indicate the nature of the controversy and to show that the issue of confusing similarity was an issue of fact for the trial court and not an issue of law for this Court. There is no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contention that confusing similarity was conclusively established by the evidence. What the plaintiff is, in effect, asking this Court to do is to retry this case and to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. This the Court will not do. See and compare, Cleo Syrup Corporation v. Coca-Cola Co., 8 Cir., 139 F.2d 416, 417-418, 150 A.L.R. 1056; Seven Up Co. v. Cheer Up Sales Co. of St. Louis, Mo., 8 Cir., 148 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>909, 911. The determination of the trial court that there was no confusing similarity between the trade-marks in suit and that the defendant had not infringed the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark rights and had not engaged in unfair competition is not erroneous. The burden of proving confusing similarity was that of the plaintiff, and the defendant, as the prevailing party, is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences which can be drawn from the evidence, viewed in the aspect most favorable to it. Cleo Syrup Corporation v. Coca-Cola Co., at page 418 of 139 F.2d; Clarke Hybrid Corn Co., Inc., v. Stratton Grain Co., 8 Cir., 214 F.2d 7; Lanza v. Carroll, 8 Cir., 216 F.2d 808, 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We take the liberty of saying that a comparison of the products, packages and labels used by the respective parties indicates to us that no ordinarily prudent purchaser in possession of his faculties and at all interested in the source of the breakfast food he was buying would have the slightest difficulty in distinguishing the defendant\u2019s accused products from those of the plaintiff and determining their source.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
