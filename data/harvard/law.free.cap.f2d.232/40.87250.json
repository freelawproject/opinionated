These jobs were created by the Bureau in connection with a four-year training program approved by the Veterans Administration for subsistence allowances under the educational and vocational training provisions of the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After some of the appellants had served two and one-half years and others one and one-half years, the Bureau abolished these apprentice jobs and offered appellants other jobs pursuant to applicable Civil Service and Veterans Preference laws. Appellants thereupon filed this suit in the District Court against officers in charge of the Bureau, for restoration to the apprentice jobs; and against the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, for continuation of their subsistence allowances. The complaint, captioned \u201cSuit for a Mandatory Injunction to Require the Defendants to Perform a Purely Ministerial Duty * * was dismissed by the District Court on the ground that no cause of action was stated upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">The complaint was properly dismissed. The creation or abolition of Government jobs, within the scope of the authority given by law to supervisory officials, requires primarily a judgment as to the needs of public business. The determination of those needs plainly involves the exercise of discretion, not the performance of a ministerial duty which can be compelled by mandamus. Since there is no showing here that appellees abused their discretion, or departed from applicable law and procedures <em>in </em>determining that appellants\u2019 jobs should be abolished, we cannot disturb their action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">. 57 Stat. 43 (3943), as amended, 58 Stat. 287 (1944), 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 703(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-12\">.

The case against the Veterans Administrator necessarily falls with abolition of the jobs for which subsistence allowances were paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
