The findings are amply supported by the record as a whole. The respondent company has agreed to comply with the portion of the order directed against it. The Trial Examiner\u2019s Intermediate Report and the Board\u2019s Decision completely demolish all the respondent union\u2019s contentions. We mention but two:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">(1) The parties to the collective bargaining agreement are the employer-company and the respondent union, District No. 2. That union is a \u201csubordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>nate\u201d of an International union; but the International is not a party to the bargaining agreement. The agreement contains provisions which violate the statute, i. e., they prescribe that the employer \u201cshall employ none but building construction members in good standing on all work * * * coming within the jurisdiction of District No. 2. * * *\u201d Such an unlawful discriminatory agreement is not the less so because it applies, as it did here, to members of other local unions which are also \u201csubordinates\u201d of the International. The actual conduct of the respondent union and the employer conformed to the discriminatory provisions and was therefore also violative of the statute. That these provisions and that conduct were authorized or required by the parent union, the International, cannot render them lawful: The \u201cchild\u2019s\u201d sins are not to be excused because committed in obedience to the commands of the parent; such paternal commands do not nullify those issued by Congress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">(2) The Board found that all the respondent union\u2019s agreements contain unlawful provisions substantially the same as those before us here; accordingly the Board\u2019s Order, which prohibits like conduct anywhere, is not invalidly broad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\">.

The Employer shall employ none but building construction members in good standing in the Union on all work done by or for him on all construction, repair and maintenance work within the Metropolitan area * * * The Employer further agrees that he will demand and see the working cards and Building Trades Quarterly cards of Employees before employing them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALz\">The Board confirmed the finding of the Trial Examiner that four members of Lodge 23 of the Boilermakers Union were refused employment because they were not members of District 2. These acts and the provisions of the contract were obvious and flagrant violations of \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to hire to encourage membership in a labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">The four charging parties are members of Lodge 23 of the Boilermakers International which limits Lodge 23\u2019s work jurisdiction to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mrazek unsuccessfully applied at the company\u2019s Astoria job several times in December 1952 and on January 5, 1953. Hagan, the company\u2019s foreman, told Mrazek that although he needed men he could not put him on without District 2\u2019s permission, and this was confirmed by the tenor of Mrazek\u2019s talk with District 2's field representative, Graber, in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Smith, Duncovich and Marin were each refused employment by Hagan on January 8th. Hagan told Smith and Marin that since they were Lodge 23 members and did not have Building Trades Quarterly cards they would have to get the approval of District 2 headquarters. At 14th Street headquarters field representative Graber told them that the Astoria jobs were being held for District 2 members.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On the same day, January 8th, Duncovich received substantially similar advice from Hagan at the Astoria project and from Graber and another field representative at two different District 2 headquarters. There was ample evidence to sustain the finding of the Board and its Trial Examiner that pursuant to its unlawful hiring arrangement the company had diseriminatorily refused employment to the four complainants and that District 2 had caused this discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Thus it follows that by the performance of this discriminatory contract with the company and by causing the company to discriminate against the charging parties, .District 2 violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(b)(2) and (1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">' The evidence justified the Board\u2019s rejection of District 2\u2019s contention that the Board could not issue its complaint because, the four complainants were merely. fronting for Lodge 23 in a jurisdictional dispute with District 2. Mrazek and Marin were unemployed at the time, and Smith although working elsewhere was receiving $1.20 an hour less than the boilermaker wage scale in effect at the Astoria project. Duncovich also was working elsewhere, but his weekly salary was nearly $50 less than the pay scale on the Astoria job.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Of course no provision of the constitution or rules of the International which chartered both District 2 and Lodge 23 could validly determine where and under what circumstances the members of a particular local could apply for and be given jobs by an employer. The Act is paramount and its provisions may not be whittled away or circumvented by any action of the International any more than by the agreement between the company and District 2 which we here strike down.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">For the reasons stated above and in Judge Frank\u2019s opinion I concur in granting enforcement of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b444-10\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">I concur with my colleagues in each of the foregoing opinions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
