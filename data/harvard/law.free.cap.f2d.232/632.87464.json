United States, 6 Cir., 216 F.2d 330;</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">And appellee having filed in support of its motion for summary judgment the affidavit of the Secretary of the First Bancredit Corporation stating that it purchased the note from the payee on January 15, 1940, which was prior to the due date of the first installment payment and said affidavit being uncontradicted and not discredited by appellants, and no showing having been made by appellants that there is any evidence now known to them that would in any way contradict said affidavit;</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">It is ordered that the judgment of the District Court in favor of the appellee for the unpaid balance on the note, be affirmed.
