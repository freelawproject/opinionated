Jointly they were found guilty of conspiracy to violate that section under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1952). The court imposed a general sentence for these two counts. Each appellant was also convicted of violating D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1502\u2019s prohibition against the possession of lottery tickets. Appellants Harley and Kingsbury, in addition, were sentenced for violating \u00a7 22-1505(b) (Supp.1954), which prohibits the maintenance of \u201cany gambling premises.\u201d The general sentence imposed on the operation and conspiracy counts ran concurrently with that on the possession and maintenance counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-22\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that the conspiracy and substantive counts relating to \u00a7 22-1501 are duplicitous. Since the Government relied on identical evidence to sustain both counts, it is said that the proof submitted under the substantive count included every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>element necessary to the conspiracy count, including that of joint enterprise, and thereby infringed the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But appellants did not save the question for review on appeal by requesting the court below to compel an election of counts when the duplicity became apparent. Accordingly we are not required to consider the merits of this contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if we thought this contention was correct, we could not say appellants were prejudiced, since the sentence imposed on these two interrelated counts was less than the maximum permissible under either.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">As to all the appellants but Kingsbury, we think the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on all counts. The Government claims that Kingsbury\u2019s guilt is proved by activities related to an apartment at 851 Howard Road, S.E., which he is said to have been maintaining as gambling premises. During the police surveillance, Aikens, one of our appellants, regularly visited this apartment as part of his daily routine, under circumstances which justified the inference that he was a numbers pick-up man. But Kingsbury testified that, because of marital difficulties, he had moved from this address oh June 18, prior to surveillance. No evidence was offered specifically to refute this testimony, although the police stated they observed Kingsbury going into the apartment with Aikens on three occasions after June 18. On July 27 a search executed pursuant to a search warrant at that address revealed the presence of numbers slips and a notebook with numbers written in, but nothing appears to connect Kingsbury himself with that evidence. And, unlike the other appellants, Kingsbury was never arrested with numbers slips in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\"> Under applicable tests,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kingsbury\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on all four counts should have been granted. His mere association with Aikens as they entered the apartment does not implicate him in the conspiracy. With respect to the substantive counts, Kingsbury was never shown to be in possession of lottery tickets. The fact that slips were found in his former residence, without more, does not justify an inference that they belonged to him. Absent such proof, a violation of \u00a7 22-1502 is not established, nor can it be said that Kingsbury was guilty of maintaining gambling premises in violation of \u00a7 22-, 1505(b). The operation count under \u00a7 22-1501 likewise must fail. That section provides that proof of possession establishes a prima facie case. Lacking that presumption, there was no evidence (such as proof that bets were written in the apartment) from which it could reasonably be inferred that Kingsbury operated a lottery.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>We have considered appellants\u2019 other contentions in the light of this record and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Affirmed in Cases Nos. 12730, 12731, 12732 and 12734; reversed in Case No. 12733.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-5\">.
