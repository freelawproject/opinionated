Defendant, plaintiff there, prayed an injunction to prohibit future violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">On March 30, 1953, by consent of the parties, an order was entered granting Frankfort a permanent injunction restraining Economy from advertising, offering for sale or selling Frankfort liquors at less than the prices stipulated. Later, Economy was found guilty of contempt of court because of violation of the injunction, and fined, and thereafter discontinued selling Frankfort products. The decree of March 30, 1953 has never been vacated, modified, reversed or set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">Following these events, in July 1955, the present plaintiff, Economy, filed in the Superior Court of Cook County, the instant suit, which was later removed to the District Court of the United States. It averred that it was a member of an association of liquor dealers, other members of which had, when informed of plaintiff\u2019s conviction for contempt, threatened to discontinue selling defendant\u2019s products; that, thereupon, a representative of defendant informed other members they might disregard Frankfort\u2019s Fair Trade prices; that defendant sent one of the association members to plaintiff to say to it that the fine and costs of the prior litigation would be repaid to Economy if it would resume sale of Frankfort products, and that Economy refused so to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">Plaintiff\u2019s prayer for relief was that, inasmuch as the foregoing facts evinced an intention upon the part of Frankfort to abandon the benefit of the Fair Trade Act and to discriminate against plaintiff, defendant should be enjoined from enforcement of the act and plaintiff awarded $250,000 punitive damages. The district court allowed defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because, as it said, it appeared \u201cthat the matters set forth in the complaint should properly be brought in an appropriate proceeding relating to an injunction heretofore entered in a previous case.\u201d Consequently, the court held that plaintiff had not stated a claim. From the judgment of dismissal this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">It is apparent that the sole question presented is whether the decree of March 30, 1953 bars plaintiff\u2019s asserted cause of action. If the averments of plaintiff\u2019s complaint were true, in the absence of any prior judgment to the contrary, defendant could not invoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Fair Trade Act of Illinois, and could not succeed in a suit to restrain plaintiff from selling Frankfort\u2019s products below the fair trade prices. But the undisputed fact is that in the prior litigation an injunction has been entered prohibiting plaintiff from advertising or selling Frankfort\u2019s products. And, inasmuch as that injunction has never been modified, vacated or set aside or reversed, it is binding upon the parties thereto. Thus, in Rector v. Suncrest Lumber Co., 4 Cir., 52 F.2d 946, the court said at pages 947-948: \u201cThe effect of the judgment was to put an end to all litigation between the parties upon the questions determined in the earlier case, and these included the very essence of the present controversy. * * * Such a judgment precluded further litigation of the issue, for a judgment entered by consent is as conclusive and final as to any matter determined as one rendered <em>in invitwm </em>after contest and trial.\u201d In Curry v. Curry, 65 App.D.C. 47, 79 F.2d 172, 174, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reached the same conclusion, quoting the Supreme Court: \u201c <em>\u2018A fortiori, </em>neither party can deny its effect as. a bar of a subsequent suit,on any claim included in the decree.\u2019 Nashville, etc., Railway Company v. United States, 113 U.S. 261, 266, 5 S.Ct. 460, 462, 28 L.Ed. 971.\u201d And in Western Union Tel. Co. v. International Brotherhood, etc., 133 F.2d 955, this court had .occasion to comment at page 957, that: \u201cAn-injunction protects civil rights from irreparable injury, either by commanding acts' to be done, or preventing their commission, and the decree in such an action is an adjudication of the facts and the Ihw applicable thereto. The decree, however, is executory and continuing as to the purpose or object to be obtained, and operates until vacated, modified, or dissolved,\u201d citing Ladner v. Siegel, 298 Pa. 487, 148 A. 699, 68 A.L.R. 1172. In Fleming v. Warshawsky &amp; Co., 7 Cir., 123 F.2d 622, we again announced that a judgment of any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties may not be challenged or set aside in collateral proceedings, citing Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 48 S.Ct. 311, 72 L.Ed. 587. See also Bigelow v. Balaban &amp; Katz Corp., 7 Cir., 199 F.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As long as the injunction remains-in full force and effect against plaintiff it cannot maintain a complaint which! cannot be legally effective unless and until the existing injunction shall have-been removed by direct appeal, or modified in some direct proceeding. In other-words, the present complaint constitutes-an indirect attack upon, an earlier unreversed judgment. The district court rightfully dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was tantamount to an admission that defendant is liable as charged. Obviously, any motion to dismiss admits the well pleaded facts but only to the extent of applying the-tests of the legal sufficiency of the complaint. United States v. Geisler, 7 Cir., 174 F.2d 992, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 861, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 528. Such a motion does not admit that the facts-averred can be litigated in collateral proceedings in the face of a judgment cutting off all plaintiff\u2019s rights in the premises. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
