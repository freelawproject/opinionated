Gordon, Vice President of the Quaker Oats Company. Mr. Gordon testified that the mark \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d was used continuously by The Quaker Oats Company since 1917 in a region east of the Rocky Mountains until 1940 when its use became national. It was further testified that appellant has sold five and one-half million tons of animal feeds under the mark \u201cFul-O-Pep.\u201d It was also stated in the testimony that appellant has widely advertised its \u201cFul-OPep\u201d animal feeds by newspaper, trade-magazines, farm magazines, and radio; and has spent in excess of nine and one-half million dollars in advertising featuring its \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d trade-mark. Mr. Gordon also stated that appellant spent approximately $700,000 in advertising \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d during the year 1951, and that its advertising budget was in excess of the foregoing amount for the year 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Appellant also introduced deposition testimony of numerous witnesses who were either farmers or feed dealers. Their testimony, insofar as pertinent here, was to the effect that they were familiar with the mark \u201cFul-O-Pep,\u201d having either sold or used feeds bearing that trade-mark. These witnesses also professed familiarity with advertising relating to the. mark. It is also to be noted that the witnesses gave their opinions that customers would be confused by the marks \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d and \u201cVit-APep\u201d in the sense that these customers would believe that products appearing under the name \u201cVit-A-Pep\u201d were manufactured by the company manufacturing \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d products.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">Applicant-appellee, St. Joe Processing Company, Inc., filed no testimony, but filed a brief and was represented at the hearing before the Examiner of Interferences. However, appellee has neither filed a brief nor appeared for argument before our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">The Examiner of Interferences was of the opinion that the marks \u201cVit-APep\u201d and \u201cFul-O-Pep\" were not confusingly similar and dismissed the notice of opposition. In so doing, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">\u201cIt is noted in the comparison of the notations \u2018Vit-A-Pep\u2019 and \u2018Ful-O-Pep\u2019 that they are alike primarily in that both are composed of three syllables, and that both end in the word \u2018Pep\u2019. The initial portions of the marks consisting of the syllables \u2018Vita-A\u2019 [sic] and \u2018Ful-O\u2019 obviously contain nothing in common other than that they comprise the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>two syllables of the marks as a whole. These differences in the initial portions of the marks, it is believed render the marks as a whole so totally different in appearance, sound, and meaning, as to enable their contemporaneous use for the goods here involved, which obviously are purchased with care and certain amount of discrimination, without any reasonable likelihood of confusion, or mistake, or deception of purchasers as to the origin thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">An appeal was taken to the Assistant Commissioner by the present appellant. Insofar as pertinent here, the Assistant Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201cThe marks of the parties do not look alike, aside from the fact that they each comprise a succession of three letters, a hyphen, a capital letter, a hyphen, and the word \u2018Pep.\u2019 Purchasers do not, in my opinion, analyze trade-marks to that extent. The marks do not sound alike; and their connotations are different. They create entirely different commercial impressions. It is not believed that confusion, mistake or deception is likely to result if applicant\u2019s mark is registered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Appellant has appealed to us from the concurrent holdings of the tribunals below that the marks \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d and \u201cVit-A-Pep\u201d would not be likely to cause confusion. There is no doubt that the goods of the parties are identical. Furthermore, with respect to priority of use of the respective marks, the record indicates that appellant was the prior user of its mark. In this respect, the statement of the Examiner of Interferences, \u201c * * * [it] is conceded by the applicant [appellee], that the op-poser [appellant] was first in the use of its mark, * * *\u201d has not been controverted, and must therefore be accepted as being accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The sole question before us on appeal is whether the marks \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d and \u201cVit-A-Pep,\u201d when applied to identical goods, are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion in the trade and mislead purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Before reaching the main issue in the present case, we deem it necessary to comment on the weight to be given the witnesses\u2019 opinions that the marks would be likely to cause confusion. In this respect it has been held that such testimony amounts to nothing more than an expression of opinion by the witness, which obviously is not binding upon either the tribunals of the Patent Office or the courts. Ciba Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., v. Abbott Laboratories, 121 F.2d 551, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1315; Crown Fabrics Corp. v. American Viscose Corp., 145 F.2d 246, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 701. If such testimony were adopted without considering other aspects of the case, the effect would be to substitute the opinions of the witnesses for the ultimate decision to be reached by the court and would therefore be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">We now reach the question of whether the marks are so similar that they would be likely to cause confusion when applied to the identical goods of the parties. A part of the applicable law was stated in our recent case of L. J. Mueller Furnace Co. v. United Conditioning Corp., 42 C.C.P.A., Patents, 932, 222 F.2d 755, 757. We therefore quote the following portion of that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">\u201cThe test applied by this court in an opposition proceeding is the likelihood of confusion in the minds of the purchasing public as to the origin of the goods. Nestle\u2019s Milk Products, Inc., v. Baker Importing Co., Inc., 182 F.2d 193, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1066; Standard Laboratories, Inc., v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 167 F.2d 1022, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1146. This is a subjective test. Therefore prior decisions are of little value since each case must be decided on its own particular set of facts. North Star Manufacturing Co. v. Wells Lamont Corp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>193 F.2d 204, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 764.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">\u201cHowever, various rules have been developed for the purpose of aiding in the determination of the question of confusing similarity. It is well settled that the marks must be considered in their entireties, Apollo Shirt Co. v. Enro Shirt Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 469, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 849; Valpo Co. v. Solis, Entrialgo y Compania, 175 F.2d 457, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160. But different features may be analyzed to determine whether the marks are confusingly similar, Hoffman-La-Roche, Inc., v. Kawerk, 148 F.2d 557, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 954, and similarities and dissimilarities, should both be considered, Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., Inc., 94 F.2d 230, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 886.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5mF\">\u201cIt has also been held that the common portions of the marks cannot be disregarded, Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc., v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Furthermore, in determining the likelihood of confusion between marks on identical goods, it is proper to consider their appearance, sound, and meaning. Hancock v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co., etc., 203 F.2d 737, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 931; Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 150 F.2d 439, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We will now proceed to analyze the marks \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d and \u201cVit-A-Pep\u201d in view of the foregoing applicable law. In considering the marks in their entireties, it can be readily seen that they both consist of three syllables separated by hyphens. In this respect, the marks would tend to look alike. Furthermore, the marks, when different features thereof are analyzed, both have the suffix \u201cPep\u201d in common. The marks are dissimilar in that one has the words \u201cFul-O\u201d and the other \u201cVit-A\u201d as prefixes. We are of the opinion that \u201cFulO-Pep\u201d and \u201cVit-A-Pep,\u201d when viewed in their entireties, are not confusingly similar. Even <em>if </em>they are not viewed in their entireties, but the similarities and dissimilarities are compared, we find that while the suffixes \u201cPep\u201d are identical, the prefixes \u201cFul-O\u201d and \u201cVit-A\u201d do not look alike or sound alike. We feel that the dissimilarities by far outweigh the similarities, and thus cause the terms in their entireties to be more different than alike. Furthermore, we cannot see where the marks have the same meaning. It is therefore our opinion that the concurrent use of the marks \u201cVit-APep\u201d and \u201cFul-O-Pep\u201d would not be likely to cause confusion in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments, but we are of the opinion that the decision appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">WORLEY, J., concurs in the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">O\u2019CONNELL and COLE, JJ., because of illness, did not participate in the hearing or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
