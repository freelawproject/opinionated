This, it is alleged, constitutes an interference with the jurisdiction of the Federal court and with his rights and which interference he seeks to enjoin.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The trial court did not pass upon the merits of these contentions. It concluded it had no jurisdiction of the defendants who are residents of Missouri. It accordingly dismissed the petition. We think the trial court is correct in its conclusion and its judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
