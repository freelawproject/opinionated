Excel Auto Radiator Co. v. Bishop and Babcock Manufacturing Co., 6 Cir., 167 F.2d 962 certiorari denied 335 U.S. 823, 69 S.Ct. 46, 93 L.Ed. 377. Our opinion pointed out that, although it was old to heat the passenger compartment of an automobile with air warmed by the heat of the engine, radiated by the propulsion fan and moving in a single path; and, while it was also old to convey heated air to the windshield of an automobile for the purpose of defrosting it, \u201cthe Mayo device is a highly integrated unit operated by a single motor which produces two currents of heated air directed simultaneously in different directions, the elements coacting in performing the functions of both heater and defroster\u201d, resulting in a new combination. 167 F.2d 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In the subsequent action \u2014 brought by the assignee, The Bishop and Babcock Manufacturing Company, of which the inventor, Mayo, is president- \u2014 -for alleged infringement of Mayo Patent No. 2,322,-041, the plaintiff sought an injunction and an accounting. The defendant challenged the patentability of the Mayo device as not amounting to invention and for the alleged reason that the prior art disclosed anticipation of all the essential elements of the patent. Further defense was interposed because of alleged unreasonable delay and laches. With his customary painstaking study of the issues involved, our late lamented brother, District Judge Freed, made a careful analysis of the issues presented in the light of the opinion of this court in Excel v. Bishop and Babcook Manufacturing Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">The distinguished jurist held that the plaintiff is entitled to have Letters Patent No. 2,322,041 decreed to be valid and infringed by defendant\u2019s devices, No. 7762 and No. 7763; but that defendant\u2019s accused device No. 7733 does not infringe the aforementioned patent. An injunction against use of the two first-mentioned devices was ordered; likewise, an accounting <em>before </em>a <em>master was </em>ordered, to ascertain the damage sustained by the plaintiff from the sale and distribution of the accused devices, Nos. 7762 and 7763. The plaintiff was enjoined, however, from hereinafter asserting infringement in respect of the accused device No. 7733. Bishop and Babcock Manufacturing Co. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., D.C.N.D.Ohio, 125 F.Supp. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Inasmuch as this court has, in a published opinion, already presented its reasons for holding that the Mayo patented heater and defroster meets all requirements of a patentable combination in considering all the claims and elements involved, it is considered unnecessary to repeat our reasoning here. The district judge correctly interpreted our former opinion. We hold, further, that, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the district judge, he was correct in holding that the accused device does not infringe the plaintiff\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">The judgment of the district court is in all things affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
