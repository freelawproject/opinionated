As the denial of motion for summary judgment is not a final judgment in the case, we can entertain the appeal only by considering the denial of the motion as a denial of injunctive relief. So considered, the order denying such relief must be affirmed, as the administrative remedies prescribed by the recent South Carolina statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have not been exhausted. Carson v. Board of Education of McDowell County, 4 Cir., 227 F.2d 789. As plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive relief for this reason, we affirm the order in so far as it denies an injunction, without passing upon other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>questions raised in the case or approving the reasoning of the court below in denying the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A0na\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-15\">.
