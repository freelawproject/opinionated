Johnson was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Because Johnson had two prior felony convictions for the sale of a controlled substance, he was sentenced under the career offender guidelines of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Nevertheless, Johnson filed his motion pursuant to Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine quantity levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-20\">Johnson concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that defendants who were originally sentenced under \u00a7 4B l.l(b)\u2019s career offender table were not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because their guideline ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels which Amendment 706 had lowered. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30 (concluding \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">The district court did not err when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court lacked the authority to modify Johnson\u2019s sentence because Johnson was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Johnson\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
