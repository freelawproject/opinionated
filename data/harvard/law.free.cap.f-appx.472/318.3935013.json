Herrera argues that although the sentence is within the guidelines range of 46 to 57 months of imprisonment, the Guidelines that govern illegal reentry offenses lack an empirical foundation and therefore the appellate presumption of reasonableness that applies to within-guidelines sentences should not apply. He further argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to effectuate the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as the guidelines calculations double counted his criminal history and the sentence does not take into account his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-21\">Herrera correctly concedes that his argument regarding the appellate presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (2009), which held that the possibility of unjust sentences does not give this court authority to overturn the appellate presumption of reasonableness that applies to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009) (determining that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), \u201cdoes not require discarding the presumption [of reasonableness] for sentences based on non-empirically-grounded Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-22\">Herrera\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The argument that a sentence is unreasonable because the Guidelines governing illegal reentry offenses result in double counting of a prior criminal conviction has been rejected by this court. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31 &amp; n. 2. Also, Herrera\u2019s argument is essentially that this court second guess the district court\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which this court does not do. <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>F.3d at 767. Moreover, the sentencing decision reflects an individualized assessment based upon the facts that were presented in the district court and after consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Herrera\u2019s arguments do not overcome the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
