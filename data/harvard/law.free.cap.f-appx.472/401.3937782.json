Fuller argued that the district court erred in calculating his Guidelines range because his prior Tennessee conviction for Class E evading arrest, Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39 \u2014 16\u2014603(b)(1), was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). We disagreed and affirmed Fuller\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 655 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Tennessee evading arrest statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">(b)(1) It is unlawful for any person, while operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, alley or highway in this state, to intentionally flee or attempt to elude any law enforcement officer, after having received any signal from the officer to bring the vehicle to a stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">A violation of subsection (b) is a Class E felony unless the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to innocent bystanders or other third parties, in which case a violation of subsection (b) is a Class D felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-16-603(b)(l), (b)(3). Relying upon this language, Fuller asserted that his conviction for the less serious Class E felony required a finding that the offense was not a crime of violence. We rejected this contention, as this court had previously addressed and rejected this precise argument. <em>Fuller, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 657 (citing <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>594 F.3d 517, 521 (6th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Following the issuance of our opinion, the Supreme Court held that an Indiana conviction for knowing or intentional flight from law enforcement is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2270, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). In so holding, the Court expressly reserved the issue presented by Fuller. <em>See id. </em>at 2277 (\u201cThe Government would go further and deem it irrelevant ... whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it. As the above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand does not present the occasion to decide that question.\u201d). In light of this statement, the Supreme Court vacated our decision, and the decision in <em>Rogers, </em>and remanded for further consideration. <em>Fuller v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 755, 181 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3018, 180 L.Ed.2d 842 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">Since the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Sykes, </em>this court has once again decided that a Class E felony for Tennessee evading arrest qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>678 F.3d 429, 433 (6th Cir.2012). Because we are bound by <em>Doyle, </em>we adhere to our previous decision that Fuller\u2019s Class E felony for Tennessee evading arrest is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. \"A 'crime of violence\u2019 under the career-offender provision is interpreted identically to a 'violent felony\u2019 under [the] ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>580 F.3d 373, 380 n. 5 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
