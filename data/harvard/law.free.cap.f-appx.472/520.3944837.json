We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion a dismissal for failure to prosecute under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Henderson v. Duncan, </em>779 F.2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir.1986). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Anthony\u2019s petition without prejudice because Anthony failed to submit an application to proceed in for-ma pauperis or pay the requisite filing fee, even though he was given over five months to do so and warned that failure to comply with the court\u2019s order could result in dismissal. <em>See id. </em>(factors for dismissing under Rule 41(b)); <em>Ash v. Cvetkov, </em>739 F.2d 493, 497 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201c[Djismissal without prejudice is a more easily justified sanction for failure to prosecute.\u201d); <em>see also United States v.
