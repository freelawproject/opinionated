Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 453.554 and 453.566 qualifies as a conviction \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that Jiminez-Ochoa is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">We agree with the BIA that Jiminez-Ochoa\u2019s Nevada conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia is a conviction \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, rendering him removable from the United States. <em>See Luu-Le v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 911, 916 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">We also agree with the BIA that Jiminez-Ochoa is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he cannot establish seven years of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). Jiminez-Ochoa was \u201cadmitted\u201d to the United States on June 26, 2000, when he adjusted to LPR status. He committed the offense that rendered him removable on September 26, 2006. A period of continuous residence ceases to accrue on the date of commission of a removable offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). Therefore, JiminezOchoa only accrued continuous residence for a period of six years and three months, nine months shy of the requisite seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
