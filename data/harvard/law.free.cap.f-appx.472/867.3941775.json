BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">Vera Schubler petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order denying her motion for reconsideration. She contends that the Immigration Judge (IJ) did not have jurisdiction to find her inadmissible and order her removal. Alternatively, she claims that she is not inadmissible because her conviction for a crime of moral turpitude (CIMT) qualifies for the so-called petty offense exception under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). Exercising jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, we find no abuse of discretion and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-20\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b898-21\">Schubler, a native and citizen of Germany, became a lawful permanent resident (LPR) in 1969. In 1998, she was convicted of wire fraud and causing a criminal act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1342 and 1343. She was sentenced to supervised release and ordered to pay $75,949.22 in restitution. Schubler briefly left the country in 2003. On November 16, 2003, she applied for admission as an arriving alien and was paroled into the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>partment of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) charging Schubler with being inadmissible as an alien who has been convicted of a CIMT. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">At a hearing in August 2006, Schubler admitted the factual allegations in the NTA and conceded she was removable. At a later hearing, in December 2006) Schubler asserted that her 1998 conviction was a nonremovable offense under the petty offense exception to inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). As relevant here, that section provides an exception to inadmissibility for aliens convicted of a CIMT \u201cwho committed only one crime if ... the maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was convicted ... did not exceed imprisonment for one year and ... the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Schubler also informed the IJ that her application to renew her LPR card was pending with the United States Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), and that her spouse had filed an 1-130 visa petition with CIS seeking to adjust her status as the immediate relative of a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Schubler requested, and the IJ granted, several continuances of the removal proceedings pending CIS\u2019s adjudication of the 1-130 petition filed on her behalf. When the removal proceedings resumed, she reiterated her contention regarding applicability of the petty offense exception. She asserted that \u201cthe maximum penalty possible,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), refers to the maximum sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), as determined by the sentencing court. Schubler maintained that the sentencing range in her case was 6-12 months and therefore the maximum penalty possible \u201cdid not exceed imprisonment for one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also argued, citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii), that CIS had exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of her LPR status and, by renewing her LPR card, CIS had \u201cadmitted\u201d her into the United States. She therefore asked the IJ to terminate the removal proceedings. Alternatively, she asked the IJ to terminate the proceedings to allow CIS to exercise its jurisdiction over the 1-130 petition, which CIS had approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The IJ issued a decision finding Schubler removable based on her conviction for a CIMT. The IJ rejected her contention that her 1998 conviction qualified for the petty offense exception under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), concluding that \u201cthe maximum penalty possible,\u201d as used in that section, refers to the maximum penalty under the statute of conviction. The IJ found that the maximum penalty under Schubler\u2019s statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, was 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. The IJ did not address her jurisdictional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Schubler appealed the IJ\u2019s removal order to the BIA, arguing the IJ erred in construing the petty offense exception and in failing to terminate the proceedings to allow her to seek adjustment of status. The BIA dismissed her appeal. Schubler then filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing only that the BIA erred in construing the petty offense exception. The BIA denied Schubler\u2019s motion and she filed a petition for review with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Jurisdiction and Scope of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>but a petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the order, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(1). Therefore, to the extent that Schubler purports to raise issues related to the BIA\u2019s order dismissing her appeal, we do not have jurisdiction to review that decision because she failed to file a timely petition for review. <em>See Infanzon v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1359, 1361 (10th Cir.2004). Consequently, we have jurisdiction to review only the BIA\u2019s denial of Schubler\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>at 1361-62 (holding motions to reopen and reconsider are subject to judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Except to the extent a petitioner raises constitutional claims or questions of law, we do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable on the basis that she committed a CIMT. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) &amp; (D). Schubler has not raised a constitutional claim, and this court has construed the term \u201cquestions of law\u201d in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to include only \u201ca narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction.\u201d <em>Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1282 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Schubler\u2019s claim that her conviction qualifies her for the petty offense exception to inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) is such a question of law subject to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Schubler also argues that, by renewing her LPR card, CIS made the legal determination that she qualifies for the petty offense exception. She maintains that CIS\u2019s determination should be given deference. Assuming without deciding that this contention is reviewable under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we nonetheless conclude that we may not review it because Schubler did not raise it with the BIA. <em>See Rivera-Zurita v. INS, </em>946 F.2d 118, 120 &amp; n. 2 (10th Cir.1991) (\u201cJudicial review does not extend to points the alien could have made before the Board but did not.\u201d). But we may review Schubler\u2019s related contention that the IJ lacked jurisdiction to make the petty offense determination with respect to her because CIS had exclusive jurisdiction to determine her permanent resident status and her admission as an arriving alien. Although Schubler also failed to raise this contention with the BIA, \u201c[jjurisdictional challenges can be made by any party or the court at any time and are not subject to waiver or forfeiture.\u201d <em>Huerta v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 753, 755 (10th Cir.2006) (stating \u201c[w]e have jurisdiction over a case only when jurisdiction over the underlying order was proper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000 n. 5 (10th Cir.2003). Under that standard, \u201cany error of law is presumptively an abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>S. Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Bur. of Land Mgmt., </em>425 F.3d 735, 750 (10th Cir.2005), and we review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo, <em>Lockett v. INS, </em>245 F.3d 1126, 1128 (10th Cir.2001). We likewise review issues of jurisdiction de novo. <em>Huerta </em>443 F.3d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">We address Schubler\u2019s jurisdictional argument first. An IJ\u2019s authority in removal proceedings is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a)(l), which provides: \u201cAn immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility ... of an alien.\u201d That section states further that, \u201c[ujnless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(a)(3). Section 1182(a) sets forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>classes of aliens who are inadmissible, including those convicted of certain crimes, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2). Here, the IJ determined that Schubler was inadmissible based on her conviction for a CIMT that did not qualify her for the petty offense exception under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). Thus, absent a contrary provision in the same chapter, the IJ\u2019s ruling was squarely within its jurisdiction under \u00a7 1229a(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Schubler cites 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii), which provides: \u201cIn the case of an arriving alien who is placed in removal proceedings, the immigration judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by the arriving alien... ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She contends that the IJ exceeded his jurisdiction under this regulation in determining that she did not qualify for the petty offense exception. We disagree. While Schubler was \u201can arriving alien who [was] placed in removal proceedings,\u201d she fails to identify any application for adjustment of status that the IJ adjudicated in this case. To the contrary, in her appeal to the BIA she argued that the IJ erred by not terminating the removal proceedings in order to allow CIS to exercise its exclusive discretion over her pending application to adjust status. The BIA ruled, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYL0\">it is not appropriate to terminate proceedings when the alien is removable and has no relief from removal available in Immigration Court. Additionally, we note that the DHS retains jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for adjustment of status even where an administratively final order of removal remains outstanding, and may grant deferred action to a respondent if it chooses to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Admin. R. at 23. Although the IJ\u2019s inadmissibility determination terminated Schubier\u2019s previously granted LPR status as a matter of law, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2 (providing that LPR \u201cstatus terminates upon entry of a final administrative order of ... removal\u201d), in making that ruling the IJ did not \u201cadjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by [Schubler]\u201d in violation of \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii). We reject Schubler\u2019s claim that the IJ exceeded its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Schubler\u2019s second contention is that the BIA erred in concluding that she did not qualify for the petty offense exception to inadmissibility. That exception applies if three circumstances exist: (1) the alien committed only one crime; (2) \u201cthe maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was convicted (or which the alien admits having committed or of which the acts that the alien admits having committed constituted the essential elements) did not. exceed imprisonment for one year\u201d; and (3) \u201cif the alien was convicted of such crime, the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months (regardless of the extent to which the sentence was ultimately executed).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The BIA construed \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d as referring to the statutory maximum penalty for the crime of conviction. It therefore concluded that the exception did not apply to Schubler\u2019s conviction for we fraud, which (at the time she was convicted) carried a statutory maximum sentence of five years, with an alternative 30-year maximum sentence for a violation affecting a financial institution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1998). The BIA rejected Schubler\u2019s contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>sentencing court determines \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d based upon the guidelines imprisonment range applicable to the alien defendant. The BIA stated, \u201c[T]he plain language of the \u2018petty offense\u2019 exception is focused on the statutory maximum penalty for the \u2018crime\u2019 of conviction, rather than the guidelines maximum, which varies from one offender to another based on factors unrelated to the immediate \u2018crime,\u2019 such as criminal history.\u201d Admin. R. at 22. Although Schubler reasserted her argument regarding applicability of the petty offense exception in her motion for reconsideration, the BIA found no reason to revisit its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Schubler contends on appeal that the BIA erred in construing \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). Although this court has not addressed the meaning of \u201cthe maximum penalty possible,\u201d as used in that section, three of our sister circuits have rejected Schubler\u2019s position that this language refers to the maximum sentence based upon the guidelines imprisonment range applicable to the alien, rather than the statutory maximum penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">In <em>Mendez-Mendez v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 828, 833 (9th Cir.2008), the Ninth Circuit held that \u201c[t]he plain language of [\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) ] indicates that the phrase, \u2018the maximum penalty possible,\u2019 refers to the statutory maximum, not the maximum sentence under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d The court gave three reasons in support of its construction: (1) by requiring that the alien, if convicted, must have actually received a sentence of six months or less, \u201cthe statute already takes into consideration the fact that the sentence imposed might be below the maximum penalty possible\u201d; (2) the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cthe maximum penalty possible <em>for the crime </em>of which the alien was convicted\u201d most sensibly refers to the statutory maximum penalty; and (3) aliens who admit committing a crime, but were not convicted, are also eligible for the petty offense exception, but there would be no guidelines range in those circumstances defining the maximum penalty possible for the crime. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">In <em>Mejia-Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.2009), the First Circuit agreed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s construction. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">The statute itself makes no reference to the Sentencing Guidelines. The language of the statute plainly refers to the \u2018maximum penalty possible\u2019 and that maximum is set by statute. That maximum possible punishment is for \u2018the crime of which the alien was convicted,\u2019 a reference again to the statute of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-11\"><em>Id.-, accord, Vartelas v. Holder, </em>620 F.3d 108, 115-16 (2d Cir.2010), <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 70, 180 L.Ed.2d 939 (2011); <em>see also Matter of Ruiz-Lopez, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 551, 551 (BIA 2011) (holding petty offense exception inapplicable where guidelines range was 0-60 days\u2019 imprisonment, but maximum term of imprisonment for crime was five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">We join our sister circuits in holding that the plain meaning of \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d in \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), is the statutory maximum penalty possible for the crime. Schubler\u2019s construction would lead to the untenable conclusion that the maximum penalty possible means one thing (the maximum under the guidelines range) if the alien was convicted of the crime, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>something else (the statutory maximum penalty) if the alien admitted committing the crime or the acts constituting the essential elements of the crime, but was not convicted. <em>See Mendez-Mendez, </em>525 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Moreover, the criminal cases cited by Schubler are inapposite to the statutory construction question raised in this case. These decisions address the standard of appellate review for district courts\u2019 sentencing determinations, <em>see United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 805-09 (10th Cir.2008), or the requirement that facts used to increase the penalty for a crime above the statutory maximum be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Nor does <em>In Re Cota-Vargas, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 849 (BIA 2005), inform our interpretation of the meaning of \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d in the petty offense exception. Schubler asserts this case supports the proposition \u201cthat the maximum sentence of imprisonment is the time period that is issued by the underlying court without regard to its reasoning.\u201d Pet. Opening Br. at 24. But <em>Cota-Vargas </em>reaches no such holding. The BIA concluded it would give full faith and credit to a state court\u2019s decision to modify an alien\u2019s sentence nunc pro tunc so that his offense would no longer be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d subjecting him to removal. <em>See Cota-Vargas, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 852-53. Although Schubler suggests otherwise, the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d at issue in <em>CotaVargas </em>does not refer to \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d or use any similar language. <em>See id. </em>at 850; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (defining aggravated felony to include \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [was] at least one year\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">The BIA did not err in construing \u201cthe maximum penalty possible\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) as referring to the statutory maximum penalty for the crime of which the alien was convicted. Schubler fails to establish that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
