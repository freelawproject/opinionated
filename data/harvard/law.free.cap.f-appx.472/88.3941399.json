Nelson, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and cancellation of removal. <em>In re Chiaka Tolo, </em>No. A072 021 595 (B.I.A. Sept. 14, 2011), <em>aff'ing, </em>No. A072 021 595 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 29, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">Under the circumstances presented, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Because Tolo does not advance any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his claims for withholding of removal, CAT relief, and cancellation of removal, he has waived these claims and we decline to consider them. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Furthermore, we lack jurisdiction to review Tolo\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his asylum claim on timeliness grounds. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 720 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Although we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law and constitutional claims, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Tolo\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s finding that he did not establish changed circumstances is simply a challenge to the agency\u2019s fact-finding, over which we do not have jurisdiction. <em>See Gui Yin Liu, </em>508 F.3d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The petition for review is therefore DISMISSED. Any pending request for oral argument is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b), and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
