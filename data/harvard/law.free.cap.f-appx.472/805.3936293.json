Coates argues the admission of testimony about his prior acts rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and that without that testimony, the jury could not have found him guilty of committing three or more acts of substantial sexual conduct with a child under the age of fourteen, as required by \u00a7 288.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we may grant a habeas petition only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cforbidden by \u2018clearly established Federal law,\u2019 as laid out by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Holley v. Yarborough, </em>568 F.3d 1091, 1101 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). A legal principle is \u201cclearly established\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) if \u201cit is embodied in a holding of [the Supreme] Court.\u201d <em>Thaler v. Haynes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1171, 1173, 175 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2010) (citing <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 74, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Although the Supreme Court has said the writ should issue \u201cwhen constitutional errors have rendered the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d the Supreme Court \u201chas not yet made a clear ruling that admission of irrelevant or overtly prejudicial evidence constitutes a due process violation sufficient to warrant issuance of the writ.\u201d <em>Holley, </em>568 F.3d at 1101. The Supreme Court reserved the issue of whether admitting other-crimes evidence to show conduct in conformity therewith violates due process. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>see also Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 863 (9th Cir.2006). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the California Court of Appeal acted in an objectively unreasonable manner in concluding that the propensity evidence introduced against Coates did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b835-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
