He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that the district court denied the motion on March 21, 2012. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Williams\u2019 motion, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We also deny Williams\u2019 pending motion for a certif\u00edcate of appealability without prejudice to his ability to re-file it in his direct appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
