We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Januar did not experience harms in Indonesia that rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1059-60; <em>see also Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, even as a member of a disfavored group, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Januar has not established a clear probability of persecution in Indonesia, because she has not demonstrated sufficient individualized risk, <em>see Hoxha, </em>319 F.3d at 1185; <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence\u201d), and has not shown that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians, <em>see Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1060-62. Accordingly, Januar\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We grant Cindy S. Chang\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel for Januar.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
