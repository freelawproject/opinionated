The motion was pursuant to the amendments in 2011 to the cocaine-base offense levels in the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Hargers contends: <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), required the court to reduce his sentence; and it abused its discretion in considering his prior convictions, his post-conviction conduct, and that, absent his plea agreement, he may have received a higher sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (providing for increased sentence due to prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">The decision to reduce <em>vel non </em>a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the court first determines whether defendant is eligible for a reduction and the extent of that authorized reduction. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691. Next, the court must consider any applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and determine whether any reduction is warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">The court implicitly determined Hargers was eligible for a reduction, <em>see United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011), but concluded that it was not warranted in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of his case. Having concluded that Hargers was eligible for a reduction, the court was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(i)-(ii). Moreover, the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and was permitted to consider Hargers\u2019 post-sentencing conduct. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B)(i)-(iii). Thus, Hargers has failed to show an abuse of discretion in denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
