Gear alleged that UFT violated the duty of fair representation and that both defendants violated, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>by discriminating against Gear on account of her race. In an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of December 21, 2010, the district court dismissed Gear\u2019s claims against UFT pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In an order of March 30, 2011, the district court granted DOE\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Gear\u2019s claims against DOE. Gear now appeals both judgments. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">As to Gear\u2019s claims against UFT, we review de novo dismissals under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(6) of Rule 12. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Scherer v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of U.S., </em>347 F.3d 394, 397 (2d Cir.2003). The district court correctly dismissed Gear\u2019s claims against UFT for breach of the duty of fair representation under the National Labor Relations Act and Labor Management Relations Act because Gear was an employee of DOE, a political subdivision of a state, and those acts exclude public employees from coverage. <em>See Ford v. D.C. 37 Union Local 1549, </em>579 F.3d 187, 188 (2d Cir.2009) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of public employee\u2019s federal duty of fair representation claim). Insofar as the district court erred by failing to construe Gear\u2019s claim of \u201cfailure to represent correctly\u201d as raising a fair representation claim under <em>state </em>law, <em>see </em>N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law \u00a7 209-a(2)(c), we affirm the dismissal of any such claim Gear may be construed to have alleged because the court properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gear\u2019s state claims upon its dismissal of the federal claims. In addition, the district court correctly dismissed Gear\u2019s Title VII claims against UFT because she made only conclusory allegations and provided no factual allegations in support. <em>See Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As to Gear\u2019s Title VII claims against DOE, we review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment as to Gear\u2019s claim of discriminatory suspension and termination because DOE provided evidence that its actions were based on Gear\u2019s disciplinary violations, and Gear provided no evidence \u2014 other than her own unsubstantiated denials \u2014 that this proffered legitimate justification was pretextual. <em>See, e.g., St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Gear\u2019s hostile environment claim also fails because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the alleged abusive conduct was sufficiently \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d under <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), the claim is time-barred: the alleged racist conduct occurred more than 300 days before Gear filed her Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge. <em>See Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, </em>80 F.3d 708, 712 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Finally, the court properly granted summary judgment as to Gear\u2019s retaliation claims because Gear failed to establish a causal connection between any protected activity and adverse employment actions. Gear\u2019s 2005 charge was too temporally remote from her 2007 termination to establish a causal connection, and her March 2007 charge was filed <em>after </em>she was suspended and terminated. Gear\u2019s informal complaints cannot support a retaliation claim because Gear admitted that these complaints were unrelated to any arguable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Title VII violation. <em>See Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Natl Realty &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 292 (2d Cir.1998) (explaining that \u201cprotected activity,\u201d requires a showing that the plaintiff \u201cpossessed a good faith, reasonable belief\u2019 that the conduct violated Title VII (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We have considered all of Gear\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgments of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\">. Although referred to by Gear and the district court as the DOE, that entity is properly known as the \u201cBoard of Education of the City School District of New York.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
