This court reviews an immigration court\u2019s rulings of law de novo. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>An immigration court\u2019s findings of fact, including any finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum, are reviewed to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.Sd 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under substantial evidence review, this court may not reverse a factual finding unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concedes, the BIA assumed that Lin had established past persecution. \u201cA showing of past persecution sets up a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). DHS may rebut that presumption by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the \u201capplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality\u201d or (2) there has been a \u201cfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i). Both the IJ and BIA determined that DHS had rebutted the presumption by showing both that Lin could relocate safely within China and that there had been a fundamental change in circumstances. Lin has not specifically challenged those determinations in his petition for review. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that an applicant\u2019s failure to include specific issues in his petition for review results in abandonment of any claims of error he might have raised regarding the decisions related to .those issues). Even if not waived, the record supports those determinations. Lin has not shown that the BIA erred in determining that he was ineligible for asylum. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Lin also has not shown that the BIA erred in denying his requests for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Faddoul v. I.N.S., </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). His remaining arguments either lack relevance or raise a new issue for the first time, which this courts lacks jurisdiction to consider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
