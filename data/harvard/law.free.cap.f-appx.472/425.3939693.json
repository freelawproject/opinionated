We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">1. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief because it is a discretionary determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Although that jurisdictional limitation does not prohibit our \u201creview of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Vo has not raised any such claims or questions. Vo\u2019s argument that the Immigration Judge failed to properly weigh the equities is an attempt to \u201ccreate the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Bazua-Cota v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 747, 749 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cIn an attempt to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review, Petitioner contends that the BIA and IJ violated his right to due process by failing to properly weigh the equities and hardship before denying his application for adjustment of status. This argument is an abuse of discretion challenge re-characterized as an alleged due process violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">2. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the record does not compel the conclusion that Vo is more likely than not to suffer torture if removed to Vietnam. Vo\u2019s three subsequent trips to Vietnam suggest that relocation within the country is possible. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir.2004) ([I]n the CAT context ... the petitioners have the burden of presenting evidence to show that internal relocation is not a possibility) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(ii)). We accordingly deny Vo\u2019s petition for review with regard to his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b456-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
