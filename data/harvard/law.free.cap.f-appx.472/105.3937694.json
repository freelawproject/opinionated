For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-24\">In 1992, Rivera was convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of various drug charges, including distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860. He received a sentence of 292 months in prison. Rivera filed a direct appeal, which was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In May 1993, Rivera filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied relief on the merits and we affirmed. Rivera has since brought many challenges to his conviction and sentence, including motions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, habeas petitions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, all of which have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In 2010, Rivera filed a habeas petition in the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in which he argued, inter alia, that he was entitled to relief under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>443 F.3d 293 (3d Cir.2006). In <em>Jackson, </em>we held that because \u00a7 841(a)(1) (distribution of cocaine) is a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 860 (distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school), conviction of both crimes based on the same set of facts violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 301. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that Rivera was required to present this claim in a petition pursuant to \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. The District Court denied Rivera\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, and we affirmed. <em>Rivera v. Scism, </em>438 Fed.Appx. 154 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Rivera then returned to the District Court and filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) in which he again argued that he was entitled to relief under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson. </em>The District Court denied relief, explaining that Rivera had merely reiterated the <em>Jackson </em>argument that it had already rejected. Rivera now appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, </em>536 F.3d 244, 251 (3d Cir.2008). Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis available only in cases evidencing extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Martinez-McBean v. Gov\u2019t of V.I., </em>562 F.2d 908, 911 (3d Cir.1977) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. As the District Court explained, Rivera\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion merely reiterated the <em>Jackson </em>argument that he presented in support of his \u00a7 2241 petition, which both the District Court and this Court held could not be raised by way of \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is well established that a Rule 60(b) motion may not be used as a substitute for an appeal, <em>see Smith v. Evans, </em>853 F.2d 155, 158 (3d Cir.1988), or as a means of seeking review of this Court\u2019s previous opinion in this case, <em>see Reform Party v. Allegheny Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Elections, </em>174 F.3d 305, 312 (3d Cir.1999). Rivera has inappropriately resorted to Rule 60(b)(6) to re-litigate his purported \u00a7 2241 petition. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Rivera was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Accordingly, because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. We grant Rivera\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AGg\">. Rivera also raised this claim in a motion for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which this Court denied. (C.A. No. 09-2000, May 19, 2009.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
