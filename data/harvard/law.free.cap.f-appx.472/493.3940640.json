Korman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Plaintiff Canyon View Estates (\u201cCanyon View\u201d) sued Defendants Homeside Lending (\u201cHomeside\u201d) and Homeside\u2019s Attorneys (\u201cthe Attorneys\u201d) for malicious prosecution. Homeside and the Attorneys filed anti-SLAPP motions to strike the pleadings pursuant to Cal. Civ.Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(2). The trial court denied Homeside\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion and granted the Attorneys\u2019 anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., as the receiver of Homeside, appeals the denial of Homeside\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. Canyon View appeals the grant of the Attorneys\u2019 anti-SLAPP motion. This court has jurisdiction over a denial of an anti-SLAPP motion as an appealable interlocutory order, and a grant of an anti-SLAPP motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Batzel v. Smith, </em>333 F.3d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir. 2003). We affirm the grant of the Attorneys\u2019 anti-SLAPP motion, reverse the denial of Homeside\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">1. <em>Standard of Review </em>\u2014 We apply the same rules that California state courts apply in ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion. <em>See Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1109 (9th Cir.2003). We review an anti-SLAPP ruling <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1102. We \u201cconsider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(2). \u201c[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d <em>Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche, </em>31 Cal.4th 728, 741, 3 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 74 P.3d 737 (2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">To support a claim for malicious prosecution, Canyon View must show that Homeside lacked probable cause to litigate the underlying action. <em>See Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker, </em>47 Cal.3d 863, 867, 254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498 (1989). Probable cause is a determination that, on the basis of the facts known to the plaintiff in the underlying suit, the suit was legally tenable. <em>Id. </em>at 878, 254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498. A denial of a defense motion for summary judgment in the underlying suit establishes probable cause, <em>see Roberts v. Sentry Life Ins., </em>76 Cal.App.4th 375, 378, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>90 Cal.Rptr.2d 408 (1999), unless the ruling is shown to have been obtained by fraud or perjury, <em>see Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester, </em>28 Cal.4th 811, 820, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733 (2002). If the ruling was obtained by fraud, a malicious prosecution plaintiff must further show that the court \u201cwould have granted summary judgment \u2018but for\u2019\u201d the fraud. <em>Antounian v. Louis Vuitton Malletier, </em>189 Cal.App.4th 438, 452, 117 Cal.Rptr.3d 3 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">2. <em>Probable Cause for Declaratory Judgment on the Lien (the Notice </em>Issue)\u2014 In this case, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision established probable cause for all counts of the Second Amended Complaint. Assuming without deciding that Homeside obtained this ruling by fraud, the alleged fraud was not a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. <em>See Antounian, </em>189 Cal.App.4th at 452, 117 Cal.Rptr.3d 3 (requiring \u201cbut for\u201d causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Rittenhouse Email establishes nothing conclusive of Homeside\u2019s receipt of the December 15 notice. It states neither the date SCME forwarded a notice to Home-side nor the date Homeside received such notice. The testimony that SCME regularly forwarded mail to lenders and that Homeside kept no record of incoming mail also fails to establish the relevant dates. None of this evidence would have altered the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding that \u201cthe entire sequence of events raises triable issues\u201d as to whether Canyon View gave Homeside \u201ca reasonable opportunity to protect its security interest and cure the default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Canyon View\u2019s theory that Homeside assigned the debt to Aurora in March 1998, prior to filing suit, is implausible. Home-side and Aurora have explained that Homeside held and serviced the debt until 2005, assigned it to Aurora in 2005, and repurchased it in 2006. Canyon View\u2019s theory is inconsistent with the intent and course of conduct of the actual parties to the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Finally, as to the type of relief sought, Homeside\u2019s claims for declaratory relief \u201cset[ ] forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties under a written instrument and requested] that these rights and duties be adjudged by the court.\u201d <em>See Davis v. Santa Ana, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 669, 684, 239 P.2d 656 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">3. <em>Probable Cause for the Fraud Claim </em>\u2014 In the underlying suit, two factors supported probable cause for the fraud claim. First, the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding in the consolidated case of <em>Norwest v. Canyon View Estates </em>laid out a theory of fraud equally applicable to the facts underlying Homeside\u2019s action. Second, the Attorneys suspected that Nancy Stelling of La Quinta dealt with Canyon View on the Allbee loan. Stelling filed a declaration in support of Norwest\u2019s fraud claims and worked for the same company that originated the Allbees\u2019 loan and the loans in the <em>Norwest </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">4. <em>Probable Cause for the Equitable Lien </em>\u2014 In the underlying suit, the Court of Appeal ruled that Homeside \u201cwould be entitled to an equitable lien on each homeowner/trustor\u2019s leasehold interest\u201d even if the deed of trust failed. Nothing about Canyon View\u2019s evidence of alleged fraud on the Court of Appeal alters this holding that an equitable lien could exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">5. <em>Probable Cause for the Accounting Claim </em>\u2014 Canyon View re-rented the land and sold the Allbees\u2019 home to a new tenant. Because of Canyon View\u2019s actions, a claim for accounting is legally tenable. Homeside needed to know how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>much money Canyon View received from the lease with the new tenant and from the sale of the Allbees\u2019 home. <em>See Teselle v. McLoughlin, </em>173 Cal.App.4th 156, 180, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 696 (2009) (\u201cAn accounting is a species of disclosure, predicated upon the plaintiffs legal inability to determine how much money, if any, is due.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">6. <em>Probable Cause for Unjust Enrichment and Constructive Trust </em>\u2014 Canyon View\u2019s arguments that the claims for unjust enrichment and construction trust lacked probable cause are premised on the belief that Homeside \u201cwas not entitled\u201d to \u201cCanyon View\u2019s property.\u201d This premise is inconsistent with the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding that Homeside had a valid and enforceable lien on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">7. <em>Probable Cause for Relief from Forfeiture </em>\u2014 Homeside\u2019s complaint alleged that even if Canyon View sent timely notices, it deserved relief from forfeiture of its security interest. A reasonable attorney would have viewed Homeside\u2019s claim to have \u201cincur[red] a forfeiture\u201d \u201cby the terms of an obligation,\u201d without a \u201cgrossly negligent, willful, or fraudulent breach of duty\u201d as legally tenable. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3275.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">8. <em>Probable Cause for the Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 Violation </em>\u2014 In a claim for violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200, a reasonable attorney would have viewed Homeside, a lender to mobile home tenants, as a proper representative in protecting tenants and lenders from Canyon View\u2019s alleged misconduct. <em>See Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>17 Cal.4th 553, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 735-36, 950 P.2d 1086 (1998) (private for-profit plaintiff that suffered no injury may sue to obtain relief for others for \u00a7 17200 violation).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">9. <em>The Attorneys </em>\u2014 Except with respect to the Rittenhouse Email, which the Attorneys learned of belatedly, the Attorneys litigated the claims on the basis of the same facts as Homeside. <em>See Daniels v. Robbins, </em>182 Cal.App.4th 204, 222-23, 105 Cal.Rptr.3d 683 (2010) (evaluating probable cause of a lawyer based on information obtained from client). Canyon View has not alleged otherwise. For this reason, the Attorneys had probable cause to the extent Homeside did.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">10. <em>Conclusion </em>\u2014 Because the pleadings and affidavits fail to state and substantiate a claim for malicious prosecution, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the Attorneys\u2019 anti-SLAPP motion and reverse its denial of Homeside\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">Canyon View, et al. shall bear costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b525-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. In 2004, California adopted a voter initiative constricting standing under \u00a7 17200. <em>See Branick v. Downey Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, </em>39 Cal.4th 235, 240, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 138 P.3d 214 (2006). Because Homeside filed its complaint before these changes to \u00a7 17200 standing took effect, we need not take them into account.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
