Black alleged disability due to depressive disorder severe with psychotic features, polysubstance abuse, obesity, chronic back pain, and anxiety disorder. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits to ensure that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and a correct application of the law. <em>Roberts v. Shalala, </em>66 F.3d 179, 182 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) applied the five-step sequential evaluation process to determine if Black is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. At step one, the ALJ determined that Black had not been engaged in substantial gainful activity since September 1, 2006, the alleged disability onset date. At step two, the ALJ found that Black had two severe impairments: (1) major depressive disorder, chronic, severe with psychotic features, and (2) polysubstance abuse. At step three, the ALJ determined that Black did not have an impairment that meets the criteria of an impairment listed at 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. The ALJ then found that Black had the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work but with non-exertional limitations, and at step four, the ALJ concluded that Black is capable of performing her past relevant work as a dishwasher, and .therefore is not disabled. Alternatively, at step five, the ALJ concluded that Black is not disabled because there are other jobs that exist in significant numbers in the economy that she can perform, including work as a night cleaner.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">The ALJ erred at step two by not considering whether Black\u2019s anxiety disorder is a severe impairment. Treating physician Dr. Woyna diagnosed Black as suffering from anxiety disorders and Black alleged that she was disabled in part due to anxiety disorder. By disregarding the anxiety disorder diagnosis, the ALJ failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>to offer the \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons\u201d required to reject a treating doctor\u2019s conclusions. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the anxiety disorder is not a severe impairment in the absence of any mention of the disorder. We cannot determine whether the error was harmless because the ALJ did not provide a statement of reasons for rejecting evidence relevant to Black\u2019s residual functional capacity, and therefore we do not know whether the ALJ\u2019s omission was \u201cinconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.\u201d <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the ALJ to consider all of the evidence. We do not reach Black\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b522-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
