He argues that the trial court improperly admitted propensity and other prejudicial evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of kidnapping to commit rape, both alleged errors in violation of his due process rights. A court reviewing a habeas petition considers the last reasoned opinion of the state court, in this case that of the California Court of Appeal. <em>See Womack v. Del Papa, </em>497 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.2007). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. The facts of this case are known to the parties. We need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-26\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus and may affirm the judgment on any ground supported in the record. <em>Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, </em>80 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir.1996). Because Greel filed his petition after April 24, 1996, the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>(AEDPA) applies. <em>See Greenway v. Schriro, </em>653 F.3d 790, 797 (9th Cir.2011). Under AEDPA, a reviewing court considers whether the state court\u2019s adjudication of a claim was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Ninth Circuit precedent \u201csquarely forecloses [the] argument\u201d that admission of evidence of sexual misconduct to show propensity violates due process. <em>See Mejia v. Garcia, </em>534 F.3d 1036, 1046 (9th Cir.2008). Greel is unable to identify Supreme Court case law clearly establishing this principle such that would justify issuing the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">There is likewise no clearly established federal law that admitting prejudicial evidence violates due process. <em>See Holley v. Yarborough, </em>568 F.3d 1091, 1101 (9th Cir. 2009). Greel argues that we should infer this specific protection for criminal defendants from the Supreme Court\u2019s cases holding that errors that undermine the fundamental fairness of a criminal trial justify granting the writ. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 375, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 70, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). But \u201c[u]nder AEDPA, even clearly erroneous admissions of evidence that render a trial fundamentally unfair may not permit the grant of federal habeas corpus relief if not forbidden by \u2018clearly established Federal law,\u2019 as laid out by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Holley, </em>568 F.3d at 1101 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). The Supreme Court has made no such ruling with regard to prejudicial evidence, <em>id., </em>and thus we may not issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">We construe the briefed but uncertified claim that insufficient evidence supports Greeks conviction of kidnapping to commit rape as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. So construed, the motion is denied. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b533-27\"> phis disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
