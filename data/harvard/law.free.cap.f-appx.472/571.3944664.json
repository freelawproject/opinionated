We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We grant in part and deny in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-25\">In evaluating Kwek\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, the agency appears to have concluded the attack that occurred at Kwek\u2019s rice mill and the attack on Kwek\u2019s son were random acts of violence and not a basis for relief. Substantial evidence does not support this finding. <em>See Sinha v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhat the IJ described is not random violence, but violence with a distinct racial slant.\u201d). Accordingly, because the agency did not consider these incidents in evaluating Kwek\u2019s claim of past persecution and his fear of future persecution, as a member of disfavored groups, we grant the petition with respect to petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>With respect to CAT relief, Kwek has failed to establish a clear probability he faces torture if removed to Indonesia. <em>See, Zheng v. Holder, </em>644 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cTo receive relief under CAT, Petitioner has the burden of showing that he is more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The government shall bear the costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
