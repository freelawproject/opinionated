The court revoked his supervised release and imposed a sentence of nine months\u2019 incarceration followed by twenty-four months of supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">1. The district court\u2019s decision to allow a statement from the Henrys\u2019 lawyer on their behalf was not an abuse of discretion, even though the Henrys did not qualify as a statutorily-recognized \u201cvictim\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771 (the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, \u201cCVRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">At sentencing, the district court has a wide range of discretion in admitting whatever evidence it deems relevant. <em>See Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994). Indeed, \u201cunder the Guidelines, a sentencing judge \u2018may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise <em>prohibited </em>by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>114 F.3d 896, 898 (9th Cir.1997) (emphasis added) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">None of the authorities relied upon by Rizzolo prohibited the Henrys\u2019 lawyer from making a statement. The CVRA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771, and Rule 32(i) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure merely mandate situations where the district court must allow individuals to be heard. However, these provisions say nothing about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>prohibiting individuals from being heard. Therefore, while Rizzolo is correct that the district court was not <em>required </em>to allow the Henrys\u2019 lawyer to speak on their behalf as victims under the CVRA, Rizzolo is incorrect when he argues that the district court still had no <em>discretion </em>to allow the lawyer to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The district court carefully explained its reasons for allowing the Henrys\u2019 lawyer to make a statement. Because those reasons were not implausible or illogical, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1263 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">2. Even if the district court did abuse its discretion, Rizzolo suffered no prejudice from this error. Rizzolo does not challenge the district court\u2019s findings that he committed the alleged acts violating the terms and conditions of his probation. Rizzolo also does not claim that these facts were insufficient to support the district court\u2019s revocation decision under the \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). In addition, the record does not indicate that the district court judge relied on the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s statements in making its sentencing determination. Accordingly, any error Rizzolo suffered regarding this statement was not prejudicial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), Rizzolo filed a letter arguing that, in <em>United States v. Grant, </em>664 F.3d 276, 282 (9th Cir.2011), we applied the rule from <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011) to prohibit the district court from considering retribution as a purpose for imprisoning someone for violating conditions of supervised release. Rule 28\u00ae letters may include additional authorities discovered after the filing of the brief. Fed. R.App. P. 28\u00ae. However, a Rule 28\u00ae letter <em>\"cannot </em>raise a new issue\u201d that was not addressed in the briefs. <em>United States v. La-Pierre, </em>998 F.2d 1460, 1466 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1993). Thus, the issue Rizzolo raised is not properly before us, because it contained additional argument never discussed in either his opening or reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
