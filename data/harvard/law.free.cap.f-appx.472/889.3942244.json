No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">Bush filed a section 1983 complaint against all federal and State of Georgia judges, all federal district and appellate courts, the United States Supreme Court, the judicial branches of both the United States and the State of Georgia, and the State of Georgia. He contended that defendants failed to protect him from the executive and legislative branches\u2019 alleged constitutional violations. The magistrate judge \u2014 concluding that Bush\u2019s \u201crambling, nonsensical, and eonclusory allegations lack[ed] an arguable basis either in law or in fact\u201d \u2014 recommended that the complaint be dismissed without prejudice as frivolous under section 1915(e)(2). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">In his two-page appellate brief, Bush argues that defendants \u201chave failed to observe and follow the Constitution of the United States as written, and in doing so, have violated [his] 14th Amendment, Equal Protection Rights.\u201d Bush makes no specific argument in support of his claim. Instead, he merely sets forth a hypotheti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>cal traffic court case that is unrelated to his original complaint. \u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). Because Bush failed to raise adequately issues that were before the district court, he has abandoned all issues on appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b920-16\"> Even if Bush had not abandoned his arguments on appeal, we agree that Bush\u2019s complaint lacked \"arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>See Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Bush\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
