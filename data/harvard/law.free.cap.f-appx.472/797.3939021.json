We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review in No. 09-70030 and remand, and we dismiss the petition for review in No. 10-73768.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">There is no inconsistency between Shura\u2019s documentary evidence and his testimony with respect to the year that the Healthy Society Citizen\u2019s Movement started. <em>See Morgan v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 1202, 1209 (9th Cir.2008) (no inconsistency between application and testimony). In addition, the discrepancy regarding the date which Shura became Secretary of the Healthy Society Citizen\u2019s Movement is a trivial inconsistency that has no bearing on Shura\u2019s credibility. <em>See Ren v. Holder, </em>648 F.3d 1079, 1085-86 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cminor discrepancies in dates that ... cannot be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution have no bearing on credibility\u201d). Finally, considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the last inconsistency the IJ cited appears to be an \u201cinnocent mistake.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1087. Therefore, substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1089. Accordingly, we remand Shura\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, on an open record, for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2009); <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In light of our above conclusion, we dismiss as moot Shura\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">No. 09-70030: PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">No. 10-73768: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b827-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
