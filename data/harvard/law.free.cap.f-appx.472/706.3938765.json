Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Pacheco-Sierra\u2019s motion to reopen because the BIA considered the evidence submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining Pacheco-Sierra did not show prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under- the Convention Against Torture. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought); <em>see also Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">In the opening brief, Pacheco-Sierra does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that the motion to reconsider the deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>al of his cancellation of removal claim was not timely filed. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Pacheco-Sierra\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal and his related due process claim, because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b737-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
