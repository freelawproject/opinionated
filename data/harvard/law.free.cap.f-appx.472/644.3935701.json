Madison Indus., Inc., of Ariz., </em>84 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cIf, on its face, the award represents a plausible interpretation of the contract, judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be enforced.\u201d <em>Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local No. 359 v. Ariz. Mech. &amp; Stainless, Inc., </em>863 F.2d 647, 653 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The arbitrator plausibly considered \u201cdue process\u201d to be a contractual component of \u201cjust cause,\u201d and therefore submitted for arbitration in accordance with the contract. <em>See Federated Dep\u2019t Stores v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 1442, </em>901 F.2d 1494, 1497-98 (9th Cir.1990). Even if the due process violation here was \u201ctechnical,\u201d as Gruma argues, \u201cthe arbitrator derived his decision from the essence of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1497. And to the extent there is any contradiction in the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning, we are not permitted to review arbitration awards at that level of specificity. <em>See id. </em>at 1497 n. 2. Lastly, the award was not a \u201csubstantial windfall.\u201d The arbitrator found that the employee\u2019s contractual due process rights were violated by the employer, and awarded the employee backpay to compensate for that violation. The award was therefore nonpunitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
