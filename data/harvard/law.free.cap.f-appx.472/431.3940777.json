Having pled guilty pursuant to a conditional guilty plea, Frank appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the government\u2019s motion to exclude Frank\u2019s defense of diminished capacity and related expert testimony. We review <em>de novo </em>whether diminished capacity is a defense to a charged offense. <em>United States v. Vela, </em>624 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2010). We do not recite the facts as they are known to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">A diminished capacity defense is \u201cordinarily available only when a crime requires proof of a specific intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Twine, </em>853 F.2d 676, 679 (9th Cir.1988)). Assault resulting in seriously bodily injury is a general intent crime. <em>United States v. Fitzgerald, </em>882 F.2d 397, 399 (9th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Voluntary manslaughter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, is also a general intent crime. <em>Kane v. United States, </em>399 F.2d 730, 736 (9th Cir.1968). There is no legal authority for Frank\u2019s claim that his alleged use of a weapon transformed these charges into specific intent crimes. Because the crimes with which Frank was charged are both general intent crimes, we hold that the district court did not err in excluding the defense of diminished capacity and any evidence thereof. <em>Vela, </em>624 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
