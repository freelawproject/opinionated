Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1285 (9th Cir.2008). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review Kamara\u2019s contention that he is eligible for humanitarian asylum because he failed to exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if Kamara\u2019s asylum application was timely, and even if Kamara established past persecution, the government rebutted the presumption that Kamara has a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to Sierra Leone. <em>See Sowe, </em>538 F.3d at 1285-87 (evidence of fundamental changes in Sierra Leone rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution). Accordingly, Kamara\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Because Kamara failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Kamara failed to show that it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Sierra Leone. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b792-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
