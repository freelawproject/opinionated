Pineda had previously been convicted of arson in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 451(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Pineda\u2019s conviction for illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), carries a statutory maximum sentence of 2 years, but that maximum goes up to 10 years if he was previously convicted of a felony, and up to 20 years if he was previously convicted of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Pineda concedes that his conviction qualifies as a felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), whether or not it is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the district court could have sentenced Pineda up to 10 years. We therefore affirm the sentence of forty-eight months imposed by the district court, and remand for the district court to correct the judgment to cite 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) instead of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
