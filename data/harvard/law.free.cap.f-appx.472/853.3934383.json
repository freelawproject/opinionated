We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir.2004), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-23\">The district court concluded that Jeffery\u2019s excessive force claim was barred under <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997), because he had failed to set forth evidence demonstrating that his rule-violation conviction, arising from the same 2003 incident, had been invalidated. On appeal, appellees acknowledge that the district court erred in granting their motion for summary judgment because Jeffery\u2019s rule violation conviction had in fact been invalidated before he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Appellees assert therefore that the <em>Edwards </em>bar does not apply and that this case should be remanded to the district court. Because it appears that Jeffery\u2019s rule violation conviction in connection with the 2003 incident has been invalidated, we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on Jeffery\u2019s excessive force claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-24\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b883-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
