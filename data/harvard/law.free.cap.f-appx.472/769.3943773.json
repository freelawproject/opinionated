We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Vi does not contend he suffered past persecution, but argues he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based upon his support of the pro-democracy group. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if Vi\u2019s asylum application was timely, he is not eligible for asylum because he was not persecuted in Tonga and his fear of future persecution is not objectively reasonable in light of his testimony that the government of Tonga was not aware he provided financial support from the United States to the pro-democracy group. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Because Vi failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Vi failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured if removed to Tonga. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
