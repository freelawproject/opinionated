We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations, and review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for a continuance. <em>Cruz Rendon v. Holder, </em>603 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-22\">The IJ did not violate Herrera-Lopez\u2019s right to due process by pretermitting his cancellation application without first giving him an opportunity to testify. Herrera-Lopez has failed to show that his testimony concerning the outcome of the criminal charges at issue may have affected his eligibility for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1109 (to prevail on a due process claim, petitioner must show \u201cthat the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-23\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion by denying Herrera-Lopez\u2019s request for a continuance where the proceedings had already been continued for more than a year to allow Herrera-Lopez to file his application, and he was expressly placed on notice during the previous hearing that the application must be complete. <em>See id. </em>at 1110 (setting forth factors to consider in reviewing the denial of a continuance).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-24\">Herrera-Lopez\u2019s equal protection claim fails because he has not established that he was treated differently from similarly situated persons. <em>See id. </em>at 1109 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b760-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
