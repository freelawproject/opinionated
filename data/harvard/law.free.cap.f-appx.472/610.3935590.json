We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">1. The district court did not err in denying Meraz-Olivera\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment as improperly predicated on the August 2000 expedited removal order. We have jurisdiction to resolve his collateral challenge to that order because \u201cthere must be <em>some </em>meaningful review\u201d of that administrative action where, as here, it plays \u201ca critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 837, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). Meraz-Olivera \u201ccan succeed in this collateral challenge only if he is able to demonstrate that: (1) his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Martinez, </em>228 F.3d 956, 960 (9th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). Neither element is satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">Meraz-Olivera was not denied due process by the immigration officer\u2019s failure to inform him that he had the right to withdraw the application for admission \u201cin the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a)(4). \u201c[T]he Supreme Court has ruled that when Congress enacts a procedure, aliens are entitled to it.\u201d <em>United States v. Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir.2011). Here, Meraz-Olivera received all of the process required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(l)(A)(i). Neither the statute, nor the regulations, require that an immigration officer advise the alien of his opportunity to request withdrawal of his application for admission, subject to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. <em>See id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.3 (procedures for expedited removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Meraz-Olivera suffered no prejudice because he had no plausible grounds for relief. <em>See Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 F.3d at 1089 (\u201cWhere the relevant form of relief is discretionary, the alien must make a plausible showing that the facts presented would cause the Attorney General to exercise discretion in his favor.\u201d) (quotation omitted). Meraz-Olivera falsely claimed that he was a United States citizen to the primary immigration officer. During a secondary inspection, he admitted that he had lied and that he knew that his actions were illegal. An alien who attempts to enter the United States by fraudulent means is ineligible for withdrawal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a)(4). <em>See In re Gutierrez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 562, 565 (BIA 1988); INS Inspector\u2019s Field Manual \u00a7 17.2(A) (2001) (\u201cAn expedited removal order should ordinarily be issued, rather than permitting withdrawal, in situations where there is obvious, deliberate fraud on the part of the applicant.\u201d). An alien does not have the right to withdraw his application for admission, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.4; here the immigration officer exercised his discretion to proceed with expedited removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">2. Nor did the district court err by giving the Ninth Circuit model jury instruction on reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Velasquez, </em>980 F.2d 1275, 1278 (9th Cir.1992) (reviewing reasonable doubt instruction <em>de novo). </em>We reject Meraz-Olivera\u2019s arguments that the model instruction: (1) improperly forecloses speculation as a basis for having a reasonable doubt; (2) fails to direct jurors that proof beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be based on speculation; and (3) misstates the presumption of innocence because it instructs that reasonable doubt \u201cmay arise,\u201d from the evidence. The model instruction correctly states the law, and does not \u201cdetract from the heavy burden suggested by the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standing alone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b642-8\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4q\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">I agree with the majority that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s resolution of Meraz\u2019s due process claim. The Due Process Clause required that Meraz be notified of the opportunity to ask to withdraw his application for admission, and Meraz was prejudiced by the deprivation of that right. His conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The majority subverts the essential requirement of constitutional due process in denying Meraz\u2019s claim because he \u201creceived all of the process required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(1)(A)\u00a9.\u201d Memorandum at 612. It is true that \u201c \u2018when Congress enacts a procedure, aliens are entitled to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir.2011)). It is not true, however, that an alien\u2019s due process rights in the context of a criminal prosecution are <em>limited </em>to those prescribed by statute or regulation. The Constitution requires that individuals receive process that is \u201c\u2018meaningful\u2019 and \u2018appropriate to the nature of the case\u2019 \u201d before they are deprived of any protected interest, independent of whether or not such process is mandated by statutes or regulations. <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 541-42, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>(citation omitted). If compliance with statutory or regulatory procedures were itself sufficient to satisfy the constitutional command, then the Due Process Clause would be deprived of all substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Had the majority properly conducted the due process analysis that it chose to bypass, it would have concluded that Meraz was entitled to be informed that he had the right to ask to withdraw his application for admission. We have held that aliens have a due process right to be apprised of all forms of relief for which they might reasonably be eligible. <em>See United States v. </em>Melendez-Castro, 671 F.3d 950, 953-54 (9th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Arrieta, </em>224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, all three factors of the due process standard of <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), weigh in Meraz\u2019s favor: an alien\u2019s interest in being allowed to withdraw his application is immense, the failure to inform an alien of the right to seek withdrawal poses an unacceptably high risk that the alien will be denied a benefit that he would receive if he were to ask for it, and the administrative burden of requiring such disclosure is minimal. <em>See id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Meraz was not prejudiced by the failure to inform him of his right to seek withdrawal of his application. \u201cAn alien seeking to prove prejudice need not establish that he definitely would have received immigration relief, but only that he had \u2018plausible grounds\u2019 for receiving such relief.\u201d <em>Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 F.3d at 1089. In light of the agency\u2019s criteria for allowing the withdrawal of an application for admission, and in light of the fact that withdrawal is offered to an overwhelming proportion of aliens who would otherwise be removed on an expedited basis, Meraz might well have been permitted to withdraw his application had he asked to do so. <em>See </em>Insp. Field Manual 17.2(a), <em>available at </em>FIM-INSFMAN 17.2 on Westlaw; U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, <em>Immigration Enforcement Actions: 200k Annual Report </em>6 (2005) (\u201cApproximately 184,000 foreign nationals] were determined to be inadmissible in 2004 for reasons that made them subject to expedited removal. However, 129,000 of those aliens were allowed to withdraw their application for admission.\u201d). Meraz presented no false documents to immigration officers, he had never previously been removed, and he has three U.S. citizen children. Although an alien who has committed \u201cobvious, deliberate fraud\u201d (such as the use of \u201ccounterfeit or fraudulent documents\u201d) may not <em>\u201cordinarily </em>\u201d be allowed to withdraw his application for admission, <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), this guidance hardly implies that withdrawal is to be denied in <em>all </em>such cases. Meraz, moreover, did not use \u201ccounterfeit or fraudulent documents\u201d at all; he merely stated that he was a citizen of the United States before admitting at secondary inspection that he was not. The majority\u2019s rationale comes close to saying that <em>no </em>alien who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>subject to expedited removal can show that he might plausibly have been allowed to withdraw his application, since <em>any </em>such alien must have tried to enter the country without legal authorization. Such a holding is plainly inconsistent with the agency\u2019s own statistical report that a large majority of aliens in Meraz\u2019s position are granted the relief of which he was not even informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">. Although \"non-admitted aliens are not entitled to any procedure vis-\u00e1-vis their admission or exclusion,\u201d <em>Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 F.3d at 1084; <em>see United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, </em>338 U.S. 537, 544, 70 S.Ct. 309, 94 L.Ed. 317 (1950), such aliens <em>are </em>entitled to due process review of their immigration proceedings when those proceedings form the basis of a subsequent criminal prosecution. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 837-38, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987); <em>see Barajas-Alvarado, </em>655 F.3d at 1085 (applying <em>Mendoza-Lopez </em>to expedited removal proceedings). To hold in the context of a criminal prosecution that the Due Process Clause requires nothing more than compliance with statutory or regulatory procedures is wholly inconsistent with <em>Mendoza-Lopez.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
