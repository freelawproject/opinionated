We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Tamang testified Maoists threatened, kidnapped, and beat her after she refused to give them money or join them. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Tamang failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Tamang\u2019s claim for humanitarian asylum necessarily fails because she did not establish past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii). Accordingly, in the absence of a nexus to a protected ground, Tamang\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Tamang has not established that it is more likely than not she would be tortured by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official upon return to Nepal. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Tamang\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
