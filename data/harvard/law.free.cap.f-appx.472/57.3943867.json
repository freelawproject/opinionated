COGAN,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-15\"> The Honorable Brian M. Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b88-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">Call\u00f3n Petroleum Company (\u201cCall\u00f3n\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).\u201d <em>L-7 Designs, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, </em>647 F.3d 419, 429 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">\u201cAs a general rule, reinsurance contracts are contracts of indemnity, which give the original assured no right of action against the reinsurer.\u201d <em>China Union Lines, Ltd. v. Am Marine Underwriters, Inc., </em>755 F.2d 26, 30 (2d Cir.1985). However, \u201cNew York law recognizes an exception if the reinsurance agreement contains a so-called \u2018cut through\u2019 provision granting policyholders a direct right of action against reinsurers, which is apparent on its face.\u201d <em>Jurupa Valley Spectrum, LLC v. Nat\u2019l Indem. Co., </em>555 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-19\">In this case, however, Article 14 of the agreement at issue explicitly makes clear that third parties have no rights whatsoever under the agreement. Indeed, we have previously ruled that the very contract at issue in this case \u201cexplicitly provides that no one other than the reinsured shall have \u2022any rights or remedies against the reinsurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. Therefore, the agreement at issue in this case does not provide Call\u00f3n with a right of action against National Indemnity Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-20\">Call\u00f3n also claims on appeal that the district court erred by denying Call\u00f3n the opportunity to amend its complaint. Call\u00f3n, however, does not even hint at why it believes that the district court erred in this regard. \u201cTo make a legal argument is to advance one\u2019s contentions by connecting law to facts.... \u201d <em>Sioson v. Knights of Columbus, </em>303 F.3d 458, 460 (2d Cir.2002). If an argument is not made, we need not guess as to what that argument might have been. <em>See McCarthy v. S.E.C., </em>406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c [Arguments not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief ... are not properly before an appellate court even when the same arguments were raised in the trial court.\u201d). Therefore, we do not consider, let alone decide the merits of, Callon\u2019s claim that the district court erred by denying Call\u00f3n leave to amend its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
