(\u201cFreeport\u201d) from the district court\u2019s interlocutory order in a proceeding to adjudicate Freeport\u2019s applications to sever water rights from their appurtenant lands, and transfer those rights to other lands. The 2007 settlement of claims concerning the unauthorized pumping of water in the Upper Valley of the Gila River permitted the defendant water users to file such \u201csever-and-transfer\u201d applications within a limited time period. The district court separated the Free-port applications from those of the other Upper Valley applicants, consolidating Freeport\u2019s applications in a subproceeding on a new docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">When this appeal was filed, the district court had decided only 10 of the 59 Free-port applications. Freeport contends there is no appellate jurisdiction to hear any part of its protective appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Freeport challenges the district court\u2019s order denying, on the merits, those 10 applications. The district court held that Freeport had not satisfied its <em>prima facie </em>burden of showing that the proposed transfers would result in no injury to other water rights users. The district court\u2019s order is not final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, because it deals with only 10 of the applications and thus \u201cdo[es] not resolve all of the issues in the post-judgment proceeding.\u201d <em>Cordoza v. Pacific States Steel Corp., </em>320 F.3d 989, 996 (9th Cir.2003). The district court still must resolve issues related to Freeport\u2019s other applications, as well as issues related to other applicants. The district court therefore denied the Gila River Indian Community\u2019s request for certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). <em>See Huene v. United States, </em>743 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir.1984). At this stage, however, there is no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 for us to review this order. The order also does not relate to injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>relief, so jurisdiction is also lacking under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">For similar reasons, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying Freeport\u2019s attempt to correct facial deficiencies in its sever-and-transfer applications by filing amended papers with the district court. The order is neither a partial nor a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Gila River Indian Community argues there is appellate jurisdiction to review the abandonment ruling, because that ruling extinguished water rights specifically identified in the Globe Equity Decree, and therefore modifies an injunction within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The decree was an adjudication of rights and not entirely injunctive in nature. The ruling appealed here does not appear to relate to an injunctive aspect of the decree, and even if it did, it would not come within \u00a7 1292(a)(1)\u2019s grant of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Carson v. American Brands, </em>450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <em>Thompson v. Enomoto, </em>815 F.2d 1323, 1327 (9th Cir.1987). To fall within \u00a7 1292(a)(1), an order purporting to modify a consent decree would need to have the \u201cpractical effect of [modifying] an injunction\u201d; have \u201cserious, perhaps irreparable consequence[s]\u201d to the appellant; and \u201cbe effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.\u201d <em>Carson, </em>450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. 993 (internal quotation marks omitted). Like the order appealed in <em>Thompson, </em>the abandonment ruling here did not modify the decree. It was \u201cimplicitly contemplatefd]\u201d by the underlying consent decree. 815 F.2d at 1327. The Globe Equity Decree provides that decreed water-rights owners may, subject to certain limitations, \u201cchange the point of diversion ... so far as they may do so without injury to the rights of other parties.\u201d Ar-tide XI. The party filing a sever-and-transfer application must, show it has a \u201cright to transfer.\u201d Change-in-Use Rule \u00a7 4(B). The abandonment ruling, therefore, bears on whether Freeport has a right to transfer the water rights in dispute. The district court\u2019s ruling, like the order in <em>Thompson, </em>was \u201cpursuant to, and not a modification of, the original consent decree.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>815 F.2d at 1327. It therefore fails the first <em>Carson </em>factor. <em>Id. </em>The abandonment ruling, moreover, can be effectually challenged at a later stage of the litigation, after the district court decides the remaining sever-and-transfer applications, so it fails the third factor as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
