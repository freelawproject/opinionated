Bennett, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Appellee American Family Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican Family\u201d) sought a declaration against appellants Milo Bergeson and David and Joan Levengood (\u201cthe Levengoods\u201d) that American Family did not have a duty to defend or indemnify the Levengoods in an underlying wrongful death suit brought by Bergeson, after his ex-wife Lynn Bergeson died from carbon monoxide intoxication in the condominium she leased from the Levengoods when an improperly wired ceiling fan ignited the insulation above her unit. Bergeson and the Levengoods (collectively, \u201cappellants\u201d)appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of American Family, in which the court concluded that because American Family\u2019s policy did not cover the Levengoods\u2019 liability, American Family had no duty to defend or indemnify them. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Sullivan v. Oracle Corp., </em>662 F.3d 1265, 1270 (9th Cir.2011). Under Arizona law, \u201can insurer typically owes a duty to indemnify the insured against liabilities covered by the policy and a duty to defend the insured against any claim \u2018potentially covered by the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pueblo Santa Fe Townhomes Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Transcon. Ins. Co., </em>218 Ariz. 13, 178 P.3d 485, 491 (Ariz.Ct.App.2008) (quoting <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Morris, </em>154 Ariz. 113, 741 P.2d 246, 250 (1987)). The allegations in the complaint against the insured, as well as any facts known to the insurer, determine whether a particular claim against an insured triggers coverage under an insurance policy. <em>See Regal Homes, Inc. v. CNA Ins., </em>217 Ariz. 159, 171 P.3d 610, 615 (Ariz.Ct.App.2007); <em>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Morgan, </em>186 Ariz. 33, 918 P.2d 1051, 1053 (Ariz.Ct.App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">The policy here, purchased by the Levengoods\u2019 homeowners\u2019 association, provided liability coverage to \u201c[e]ach individual unit-owner of the insured condominium, but only for liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or repair of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>portion of the premises which is not reserved for that unit-owner\u2019s exclusive use or occupancy.\u201d We apply a broad reading of the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d which, under Arizona law, does not demand proximate cause but only \u201csome causal relation or connection.\u201d <em>See Salerno v. Atl. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>198 Ariz. 54, 6 P.3d 758, 762 (Ariz.Ct.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Although appellants urge that the Levengoods\u2019 liability arose out of their negligence as fractional owners of the ceiling (property not reserved for their exclusive use or occupancy), there is no causal relation or connection between the Levengoods\u2019 liability and their ownership, maintenance, or repair of the ceiling. The fire that caused Lynn Bergeson\u2019s death occurred in the insulation in the ceiling, but every negligent act alleged against the Levengoods related to their ownership, maintenance, or repair of property that was reserved for their exclusive use. Bergeson alleged that the Levengoods failed to notify the homeowners\u2019 association of the fan\u2019s installation; failed to obtain an electrical permit and an inspection, which would have revealed the absence of a junction box;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> failed to ascertain whether Lynn Bergeson properly installed the ceiling fan; and allowed Lynn Bergeson to install the fan, when they knew or should have known that she could not do it properly. These allegations involve the ceiling fan itself, the electrical fixture into which it was connected, or the electrical wire powering it, all of which were, pursuant to the homeowners\u2019 declarations and Arizona condominium statutes, reserved for the Levengoods\u2019 exclusive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Thus, we agree with the district court that American Family\u2019s policy did not cover the Levengoods\u2019 liability to Bergeson and, therefore, that American Family had no duty to defend or indemnify the Levengoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Finally, we briefly mention two additional arguments that are not included in the appellants\u2019 opening brief and, therefore, are waived. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999). In a letter submitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), appellants contend, for the first time, that, under <em>Associated Aviation Underwriters v. Wood, </em>209 Ariz. 137, 98 P.3d 572 (Ariz.Ct.App.2004), the stipulated judgment in the state wrongful death case precludes American Family from litigating coverage here. Even if appellants had not waived this argument, <em>Associated Aviation Underwriters </em>prohibits insurers only from relitigating liability under the guise of litigating coverage in a declaratory judgment, which is not the case here. <em>See Ariz. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Martin, </em>210 Ariz. 478, 113 P.3d 701, 704 (Ariz.Ct.App.2005). Additionally, appellants, in their reply brief, raise the new argument that the electrical wire powering the fan was not reserved for the Levengoods\u2019 exclusive use. Again, even if not waived, this contention would fail because, pursuant to the homeowners\u2019 declarations, the electrical wire was reserved for the Levengoods\u2019 exclusive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b635-16\"> -pjjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. Appellants maintain, but do not explain how, the presence of a junction box would have prevented the improper installation of the ceiling fan. In fact, their expert, when asked in his deposition whether \"the lack of a junction box here ha[d] anything to do with the cause of this fire,\u201d responded, \"I don\u2019t see anything in the evidence that indicates that to be the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
