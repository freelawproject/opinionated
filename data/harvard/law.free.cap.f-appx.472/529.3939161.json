Gwin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Coulette Osmore appeals the district court\u2019s judgment reversing the Commissioner\u2019s final decision that Osmore was not disabled within the meaning of Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383c(a)(3), and remanding the matter for further administrative proceedings. With her appeal, Osmore seeks an order that, on remand, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) must complete an entirely new evaluation of Osmore\u2019s Supplemental Security Income and Disability Insurance Benefits applications. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Osmore has standing to pursue this appeal because \u201cthe District Court\u2019s order g[ave] [Osmore] some, but not all, of the relief she requested.\u201d <em>Forney v. Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 266, 271, 118 S.Ct. 1984, 141 L.Ed.2d 269 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">\n<em>Evaluation of the Medical Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The Commissioner says that, on remand, he will both consider the effects of Osmore\u2019s mental impairments and allow Osmore to argue that medication side effects limit her residual functional capacity. Accordingly, Osmore\u2019s claim that the ALJ improperly disregarded evidence of Os-more\u2019s depression and medication side effects is moot. <em>See W. Coast Seafood Processors Ass\u2019n v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>643 F.3d 701, 704 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cAn appeal is moot if there exists no \u2018present controversy as to which effect relief can be granted.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Outdoor Media Grp., Inc. v. City of Beaumont, </em>506 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir.2007))). On remand, the ALJ must consider Osmore\u2019s mental impairments and medication side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">The ALJ did not err by failing to discuss specifically Osmore\u2019s MRI and CT scan results. \u201c[I]n interpreting the evidence and developing the record, the ALJ does not need to discuss every piece of evidence.\u201d <em>Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Osmore\u2019s MRI results were consistent with her CT scan results. Both revealed that Osmore has the severe impairment spondylolisthesis. The ALJ properly considered Osmore\u2019s medical records \u2014 including records that evaluated her MRI and CT scan \u2014 in evaluating Osmore\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">The ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Tim Truschel\u2019s (a' treating physician) opinion: other treating and non-treating physicians\u2019 opinions, along with Osmore\u2019s treatment records, contradicted Dr. Truschel\u2019s opinion. A non-examining physician\u2019s opinion may constitute substantial evidence to disregard the opinion of an examining physician if it is consistent with other independent evidence in the record and the ALJ does not rely on the non-examining physician\u2019s report alone. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">The ALJ did not err in evaluating the medical records from Osmore\u2019s twelve other physicians. The ALJ noted Os-more\u2019s history of back pain, cited several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>of Osmore\u2019s physicians\u2019 medical opinions and treatment records, and appropriately developed and considered the record. <em>See, e.g., Howard, </em>341 F.3d at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\n<em>Evaluation of Other Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The ALJ did not err in discrediting Osmore\u2019s symptom testimony based on inconsistencies with 1) the objective medical evidence and 2) Osmore\u2019s daily activities. <em>See Regennitter v. Comrn\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.1999) (Inconsistencies with clinical observations can \u201csatisfy the requirement of a clear and convincing reason for discrediting a claimant\u2019s testimony.\u201d); <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.2001) (The ALJ may reject the claimant\u2019s testimony when inconsistent with the claimant\u2019s daily activities and contrary to the medical evidence.).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The ALJ did not err in failing to consider Osmore\u2019s lay-witness evidence. In 2004, Osmore\u2019s husband and sister prepared reports for Osmore\u2019s prior Social Security benefits applications; the present application concerns disability beginning March 2005. Accordingly, these out-of-date lay-witness reports are not probative evidence of Osmore\u2019s 2005 disability status. <em>See Vincent v. Heckler, 739 </em>F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]he evidence which the Secretary ignored was neither significant nor probative.\u201d). On remand, however, Osmore may seek leave to submit additional evidence from lay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>Other Claims of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The district court explained that because \u201cthe ALJ erred in evaluating the medical evidence in the record concerning [Os-more\u2019s] mental impairments and limitations,\u201d the ALJ also erred \u201cin assessing [Osmore\u2019s] residual functional capacity.\u201d In its judgment reversing and remanding, the district court ordered the ALJ to make a new determination of Osmore\u2019s residual functional capacity and of Osmore\u2019s ability to perform past relevant and current work. Accordingly, Osmore\u2019s remaining allegations of error \u2014 regarding the ALJ\u2019s determination of Osmore\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to perform past relevant and current work \u2014 are also moot. <em>See W. Coast Seafood, </em>643 F.3d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b561-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
