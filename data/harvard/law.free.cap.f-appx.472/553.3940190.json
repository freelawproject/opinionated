Franklin Lee appeals the decision of the district court affirming the final determination of the Social Security Commissioner denying his claim for disability benefits and supplemental security income under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. Because we find that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision was not based on legal error and was supported by substantial evidence, <em>Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.2009), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Lee argues that \u201cthe ALJ failed to give clear and convincing reasons for rejecting [his] testimony.\u201d Where, as here, objective medical evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from an impairment that could reasonably produce the complained of symptoms, \u201can adverse credibility finding must be based on clear and convincing reasons.\u201d <em>Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In making the credibility determination, an ALJ may consider the course of treatment to determine whether allegations of a disability are credible, <em>see Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989) (finding that an \u201cunexplained, or inadequately explained, failure to seek treatment or follow a prescribed course of treatment\u201d is a valid basis to reject claimant testimony), as well as the testimony\u2019s compatibility with the medical evidence, <em>see Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that an ALJ may consider \u201ctestimony from physicians and third parties concerning the nature, severity, and effect of the symptoms of which [a] claimant complains\u201d to evaluate a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Finding that Lee\u2019s allegations about \u201cthe extent of his limitations ... are not supported by the objective evidence to the degree alleged,\u201d the ALJ noted inconsistencies between Lee\u2019s complaints and medical evidence, as well as the lack of any ongoing treatment. Because the ALJ cited to several clear and convincing reasons for finding Lee\u2019s testimony not entirely credible, the ALJ did not err in discrediting Lee\u2019s subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">Lee next argues that the ALJ erred in failing to include Lee\u2019s personality disorder as a \u201csevere\u201d impairment at Steps Two and Four of the sequential analysis. The record demonstrates, however, that the ALJ\u2019s failure to include Lee\u2019s personality disorder at Step Two \u2014 if error at all \u2014 was harmless, because the ALJ discussed Lee\u2019s personality disorder in the context of his residual functional capacity analysis after finding that Lee\u2019s other mental disabilities were severe. Where an ALJ fails to consider a disorder at Step Two, but nonetheless accounts for that disorder at Step Four in the residual functioning capacity analysis, any alleged error in failing to find the disorder \u201csevere\u201d at Step Two is harmless. <em>See Lewis v. Astrue, </em>498 F.3d 909, 911 (9th Cir.2007). Lee has therefore failed to show reversible error in the consideration of his personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Lee next contends that the ALJ improperly discounted the opinion of his examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ing psychologist, Dr. Prescott, and instead credited the opinions of Dr. Balsamo and Dr. Redner, both of whom also examined Lee. \u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility and resolving conflicts in medical testimony.\u201d <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989). If a contradicted medical opinion is rejected, the ALJ must provide \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d for that rejection. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The ALJ noted that unlike other examining sources, Dr. Prescott \u201cdid not have the benefit of reviewing the claimant\u2019s record with [sic] history of learning disorder and cognitive disorder.\u201d Finding that the opinions of Dr. Balsamo and Dr. Redner exhibited \u201cmore comprehensive testing and evaluation of his overall history and record,\u201d the ALJ relied on their opinions attributing Lee\u2019s impairments to cognitive disorders, not to the depression cited by Dr. Prescott. The ALJ thus provided specific and legitimate reasons for discounting the contradicted opinion of Dr. Prescott.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Lee also contends that the ALJ erred by failing to acknowledge treating physician Dr. Phillips\u2019s observation that Lee may suffer from cognitive defects or mental retardation, and that Lee appeared to have memory problems. The ALJ, however, did consider Dr. Phillips\u2019s report regarding Lee\u2019s poor memory and gave that report little weight, noting that Dr. Phillips \u201cdid not record any medical findings and noted [that Lee] would require a psychological evaluation for possible cognitive deficits.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s decision to afford the report of Dr. Phillips little weight is supported by substantial evidence as even Dr. Phillips was hesitant to make any medical findings about Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Lee next argues that the ALJ improperly discounted the lay witness statements of Darlene Reasoner, Lee\u2019s mother-in-law. The ALJ discounted Reasoner\u2019s statement (identified by the ALJ as \u201creports provided by ... third parties\u201d) because her characterization of Lee\u2019s limitations \u201cis not supported by the objective evidence,\u201d including the medical evidence. Because the ALJ articulated a valid reason for rejecting Reasoner\u2019s statement, and that reason is supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ did not err in discounting Reasoner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Finally, Lee argues that if his testimony and medical evidence were credited, and therefore incorporated into the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert, the expert would have found that Lee would have been unable to perform work in the national economy. Because we affirm the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the evidence, we likewise reject Lee\u2019s challenge to the conclusion provided by the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In sum, we do not find any legal error or that the evidence was insufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>Bray, </em>554 F.3d at 1222. We note, however, that Lee has a history of losing jobs after holding them for only a short period of time. If that pattern continues, and if he were to then file a subsequent application for benefits, that continued pattern would present a new issue related to Lee\u2019s claim for disability and would preclude the application of res judicata based on the present adjudication. <em>See Vasquez v. Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 586, 597 n. 9 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A]ll an applicant has to do to preclude the application of res judicata is raise a new issue in the later proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
