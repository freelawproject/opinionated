He claims that California Evidence Code Section 1109, which provided for the admission at his trial of certain propensity evidence, violated his rights to due process and equal protection. He also claims that the jury instructions regarding the propensity evidence violated due process, and that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise this issue in his direct appeal from his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The California Court of Appeal rejected Chavarria\u2019s due process and equal protection challenges to Section 1109 on the merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) therefore precludes federal habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Because the Supreme Court has expressly left open the question of whether a state law permitting the introduction of propensity evidence would violate due process, <em>see Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991), the state court\u2019s decision rejecting Chavarria\u2019s due process challenge to Section 1109 cannot have been contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established law. <em>See Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 866 (9th Cir.2006). Furthermore, we have upheld the constitutionality of an equivalent Federal Rule of Evidence permitting the introduction of propensity evidence. <em>See United States v. LeMay, </em>260 F.3d 1018, 1025-26, 1030-31 (9th Cir.2001) (rejecting due process and equal protection challenges to Federal Rule of Evidence 414). We cannot now hold to be unreasonable a state court decision that reached the same result based on the same reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The district court dismissed Chavarria\u2019s jury instruction and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims as untimely, concluding that these claims; which were first raised in federal court well after the statute of limitations imposed by AEDPA had run, did not \u201crelate back\u201d to Chavarria\u2019s original petition. We agree with the district court that Chavarria\u2019s case is indistinguishable from that of the petitioner in <em>Hebner v. McGrath, </em>543 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir.2008). <em>Hebner </em>compels us to conclude that Chavarria\u2019s Section 1109 claims \u201cdo not share a common core of operative fact\u201d with his jury instruction and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1139. Because these later-asserted claims do not therefore \u201crelate back\u201d to those in Chavarria\u2019s original petition, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>are barred by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\">. To the extent that Chavarria now asserts that he challenges Section 1109 as applied in his case, this claim was not raised before the state court or the district court, and is therefore not cognizable on appeal. <em>See Belgarde v. Montana, </em>123 F.3d 1210, 1216 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
