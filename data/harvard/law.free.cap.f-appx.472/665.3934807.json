We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004) (judicial immunity and statute of limitations); <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004) (failure to state a claim). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The district court properly dismissed Gillaspy\u2019s claims against defendants Yaffe, Armstrong, Kriegler, Turner, and Stiglitz, because these defendants are immune from liability. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (barring injunctive relief against a judicial officer \u201cunless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable\u201d); <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (per curiam) (judges retain their immunity from suit when they are accused of acting maliciously or corruptly); <em>Olsen, </em>363 F.3d at 923 (absolute immunity extended to agency representatives performing functions analogous to those of a judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The district court properly dismissed Gillaspy\u2019s remaining federal constitutional claims as time-barred. <em>See Comm. Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto, </em>583 F.3d 690, 701 n. 3 (9th Cir.2009) (\u00a7 1983 actions are governed by the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions, which in California is two years); <em>see also Knox v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 1009, 1013 (9th Cir.2001) (a mere continuing impact from past violations does not give rise to a new cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The district court properly dismissed Gillaspy\u2019s state claims because Gillaspy was required, but failed, to comply with the requirements of California\u2019s Government Code \u00a7 900 et seq. <em>See Loehr v. Ventura Cnty. Comm. Coll. Dist., </em>147 Cal. App.3d 1071, 195 Cal.Rptr. 576, 581-82 (1983) (narrow exception of Cal. Gov. \u00a7 905(c) applies only to claims seeking recovery of previously-earned salary or wages, not to claims seeking \u201cmonetary damages for defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct in preventing [plaintiff] from rendering services through which he might have acquired a vested right to additional amounts in salary or benefits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gillaspy\u2019s motion to declare the judgment void under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60 because Gillaspy provided no basis for reconsideration. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion and setting forth requirements for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Gillaspy\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Gillaspy\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on November 8, 2011, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Gillaspy\u2019s opposed motion requesting an expedited ruling, filed on February 27, 2012, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
