For the following reasons, we will affirm the judgment and sentence the District Court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">The morning of April 15, 2004, Latricia Samuels entered the M&amp;T Bank in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and asked for mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>information. After observing the number of people inside the bank, Latricia left to communicate that information to her brother, Ronald Samuels. Shortly thereafter, Ronald and David Dupree, both armed and disguised, entered the bank. One man, who was wearing a yellow parka, jumped over the counter, pointed a gun at the bank employees, and demanded money. As he jumped back over the counter, his sunglasses fell from his head. Meanwhile, the other man pointed his gun at various individuals inside the bank. The two men fled to a car in the alley behind the bank, in which Latricia and Mayra Rodriguez, Ronald\u2019s girlfriend, were waiting. Rodriguez drove them away, and the four individuals later divided the approximately $10,418 stolen from the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">DNA testing performed on material recovered from the sunglasses subsequently revealed a positive match to Ronald. On April 23, 2008, Dupree and his co-defendants were indicted for armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (Count I, against all four defendants), use of a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count II, against Ronald and Dupree), and conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count III, against all four defendants). Ronald, Latricia, and Rodriguez pled guilty. Dupree was arrested on December 18, 2008, and he entered a plea of not guilty on February 10, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On November 2, 2009, Dupree proceeded to a jury trial. Latricia and Rodriguez testified against Dupree; Ronald was not called as a witness. To rehabilitate the credibility of Rodriguez and Latricia after impeachment, the prosecution called FBI Special Agent Robert Daniel Craft as a witness. Special Agent Craft testified that he interviewed all three accomplices and that the information they provided was ultimately consistent. After cross and recross examination regarding other individuals and bank robberies and upon further re-direct examination, Special Agent Craft testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">Q: Did Ronald Samuels ever indicate relative to the M&amp;T Bank that it was anyone other than David Dupree that robbed that bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">A: He never- did. He was consistent from day one who was with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Q: And is that reflected in that 302?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">A: Yes. Samuels confessed to robbing the M&amp;T Bank in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, on April 15th, 2004. Samuels was with David Dupree, Mayra Rodriguez and Latricia Samuels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">On November 4, 2009, the jury found Dupree guilty of all three counts. On May 18, 2010, the District Court denied Dupree\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">On August 6, 2010, Dupree was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 332 months. The District Court determined that Dupree was a Career Offender based on three controlled substance convictions for offenses separated by intervening arrests but for which he was sentenced on the same date. The District Court granted a 28-month variance based on the 188-month sentence received by Ronald.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Dupree appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">For a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and must sustain a jury\u2019s verdict if a reasonable jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>believing the government\u2019s evidence could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government proved all the elements of the offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosario, </em>118 F.3d 160, 163 (3d Cir.1997) (internal quotations omitted). This places \u201ca very heavy burden\u201d on appellant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">1. Insured by the FDIC</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Dupree was convicted of bank robbery pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, which provides that \u201cas used in this section the term \u2018bank\u2019 means ... any bank the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(f). Dupree argues the Indictment should be dismissed because the prosecution failed to prove that the bank is insured by the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">During the trial, however, the prosecutor elicited testimony from the branch manager of M&amp;T Bank:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">Q: Ms. Mitchell, is your bank insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">Q: Who is it insured by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">A: FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">Based on that testimony, the jury could reasonably find that the bank was insured by the FDIC when the crime occurred. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>314 Fed.Appx. 478, 482 (3d Cir.2008) (explaining that rational jury could find employees\u2019 testimony that bank was presently FDIC insured sufficient to find banks were also insured at the time of the robberies).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">2. Accomplice Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">Dupree acknowledges that accomplice testimony is \u201cvalid\u201d evidence but argues that the testimony of Rodriguez and Latricia was \u201cso inconsistent, confusing, and contradictory\u201d that it could not serve as the sole evidence supporting his conviction. However, as Dupree concedes, \u201cuncorroborated accomplice testimony may constitutionally provide the exclusive basis for a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Delarosa, </em>450 F.2d 1057, 1061-62 (3d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Although there were inconsistencies, Rodriguez and Latricia testified consistently on critical aspects of the case, including that: Dupree agreed to rob the bank with Ronald and them, Dupree and Ronald ran to the getaway car, Dupree was wearing a black jacket, and all four drove away from the robbery and later split the proceeds. In addition, the District Court instructed the jury about credibility, inconsistent statements, and accomplice testimony. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find that a reasonable jury could base its verdict on the accomplice testimony of Rodriguez and Latricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">B. Statement of Non-Testifying Accomplice</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">Dupree contends that a <em>Bruton </em>violation occurred when the prosecution introduced a hearsay statement of a non-testifying accomplice that implicated him, <em>He., </em>when Special Agent Craft testified that Ronald confessed to robbing the bank with Dupree. Because Dupree did not raise the error at trial, we review for plain error. Under that standard, the Court may, in its discretion, correct an error only if the appellant demonstrates that: 1) there is an error, 2) the error is \u201cclear or obvious,\u201d 3) the error \u201caffected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>affected the outcome of the District Court proceedings, and 4) the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-22\">Dupree\u2019s argument is inapt because <em>Bruton </em>only applies to cases involving joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>trials. <em>See Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 123-24, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968); <em>United States v. Mussare, </em>405 F.3d 161, 168 (3d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Pinto, </em>413 F.2d 727, 729 (3d Cir.1969) (\u201cThe heart of <em>Bruton </em>is that if at a joint trial a co-defendant\u2019s confession which involves another co-defendant is to be allowed into evidence the latter co-defendant must be allowed his constitutional right of cross-examination secured by the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause if he so desires.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">As the government admits, however, the issue raised implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, which forbids the introduction of testimonial hearsay into evidence at trial unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In light of the accomplice testimony that was consistent on critical aspects of the case, we conclude that Special Agent Craft\u2019s brief and unsolicited testimony regarding Ronald\u2019s statement did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The District Court did not, therefore, commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Dupree argues that the District Court erred in determining that he was a career offender without considering whether his prior convictions should be \u201cfunctionally consolidated\u201d under <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Grier, </em>585 F.3d 138, 141 (3d Cir.2009). We review the sentence for significant procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567-68 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The parties disagree as to which version of the Guidelines applies, but because we reach the same conclusion regardless of which version is used, we will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Dupree is correct in this regard. Before the 2007 Amendment, \u201cprior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Application Note 3 explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that ... were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Under <em>Buford, </em>convictions are \u201cfunctionally consolidated\u201d if they were \u201cfactually or logically related, and sentencing was joint.\u201d <em>Buford, </em>532 U.S. at 61, 121 S.Ct. 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Dupree argues that his three prior drug offenses are \u201crelated\u201d because they were \u201cfunctionally consolidated\u201d for sentencing. Although Dupree was sentenced for the offenses on the same day, the offenses were separated by intervening arrests and thus they are not considered \u201crelated.\u201d The District Court did not err, therefore, in determining that Dupree was a career offender. <em>See United States v. Alexander, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 77, 78 (3d Cir.2010) (analyzing pre-2007 Guidelines and finding no error in district court\u2019s decision not to treat three prior offenses as \u201crelated\u201d because they were separated by intervening arrests).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Having concluded that the sentence the District Court imposed is procedurally sound, we will affirm it \u201cunless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568. Dupree does not contest the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, and we conclude that the sentence the District Court imposed was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
