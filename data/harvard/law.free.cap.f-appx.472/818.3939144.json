King was convicted in California state court after a jury trial for murder and attempted murder. He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in which he challenged the integrity of the jury verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">The state trial court held a full evidentiary hearing on Juror No. 4\u2019s multiple claims of juror misconduct, including her own belatedly perceived bias. The court found that she was not credible and that no juror misconduct had occurred. The state court described the juror\u2019s efforts to undo the verdict as \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">The parties dispute whether the state court\u2019s adjudication should be reviewed under the standard set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) or (e)(1). Regardless of which provision applies, however, the decision of the state trial court remains a credibility determination that is entitled to substantial deference. <em>See Maxwell v. Roe, </em>628 F.3d 486, 503 (9th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 611, 181 L.Ed.2d 785 (2012). That ruling was neither unreasonable nor clearly erroneous, because the record contained ample support for the court\u2019s determination. Juror No. 4\u2019s version of what happened was substantially contradicted by the testimony of virtually all of the other jurors and, at most, only partially corroborated by the alternate juror and Juror No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">There was no violation of King\u2019s federal rights, and the petition was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
