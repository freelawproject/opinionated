We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">Cavins\u2019s civil commitment became final on September 16, 1997. Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 904.1(a)(2); former Cal. R. Ct. 30.1(a) (now 8.308). The one-year statute of limitations for Claims 2 and 5 began running the next day and expired on September 16, 1998. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2001). At the latest, the one-year statute of limitations for Claim 6 began running in October 2003, the date of Cavins\u2019s final challenged periodic review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Cavins brought Claims 2, 5 and 6 after the expiration of the limitations periods. These claims are, therefore, untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">While statutory tolling does apply during the pendency of a properly filed state habeas petition, the California Supreme Court denied Cavins\u2019s state petitions raising Claims 2 and 5 as untimely. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 414, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Statutory tolling does not apply to either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">As to Claim 6, we are satisfied that Cavins had reason to know that reviews of his civil commitment took place during his confinement based on the periodic interviews conducted by the medical director at Atascadero State Prison and Cavins\u2019s efforts to investigate his appeal beginning in April 1998. Moreover, Cavins has not shown that an extraordinary circumstance prevented him from timely filing a petition, and, thus, equitable tolling does not apply. <em>Bryant v. Arizona Atty. Gen., </em>499 F.3d 1056, 1061 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
