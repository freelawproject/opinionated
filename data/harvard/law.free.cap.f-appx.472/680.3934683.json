We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">To prevail on his gender discrimination claim, DiDiana must either (1) present direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination, or (2) satisfy the burden-shifting analysis described in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). To satisfy the burden shifting framework, Di-Diana must make a prima facie case either by (1) presenting direct evidence of discrimination, or (2) presenting evidence satisfying each of four requirements described by our previous gender discrimination cases. <em>See, e.g., Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010); <em>Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>358 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir.2004). DiDiana does not satisfy these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">DiDiana\u2019s proffered evidence did not conclusively show an intent to discriminate on the basis of gender. <em>See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir.2003) (direct evidence must prove a fact without \u201cinference or presumption\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nor did it satisfy the four-prong test for a prima facie case, which required DiDiana to show that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was performing to Parball\u2019s legitimate expectations; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated employees outside the protected class were treated more favorably or the circumstances gave rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>Hawn, </em>615 F.3d at 1156. DiDiana did not satisfy this test because, even if cocktail servers were similarly situated employees, the evidence showed that a female employee actually caught misappropriating funds was terminated. He also was not performing to Parball\u2019s legitimate expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Even if DiDiana could establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, Parball offered a nondiscriminatory reason for his termination, and DiDiana failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Parball\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Because \u201cat least one other similarly situated employee ... was treated in a similar manner as [DiDiana],\u201d that evidence negates \u201cany showing of pretext\u201d and therefore defeats DiDiana\u2019s claim. <em>Snead v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">We also affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Parball on DiDiana\u2019s age discrimination claim. To prevail on a claim for age discrimination, DiDiana must prove at trial that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the employer\u2019s adverse action. <em>See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2352, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009). DiDiana misappropriated company funds on more than one occasion; no reasonable juror could find that this job performance was satisfactory and that age not only compelled the adverse employment action, but was the but-for cause of termination. <em>Id.-, see also Diaz v. Eagle Prod. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>521 F.3d 1201, 1208 (9th Cir.2008). DiDiana\u2019s evidence fails to clear this high hurdle, even when evidence of Parball\u2019s age-based proposal is considered in the light most favorable to DiDiana. Therefore, the district court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>concluded that DiDiana failed to make a prima facie case for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
