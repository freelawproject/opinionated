The application was based on the hardships her spouse, who is a lawful permanent resident, and her children, who were all born in this country, would suffer upon Hernandez\u2019s removal from this coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>try. The IJ\u2019s decision denying relief was based on a determination that Hernandez had not demonstrated that her qualifying relatives would suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d as required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Hernandez argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in considering only the current hardships her family is suffering as a result of her removal proceedings and committed legal error by failing to consider the future hardships that will result if she is removed to Mexico. Although we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b, we may consider the legal argument presented by Hernandez. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (a)(2)(D). Hernandez\u2019s argument is based on her contention that the pertinent consideration here is future-oriented. The Ninth Circuit has agreed with this contention. <em>Figueroa v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 487, 497-98 (9th Cir. 2008). Assuming, without deciding, that the \u00a7 1229(b)(1)(D) hardship inquiry is future-oriented, the record does not reflect that the IJ or the BIA failed to consider the future hardships asserted here. To the extent that Hernandez argues that the BIA committed legal error in considering her application for relief, her petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Hernandez also argues that <em>In re Andazola-Rivas, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 319, 322 (BIA 2002), and <em>In re Monreal-Aguinaga, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 56, 62-64 (BIA 2001), two BIA decisions that are \u201cthe starting points for any analysis of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1229b(b), <em>In re Gonzalez-Recinas, 23 I &amp; </em>N Dec. 467, 469 (BIA 2002), were wrongly decided. Hernandez did not present these arguments to the BIA on appeal, and she did not file a motion to reopen or a motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 390 (5th Cir.2001). She has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to these arguments, and we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 320-21 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
