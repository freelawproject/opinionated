Each count charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ayala argues that under <em>United States v. Berry, </em>977 F.2d 915, 919-20 (5th Cir.1992), his conviction and sentence on one of his counts must be vacated because his two convictions and sentences are multiplicitous and violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The government agrees and has filed an Unopposed Motion for Summary Remand in lieu of Filing Appellee\u2019s Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">The government\u2019s motion is GRANTED. Ayala\u2019s sentences are VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for dismissal of the multiplicitous count and for resentencing on the count selected by the government. <em>See Berry, </em>977 F.2d at 919-20; <em>United States v. Osunegbu, </em>822 F.2d 472, 481 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
