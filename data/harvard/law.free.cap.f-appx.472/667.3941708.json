We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b697-28\">Espinoza-Flores contends that the district court erred by failing to grant him a minor-role adjustment. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Charles, </em>581 F.3d 927, 932-33 (9th Cir.2009), and conclude that in light of this court\u2019s precedent, any error was not plain, <em>see United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 770 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, Espinoza-F lore s\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by any error because the district court varied downward and sentenced him toward the low end of the range that would have resulted from the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-29\">Espinoza-Flores also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We find no support in the record for the proposition that the district court relied at sentencing on an inaccurate understanding of Espinoza-Flores\u2019s role in the criminal venture, and the 80-month sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
