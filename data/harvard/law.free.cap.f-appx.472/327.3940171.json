Rojo argues that his total sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the district court erred in not granting his request for a sentencing variance because it did not consider his benign reasons for illegally reentering the country or his argument that the Sentencing Guidelines overstated his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no error or the error is harmless, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">To the extent that Rojo raises a procedural reasonableness argument by asserting that the district court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the argument is without merit given that the record re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>veals that the district court did consider all of the sentencing factors. Although the district court did not expressly state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, a mechanical recitation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not necessary. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Furthermore, when reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, we generally will infer that the district court considered all of the fair sentencing factors set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that the district court considered Rojo\u2019s arguments for mitigating his sentence, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but implicitly overruled his arguments and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was \u201creasonable\u201d considering the circumstances of the case. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Rojo\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Furthermore, Rojo\u2019s 41-month sentence, which is at the bottom of the guideline range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Rojo has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines prison term. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
