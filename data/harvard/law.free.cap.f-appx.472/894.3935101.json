Bryant\u2019s sentence was imposed on February 28, 2011. During that proceeding, the district court relied on <em>United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343 (11th Cir.2010), to find that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) did not apply to Bryant. As a result, the court sentenced Bryant to 120-months imprisonment, the pre-FSA mandatory-minimum sentence for his offense under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">On appeal, Bryant argues that the district court erred in refusing to apply the FSA at his re-sentencing. As the Supreme Court has now explained in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, -L.Ed.2d - (2012), Bryant is correct. The revised mandatory m\u00ednimums set forth in the FSA are applicable to individuals who committed their offensive conduct before August 3, 2010, but who were sentenced after that date. <em>Id. </em>at 2335-36. Therefore, we must vacate Bryant\u2019s sentence and remand the case for re-sentencing consistent with the <em>Dorsey </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
