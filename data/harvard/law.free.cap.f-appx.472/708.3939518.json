We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Petitioners contend that the birth of their second child in the United States violated China\u2019s population-control policy and would subject Min Fu to forced sterilization upon return to China, citing the experience of one or more friends in China and a warning Min Fu received from a birth control official before leaving China in 1997. The record does not compel the conclusion that petitioners met their burden of showing a clear probability of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1190 (clear probability standard requires objective evidence that it is more likely than not that alien will be subject to persecution upon removal) (citation omitted); <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir.2009) (noting BIA\u2019s conclusion in <em>Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185 (BIA 2007), that the Chinese government does not have a national policy requiring forced sterilization of a parent who returns with a second child born outside of China). Accordingly, their withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Finally, we deny petitioners\u2019 request for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
