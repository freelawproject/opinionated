When multiple health issues presented, she applied for long-term disability benefits. Black claims on appeal that UnitedHealth wrongfully denied her claim for long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">We have reviewed the record in this appeal, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel. The record indicates that United-Health denied benefits to Black after three independent reviewing physicians separately determined that she was not disabled under the terms of the plan. In light of that evidence, we agree with the district court that UnitedHealth\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-19\">. As to Count Four of Black's complaint only, the district court granted in part, and denied in part, Black\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In all other respects, it denied Black\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-27\">As to Count Four, in an effort to encourage plan administrators to promptly respond to requests for documents, the district court penalized UnitedHealth $10 per day for each day that Black was denied the information she requested. UnitedHealth was directed to pay Black $1,120, in statutory penalties, for violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
