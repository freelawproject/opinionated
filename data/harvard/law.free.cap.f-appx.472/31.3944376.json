Abrams, which denied Xu\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Li Han Xu, </em>No. A078 854 006 (B.I.A. Oct. 22, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A078 854 006 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 23, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-18\">The agency reasonably relied on the inconsistency between Xu\u2019s hearing testimony and his airport interview in finding him not credible. Specifically, Xu\u2019s asylum claim was based on his hearing testimony that he had two children, but he stated in his airport interview that he had only one child. <em>See Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that an IJ may base an adverse credibility determination on discrepancies that go to \u201cthe heart of [petitioner\u2019s] asylum claim\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that this Court examines record of airport interview to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>it represents a \u201csufficiently accurate record\u201d of asylum applicant\u2019s statements to merit consideration in determining whether applicant is credible). The agency did not err in rejecting his explanations that his airport-interview statement was \u201cnot complete\u201d because he had been \u201cquite nervous\u201d and because his interpreter had communicated with him by telephone. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (concluding that agency need not credit asylum applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so); <em>see also Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 398 n. 6 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that asylum applicant\u2019s \u201cmere recitation that he was nervous or felt pressured during an airport interview will not automatically prevent\u201d agency from relying on interview as long as agency acknowledges and evaluates this explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The adverse credibility determination was further supported by the agency\u2019s finding that, in the six years since his last hearing, Xu failed to provide any additional evidence to corroborate the existence of his second child. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (holding asylum applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony may bear on his credibility where \u201cthe absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question\u201d). Accordingly, given the lack of corroborating evidence to rehabilitate Xu\u2019s inconsistent statements as to how many children he has and the fact that this issue is central to Xu\u2019s asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As the existence of his second child is necessary to both Xu\u2019s claims of past persecution and his fear of future persecution, the credibility determination is dispositive and we do not address Xu\u2019s additional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
