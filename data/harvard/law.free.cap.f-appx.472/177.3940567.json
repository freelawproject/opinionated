Boling, a prisoner in federal custody pursuant to a Washington, D.C., conviction, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting in part the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on this 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2011) petition. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(2006); <em>see Madley v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>278 F.3d 1306, 1310 (D.C.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); see <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Boling has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
