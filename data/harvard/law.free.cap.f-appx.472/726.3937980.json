We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed over four years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Kaur failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for an exception to the time limit, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 996-97 (requiring movant to produce material evidence that conditions in the country of nationality had changed). Kaur\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to adequately explain its reasoning is belied by the record. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir.2010) (the BIA \u201cdoes not have to write an exegesis on every contention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-22\">Further, we decline to consider Kaur\u2019s contentions regarding the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the court previously rejected them in <em>Kaur v. Mukasey, </em>268 Fed.Appx. 628 (9th Cir.2008). <em>See Merritt v. Mackey, </em>932 F.2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that under the \u2018law of the case doctrine,\u2019 one panel of an appellate court will not reconsider questions which another panel has decided on a prior appeal in the same case).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b756-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
