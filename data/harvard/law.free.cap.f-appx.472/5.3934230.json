Rakoff of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Plaintiffs Daniel Murphy and Wendy Linnington appeal from an award of summary judgment in favor of Acceptance Indemnity Insurance Company (\u201cAcceptance\u201d) in this action for breach of contract. Plaintiffs submit that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Acceptance did not have a duty to defend its insured, Rusty Nail Acquisition, Inc., in plaintiffs\u2019 tort suit because the conduct alleged fell within a policy exception for assault and battery. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">1. <em>Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Under Vermont law, which controls in this case, there is a duty to defend \u201cwhenever it is clear that the claim against the insured might be of the type covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Vose, </em>177 Vt. 412, 417, 869 A.2d 97, 101 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). While the policy here at issue covers claims for bodily injury, it excludes from such coverage \u201cclaims arising out of Assault and/or Battery.\u201d Appellant App. at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 underlying complaint against the insured alleged in \u00b6 7 that \u201c[wjithout basis or provocation, [Rusty Nail employees] forcefully escorted Mr. Murphy from the restaurant, and threw or pushed Mr. Murphy down a flight of stairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64. This allegation states claims for assault and battery under Vermont law. <em>See Christman v. Davis, </em>179 Vt. 99, 101, 889 A.2d 746, 749 (2005) (noting that battery is \u201cintentional act that results in harmful contact with another\u201d (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 13 (1965))); <em>State v. Riley, </em>141 Vt. 29, 33, 442 A.2d 1297, 1298 (1982) (noting civil notion of assault is when person \u201cplaces another in fear of bodily injury, even if the alleged assailant acts without purpose to carry out the threat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Insofar as plaintiffs attempt to recast these events in \u00b6 9 under a theory of negligence, we conclude, like the district court, that the action nevertheless is one \u201carising out of\u2019 an assault or battery. Appellant App. at 34. In assessing a duty to defend, a court \u201cmust focus on the factual allegations in [the] complaint and not on the legal theories asserted.\u201d <em>TBH v. Meyer, </em>168 Vt. 149, 153, 716 A.2d 31, 34 (1998). Paragraph 9 does not allege alternative facts, only an alternative legal theory. But that theory is inconsistent with the allegations of forcible throwing and pushing that are the crux of the tortious conduct. Indeed, the Vermont Supreme Court has regularly found no duty to defend, notwithstanding a complaint\u2019s negligence claim, where that claim is \u201cinconsistent with the facts alleged in the underlying complaint.\u201d <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Vose, </em>177 Vt. at 418, 869 A.2d at 101; <em>Serecky v. Nat\u2019l Grange Mut. Ins., </em>177 Vt. 58, 64, 857 A.2d 775, 781 (2004). Therefore, the action is not covered by Acceptance\u2019s policy. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Roberts, </em>166 Vt. 452, 460, 697 A.2d 667, 672 (1997) (noting that phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 is \u201cvery broad and comprehensive\u201d and requires only \u201csome causal relationship\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Insofar as plaintiffs further argue on appeal that any initial battery by Rusty Nail employees would have been privileged, the argument is unavailing. Assuming Vermont recognizes such a privilege, it permits \u201creasonable force\u201d only when the \u201cactor reasonably believes that the other\u2019s intrusion can be prevented or terminated only by the immediate infliction of the harmful or offensive contact.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 77 &amp; cmt. g. The underlying complaint\u2019s allegation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Rusty Nail employees\u2019 use of force was \u201c[w]ithout basis or provocation\u201d contradicts any such claim. Appellant App. at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that there was no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">2. <em>Duty to Indemnify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that Vermont courts would follow the law of other jurisdictions and analyze the duty to indemnify with respect to the true facts as determined by the court, rather than the allegations of the complaint. <em>See, e.g., Servidone Constr. Corp. v. Security Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>64 N.Y.2d 419, 424, 488 N.Y.S.2d 139, 142, 477 N.E.2d 441 (1985) (noting that under New York law \u201cduty to defend is measured against the allegations of pleadings but the duty to pay is determined by the actual basis for the insured\u2019s liability to a third person\u201d). Nor do they take issue with defendant\u2019s assertion that plaintiffs conceded defendant\u2019s statement of undisputed facts below. These undisputed facts establish that Rusty Nail employees \u201cgrabbed\u201d Murphy, \u201clifted\u201d him off the ground, \u201crushed\u201d him through the club, and then \u201cthrew\u201d him down the stairs. Appellee App. at 23. The facts further establish that the employees made a \u201cchoice to inflict pain\u201d on Murphy through \u201cbrutal, aggressive &amp; violent behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. These facts clearly demonstrate that the claim arose out of an assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the statement of Rusty Nail employee Heath Dailey creates issues of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment. We disagree. Assuming Dailey\u2019s statement is properly considered on summary judgment, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the statement is not inconsistent with defendant\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. Moreover, even if the statement could have provided a basis for plaintiffs to dispute these facts, plaintiffs did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. The judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
