We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny Palafox\u2019s petition for review. We address his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-23\">1. The documents submitted by the Department of Homeland Security during Palafox\u2019s removal proceedings established that: (1) Palafox was convicted of first-degree burglary, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 459, and (2) Palafox received a term of imprisonment of at least one year for his first-degree burglary conviction. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>finding that Palafox was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>See Kwong v. Holder, </em>671 F.3d 872, 880 (9th Cir.2011); <em>LopezCardona v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 1110, 1112 (9th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">2. Palafox argues that the term \u201calien\u201d in the Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply to him because he considers himself to be a \u201cnational\u201d of the United States. Palafox\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our precedents. <em>See Theagene v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Reyes-Alcaraz v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 937 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-16\">. Because Palafox is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony \"crime of violence\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), we decline to address the alternative grounds for removal relied upon by the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
