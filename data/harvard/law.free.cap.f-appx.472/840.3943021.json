We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-23\">Assuming without deciding that Ritchie\u2019s application for sentence review could toll the statute of limitations, that his application was properly filed, and thus that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of his sentence review application, nevertheless Ritchie\u2019s federal habeas petition still would be time-barred without the benefit of equitable tolling. We therefore need not consider separately whether statutory tolling is available pursuant to <em>Wall v. Kholi, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-25\">The district court concluded that equitable tolling did not apply before our decision in <em>Bills v. Clark, </em>628 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir.2010). We remand for consideration of equitable tolling pursuant to the heavily fact-dependent <em>Bills </em>standard, <em>id. </em>at 1100-01, expressing no view as to whether such tolling is warranted in this case. The district court shall hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary, to determine whether equitable tolling applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Each party shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
