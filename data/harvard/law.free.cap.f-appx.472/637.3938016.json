This is the fourth time that the case has been before this court. <em>See Nader v. Brewer, </em>386 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>531 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>Nader v. Bennett, </em>407 Fed.Appx. 190 (9th Cir.2010). Our most recent decision affirmed the district court\u2019s order in part, and remanded in part for the district court to determine whether \u201chours spent in the unsuccessful effort to obtain a preliminary injunction\u201d counted toward \u201call of the hours that contributed to the eventual victory,\u201d and therefore qualified for the fee award. 407 Fed.Appx. at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Upon remand, appellants had the burden to produce records to establish the number of hours that contributed to the ultimate victory on the merits. <em>See Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles, </em>796 F.2d 1205, 1210 (9th Cir.1986). Appellants did not produce such records. The district court relied on its earlier conclusion that the preliminary injunction effort was a dilatory strategy meant to force a hasty decision, and that it did not contribute to the ultimate victory on the merits. The court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the hours spent litigating the motion for preliminary injunction and the appeal of the order denying the preliminary injunction \u201cdid not contribute to the ultimate victory in the lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
