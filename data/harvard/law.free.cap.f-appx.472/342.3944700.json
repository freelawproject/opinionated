Comp. Laws \u00a7 37.2101, <em>et seq. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Parsons v. City of Pontiac, </em>533 F.3d 492, 499 (6th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). When determining whether the movant has met this burden, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Smith Wholesale Co., Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>477 F.3d 854, 861 (6th Cir.2007). However, the nonmoving party must present more than a \u201cmere ... scintilla\u201d of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Worthy contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Michigan Bell on his discrimination claim. Specifically, he asserts that: (1) the district court erred in refusing to consider the unsworn statements attached to his response in opposition to summary judgment, and that those unsworn statements established pretext; (2) the district court erred in finding that he failed to show pretext based solely on his deposition testimony; and (3) he was not required to show pretext because he presented direct evidence of discrimination. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Worthy first claims that the district court should have considered five letters purportedly written by AT&amp;T employees that he attached to his response in opposition to Michigan Bell\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In support of this claim, Worthy cites the rule that \u201c[a] nonmoving party need not \u2018produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment,\u2019 \u201d <em>O-So Detroit, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>973 F.2d 498, 505 (6th Cir.1992), and he contends that the letters attached to his response could have been converted into admissible evidence because some of them were purportedly written by individuals \u201clisted in [his] witness list,\u201d and the others were written by people \u201cidentified in [his] deposition.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">Although a district court may consider some forms of hearsay evidence in deciding a motion for summary judgment, Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c), such evidence must still be admissible at trial. <em>See Alexander v. CareSource, </em>576 F.3d 551, 558 (6th Cir.2009). An affidavit used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment \u201cis required to be sworn to by the affiant in front of an \u2018officer authorized to administer oaths,\u2019 \u201d <em>Peters v. Lincoln Elec. Co., </em>285 F.3d 456, 475 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 54 (5th ed.1979)), and must be made on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4). Alternatively, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, declarations may take the place of affidavits, so long as those declarations are made under penalty of perjury, certified as true and correct, dated, and signed. <em>See Pollock v. Pollock, </em>154 F.3d 601, 612 n. 20 (6th Cir.1998); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>Bonds v. Cox, </em>20 F.3d 697, 702 (6th Cir. 1994). Statements that are not sworn in one of these two ways are not competent summary judgment evidence. <em>See Hands v. J.B. Robinson Jewelers, </em>627 F.3d 235, 239 n. 1 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] court may not consider unsworn statements when ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d) (quoting <em>Dole v. Elliott Travel &amp; Tours, Inc., </em>942 F.2d 962, 968-69 (6th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Worthy\u2019s proposed evidence satisfies neither Rule 56 nor 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. He relies on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(1) a letter purportedly from \u201cthe union members of the Linwood Air Pressure crew,\u201d bearing nine unidentified signatures, dated January 4, 2008, which is unsworn and not notarized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">(2) a letter purportedly from Kenji Lemon which is unsigned, undated, unsworn, and not notarized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">(3) a letter purportedly signed by Erick Adams, which is undated, unsworn, and not notarized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">(4) a letter purportedly signed by Oliver Boyd, which is undated, unsworn, and not notarized; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">(5) a letter purportedly signed by TeeHuan Harvey, dated June 23, 2008, which is unsworn and not notarized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Because these letters are unsworn, they are not competent summary judgment evidence, and the district court properly refused to consider them in ruling on Michigan Bell\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Harris, </em>627 F.3d at 239 n. 1; <em>see also Alexander, </em>576 F.3d at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Worthy next claims that the district court should have considered the letters because they were \u201cself-authenticated.\u201d Citing <em>Churches of Christ in Christian Union v. Evangelical Benefit Trust, </em>No. C2-07-CV-1186, 2009 WL 2146095 (S.D.Ohio July 15, 2009), he argues that \u201c[wjhere a document is produced in discovery, \u2018there [is] sufficient circumstantial evidence to support its authenticity\u2019 at trial\u201d and \u201cthere is no error to admit as evidence documents that Defendants themselves possess and produced in response to Plaintiffs request for production of documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5 (quoting <em>Denison v. Swaco Geolograph Co., </em>941 F.2d 1416, 1423 (10th Cir. 1991)). However, unlike in <em>Churches of Christ, </em>Worthy, not Michigan Bell, produced the letters at issue here. And Worthy has cited no support, and we have found none, for the idea that a litigant\u2019s own production of documents during discovery renders the documents authenticated. Moreover, regardless of whether a document is authenticated for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 901, it must still be admissible. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>107 F.3d 1147, 1159 (6th Cir.1997) (citing 5 Jack B. Weinstein et al., Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 901(a)[02], at 901-28 (1996) (\u201cA document is not admissible simply because it has been authenticated. For example, if offered to prove the truth of assertions made in it, the document will need to meet hearsay requirements.\u201d) (footnote omitted)). Worthy\u2019s authentication argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Finally, Worthy contends that the district court should have considered the letters because they were offered to show Lustig\u2019s discriminatory motive, rather than the truth of the matter asserted, and thus were nonhearsay. But the only way the letters could \u201cshow a pattern of behavior on the part of Lustig treating African-American employees in a manner that was inconsistent with that of White employees,\u201d as Worthy claims, is if the substantive allegations contained in them were true \u2014 i.e., if Lustig allowed \u201canother white worker ... to work overtime whenever he feels without any questions, while [he] ... grill[ed] the black workers about why we worked so long when we\u2019re actually called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>out to work\u201d or \u201cprovide[d] pure satisfaction to the white employees as well as aceommodate[d] them and g[ave] them choice verses working with everyone equally.\u201d Accordingly, the letters were inadmissible hearsay, and Worthy\u2019s claim to the contrary is frivolous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Pack v. Damon Corp., </em>434 F.3d 810, 815 (6th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Worthy next argues that the district court should have denied Michigan Bell\u2019s motion for summary judgment because his deposition testimony was sufficient to establish that Michigan Bell\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was a pretext for unlawful race discrimination. Specifically, he points to his statement that on November 29, 2005, he was having problems logging onto a computer to perform an assigned task, and that when he went to talk to Lustig about it, Lustig told him: \u201cBoy, when I tell you to do something .... \u201d and \u201cBoy, bring your ass back here.\u201d Worthy asserts that \u201c[t]he term \u2018boy\u2019 ... is incredibly insensitive and offensive\u201d and that \u201cracial overtones are implicated when a White supervisor calls an African American employee \u2018boy.\u2019 \u201d Thus, as he sees it, a reasonable fact-finder could reject Michigan Bell\u2019s legitimate proffered reason for his termination and find that it was a mere pretext for unlawful race discrimination. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Michigan courts \u201chave used the prima facie test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>[, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) ], as a framework for evaluating [ELCRA] claims.\u201d <em>Town v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., </em>455 Mich. 688, 568 N.W.2d 64, 67-68 (1997). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Worthy must present evidence that (1) he belongs to a protected class, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, (3) he was qualified for the position, and (4) his termination occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. <em>Sniecinski v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich., </em>469 Mich. 124, 666 N.W.2d 186, 193 (2003); <em>see also McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Once a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Hazle v. Ford Motor Co., </em>464 Mich. 456, 628 N.W.2d 515, 521-22 (2001). If a defendant produces such evidence, the presumption is rebutted, and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s reasons were not the true reasons, but a mere pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The only issue here is pretext. \u201cPretext may be established \u2018either directly by persuading the [trier of fact] that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>533 F.3d 381, 392 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). The usual way to show pretext is to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s stated reason for the adverse employment action: (1) has no basis in fact, (2) was not the actual reason, or (3) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>insufficient to explain the employer\u2019s action. <em>See Imwalle v. Reliance Med. Prods., Inc., </em>515 F.3d 531, 545 (6th Cir. 2008). However, many \u201cform[s] of circumstantial evidence [can be] probative of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Ultimately, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence from which the jury may reasonably reject the employer\u2019s explanation and find that the employer\u2019s reason was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Warfield v. Lebanon Corr. Inst., </em>181 F.3d 723, 730 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Hazle, </em>628 N.W.2d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Worthy cites several district court cases in support of his argument that his deposition testimony was sufficient to establish pretext. We find those cases inapposite. <em>McCann v. Midland County Educational Services Agency, </em>No. 06-13150-BC, 2007 WL 2950591 (E.D.Mich. Oct. 10, 2007) is off target because the language Worthy selects from that case did not address pretext, but causation under Michigan\u2019s Whistle-Blowers\u2019 Protection Act. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 15.362 (1981). <em>Barnes v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc., </em>476 F.Supp.2d 1210 (D. Kansas 2007) is also no help to Worthy because the pretext evidence in that case was plaintiffs testimony that defendant, \u201cin the context of giving plaintiff his Final Warning that ultimately resulted in his termination, stated that \u2018they wanted someone younger and more aggressive,\u201d\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 1215, and Lustig\u2019s alleged \u201cboy\u201d comments here are not similarly close in time to Worthy\u2019s termination. Lastly, <em>Smith v. C.R. Bard, Inc., </em>730 F.Supp.2d 783 (M.D.Tenn.2010), and <em>Fuller v. Global Custom Decorating, </em>No. Civ.A. 3:2004-285, 2007 WL 44507 (W.D.Pa. Jan. 5, 2007), which Worthy cites for the unremarkable proposition that pretext <em>can </em>be shown through a plaintiffs deposition testimony, are factually and legally dissimilar, and do not help Worthy show that his deposition testimony in this case <em>does </em>establish pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">More on point is the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>190 Fed.Appx. 924 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cAsh II\u201d). </em>In <em>Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>129 Fed. Appx. 529 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cAsh </em>I\u201d), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s grant of a defendant\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on a claim by two black plaintiffs alleging that their race was a motivating factor in their failure to be promoted where their white supervisor allegedly called them \u201cboy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531. The court held that \u201c[w]hile the use of \u2018boy\u2019 when modified by a racial classification like \u2018black\u2019 or \u201cwhite\u2019 is evidence of discriminatory intent, the use of \u2018boy\u2019 alone is not evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and disagreed. It held that the word \u201cboy\u201d used without modification can be evidence of racially discriminatory intent. <em>Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 454, 126 S.Ct. 1195, 163 L.Ed.2d 1053 (2006). The Court explained that, \u201c[a]lthough it is true the disputed word will not always be evidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign .... [t]he speaker\u2019s meaning may depend on various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 126 S.Ct. 1195. It therefore remanded the case to the Eleventh Circuit to consider how the term was used in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">In <em>Ash II, </em>the Eleventh Circuit once more affirmed the district court. It concluded that \u201cthe use of \u2018boy\u2019 by [the black plaintiffs\u2019 white supervisor] was not sufficient, either alone or with the other evidence, to provide a basis for a jury reasonably to find that [the employer\u2019s] stated reasons for not promoting the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>was racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Ash II, </em>190 Fed.Appx. at 926. According to the Eleventh Circuit, \u201c[t]he usages were conversational and as found by the district court were non-racial in context\u201d and \u201cthere is nothing in the record about the remaining factors [identified by the Supreme Court] to support an inference of racial animus in the use of the term \u2018boy.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926. The court also noted that \u201ceven if somehow construed as racial, ... the comments were ambiguous stray remarks not uttered in the context of the decisions at issue and are not sufficient circumstantial evidence of bias to provide a reasonable basis for a finding of racial discrimination in the denial of the promotions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And it emphasized that \u201c[t]he statements were remote in time to the employment decision, totally unrelated to the promotions at issue, and showed no indication of general racial bias in the decision making process at the plant or by [the supervisor].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The same reasoning applies here. In this case, Michigan Bell articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for ending Worthy\u2019s employment: his failure to report to his worksite on February 14, 2008, for at least two hours, in violation of the Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Technician Expectations. Worthy\u2019s testimony that Lustig called him a \u201cboy\u201d is insufficient to show that Michigan Bell\u2019s legitimate reason was a pretext for unlawful race discrimination. Lustig\u2019s use of the word \u201cboy,\u201d like the supervisor\u2019s use of the word in <em>Ash II, </em>was remote in time to the adverse employment decision: Lustig allegedly referred to Worthy as a \u201cboy\u201d in November 2005, and Worthy was not terminated until March 2008. Moreover, aside from the fact that Worthy is black and Lustig is white \u2014 a fact that the Supreme Court implicitly found insufficient to give racial meaning to the word \u201cboy\u201d in <em>Ash </em>\u2014 there is no evidence, not the context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, historical usage, or anything else, that suggests that Lustig\u2019s use of the term reflected a racial animus. Indeed, the only evidence in the record is Worthy\u2019s response to Lustig\u2019s use of the term and that evidence points the other way. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that Worthy\u2019s deposition testimony was insufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that Michigan Bell\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Worthy\u2019s termination was a pretext for unlawful race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Worthy\u2019s final argument is that he did not need to show pretext because Lustig\u2019s use of the word \u201cboy\u201d was direct evidence of discrimination. \u201cDirect evidence is evidence that proves the existence of a fact without requiring any inferences.\u201d <em>Rowan v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>360 F.3d 544, 548 (6th Cir.2004); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 577 (7th ed.1999). \u201cThe evidence must establish not only that the plaintiffs employer was predisposed to discriminate on the basis of [race], but also that the employer acted on that predisposition.\u201d <em>Daugherty v. Sajar Plastics, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 696, 707 (6th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). To determine if statements are \u201crelevant\u201d as direct evidence of discrimination or are merely \u201cstray remarks,\u201d courts generally consider: (1) whether the remarks were made by the decisionmaker or by an agent uninvolved in the challenged decision; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or part of a pattern of biased comments; (3) whether the remarks were made close in time to the challenged decision; and (4) whether the remarks were ambiguous or clearly reflective of discriminatory bias. <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights ex rel. Burnside v. Fashion Bug of Detroit, </em>473 Mich. 863, 702 N.W.2d 154, 157 (2005); <em>Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, Inc., </em>25 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>1325, 1330 (6th Cir.1994). These factors weigh against Worthy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Worthy claims that this case is analogous to <em>DeBrow v. Century 21 Great Lakes, Inc., </em>463 Mich. 534, 620 N.W.2d 836 (2001), where the Michigan Supreme Court found that a plaintiff had presented \u201cdirect evidence of unlawful age discrimination\u201d because \u201c[t]he plaintiff testified during his deposition ... [that] his superior told him that he was \u2018getting too old for this shit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. However, the comment in <em>DeBrow </em>clearly reflected discriminatory bias and was \u201callegedly made in the context of the discussion in which plaintiff was informed [of the adverse employment action].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839. Here, in contrast, Lustig\u2019s use of the word \u201cboy\u201d was not clearly reflective of discriminatory bias, <em>see Ash, </em>546 U.S. at 456, 126 S.Ct. 1195, especially in light of Worthy\u2019s response to it, and it occurred more than two years prior to Worthy\u2019s adverse employment decision. <em>Cf. Rowan, </em>360 F.3d at 548-49 (holding that an employer\u2019s remarks about the general need to lower average age of workforce and stray comment that \u201cthe older people should go, bring in some new blood\u201d made years before employees\u2019 terminations, were not direct evidence of unlawful age bias). Moreover, Lustig\u2019s use of the word \u201cboy\u201d was isolated and not part of a pattern of biased comments. Worthy has therefore failed to present direct evidence showing that his employer\u2019s alleged discriminatory animus was causally related to his adverse employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">. Worthy also contends that the letters should have been considered by the district court because they were in the possession of Michigan Bell and thus Michigan Bell would not have been surprised by their consideration and/or admission. But whether Michigan Bell would have been surprised is not the test. The test is whether the letters were competent evidence, and they were not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
