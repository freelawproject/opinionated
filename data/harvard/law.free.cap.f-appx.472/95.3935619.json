Aug. 5, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity .with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Here, Alam\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely, as he filed it more than thirteen years after his order of deportation, and number-barred because it was his third motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C). Alam was therefore required to establish materially \u201cchanged country conditions arising in [his] country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Alam failed to satisfy this standard. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008). Alam\u2019s motion rested principally on evidence documenting recent violence perpetrated by the government-sponsored Rapid Action Battalion (\u201cRAB\u201d) against its political opponents, including supporters of the Jatiya Party, like Alam. Alam also submitted documents showing that members of the BNP and the Awami League had threatened and attacked his family, allegedly because of Alam\u2019s political activities. However, the conditions portrayed by this evidence do not differ materially from those Alam described in his original asylum application in 1997. And for this reason, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Alam failed to demonstrate a material change in country conditions to render him eligible for reopening his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">Additionally, we reject Alam\u2019s assertion that the BIA ignored record evidence or made conclusory findings. Upon review of the BIA\u2019s decision, we conclude that the BIA considered the evidence Alam presented and that its determination that he failed to meet the applicable standard was not \u201cdevoid of any reasoning\u201d or lacking in any \u201crational explanation.\u201d <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, assuming, without deciding, that the BIA\u2019s egregious disregard of applicable standards could give rise to a claim of constitutional proportions, the record confirms that the BIA afforded Alam \u201ca full and fair opportunity\u201d to present his claims, thus undermining his due process challenge. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 453 F.3d </em>99, 104 (2d Cir.2006). We have considered all of Alam\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
