We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Bahena-Aranda contends that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), because assault with a deadly weapon under section 245(a) of the California Penal Code is not a categorical crime of violence. This contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Grajeda, </em>581 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir.2009). Bahena-Aranda\u2019s argument that we are not bound by <em>Grajeda </em>in light of the subsequent case of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), is without merit. <em>See Newdow v. Lefevre, </em>598 F.3d 638, 644 (9th Cir.2010) (a three-judge panel may ignore circuit precedent only where it is \u201cclearly irreconcilable\u201d with intervening higher authority); <em>Banuelos-Ayon v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1080, 1086 (9th Cir.2010) (concluding that <em>Johnson, </em>which concerned a statute \u201cakin to California\u2019s simple battery statute,\u201d did not undermine the court\u2019s prior conclusion that a conviction for willful infliction of corporal injury upon a spouse or cohabitant was a categorical crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Bahena-Aranda\u2019s contention that the district court erred by failing to examine judicially noticeable documents fails because his prior conviction is a categorical crime of violence. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Bahena-Aranda does not contest the fact of his prior conviction, nor did the district court err in relying on the uncontested pre-sentence report to establish the fact of that conviction. <em>See United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b729-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
