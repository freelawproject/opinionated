On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Gevara\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s disposition of his Rule 59(e) motion, Gevara has forfeited appellate review of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of Gevara\u2019s post-judgment motion seeking permission to file a first amended and supplemental complaint, Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that leave to amend be freely granted when justice so requires. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). A district court may not deny a motion to amend \u201csimply because it has entered judgment against the plaintiff-be it a judgment of dismissal, a summary judgment, or a judgment after a trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 427 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). A post-judgment motion to amend is \u201cevaluated under the same legal standard as a similar motion filed before judgment was entered \u2014 for prejudice, bad faith, or futility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the motion to amend \u2014 which indicated that Gevara wished to file a class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>action complaint against various defendants based on conditions at the correctional institution where Gevara is incarcerated-was futile. <em>See Oxendine v. Williams, </em>509 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir.1975) (per curiam) (holding that a pro se prisoner may not litigate the interests of other prisoners in a class action). We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-16\"> \"We are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by the district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
