Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Garcia-Perez failed to establish he suffered harm rising to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003) (record did not compel finding that Ukrainian Pentecostal Christian who was \u201cteased, bothered, discriminated against and harassed\u201d suffered from past persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Perez-Gareia failed to established a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident, ... or when the applicant has returned to the country without incident.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (ethnic Chinese Christian petitioner did not establish a pattern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>or practice of persecution in Indonesia). Accordingly, Garcia-Perez\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Because Garcia-Perez did not meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, his withholding of removal claim necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Further, Garcia-Perez fails to raise any substantive challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Finally, we reject Garcia-Perez\u2019s due process claim because he expressly waived the issue before the IJ and did not exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b773-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
