The district court determined that Moore was an armed career criminal under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) (2009) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment on count one and a concurrent term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on count two. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in concluding that Moore\u2019s prior North Carolina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>state conviction for burning of a schoolhouse qualified as a predicate conviction warranting application of the enhanced sentence mandated by the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Moore has filed two pro se supplemental briefs and a letter we construe as another pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A defendant is properly designated an armed career criminal if he is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(a). The enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) applies to a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a violent felony is an issue of law we review de novo. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>631 F.3d 680, 682 (4th Cir.2011). To decide whether a prior conviction constitutes a violent felony, courts utilize a categorical approach. <em>Id. </em>at 684. This approach \u201clook[s] only to the elements of the offense .... [and] examinfes] [the offense] in terms of how the law defines it and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">A person is guilty of burning of a schoolhouse in North Carolina if that person \u201cwantonly and willfully set[s] fire to or burn[s] or cause[s] to be burned or aid[s], counsels,] or procur\u00e9is] the burning of, any schoolhouse or building owned, leased[,] or used by any public or private school, college!,] or educational institution.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-60 (2011). This court recently held that the modern, generic crime of arson involves the burning of real or personal property. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>606 F.3d 171, 174-75 (4th Cir.2010). Because the North Carolina statute substantially corresponds to the generic, contemporary definition of arson, Moore\u2019s conviction under the statute is a violent felony. The district court therefore did not err in concluding that the conviction qualified as an ACCA predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Additionally, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the issues in Moore\u2019s pro se supplemental briefs and the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Moore, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Moore requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
