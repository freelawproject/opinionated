Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Vasquez de Alcantar v. Holder, </em>645 F.3d 1097, 1099 (9th Cir.2011), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-24\">The IJ properly found Kim removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) because he remained in the United States after the expiration of his business visitor visa. Contrary to Kim\u2019s contention, his filing of an application for adjustment of status did not render his continued presence lawful. <em>See id. </em>at 1102-03 (filing an adjustment application does not legalize an alien\u2019s presence or confer any status). It follows that the initiation of removal proceedings against Kim did not violate his right to due process. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and substantial prejudice to show a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-25\">Kim contends that the IJ abused her discretion and violated due process by denying his request for a continuance pending adjudication of the 1-130 immigrant visa petition filed on his behalf. The government, however, has submitted a status report stating that Kim\u2019s visa petition has been denied. We must therefore dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>this portion of the petition for review as moot. <em>See Pedroza-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>486 F.3d 1362, 1364 n. 2 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b868-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
