Simmons\u2019 counsel has filed a brief <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that he has divined no meritorious grounds for appeal but requesting that we review three potential areas of error: (1) whether it was improper to deny Simmons\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Three; (2) whether the district court failed to adequately explain its selected sentence; and (3) whether Simmons\u2019 sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court continued to assess him as a career offender, notwithstanding this court\u2019s holding to the contrary in Simmons\u2019 previous direct appeal. Having reviewed the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">First, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Simmons\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Three. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000) (stating standard of review). \u201cA defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea,\u201d <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>348 F.3d 408, 413 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), but instead bears the burden of showing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir.2007). <em>See also United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991) (describing several factors that should inform a district court\u2019s determination whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">Here, although Simmons argues that he is legally innocent of the offense charged in Count Three because the gun remained in his van during the bank robbery, we cannot agree. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (criminalizing anyone who \u201cuses,\u201d \u201ccarries,\u201d or \u201cpossesses\u201d a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence\u201d); <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 127, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (someone who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle \u201ccarries\u201d a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)); <em>United States v. McCaskill, </em>676 F.2d 995, 1000 (4th Cir.1982) (noting that flight is a part of a robbery offense). <em>Accord United States v. Williams, </em>344 F.3d 365, 372-73 (3d Cir.2003) (collecting cases and upholding a \u00a7 924(c) conviction where the defendant bank robber carried the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>only in his car, not into the bank); <em>United States v. Adkins, </em>203 Fed.Appx. 472, 473-74 (4th Cir.2006) (defendant used weapon \u201cduring\u201d a carjacking when firing shots while escaping). Because there is no other reason to believe that Simmons\u2019 plea was defective, it was no abuse of discretion for the district court to deny Simmons\u2019 motion to withdraw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">As for Simmons\u2019 sentence, we review it for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although counsel suggests that Simmons\u2019 sentence was not adequately explained by the district court, <em>see United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009), the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cneed not be elaborate or lengthy.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 639 (4th Cir.2009). Nor must the district court \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d; it must only provide \u201csome indication\u201d that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to the defendant before it and also considered any nonfrivolous arguments raised by the parties at sentencing. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). Our review of the record in this case convinces us that the district court\u2019s explanation is sufficient to allow for \u201c \u2018meaningful appellate review,\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586), such that we need \u201cnot guess at the district court\u2019s rationale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329. We therefore decline to find the sentence imposed upon Simmons procedurally unreasonable in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Moreover, we reject Simmons\u2019 suggestion that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court enhanced his sentence upon its conclusion that Simmons was a career recidivist, despite the fact that Simmons was not technically a career offender under the Guidelines. When a district court imposes a sentence that falls outside of the applicable Guidelines range, we consider \u201cwhether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir. 2007). In conducting this review, the appellate court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Thus, even if we could have reasonably reached a different sentencing result than that arrived at by the district court, \u201cthis fact alone is \u2018insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 474 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Here, even if the district court failed to employ the proper incremental analysis in determining an appropriate degree of departure, <em>see United States v. Dalton, </em>477 F.3d 195, 199 (4th Cir.2007), any such procedural error is harmless where \u201cthe upward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified] the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Santana, </em>668 F.3d 95, 104 (4th Cir.2012). Our review of the record persuades us that the district court\u2019s analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they applied to Simmons\u2019 case is adequate to support the upward variant sentence ultimately imposed. <em>See id.; United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 165 (4th Cir.2008). We are likewise convinced that the district court\u2019s sentencing determinations were otherwise substantively reasonable and should therefore remain undisturbed. <em>See Evans, </em>526 F.3d at 160; <em>see also United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 367 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2946, 180 L.Ed.2d 236 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Simmons, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Simmons requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\"> Simmons was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief but elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
