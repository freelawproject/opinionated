Rodriguez fell behind on her mortgage payments and faced foreclosure. She alleges that she contracted with Wells Fargo for a \u201creverse mortgage\u201d on her home, with sufficient proceeds to be paid to Midland to cure the default on her home loan. Wells Fargo did not approve and fund the loan before Midland foreclosed on and sold the house at a Trustee\u2019s Sale. Rodriguez was then evicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-22\">The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-23\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rodriguez\u2019s claims de novo. <em>Lyon v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., </em>656 F.3d 877, 883 (9th Cir.2011) (stating that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is \u201cfunctionally identical\u201d to a motion to dismiss on the pleadings) (quoting <em>Dworkin v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>867 F.2d 1188, 1192 (9th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">Rodriguez claims that Midland lacked appropriate authority to conduct the Trustee\u2019s Sale of her home because it was not the holder of the underlying note secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>by the deed of trust. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim. The Arizona Supreme Court has held that A.R.S. \u00a7 33-308, a provision of the state\u2019s non-judicial foreclosure statute, was meant to protect the holder of the assignment against subsequent purchasers without notice; the statute \u201cdoes not affect a deed\u2019s validity as to the obligor.\u201d <em>In re Vasquez, </em>228 Ariz. 357, 266 P.3d 1053, 1055 (2011). Since Rodriguez executed a deed of trust and promissory note to obtain a mortgage loan for her home, the question whether Midland or MidFirst was in fact the beneficiary of the deed of trust at the time of sale is irrelevant to her interests. If the foreclosing party is not the beneficiary, the party with a claim is the actual beneficiary of the deed of trust, not Rodriguez, the obligor on the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Rodriguez argues that the district court improperly cut off discovery, allowing her insufficient time to develop her case. But the district court dismissed all of Rodriguez\u2019s claims either for failure to state a claim or on the pleadings. Because the case did not progress past the dismissal stage, Rodriguez\u2019s claims regarding discovery are moot. Because the discovery claims are moot, we need not address the request for further time for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Rodriguez argues that Wells Fargo induced her reasonable, foreseeable, and detrimental reliance upon its promises regarding the \u201creverse mortgage\u201d home loan. The district court assumed that Wells Fargo did make a promise to Rodriguez regarding the loan, found that Rodriguez\u2019s reliance on it was not reasonable, and dismissed her claim. According to Rodriguez\u2019s pleadings, Wells Fargo promised her that she qualified for a loan. Rodriguez did not allege that Wells Fargo promised her that it would approve or fund her loan. Because Wells Fargo\u2019s promise concerned only future conduct, Rodriguez did not have the legal right to rely on it, and the district court correctly dismissed her promissory estoppel claim against Wells Fargo. <em>See Renteria v. United States, </em>452 F.Supp.2d 910, 915-16 (D.Ariz. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Rodriguez claims that Wells Fargo negligently misrepresented to her the fact that its services would stop or prevent the Trustee\u2019s Sale of her home; she petitions for special, general, emotional, and punitive damages in recompense. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim. Rodriguez failed to allege that Wells Fargo misrepresented or omitted a material fact as is required to make a claim of negligent misrepresentation in Arizona. <em>See McAlister v. Citibank, </em>171 Ariz. 207, 829 P.2d 1253, 1261 (Ariz.Ct.App.1992). We conclude that the district court was correct in finding that Wells Fargo\u2019s representations related solely to future conduct and that Rodriguez cannot sustain a claim of negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and except as provided by 9 th Cir.
