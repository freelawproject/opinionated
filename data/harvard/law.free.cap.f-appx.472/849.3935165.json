Even assuming error, there was no prejudice. The uncontroverted evidence showed that Reyes-Perez was found on the roof of a warehouse just across the United States-Mexico border, that he had previously been deported to his country of origin, Mexico, and that he had expressly abandoned any claims for relief from deportation. The denial of the suppression motion did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Ghent v. Woodford, </em>279 F.3d 1121, 1127 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because any error was harmless, the conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">At sentencing, the court denied a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility and, in doing so, relied at least to some extent on the ground that Reyes-Perez had put the government to its burden of proof. This was error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>369 F.3d 1076, 1089 (9th Cir.2004). For this reason, the sentence must be reconsidered. The other challenges to the sentence are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We AFFIRM the conviction, VACATE the sentence, and REMAND for the district court to reconsider whether Reyes-Perez should receive a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
