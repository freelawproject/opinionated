Crape appeals his conviction on three grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">First, Crape argues that the district court erroneously rejected two of his proposed jury instructions: 1) an instruction that a conviction under \u00a7 641 requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the stolen property belonged to the United States, and 2) an instruction on Crape\u2019s good faith defense. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">The district court correctly instructed the jury on knowledge. \u201cThe reason for including the requirement [in \u00a7 641] that the property, in fact, belongs to the Government was to state the foundation for federal jurisdiction. A defendant\u2019s knowledge of the jurisdictional fact is irrelevant....\u201d <em>United States v. Howey, </em>427 F.2d 1017, 1018 (9th Cir.1970). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it refused to instruct the jury that Crape could only be convicted if he knew the border-monitoring sensor belonged to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-19\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), neither applies to \u00a7 641 nor undermines <em>Howey. </em>In <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>the Court construed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an identity-theft statute that, unlike \u00a7 641, has the term \u201cknowingly\u201d before the other elements of the crime. Using \u201cordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>English grammar,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cknowingly\u201d applied to all subsequently listed elements of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). 129 S.Ct. at 1890. But <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>did not set aside the line of cases, like <em>Howey, </em>that find government ownership is needed to establish jurisdiction but knowledge of government ownership is unnecessary to convict. <em>See United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. 64, 72 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Similarly, the district court did not err in rejecting Crape\u2019s proposed good-faith instruction. A criminal defendant \u201chas \u2018no right\u2019 to <em>any </em>good faith instruction when the jury has been adequately instructed with regard to the intent required to be found guilty of the crime charged, notwithstanding the normal rules governing \u2018theory of defense\u2019 requests.\u201d <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.2004). In this case, as Crape concedes, the district court adequately instructed the jury on the intent element required for a conviction under \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Furthermore, using a First Circuit Model Jury Instruction, the district court gave a good-faith instruction and instructed the jury that it must acquit Crape if it had a \u201creasonable doubt that Defendant acted knowingly to deprive the owner of the use or benefit\u201d of the property. That instruction was not \u201cmisleading or inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberation,\u201d <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d 1223, 1230 (9th Cir.2000), and it did not impair Crape\u2019s ability to argue his good-faith defense.</p>\n<p id=\"A6v\">\n<em>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Crape next argues that both the evidence at trial and the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment against him. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Grand Jury Clause ensures a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial right to be tried only on the charges set forth in an indictment by a grand jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>190 F.3d 1081, 1085 (9th Cir.1999). Thus, \u201cthe indictment\u2019s charges may not be broadened by amendment, either literal or constructive, except by the grand jury itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>291 F.3d 606, 614 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cA variance between indictment and proof,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not require reversal unless it affects the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>United States v. Kaiser, </em>660 F.2d 724, 730 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In this case, the indictment alleged that Crape stole a border-monitoring sensor, property of the United States Border Patrol. Evidence at trial showed that the sensor was the property of the United States Marine Corps, not the Border Patrol, and the jury instructions referred to the sensor as property of the United States. Crape\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by that variance; the precise governmental owner is irrelevant to a conviction under \u00a7 641. <em>See United States v. Von Stoll, </em>726 F.2d 584, 586-87 (9th Cir. 1984). The differences do not constitute a constructive amendment of the indictment. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Crape\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Finally, Crape argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the requisite guilty intent to steal the border-monitoring sensor. We review de novo \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Crape, an electronics hobbyist, recognized that the border-monitoring sensor\u2019s expensive lithium-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sulfur-dioxide batteries were inconsistent with an abandoned device. More important, Crape disassembled and concealed the border-monitoring sensor in a manner that suggested knowledge that the sensor was valuable. A rational trier of fact could, therefore, conclude that Crape intended to steal the border-monitoring sensor. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports Crape\u2019s conviction, and the district court correctly denied Crape\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
