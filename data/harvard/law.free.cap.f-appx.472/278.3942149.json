He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to explain its reasons for denying his request for a below-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Because Jimenez did not object to his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s comments indicate that it considered Jimenez\u2019s arguments but also took into account his history and the need to deter him from committing further crimes against the public in the future. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court was not required .to engage in \u201crobotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The within-guidelines sentence is presumed to be substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). This court has previously affirmed as substantively reasonable sentences within the guidelines range in other illegal reentry cases when defendants raised similar arguments for below-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
