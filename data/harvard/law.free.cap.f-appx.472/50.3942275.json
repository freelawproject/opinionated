A089 250 256/257 (B.I.A. July 13, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A089 250 256/257 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 31, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions, including the portions of the IJ\u2019s decision not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For an application like Petitioners\u2019, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A.2007). Analyzed under the REAL ID Act, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In finding Shcherbenko not credible, the agency reasonably relied on the omission of her August 2005 attackers\u2019 identity from her asylum statement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2008) (providing that, for purposes of analyzing a credibility determination, \u201c[a]n inconsistency and an omission are ... functionally equivalent\u201d). As the agency noted, Shcherbenko testified that members of the Russian Nationality Unity Party (\u201cRNU\u201d) attacked a baptism ceremony in August 2005 but did not indicate that the attackers were RNU members in her asylum statement. While this omission does not necessarily go to the heart of Shcherbenko\u2019s claim, it was nevertheless a proper basis for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (holding that \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The IJ also reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Shcherbenko\u2019s testimony and her friends\u2019 and pastor\u2019s letters in finding her not credible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). As the agency noted, Shcherbenko testified that she and her friends Nina, Olga, and Alexis (a male) were attacked in March 2007 by orthodox extremists with a bicycle chain; Nina\u2019s letter, however, failed to mention the incident, Olga\u2019s letter did not mention a bicycle chain, Shcherbenko\u2019s pastor\u2019s letter referred only to girls being present, and Maria\u2019s letter indicated that she was also present. Although Shcherbenko argues that Olga\u2019s failure to mention the bicycle chain in the attack and her pastor\u2019s reference to only girls being present do not constitute inconsistencies, where, as here, the agency\u2019s inference \u201cis tethered to the evidentiary record, we will accord deference to the finding.\u201d <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that \u201csupport for a contrary inference-even one more plausible or more natural-does not suggest error\u201d). Moreover, Shcherbenko fails to address Nina\u2019s omission of the attack from her letter, Maria\u2019s statement that she was present during the 2007 incident, or the additional inconsistency between Shcherbenko\u2019s testimony and her pastor\u2019s letter regarding whether gun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>shots were fired, which in itself stands as a valid basis for finding that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Having found Shcherbenko not credible, the agency reasonably noted that her failure to provide corroborating evidence further undermined her credibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (providing that \u201c[t]he testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee\u201d). We have recognized that an applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate her testimony may bear on credibility, either because the absence of particular corroborating evidence is viewed as suspicious, or because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Here, the agency reasonably relied on Shcherbenko\u2019s failure to present corroborating evidence regarding her church attendance in the U.S. and her medical and dental treatments in Russia. While Shcherbenko testified that her mother was unable to obtain her dental records in Russia, which were only kept for one year, the IJ reasonably found her explanation unconvincing because her mother\u2019s letter made no reference to any attempt to obtain the records. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the agency). <em>Cf. Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that an agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistencies in the record unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Although Shcherbenko contends that the BIA erred by failing to assess whether her allegations of past mistreatment, if credible, rose to the level of persecution, the agency had no obligation to do so given the adverse credibility determination. <em>INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (\u201c[a]s a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach\u201d). Lastly, Shcherbenko\u2019s argument that the agency placed excessive reliance on the U.S. Department of State reports is misplaced. A review of the record does not reflect that the agency relied excessively on the State Department reports or ignored any contrary evidence, particularly given the IJ\u2019s extensive discussion of the evidence and explicit statement that he had read through all of the country conditions evidence. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 337 n. 17 (presuming that the agency \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
