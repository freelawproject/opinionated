Off appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>employment action. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, and may affirm on any ground supported by the record: <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Dismissal of Offs wrongful termination claims was proper because these claims are time-barred, as Off filed this action over thirteen years after his terminations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) (providing that \u201cevery civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The district court properly dismissed Offs claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and Privacy Act as time-barred. <em>See Dent v. Cox Commc\u2019ns Las Vegas, Inc., </em>502 F.3d 1141, 1144 (9th Cir.2007) (FLSA claims are subject to at most a three-year statute of limitations); <em>Rose v. United States, </em>905 F.2d 1257, 1259 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe Privacy Act provides a two year statute of limitation, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(5), which commences when the person knows or has reason to know of the alleged violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The district court properly dismissed Offs due process claim because he failed to specify any federal official acting in an individual capacity who allegedly violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Consejo de Desarrollo Economico de Mexicali, A.C. v. United States, </em>482 F.3d 1157, 1173 (9th Cir.2007) <em>(Bivens </em>claims for alleged constitutional violations may be brought against federal officials in their individual capacities, not against the United States which is protected by sovereign immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The district court properly dismissed Offs habeas corpus claim because he failed to allege that he is in custody. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (habeas corpus relief may be sought by \u201ca person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the United States\u2019 motion to extend the time to respond to Offs complaint. <em>See Ahanchian v. Xenon Pictures, Inc., </em>624 F.3d 1253, 1258 (9th Cir. 2010) (discussing standard of review for extension requests under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Offs motion for recusal. See <em>Taylor v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., </em>993 F.2d 710, 712-13 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (discussing standard of review and noting that adverse rulings alone are insufficient to demonstrate judicial bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Offs remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Offs \u201cRequest for Extension and Special Consideration,\u201d filed on July 21, 2011, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b819-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
