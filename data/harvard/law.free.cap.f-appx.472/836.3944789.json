The BIA denied Aguilar\u2019s subsequent motion to reopen or reconsider because Aguilar failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Aguilar petitions for review of both BIA decisions. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">Aguilar\u2019s argument that the <em>Lozada </em>requirements are invalid because they were adopted by adjudication rather than rule-making is without merit. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947); <em>City of Anaheim v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>723 F.2d 656, 659 (9th Cir.1984). Aguilar made no attempt to comply with any of the <em>Lozada </em>requirements. Further, it is not \u201cobvious and undisputed on the face of the record\u201d that Aguilar\u2019s counsel was ineffective. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir.2004). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Aguilar\u2019s motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">Aguilar\u2019s purported waiver of appeal before the IJ was not \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>623 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Biwot v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). The IJ failed to \u201cexpressly and personally inform [Aguilar] that he [had] the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir.2004). Aguilar exhausted his claim that his waiver was not \u201cintelligent\u201d in his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-20\">Although Aguilar did not waive his right to appeal, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because Aguilar cannot show that he had \u201cplausible grounds for relief.\u201d <em>Ramos, </em>623 F.3d at 684. Because of his criminal convictions, the only relief for which Aguilar is eligible is deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The record simply does not support the conclusion that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Aguilar \u201cwill be tortured at the instigation of, or with the acquiescence of the [Salvadoran] government\u201d if he is deported. <em>Del</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number><em>gado v.
