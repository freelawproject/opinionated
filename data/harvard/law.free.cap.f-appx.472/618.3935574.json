Because we are unable to determine the basis for the Appeals Council\u2019s decision or adequately evaluate its conclusions, we reverse and remand. <em>See Gonzalez v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\">Parker argues that the Appeals Council erred in concluding that her past work was as a bill collection clerk. In so concluding, the Appeals Council rejected the finding of the ALJ, which was based on the testimony of a vocational expert, that Parker\u2019s past work was as a car re-possessor. At the February 11, 2009, hearing, the vocational expert initially testified that Parker\u2019s past work was best classified as \u201cbill collection clerk\u201d but then, after hearing Parker\u2019s testimony, concluded that \u201ccar repossessor\u201d more accurately captured her last job. Parker\u2019s testimony at the hearing was that she left the office to arrange for the repossession of cars consistently \u201cthroughout a work week.\u201d This testimony formed the basis for the vocational expert\u2019s conclusion and, in turn, for the ALJ\u2019s disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">If this testimony were accepted and credited, then it does indeed appear that the Appeals Council\u2019s conclusion would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>have to be reversed, as Parker\u2019s description of her job duties and the \u201cbill collection clerk\u201d job assigned by the Appeals Council just do not match. But in fact, the Appeals Council never mentioned this significant, probative evidence in its decision. <em>See Vincent ex rel. Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We cannot tell the reason for this vacuum. It is possible that the Appeals Council meant to reject Parker\u2019s testimony at the 2009 hearing regarding her former job as inconsistent with her testimony on the same subject at the hearings on the earlier application. Even so, \u201cwe must reverse because no explicit finding as to [Parker\u2019s] credibility was made\u201d regarding this critical issue, and remand for further explanation. <em>Albalos v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 871, 873 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also Howard v. Heckler, </em>782 F.2d 1484, 1487 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Appeals Council also indicated that the ALJ had committed an error of law by reopening the decision regarding Parker\u2019s past work that was made in response to her previous applications. Because Parker alleged \u201cchanged circumstances indicating a greater disability,\u201d specifically, that she had reached \u201cadvanced age,\u201d res judicata did not bar reconsideration of her disability application. <em>Chavez v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 691, 693 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted); Social Security Acquiescence Ruling (AR) 97-4(9). Neither the ALJ nor the Appeals Council discussed, however, whether \u201cnew and material evidence\u201d existed sufficient to defeat claim preclusion as applied to the previous ALJ\u2019s specific finding regarding Parker\u2019s past work. <em>See Chavez, </em>844 F.2d at 694; AR 97-4(9). It is possible that the Appeals Council did not mention Parker\u2019s 2009 testimony as to her job duties because it believed that her testimony was not \u201cnew and material,\u201d as it concerned a nonchanging matter already decided. But, again, we cannot affirm on a ground never articulated. <em>Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1225-26 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Thus, although it is possible that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision left out Parker\u2019s 2009 testimony on one of the two grounds indicated, we cannot evaluate any such unarticulated reasons at this stage. Instead, we remand to the district court, with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further explanation of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
