He contends that his sentence was improperly increased because his prior Virginia conviction did not meet the relevant federal definition of a drug-trafficking offense. He argues that because the Virginia statute criminalizes the mere giving of drugs, it is broader than the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of drug trafficking provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)) and recognized by <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We review only for plain error because Flores did not raise the issue in the district court. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 523 (5th Cir.2008). Flores must show an error that is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d and that the error affects his substantial rights; if he does so, we have discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">To determine whether a prior offense was a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), we look at the statutory definition of the prior offense and not at the facts underlying the conviction. <em>United States v. Reyes-Mendoza, </em>665 F.3d 165, 166-67 (5th Cir.2011). Nonetheless, when a statute can be violated in more than one manner, only some of which are within the relevant federal definition, we may look at certain state court documents to determine whether a prior conviction meets the federal definition. <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 524; <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The Guidelines define a drug trafficking offense as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iv)); <em>see United States v. Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d 210, 212-13 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 129, 181 L.Ed.2d 50 (2011). The Virginia statute under which Flores was convicted provides that it is unlawful \u201cto manufacture, sell, <em>give, </em>distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture, sell, give or distribute a controlled substance or an imitation controlled substance.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-248(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The Government does not contest Flores\u2019s assertion that the act of giving drugs is outside the Guidelines definition of trafficking. However, the Government contends that state court documents show that Flores\u2019 prior crime was not for giving drugs but for drug trafficking within the relevant definition articulated in \u00a7 2L1.2. Even if we assume without deciding that the Virginia statute criminalizes conduct that is not drug trafficking under \u00a7 2L1.2, Flores nonetheless fails to show a clear or obvious error in his sentence increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The sentencing court had before it, as an attachment to the PSR addendum, the \u201cConviction and Sentencing Order\u201d from the Virginia case. This Conviction and Sentencing Order, signed by the court, twice describes that Flores possessed methamphetamine with \u201cintent to manufacture, sell, or distribute it, as charged in the indictment.\u201d Consistent with that limiting description and acceptable under <em>Shepard, </em>the indictment, which exists in the record on appeal, charged that Flores possessed methamphetamine with \u201cintent to manufacture, sell or distribute it.\u201d <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Consequently, the indictment, and the Conviction and Sentencing Order referring to that indictment, show that Flores was not prosecuted for or convicted of merely giving away methamphetamine. It was not a clear or obvious error, therefore, for the district court to conclude that Flores had been convicted of a drug-trafficking felony. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 524. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
