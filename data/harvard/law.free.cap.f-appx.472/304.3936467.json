He claims that his prior offense, under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01, assault of a family member, is not a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal. He contends that the IJ and the BIA erred in not applying Fifth Circuit precedent requiring the application of the categorical approach in determining whether the assault offense was a crime involving moral turpitude. He asserts that an evaluation of his criminal record leaves open the real possibility that his assault conviction was for reckless conduct, a simple assault, or even a non-contact assault, which are not crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We apply a two-part standard of review to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Aldape-Garcia committed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Amouzadeh v. Winfrey, </em>467 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir.2006). First, we accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its definition of the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, we review de novo whether the elements of a state or federal crime fit the BIA\u2019s definition of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s determination of what constitutes moral turpitude must be upheld if it is reasonable. <em>Hamdan v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Contrary to Aldape-Garcia\u2019s insistance that our analysis is confined to the categorical approach because \u00a7 22.01 encompasses acts that both are and are not crimes involving moral turpitude, we must review the record of conviction to determine whether Aldape-Garcia\u2019s offense falls into a subsection that is a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Amouzadeh, </em>467 F.3d at 455. Under Texas law, a person commits the offense of assault if he \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another, including the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) (West 2011). The record of conviction reveals that Aldape-Garcia was convicted under \u00a7 22.01(a)(1). The charging instrument tracks the language of that subsection, stating that Aldape-Garcia \u201cintentionally and knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to\u201d the victim, \u201ca member of the Defendant\u2019s family ... by striking the complainant with his hand.\u201d As the record shows that Aldape-Garcia was convicted of intentionally inflicting bodily injury on a member of his family, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his assault offense was a crime involving moral turpitude was reasonable. <em>See In re Tran, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 291, 294 (BIA 1996) (holding that a conviction for willful infliction of corporal injury on the parent of one\u2019s child under a California statute was a crime involving moral turpitude).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
