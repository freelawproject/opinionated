Garza argues that the state trial court violated his federal due process rights and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair by admitting his former girlfriend\u2019s testimony about pri- or conduct as propensity evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we may grant a habeas petition only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cforbidden by \u2018clearly established Federal law,\u2019 as laid out by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Holley v. Yarborough, </em>568 F.3d 1091, 1101 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). A legal principle is \u201cclearly established\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) if \u201cit is embodied in a holding of [the Supreme] Court.\u201d <em>Thaler v. Haynes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1171, 1173, 175 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2010) (citing <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 74, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">Although the Supreme Court has said the writ should issue \u201cwhen constitutional errors have rendered the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d the Supreme Court \u201chas not yet made a clear ruling that admission of irrelevant or overtly prejudicial evidence constitutes a due process violation sufficient to warrant issuance of the writ.\u201d <em>Holley, </em>568 F.3d at 1101. The Supreme Court reserved the issue of whether admitting other-crimes evidence to show conduct in conformity therewith violates due process. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>see also Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 863 (9th Cir.2006). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the California Court of Appeal acted in an objectively unreasonable manner in concluding that the propen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>sity evidence introduced against Garza did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b722-5\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">I concur in the memorandum disposition. I write separately to express my view that <em>Holley v. Yarborough, </em>568 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.2009) was wrongly decided, and merits reconsideration en banc at a future date. It is not true, as <em>Holley </em>held, that the introduction of \u201covertly prejudicial\u201d evidence at trial could <em>never </em>be found to violate \u201cclearly established federal law\u201d because the Supreme Court \u201chas not yet made a clear ruling that admission of irrelevant or overtly prejudicial evidence constitutes a due process violation sufficient to warrant issuance of the writ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The Supreme Court has expressly left open the question of whether the introduction of <em>propensity </em>evidence would violate due process <em>because it was propensity evidence. See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860 (9th Cir.2006), therefore correctly held that there is no clearly established law that the admission of propensity evidence <em>per se </em>violates due process. <em>See id. </em>at 866-67. The Court has not, however, left open the question of whether the admission of <em>unduly prejudicial </em>evidence could violate due process. Although it has not held that the admission of a particular piece of evidence did, in fact, violate due process, the Court has stated that due process entitles a defendant to a trial that is fundamentally fair, and has applied this standard in holding that the admission at trial of particular prejudicial evidence did not violate due process. <em>See Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 75, 112 S.Ct. 475; <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 352, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990). Thus, as we held in <em>Albemi, </em>\u201cThe Supreme Court has established a general principle that evidence that \u2018is so fundamentally unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice\u2019 may violate due process.\u201d 458 F.3d at 864 (quoting <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 352, 110 S.Ct. 668).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">This \u201cfundamental conceptions of justice\u201d standard is a broad one. Most state court applications of it are therefore likely to be reasonable. <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 778, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (\u201c[T]he more general the rule being considered, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d) (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004)). Habeas petitioners are not, however, categorically foreclosed from prevailing on such a due process claim when the deferential 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard applies. In some cases, it undoubtedly would be unreasonable for a state court to conclude that the introduction of \u201covertly prejudicial\u201d evidence did not violate due process. <em>Holley </em>is therefore wrong, and should be reconsidered in an appropriate case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
