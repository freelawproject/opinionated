Tillio, Sr. (\u201cTillio\u201d), proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, appeals from the District Court\u2019s May 7, 2012 order dismissing his complaint. We will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-20\">In April 2012, Tillio filed an application to proceed in forma pauperis and a complaint alleging that several defendants were violating his civil rights by conducting surveillance on him and his son. (Dkt. No. 3.) On May 7, 2012, the District Court granted Tillio leave to proceed in forma pauperis, but dismissed his \u201crambling and unclear\u201d complaint without prejudice. (Dkt. No. 2.) Tillio was granted leave to amend his complaint within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">Rather than, filing an amended complaint, Tillio filed a Notice of Appeal on May 21,. 2012. The Clerk notified Tillio of a potential jurisdictional defect pursuant to <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam), and that his appeal would be submitted for possible summary action. Tillio did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-23\">Normally, an order that \u201cdismisses a complaint without prejudice is neither final nor appealable\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Borelli, </em>532 F.2d at 951. Such an order becomes final and appealable, though, if the plaintiff \u201cdeclares his intention to stand on his complaint\u201d instead of amending it. <em>Id. </em>at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-24\">There is no \u201cclear rule for determining when a party has elected to stand on his or her complaint.\u201d <em>Hagan v. Rogers, </em>570 F.3d 146, 151 (3d Cir.2009). However, when the District Court has provided a set amount of time within which to amend, and the plaintiff fails to do so, the Court may conclude that the plaintiff elected to stand on his Complaint. <em>Batoff v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>977 F.2d 848, 851 n. 5 (3d Cir.1992); <em>see also Hagan, </em>570 F.3d at 151 (concluding that plaintiffs stood on their complaints because they filed notices of appeal rather than amending within speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>fied time period); <em>Frederico v. Home Depot, </em>507 F.3d 188, 193 (3d Cir.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u25a0Tillio filed a Notice of Appeal, instead of amending his complaint, within the thirty-day window provided by the District Court. Therefore, Tillio elected to stand - on his complaint, and the order of the District Court is final and appealable. We have jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Having determined that jurisdiction is proper, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court if no substantial question is presented on appeal. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We agree with the District Court that Tillio\u2019s complaint does not meet the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). He claimed that \u201cthis women Dr. Nell\u201d and the Horsham and Lower Merion Police Departments were violating his civil rights through \u201cscam surveillance.\u201d (Dkt. No. 3, pp. 3-4.) He does not describe any factual basis for Dr. Nell\u2019s alleged liability, nor does he name any individual police officers or state a factual basis for the police departments\u2019 alleged liability. Even given the most liberal reading, Tillio\u2019s complaint does not contain the requisite \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that [he] is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Dismissal was therefore appropriate. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (a complaint does not suffice \u201cif it tenders \u2018naked assertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The District Court properly dismissed Tillio\u2019s complaint and allowed him leave to amend. We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court because no substantial question is presented by this appeal. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
