We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment affirming the denial of social security benefits, and we affirm. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b581-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b581-21\">The ALJ gave specific and legitimate reasons for discounting Dr. James Czysz\u2019s opinion in 2008 that Carter experienced significant decompensation, low global functioning, and compromised interpersonal resilience. The ALJ noted that Dr. Czysz\u2019s tests revealed that Carter\u2019s cognitive functioning was within normal limits, and that his treatment notes indicated that Carter\u2019s social difficulty with redirection improved with each encounter. Such a discrepancy between a doctor\u2019s opinion and his other records constitutes a \u201cclear and convincing reason for not relying on the doctor\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Bayliss v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir. 2005). The ALJ properly discounted Dr. Czysz\u2019s opinion on the basis that it was unsupported by contemporaneous objective evidence. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The ALJ gave clear and convincing reasons for discrediting Carter. First, the ALJ observed that Carter made several admissions that contradicted his asserted disability. Notably, Carter told Dr. Breen that (1) he was fired from the Seattle Times because of racial issues, not because of any inability to perform his work; (2) that if he had not been let go, he would have continued working; and (3) that if he could relocate back to San Francisco, he \u201ccould get a job as a telemarketer.\u201d This evidence contradicts Carter\u2019s assertion that he is unable to work because of interpersonal difficulties. Such \u201cinternal contradictions\u201d in the claimant\u2019s testimony constitute a legitimate reason to disbelieve his testimony. <em>See Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Second, the ALJ properly reasoned that Carter\u2019s prior conviction for welfare fraud \u201ccasts doubt on [his] motivation to truthfully report.\u201d <em>See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 680 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Third, the ALJ discounted Carter\u2019s testimony because it was not corroborated by medical evidence. The ALJ stated that despite Carter\u2019s descriptions of \u201csevere pain,\u201d Dr. Wainstein observed that \u201cclaimant sat throughout the interview without changing positions[,] did not appear to be in any distress,\u201d and exhibited no physical limitations except in his ankles. This inconsistency between the claimant\u2019s asserted symptoms and his abilities during an exam constitutes a specific and legitimate basis for a negative credibility determination. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Fourth, the ALJ reasonably pointed out that Carter did not engage in treatment commensurate to his alleged physical and mental symptoms. We have held that lack of treatment is a legitimate reason to discredit the claimant. <em>Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Fifth, the ALJ concluded that Carter\u2019s credibility was undermined by the fact that he worked part-time for nearly another year after his alleged disability onset date of March 22, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f a claimant engages in numerous daily activities involving skills that could be transferred to the workplace, the ALJ may discredit the claimant\u2019s allegations upon making specific findings relating to those findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989)). Here, the fact that Carter continued working past his alleged onset date forms a valid basis for doubting his veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">To conclude, the ALJ made specific findings identifying conflicts between Carter\u2019s testimony and the medical evidence, internal contradictions in his testimony, conflicts between his conduct and his alleged disability, and his past untruthfulness. We hold that these are clear and convincing reasons for discrediting Carter\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">The ALJ did not err in rejecting the lay testimony of vocational counselor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>John Shiels, who opined that Carter\u2019s leg pain, depression, and mental health challenges were \u201csevere barriers to employment.\u201d The ALJ provided a specific and germane reason for rejecting Shiels\u2019 opinion by explaining that \u201cthis comment is not supported by the record as thoroughly discussed above.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s summary of the record identified medical evidence that contradicts Shiels\u2019 opinion. First, Dr. Wainstein concluded that Carter\u2019s alleged leg pain would not prevent him from sitting or from tolerating six hours of standing and walking. Second, although Dr. Breen diagnosed Carter with \u201cadjustment reaction with depressed mood,\u201d he reported that Carter \u201cacknowledges that he could work in a similar position, if there were other opportunities.\u201d And while Dr. Breen also diagnosed Carter with \u201cschizoid personality,\u201d he concluded that this \u201cdid not directly impact [Carter\u2019s] ability to remain employed.\u201d Third, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discounting Dr. Czysz\u2019s opinion regarding Carter\u2019s interpersonal difficulties likewise justify rejecting Shiels\u2019 view about Carter\u2019s \u201cmental health challenges.\u201d We have held that inconsistency with medical evidence is a germane reason to reject lay testimony. <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1218. Given the numerous discrepancies between Shiels\u2019 opinion and the medical record, the ALJ properly rejected the lay testimony for a germane reason supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Finally, the ALJ was not obligated to recontact Shiels. \u201cAn ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record further is triggered only when there is ambiguous evidence or when the record is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.\u201d <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing <em>Tonapetyan, </em>242 F.3d at 1150). Shiels\u2019 opinion was not ambiguous. Nor was the record inadequate for the ALJ to properly evaluate the evidence. After requesting a clarifying opinion from Dr. Czysz in 2008, \u201c[t]he ALJ, with support in the record, found the evidence adequate to make a determination regarding [Carter\u2019s] disability.\u201d <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1217. Accordingly, the ALJ did not have a duty to further develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The ALJ did not err and his decision to deny Carter benefits is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b581-22\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">. On appeal, Carter revises his onset date to February 2006. Even so, this does not change the fact that he represented to the Social Security Administration that he was disabled during a lengthy period in which he was working. In any event, because the ALJ was not apprised of this revised onset date, his credibility concern was reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
