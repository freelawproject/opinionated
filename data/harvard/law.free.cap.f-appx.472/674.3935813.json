The BIA found \u2014 on remand, after the Court granted a prior petition for review in part, <em>see Abulfeilat v. Gonzales, </em>244 Fed.Appx. 159 (9th Cir. 2007) \u2014 that Abulfeilat had committed a particularly serious crime, rendering him ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation; that he was ineligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); and that he was ineligible for voluntary departure. We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Because Abulfeilat raises his argument that the BIA was required to remand his case to an immigration judge for the first time in his petition for review, we cannot consider it. <em>See Chettiar v. Holder, </em>665 F.3d 1375, 1379 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The BIA applied the correct standard in determining that the crime for which Abulfeilat is deportable, conspiracy to evade Iraqi sanction regulations, is \u201cparticularly serious,\u201d rendering him ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Arbid v. Holder, </em>674 F.3d 1138, 1140-42 (9th Cir.2012); <em>Delgado v. Holder, </em>648 F.3d 1095, 1099-1100 (9th Cir.2011). It properly found that the nature of the crime and the underlying facts of the conviction \u2014 in particular the scale of the attempted crime and its national security implications \u2014 justified a presumption that Abulfeilat was a danger to the community. <em>See Delgado, </em>648 F.3d at 1107. This conclusion was not an abuse of discretion, as it was neither arbitrary, irrational, nor contrary to law. <em>See Arbid, </em>674 F.3d at 1142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The BIA\u2019s determination regarding Abulfeilat\u2019s claim for deferral of removal under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence. While Abulfeilat introduced evidence that apostasy is punishable by death under Islamic law and that Muslims who convert to Christianity are subject to various forms of discrimination in Jordan, he failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured with the consent or acquiescence, through awareness or willful blindness, of the Jordanian government. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Finally, the agency properly determined that Abulfeilat\u2019s conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude rendered him ineligible for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
