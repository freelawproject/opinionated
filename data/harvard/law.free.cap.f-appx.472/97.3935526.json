Aug. 25, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A075 776 847 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 3, 1999). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-21\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-22\">Even assuming that Dong was credible, the agency did not err in finding that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in China. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005). As the agency reasonably noted, Dong failed to show that any of his neighbors suffered harm for their role in the January 1998 altercation with family planning officers. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). Indeed, Dong failed to offer any evidence showing that authorities sought him fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lowing the issuance of his summons in April <em>1998 or </em>had any continued interest in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Moreover, the agency did not err in according diminished weight to Dong\u2019s summons because it was not authenticated by any means. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). The agency also reasonably concluded that Dong\u2019s summons, which merely directed him to report to the local precinct for questioning, was entitled to minimal weight because it did not indicate the purpose of the questioning. <em>See Jian Xing Huang, </em>421 F.3d at 128-29; <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329. Under these circumstances, the agency did not err in concluding that Dong failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As Dong failed to meet his burden for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. See <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir.1991). Although Dong also argues that he established his eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), Dong filed his application prior to the effective date of CAT\u2019s implementing legislation and did not subsequently assert a claim for CAT relief before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Because the agency did not err in finding that Dong failed to establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, we decline to consider his challenges to the agency\u2019s alternative basis for denial \u2014 that he was not credible. <em>See INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (per curiam). Even assuming error in the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, given the agency\u2019s reasonable alternative burden finding, remand of these proceedings would be futile. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition <em>for </em>review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
