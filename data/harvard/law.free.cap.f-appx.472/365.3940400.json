This action stems from the sale of a home at 1367 Holland Street, Birmingham, Michigan (the \u201cBirmingham property\u201d). After the Willeckes purchased the Birmingham property from the Toths, the Willeckes sued numerous parties connected to the sale, including the Toths. With respect to the Toths, the Willeckes alleged multiple acts of fraud and breach of contract. R. 1, Compl. The district court denied the Toths\u2019 motion to dismiss and granted summary judgment in favor of the Willeckes after finding that: (1) the Toths fraudulently made material misrepresentations regarding the Birmingham property; (2) the Toths breached the contract selling the Birmingham Property to the Willeckes, and (3) the Toths breached the lease agreement allowing the Toths to live at the Birmingham Property after its sale to the Willeckes. R. 79, Order. The district court also entered a judgment against the Toths \u201cin the sum of $304,393.99, plus costs, fees and the imposition of statutory interest as authorized by law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">On appeal, the Toths charge, that they were denied their Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. In addition, the Toths assert that the district court \u201cwas biased against them for not having legal counsel representation.... \u201d Appellant Br. at 4. Accordingly, the Toths request that we overturn the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">We begin with the Toths\u2019 Seventh Amendment claim. The Toths assert that the district court\u2019s disposition of their case by summary judgment deprived them of their Seventh Amendment right to a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. This claim is unavailing because summary judgment does not violate the Seventh Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Love v. Electric Power Bd. of Chattanooga, EPB, </em>392 Fed.Appx. 405, 410 (6th Cir. 2010); <em>McDaniel v. Kindred Healthcare, Inc., </em>311 Fed.Appx. 758, 758-59 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>2009); <em>Cook v. McPherson, </em>273 Fed.Appx. 421, 425 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Next, the Toths accuse the district court of judicial bias. In particular, the Toths note that \u201c[ejvery time [their] case came to court the judge made comments\u201d about their lack of counsel, and \u201cthis is why [they] believe [the district court] did not listen to find the truth behind this case.\u201d Appellant Br. at 4. The record reflects that the district court repeatedly referred to the fact that the Toths were proceeding pro se. R. 85 at 40-42. Nothing in the record, however, supports the Toths\u2019 allegation of judicial bias. Rather, the district court appeared sympathetic to the Toths\u2019 plight, noting \u201can element of sadness\u201d in the fact that the Toths were unable to secure effective legal representation. <em>Id. </em>The district court also expressly stated that its decision was \u201cnot based on [the Toths\u2019] lack of having counsel but because ... their request for dispositive relief was without merit.\u201d R. 85, Transcript, 41. Thus, we reject the Toths\u2019 allegations of judicial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We now turn to the substance of the Toths\u2019 summary judgment appeal. We have carefully reviewed the applicable law, the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs de novo. <em>See Wuliger v. Mfrs. Life Ins. Co., </em>567 F.3d 787, 792 (6th Cir.2009) (explaining that a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo). After considering all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the Toths, <em>Combs v. Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>354 F.3d 568, 576-77 (6th Cir.2004), we find that the Toths have not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding either the Willeckes\u2019 fraud claim or their breach of contract claims. Because the district court thoroughly analyzed these issues and appropriately granted summary judgment, a full written opinion on these matters by this Court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
