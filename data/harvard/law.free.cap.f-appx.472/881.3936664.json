Because Ross was responsible for 314.3 grams of crack cocaine, the court calculated a base offense level of 32. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (Nov.2007). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Ross\u2019 total offense level was 29. Combined with his criminal history category of V, the result was a guidelines range of 140 to 175 months imprisonment. The court sentenced Ross to 140 months in prison on Count 1 and to 60 months on Count 2, with each sentence to run consecutively, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (D)(ii) (imposing a mandatory minimum consecutive prison sentence of 60 months for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">In 2011 Ross, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The district court denied that motion, and Ross has appealed. We review only for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Under Amendment 750, the guidelines assign a base offense level of 32 for cases involving at least 280. grams but less than 840 grams of crack cocaine. , U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (Nov.2011). Ross was responsible for 314.3 grams of crack cocaine, so his total offense level, after a 3-level reduction for acceptance responsibility, is 29. Combined with a criminal history category of V, his guidelines range after Amendment 750 is 140 to 175 months, the same guidelines range calculated by the district court in 2008. Amendment 750 had no effect on Ross\u2019 guidelines range, so the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ross\u2019 motion. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (\u201cA district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. This authority is limited to those guideline amendments ... that have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ble guideline range.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-18\">. Ross\u2019 contention that the district court erroneously construed his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is merit-less.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
