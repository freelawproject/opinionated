We review de novo questions of law and for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion Nguyai established extraordinary circumstances excusing her late filing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies between Nguyai\u2019s testimony and asylum application regarding whether she went into hiding and moved around to avoid the Mungiki, <em>see Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 939-40 (9th Cir.2000), and based on her failure to provide corroboration, <em>see Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cif the trier of fact either does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application\u201d). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, we deny the petition as to Nguyai\u2019s withholding of removal claim. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Finally, Nguyai\u2019s CAT claim fails because it is based on the same statements that the agency found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the finding that it is more likely than not Nguyai would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to Kenya. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b818-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
