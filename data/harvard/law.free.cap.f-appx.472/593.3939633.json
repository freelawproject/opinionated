Lovellette (\u201cLovellette\u201d) was indicted on charges of theft by a credit union employee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657, and tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. A jury found Lovellette guilty on both counts. Lovellette appeals her convictions. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm. We address her arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">1. Lovellette argues that insufficient evidence supports her conviction for theft by a credit union employee because the government failed to prove: (1) that the credit union at issue, Pacific Marine Credit Union (\u201cPMCU\u201d), was insured by the National Credit Union Administration Board; (2) that $100,000 was stolen from PMCU; and, (3) that Lovellette stole the $100,000. Lovellette\u2019s arguments fail, as there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find each of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">William Bernie, the internal auditor at PMCU, testified that PMCU\u2019s deposits were insured by the federal government. During Bernie\u2019s testimony, the government also offered into evidence a certificate by the National Credit Union Administration. <em>See United States v. Bellucci </em>995 F.2d 157, 160 (9th Cir.1993) \u2022 (holding that a bank\u2019s FDIC certificate of insurance was sufficient to establish that the bank was insured by the FDIC); <em>United States v. Corbin, </em>972 F.2d 271, 272 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cWe have held that bank employees\u2019 uncontradicted testimony of a bank\u2019s insured status can sufficiently support the jury\u2019s conclusion that this element was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Bernie also testified that $100,000 was stolen from the PMCU Branch on May 2, 2002. Branch manager Candace Neuroth likewise testified that $100,000 went missing from the branch on May 2, 2002. The evidence also established that Lovellette had access to the missing cash, and that in 2002 Lovellette deposited over $70,000 in her various bank accounts, the majority of which were in $100 denominations. This was significantly higher than the $34,379.00 in income Lovellette and her husband declared on their 2002 joint income tax return. Accordingly, sufficient evidence supports Lovellette\u2019s conviction for theft by a credit union employee. <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">2. Because sufficient evidence establishes that Lovellette stole $100,000 from PMCU and failed to pay income taxes on the stolen money, sufficient evidence also supports Lovellette\u2019s conviction for tax evasion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">3. The admission of various business and public records during Lovellette\u2019s trial did not violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. \u201cBusiness and public records are generally admissible absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>confrontation ... because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial\u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Mass., 557 </em>U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2539-40, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">4. The government\u2019s use of certificates of authenticity during Lovellette\u2019s trial did not violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1077 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">5. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to give Lovellette\u2019s proffered jury instructions regarding lost evidence. Lovellette has not demonstrated that the evidence was lost in bad faith or that she was prejudiced by the loss. <em>See United States v. Artero, </em>121 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Jennell, </em>749 F.2d 1302, 1308-09 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
