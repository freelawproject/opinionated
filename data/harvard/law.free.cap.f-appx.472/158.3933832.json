We grant the Appellee\u2019s motion, dismiss the appeal in part for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed, and affirm the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 13, 2011. The notice of appeal was filed on February 8, 2012. Because Tran failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">We further affirm the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration and deny Tran\u2019s motion for justice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\"> Tran\u2019s motion for reconsideration, filed on February 2, 2012, was not within the period for filing a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment and, therefore, the motion did not extend the appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed.
