WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">Aurora Pllumaj, a native and citizen of Albania, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s decision and deny Pllumaj\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">Pllumaj entered the United States on or around September 3, 2001, without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer. On August 28, 2002, Pllumaj filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection, asserting that she was persecuted in Albania on account of her parents\u2019 political activities with the Democratic Party (PD) in Albania and her involvement with the Youth Forum of the PD of Shkodra, the city where she and her parents resided. Pllumaj\u2019s application also stated that following a July 9, 2001 protest by the Youth Forum and PD at which she gave a speech, three men forced her into a car, beat her, called her a \u201cdemocrat bitch,\u201d and drove to an abandoned building, where the three raped her. On October 22, 2002, the INS commenced removal proceedings against Pllumaj and her husband, Kledi Pllumaj, filing a Notice to Appear (NTA) and charging them with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae as aliens not admitted or paroled. Petitioners admitted the NTA allegations, conceded removability, and stated that they planned to apply for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Pllumaj filed a new application for asylum and withholding of removal on August 25, 2004, and included her husband as a derivative applicant for asylum. Pllumaj, her parents, and her husband testified at the December 5, 2005 merits hearing before the IJ. Pllumaj and her parents testified to her involvement with the PD Youth Forum, and her parents testified that they were active in the PD. Pllumaj and her parents testified that after the men beat and raped Pllumaj following her speech at a political protest, Pllumaj spent three days in a hospital in a city thirty minutes away from the family\u2019s residence in Shkodra, and then stayed with an uncle in a city at an hour\u2019s distance from Shkodra for several months. Pllumaj\u2019s parents testified that they strove to hide that Pllumaj had been raped because in Albania women that are raped bring shame on their families and are sometimes killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">On November 13, 2008, the IJ issued a written decision denying Pllumaj\u2019s applications and ordering her removed to Albania. The IJ found Pllumaj was ineligible for asylum because she did not establish that she filed her application within one-year of her arrival; determined that Pllumaj was not credible, noting internal inconsistencies in her testimony, inconsistencies between her and her mother\u2019s testimony, as well as inconsistencies between her parents\u2019 testimony; and alternatively found that even if Pllumaj had testified credibly about her past persecution, DHS demonstrated that country conditions in Albania had changed to such an extent that Pllumaj no longer had a well-founded fear of persecution. Regarding Pllumaj\u2019s request for CAT protection, the IJ concluded that there was no evidence that she would be targeted for torture if returned to Albania or that any such torture would be at the hands of the Albanian government. Petitioners appealed to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The BIA dismissed Petitioners\u2019 appeal, agreeing only with the IJ\u2019s alternative finding that assuming that Pllumaj was credible and that she established past persecution, her presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was rebutted by improved country conditions in Albania:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">We agree with the Immigration Judge that, assuming arguendo that she was credible and that past persecution was established, the respondent\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear has been rebutted by improved country conditions in Albania. <em>See </em>I.J. at 13-14; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(ii); <em>Ceraj v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 583, 593-594 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cthis court has [ ] repeatedly concluded that the conditions in Albania have improved to such an extent that there is no objective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution based on political or religious beliefs\u201d) (citing, inter alia, <em>Ramaj v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 520, 530-31 (6th Cir.2006)). As the [IJ] noted, DHS has the burden to show a change in country conditions to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. Under the facts of this case, the country conditions reports relied on by the [IJ] rebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. In addition, the most recent report issued in March 2010, including descriptions of the overwhelmingly peaceful nature of the most recent national elections, further supports the finding of improved country conditions. <em>See </em>Department of State, Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy, and Labor-Albania Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2009 (March 11, 2010). Based on improved country conditions, the respondent\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear has been rebutted, and on that basis she has failed to establish eligibility for asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and for withholding of removal to Albania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">The respondent states on appeal that she should be granted asylum as a matter of discretion on humanitarian grounds pursuant to <em>Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16 (BIA 1989); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A). We disagree. The respondent has made a very limited argument on this issue and has not delineated any of the specific factors that would lead to a favorable exercise of discretion on the very narrow form of relief of humanitarian asylum, and does not allege risk of \u201cother serious harm.\u201d The respondent has not met her burden of proof on this claim. <em>See generally Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 190-91 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484 (4th Cir.2006) (persuasive circuit authority).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">AR 1-4. Petitioners filed the instant petition for review on September 15, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Where the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision and issues a separate opinion, rather than summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Al-Ghorbani v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 980, 991 (6th Cir.2009). To the extent the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, however, we also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions de novo, but defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the INA and accompanying regulations. <em>Shan Sheng Zhao v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 238, 246, 247 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Pllumaj\u2019s first five issues on appeal fail to acknowledge that the BIA did not base its decision on the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility or untimeliness findings, but rather, the BIA agreed only with the IJ\u2019s alternative finding that assuming Pllumaj was credible and that she established past persecution, her presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was rebutted by improved country conditions in Albania. See <em>Bonilla-Morales v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 1132, 1136 (6th Cir.2010) (stating that where the BIA analyzes an applicant\u2019s asylum claim assuming that the applicant\u2019s testimony was credible, \u201c[this court] will do so as well.\u201d), <em>Ayyad v. Holder, </em>391 Fed.Appx. 485, 487 (6th Cir.2010) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Pllumaj\u2019s first five issues on appeal include that the BIA violated her due process rights by failing to conduct an independent evidentiary evaluation of the IJ\u2019s decision; that the BIA \u201cfocused entirely on changed country conditions, instead of on the [IJ\u2019s] gross errors\u201d; and that various rulings of the IJ were erroneous. However, Pllumaj cites no authority to support that the BIA must discuss an IJ\u2019s findings and rulings if the BIA agrees with an alternative and dispositive ground for denying asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Djokovic v. Mukasey, </em>273 Fed.Appx. 505, 511 (6th Cir.2008) (unpublished) (declining to review IJ\u2019s credibility determination where affirming on basis of changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">As to her asylum and withholding of removal claims, Pllumaj has abandoned these claims by failing to challenge the basis of the BIA\u2019s decision \u2014 that conditions in Albania had improved to the extent that she no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>All that remains then is Pllumaj\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision to deny humanitarian asylum. An applicant who has established past persecution on account of a qualifying ground, but who does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution may nonetheless be granted asylum on humanitarian grounds under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii). The Attorney General reserves this form of asylum for rare instances involving the most atrocious abuse, where the past persecution was so severe that it would be inhumane to return the alien to her native country. <em>See In re Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16, 19-20 (BIA 1989) (granting humanitarian asylum to applicant, a Chinese Christian who established that he suffered extreme abuse, both physical and psychological, over ten years during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution); <em>Ben Hamida v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 734, 740 (6th Cir.2007) (noting that \u201c[ujnder the rule announced in <em>[Chen </em>], in rare instances, an applicant may be eligible for asylum where he \u2018has suffered under atrocious forms of persecution,\u2019 even where there is little likelihood of future persecution.\u201d) We review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Pllumaj humanitarian asylum for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chieh v. Holder, </em>411 Fed.Appx. 800, 805 (6th Cir.2011) (unpublished), <em>Mbodj v. Holder, </em>394 Fed.Appx. 239, 245 (6th Cir. 2010) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Pllumaj argues that \u201ceven if country conditions have changed since her departure, she would endure great psychological hardship if she were to return to Albania due to the serious harm she suffered,\u201d and that \u201creturn to Albania would risk even more serious psychological harm for her and destruction of her family relationships based upon the cultural context in Albania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Although being beaten and raped by three men is deplorable and likely to have long-lasting emotional and psychological effects, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in finding Pllumaj\u2019s limited argument insufficient to support the extraordinary relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Pllumaj\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">. We observe that this court has noted that conditions have improved in Albania to such an extent that various asylum applicants could not show an objective basis for a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>founded fear of future persecution based on political or religious beliefs. <em>See Ceraj v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 583, 593 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see also Macotaj v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 464, 465 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Mullai v.
