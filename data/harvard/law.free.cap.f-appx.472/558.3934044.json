The BIA concluded that Petitioner was not simultaneously eligible for waiver of inadmissibility under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182, INA'\u00a7 212(c) and cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, INA \u00a7 240A.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Petitioner argues that the BIA did not provide him with meaningful review because, in deciding that he could not file for relief simultaneously under INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(c) and 240A, the BIA relied on an unamended version of our opinion in <em>Garcia-Jimenez v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 679 (9th Cir.2007). We disagree. Although the amended version of the opinion, <em>Garcia-Jimenez v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 1082 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(9th Cir.2007), included a dissent by Judge Pregerson and was available at the time of the BIA\u2019s decision, the text of the majority\u2019s opinion remained unchanged. Our panel is bound by the majority opinion in <em>Garcia-Jimenez, </em>488 F.3d at 1083-86, which must be followed unless or until it is altered by a supervening higher authority such as an en banc panel of our Court or the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Miller v. Gammie, </em>335 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc). Judge Pregersoris dissent therefore does not change the majority\u2019s holding that INA \u00a7 240A(c)(6) is unambiguous and that aliens may not simultaneously receive cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(a) and waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>Garcia-Jimenez, </em>488 F.3d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Petitioner argues that repeal of former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2), INA \u00a7 244(a)(2), which allowed for suspension of deportation, is impermissibly retroactive as applied to him because at the time he entered his 1996 guilty plea he could not have known INA \u00a7 244(a)(2) would be repealed. The repeal of INA \u00a7 244(a)(2) is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to an alien who was not eligible for suspension of deportation at the time it was repealed. <em>Valencia-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 1319, 1330 (9th Cir.2006). An alien was only eligible for suspension of deportation if he had good moral character for the period required. INA \u00a7 244(a)(2) (repealed 1997). \u201cNo person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who, during the period for which good moral character is required to be established, is, or was ... (8) one who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8), INA \u00a7 101(f)(8). Petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony in 1995 and thus could not establish good moral character. Even if he received relief under INA \u00a7 212(c) for his 1995 conviction, that relief would not expunge the aggravated felony from his record, and he would remain ineligible for suspension of deportation. <em>Becker v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1000 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Petitioner argues that the government acted improperly by withholding issuance of an Order to Show Cause (predecessor to the Notice to Appear) until after the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was passed. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g), INA \u00a7 242(g), and our decision in <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594 (9th Cir.2002), we do not have jurisdiction to consider Navarro-Ruiz\u2019s challenge to the timing of the commencement of his removal proceedings. We therefore dismiss his claim due to lack of jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Finally, Petitioner argues that if he were entitled to file simultaneous INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(c) and 240A petitions, an INA \u00a7 212(c) waiver for his 1995 conviction would make him eligible for first offender treatment for his 1996 conviction. Because Petitioner may not simultaneously file for relief under INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(c) and 240A, this argument is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The petition is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
