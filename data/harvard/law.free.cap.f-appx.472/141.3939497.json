For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">We write principally for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">In 2003, Wolfe was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for knowingly transporting an individual in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421. Wolfe pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. In August of 2009, Wolfe was released from prison and returned to his mother\u2019s home in Philadelphia to begin his term of supervised release. Because his 2003 conviction involved the solicitation of a minor to practice prostitution, Wolfe was required to register as a sex offender in his state of residence pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 (\u201cSORNA\u201d). Wolfe registered his status and local address (his mother\u2019s residence) with the Pennsylvania State Police. He was informed that he was required to notify the Pennsylvania State Police within 48 hours of any change in residence, and that he was required to register in any new state of residence within 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">After Wolfe missed two appointments for drug testing with the Probation Office, his probation officer visited his mother\u2019s Philadelphia residence and discovered that he had left one week prior. On January 13, 2009, Wolfe\u2019s probation officer filed a petition to revoke Wolfe\u2019s supervised release for failing to comply with random drug testing and failing to notify the Probation Office of his change in residence. A warrant was issued for his arrest. Wolfe was arrested two months later in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, for operating an unregistered vehicle. At that time, he was residing in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">On June 10, 2010, a grand jury returned an indictment against Wolfe charging him with one count of failing to register as a sex offender, as required by SORNA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250. The then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>pending revocation of Wolfe\u2019s supervised release was transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On November 18, 2010, Wolfe entered a plea of guilty for violating SORNA, pursuant to a plea agreement. Under the agreement, Wolfe waived his right \u201cto appeal or collaterally attack [his] conviction, sentence or any other matter relating to [the] prosecution,\u201d subject to four limited exceptions. The plea agreement provided that the government could \u201c[m]ake whatever sentencing recommendation as to imprisonment [for the SORNA violation] ... which [it] deem[ed] appropriate.\u201d The agreement further authorized the government to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALh\">\u201cComment on the evidence and circumstances of the case; bring to the Court\u2019s attention all facts relevant to sentencing including evidence relating to dismissed counts, if any, and to the character and any criminal conduct of the defendant; address the Court regarding the nature and seriousness of the offense; respond factually to questions raised by the Court; correct factual inaccuracies in the presentence report or sentencing record; and rebut any statement of facts made by or on behalf of the defendant at sentencing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">However, the government also committed to \u201cagree that whatever sentence [was] imposed [for Wolfe\u2019s SORNA violation] is to run concurrent to any sentence that may be imposed ... for a pending violation of [Wolfe\u2019s] federal supervised release.\u201d During the plea colloquy, the District Court reviewed these provisions with Wolfe, who indicated that he understood them. The District Court made clear that the plea agreement was only binding as between the parties, and therefore did not bind the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court first addressed Wolfe\u2019s SORNA violation. The Court heard extended argument from both the government and Wolfe regarding the appropriate length of the sentence. The government strenuously advocated for a 37-month sentence, at the top of the Guidelines range. In its presentation, the government emphasized Wolfe\u2019s numerous prior offenses, which included three sex offenses, the severity of his prior offenses, the fact that he had knowingly violated SORNA while on supervised release, and the certainty that he would reoffend. The government did not otherwise mention the supervised release violation. After hearing Wolfe\u2019s argument and testimony, the District Court imposed a 36-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The District Court then turned to the sanction for Wolfe\u2019s violation of supervised release, and inquired whether that sentence should be imposed consecutively or concurrently to Wolfe\u2019s SORNA sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akp\">THE COURT: So what\u2019s the Government\u2019s view about the consecutive/concurrent issue? Because I think there is an agreement on this, isn\u2019t there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">THE GOVERNMENT: There is, sir, and I\u2019m at a loss to be able to \u2014 I\u2019m at a loss to be able to explain that. I was not the prosecutor initially on the case. I was asked to come in for sentencing purposes, so I did not negotiate that particular part of the plea agreement. I am told that it was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">THE COURT: Well, it was negotiated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Q\">THE GOVERNMENT: It was something that was negotiated in order to get the agreement in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">THE COURT: Okay, but in terms of the authority of the Court, you would agree with me that that\u2019s a different issue from the issues that we just spent an hour and a half plus\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">THE GOVERNMENT: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A52\">THE COURT: \u2014 worrying about? Wouldn\u2019t you agree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>THE GOVERNMENT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">THE COURT: Okay. But, obviously, you\u2019re bound by your agreement and I\u2019m not going to ask you to retreat from that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">After further discussion with Wolfe\u2019s counsel, the Court revoked Wolfe\u2019s supervised release and imposed a 12-month sentence to be served consecutively to Wolfe\u2019s sentence for the SORNA- violation. Wolfe filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Wolfe appeals the District Court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences on the grounds that the government\u2019s conduct at sentencing violated his plea agreement, and that, consequently, he must be resentenced. In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, we review the government\u2019s adherence to its obligations under a plea agreement for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Under plain error review, Wolfe must show that (1) there was an error which was (2) \u201cclear or obvious,\u201d (3) \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings,\u201d and (4) \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). We review the validity of an appellate waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 560 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">We would normally decline to exercise jurisdiction over Wolfe\u2019s appeal because it is not permitted under his appellate waiver. <em>See United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 203 (3d Cir.2007). The record reveals that Wolfe\u2019s plea is valid: it was entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and the sentencing judge fully complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 563. Moreover, none of the four exceptions to Wolfe\u2019s appellate waiver are implicated here,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Wolfe does not argue that the result \u201cwould work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d at 203. Thus, the parties do not dispute that, if enforced, the waiver would not permit an appeal of this within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Nevertheless, it is well-established that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s appellate waiver is not enforceable if the government breaches its own obligations under a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>511 F.3d 403, 405 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Accordingly, Wolfe offers two arguments that the government breached its promise to \u201cagree that whatever sentence is imposed [for Wolfe\u2019s SORNA violation] is to run concurrent to any sentence that may be imposed for a violation of [Wolfe\u2019s] federal supervised release.\u201d First, he contends that the prosecutor used her sentencing argument for Wolfe\u2019s SORNA violation to advocate in favor of consecutive sentences. Second, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s response to the District Court concerning the recommendation for concurrent sentences effectively undermined the govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>merit's commitment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wolfe\u2019s challenges fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Our task is to \u201cevaluate the [challenged] conduct and determine whether it violates the government\u2019s obligations under the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Larkin, </em>629 F.3d 177, 186 (3d Cir.2010). We interpret the plea agreement according to \u201cgeneral principles of contract law,\u201d <em>McKeever v. Warden SCI-Graterford, </em>486 F.3d 81, 95-96 (3d Cir.2007) (citation omitted), and, mindful of the government\u2019s \u201ctremendous bargaining power,\u201d we \u201cstrictly construe the text against [the government].\u201d <em>United States v. Baird, </em>218 F.3d 221, 229 (3d Cir.2000). We do not review the allegedly violated provision in isolation, but rather with an eye towards the agreement as a whole. <em>See Larkin, </em>629 F.3d at 189-91; <em>Schwartz, </em>511 F.3d at 405-06. The ultimate decision of the District Court to disregard the agreement is, of course, irrelevant to our inquiry, because a plea agreement binds only the parties. <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">First, we reject Wolfe\u2019s contention that the government used its sentencing arguments in the SORNA portion of the hearing to persuade the District Court to impose consecutive sentences. The entire premise of this argument rings hollow, because the District Court treated the sentencing for the SORNA and supervised release violations as distinct issues. The District Court and the government agreed that the decision to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences was \u201ca different issue from the issues that [the parties] had just spend an hour and a half plus ... worrying about.\u201d Moreover, the arguments offered by the government were expressly permitted by the plea provisions allowing the government to comment on \u201call facts relevant to sentencing,\u201d and therefore fell \u201cwithin the range of expectations reasonably understood by [Wolfe] when .[he] entered [his] plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Larkin, </em>629 F.3d at 186; <em>see id. </em>at 189-91 (finding government\u2019s briefing on sentencing enhancement permissibly \u201cprovided an assessment of the law and relevant facts that would support application of the enhancement\u201d pursuant to plea provisions allowing response to court\u2019s request for briefing, despite stipulation that enhancement was inapplicable). Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the initial SORNA sentencing discussion \u2014 which was entirely proper \u2014 can be understood as violating the government\u2019s obligations to agree to a concurrent sentence for Wolfe\u2019s violation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Second, the prosecutor\u2019s response to the District Court\u2019s inquiry regarding the concurrent sentence recommendation was not inconsistent with her promise to \u201cagree\u201d to a concurrent sentence. Wolfe is correct that the government may breach a plea agreement with statements that either contradict or implicitly undermine its obligations. <em>See United States v. Hodge, </em>412 F.3d 479, 486-87 (3d Cir.2005) (finding prosecutor\u2019s repeated statements that defendant should not be released into community plainly amounted to recommendation for a life sentence and contradicted obligations under plea agreement to request sentence within Guidelines range). And viewed alone, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that she was \u201cat a loss to be able to explain\u201d the basis for the agreement is admittedly ambiguous. However, we must construe the challenged statements in context and \u201cagainst the entire backdrop of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Larkin, </em>629 F.3d at 191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and fairly construed, the prosecutor was simply attempting to explain that she was unfamiliar with that provision of the plea agreement. The response of the District Court \u2014 which cut off the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s agreement \u2014 is informative in this regard. <em>See United States v. Ahn, </em>231 F.3d 26, 38 (D.C.Cir.2000) (explaining that a district court is in the best position to understand the meaning of a party\u2019s conduct and statements responding to the court\u2019s requests). Here, the District Court responded by expressly recognizing the prosecutor\u2019s commitment to agree to a concurrent sentence and stated that it would not ask the prosecutor to retreat from that commitment. This strongly suggests that the prosecutor\u2019s comment should not be interpreted as a retreat from the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Thus, viewed in context, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s truncated remarks were a \u201cthinly veiled attempt to ... influence the District Court.\u201d <em>Larkin, </em>629 F.3d at 191. Nor did this brief utterance implicitly undermine the very position the government had committed to adopt, as the repeated statements did in <em>Hodge. See </em>412 F.3d at 486-87. The prosecutor may not have spiritedly advocated for a concurrent sentence, but the plea provisions did not require her to do so. She was obligated to agree, and we do not understand her conduct to be inconsistent with that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Moreover, Wolfe\u2019s argument attacks the prosecutor\u2019s honest response to the District Court\u2019s questioning, which a prosecutor\u2019s ethical obligations require of her. <em>See United States v. Allen, 434 </em>F.3d 1166, 1175 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] plea agreement does not bar the government from honestly answering the district court\u2019s questions. To the contrary, honest response of the government to direct judicial inquiry is a prosecutor\u2019s professional obligation that cannot be barred, eroded or impaired by a plea agreement.\u201d (marks and citation omitted)). We will not penalize the government for adhering to such obligations. In sum, the prosecutor\u2019s truncated remarks\u2014 though perhaps not as effective as Wolfe might desire \u2014 do not amount to a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">. The exceptions to Wolfe\u2019s appellate waiver are: (1) Wolfe may filed a direct appeal from his sentence if the government appealed from the sentence; (2) Wolfe may assert a claim that the \"sentence on any count of conviction exceeds the statutory maximum for that count\u201d; (3) may could assert a claim that \"the sentencing judge erroneously departed upwards under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\u201d; or (4) Wolfe may assert a claim that the sentencing judge \"imposed an unreasonable sentence above the final Sentencing Guidelines range\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Wolfe also asserts that he may appeal the sentence because there is no plea agreement governing the revocation of his supervised release. However, he offers no argument to revisit the sentence that is independent of the alleged breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
