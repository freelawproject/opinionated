We did so based on then-valid circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Breland, </em>647 F.3d 284 (5th Cir.2011), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1096, 181 L.Ed.2d 973 (2012). Consistent with its decision to vacate in <em>Breland, </em>the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the judgment in the present case, instructing that we reconsider in light of the Government\u2019s change in position as described in its brief to the Supreme Court. <em>Garcia v.
