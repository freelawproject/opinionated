Williams asserts that this court should vacate her conviction and order a new trial because her custodial statements were admitted at trial in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">The California Court of Appeal did not unreasonably apply federal law in determining that any potential violation of Williams\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights was excused under California\u2019s rescue doctrine. While the questioning of Williams may have been investigatory in nature as to not fall within the \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception set out in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), \u201cfair-minded jurists could disagree.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). The state court\u2019s finding that the officers were prompted by a concern for rescue does not violate \u201cclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b881-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>MURGUTA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A84\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">I write separately because, unlike the majority, I cannot say that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that Williams\u2019s confession was admissible under the California \u201crescue doctrine\u201d was a reasonable application of <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984). Instead, although a close question, I would affirm because the California trial court was not objectively unreasonable in holding that Williams\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent was equivocal. See <em>Anderson v. Terhune, </em>516 F.3d 781 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>fundamental tenet \u2014 that police must \u2018scrupulously honor[ ]\u2019 a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent by immediately ceasing questioning when the suspect invokes this right \u2014 has never wavered.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>516 F.3d at 788 (quoting <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)) (internal citation omitted) (alteration in original). In <em>Quarles, </em>the Supreme Court created a \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception to <em>Miranda, </em>allowing officers to question a suspect before giving a <em>Miranda </em>warning as long as their questions are \u201crelated[d] to an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger associated with [a] weapon.\u201d 467 U.S. at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626. In outlining the bounds of the <em>Quarles </em>exception, the Supreme Court stressed that it does not apply to \u201cquestions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Nor does it apply where circumstances require no \u201cimmediate action by the officers beyond the normal need expeditiously to solve a serious crime.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626 (distinguishing <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969)). Due to the specific nature of this \u201cnarrow exception,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626, only a limited range of applications of <em>Quarles </em>maybe deemed reasonable. <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (\u201cThe more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The record in this case unambiguously shows that the officers\u2019 questions had nothing to do with an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger. The officers questioned Williams for hours, while she was uncontestedly in custody, asking general questions designed to investigate a crime and elicit incriminating statements. The investigatory nature of Williams\u2019s interrogation bears a stark resemblance to the questioning in <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 325, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969), that the <em>Quarles </em>Court specifically denounced. 467 U.S. at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Admittedly, this Circuit has applied <em>Quarles </em>to a broader range of cases than other circuits. <em>Compare United States v. Brady, 819 F.2d 884 </em>(9th Cir.1987), <em>with United States v. Williams, </em>483 F.3d 425 (6th Cir.2007), <em>and United States v. De-Jear, </em>552 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir.2009). In justifying the admission of statements under the <em>Quarles </em>exception even where officers lacked actual knowledge of a weapon, <em>Brady, </em>819 F.2d at 888, and where there was no \u201cpressing need for haste,\u201d <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir.1994), we have stressed the non-investigatory nature of the questioning. <em>Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1049-50 (labeling as non-investigatory a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d question about a weapon that called for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer that was not followed by further questioning); <em>Brady, </em>819 F.2d at 888. By holding that fair-minded jurists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>could disagree about the application of <em>Quarles </em>to the lengthy and meticulous testimonial interrogation that Williams was subjected to, the majority undermines the bounds of an exception \u201ccircumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Accordingly, I concur only in the majority\u2019s judgment and not its reasoning.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
