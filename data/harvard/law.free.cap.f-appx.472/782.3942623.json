We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Summers v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>508 F.3d 923, 926 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">The district court properly entered judgment as a matter of law on Harper\u2019s claim that his confinement in administrative segregation on false charges violated his due process rights. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (\u201cdiscipline in segregated confinement did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation\u201d required to create a liberty interest); <em>see also Serrano v. Francis, </em>345 F.3d 1071, 1078 (9th Cir.2003) (procedural protections apply to disciplinary proceedings \u201conly when the disciplinary action implicates a protected liberty interest\u201d). Even assuming that there was a liberty interest at stake, the evidence showed that prison officials afforded Harper with all the process that he was due. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (setting forth due process requirements in prison disciplinary proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to grant a continuance sua sponte when one of Harper\u2019s witnesses was medically unavailable at trial, particularly where Harper did not show that he suffered prejudice. <em>See United States v. Orlando, </em>553 F.3d 1235, 1237 (9th Cir.2009) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the decision to grant or deny a continuance, \u201ceven where, as here, no motion for continuance was made\u201d); <em>United States v. Flynt, </em>756 F.2d 1352, 1359 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.1985) (setting forth factors to consider in reviewing denials of requests for continuances).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b813-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
