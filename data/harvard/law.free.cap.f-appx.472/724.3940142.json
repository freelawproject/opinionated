We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Xu\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed a year and a half after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Xu failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in China to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 988-89 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Toufighi, </em>538 F.3d at 996-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">We reject Xu\u2019s contention that the BIA did not adequately address his evidence. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006) (finding petitioner had not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record); <em>see also Najmabadi, </em>597 F.3d at 990-91 (BIA must consider issues raised and announce its decision in a manner sufficient for reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b755-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
