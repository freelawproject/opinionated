While this action was pending, Webb filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but failed to disclose this pending lawsuit. When the defendants discovered Webb did not list this case in his bankruptcy petition, they filed a motion for summary judgment based upon the doctrine of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">The district court denied the motion for summary judgment, but dismissed Webb\u2019s civil action on the ground that only the Trustee in Webb\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding had standing to pursue the action. The dismissal was without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">On appeal, Webb agrees that he does not have standing to prosecute this case. His brief states, \u201cSince Appellee filed a Chapter 7 petition, the Trustee became the real party in interest of Appellee\u2019s claims at the time of his filing.... Therefore, Appellee lost his right to litigate the claim immediately at the time of filing.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">Webb\u2019s position is in accord with our precedent. In <em>Parker v. Wendy\u2019s Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268 (11th Cir.2004), we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-22\">a pre-petition cause of action is the property of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate, and only the trustee in bankruptcy has standing to pursue it.... Thus, a trustee, as the representative of the bankruptcy estate, is the proper party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-23\"><em>Id. </em>at 1272 (citations omitted). Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing the case on this basis. We affirm the judgment dismissing the action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-24\">Because Webb did not have standing to prosecute the case, the district court should have refrained from ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying the motion. Should the bankruptcy Trustee abandon this claim back to Webb, and Webb refiles this case, then the question of judicial estoppel, if raised, would properly be before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
