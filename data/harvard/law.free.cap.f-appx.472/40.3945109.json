First, he alleged that the defendants violated Connecticut law as established by the Connecticut Supreme Court in <em>Obeda v. Board of Selectmen, </em>180 Conn. 521, 429 A.2d 956 (1980), by failing to provide sufficient cause for his removal. Second, he alleged that his dismissal was an unconstitutional act of retaliation in violation of his right to free speech under both the federal and Connecticut constitutions. Finally, Fromer alleged that his removal violated due process under both the federal and Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Fromer initially filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a writ of mandamus. At oral argument before the District Court, however, the parties agreed that there were no issues of material fact in dispute, and therefore Fromer made an oral motion for summary judgment. The District Court denied both Fromer\u2019s motions for a preliminary injunction and for a writ of mandamus as well as his motion for summary judgment. In light of its ruling on Fromer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the parties\u2019 mutual concession that no facts were in dispute, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the remaining facts and procedural issues of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">We review orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are \u201c \u2018required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., </em>131 F.3d 305, 312 (2d Cir.1997)). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Following a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the District Court in its Ruling of April 15, 2011. <em>See Fromer v. Town of Windsor, </em>No. 10-cv-1780-JCH (D.Conn. Apr. 15, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We have considered all of Fromer\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">. Fromer also appears to advance a claim that the Town Council's decision to dismiss him violated his \"absolute immunity from removal.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 52. Without deciding whether Fromer, as a volunteer commissioner on a town wetlands commission is entitled to any sort of \"immunity,\u201d we simply note that immunity is a protection from having to defend a <em>lawsuit, </em>not from being disciplined or otherwise subject to unfavorable actions. Fromer, or course, is the plaintiff in this lawsuit; he has not been sued and thus has no basis for asserting immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
