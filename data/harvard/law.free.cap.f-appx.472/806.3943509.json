We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The BIA reasonably concluded Tian\u2019s testimony was non-responsive to several questions, appeared to be memorized, and lacked detail regarding his religious practice in the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under totality of circumstances). Therefore, the record does not compel the conclusion Tian was credible. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 745 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Tian\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT protection because Tian\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same statements the agency found not credible, and there is no other evidence in the record that would compel a finding it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to China. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57. Accordingly, Tian\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b836-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
