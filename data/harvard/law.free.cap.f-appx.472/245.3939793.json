The district court sentenced Howell to a total of 250 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sole issue on appeal is whether the Government elicited expert testimony from Shari Gantt, a nurse, concerning the victim\u2019s injuries without disclosing or qualifying Gantt as an expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">We \u201creview[ ] a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>617 F.3d 286, 292 (4th Cir.2010). A court abuses its discretion if its decision is based on an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cEvidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review,\u201d and we will find an error harmless if we can \u201csay with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">We have observed that \u201cthe line between lay opinion testimony under Rule 701 [of the Federal Rules of Evidence] and expert testimony under Rule 702 is a fine one\u201d and \u201cnot easy to draw.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>470 F.3d 150, 155 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, a lay opinion <em>\u201cmust </em>be based on personal knowledge\u201d whereas expert opinion may be based on personal knowledge but must involve \u201csome specialized knowledge or skill or education that is not in possession of the jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155-56. \u201cRule 701' forbids the admission of expert testimony dressed in lay witness clothing, but it does not interdict all inference drawing by lay witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156. The Advisory Committee\u2019s notes explain \u201cthat lay testimony results from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life, while expert testimony results from a process of reasoning which can be mastered only by specialists in the field.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701 advisory committee notes. Accordingly, \u201ca lay witness with experience could testify that a substance appeared to be blood, but ... a witness would have to qualify as an expert before [s]he could testify that bruising around the eyes is indicative of skull trauma.\u201d <em>Id.; see Perkins, </em>470 F.3d at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the Government elicited expert testimony from Gantt because portions of her testimony required specialized knowledge not in possession of the jurors and that the court\u2019s admission of that testimony was error. However, we are convinced that the error was harmless. Relative to the charged offenses, Gantt\u2019s testimony supported the inference that Howell had severely beaten his vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tim. This fact was well-established by-other physical evidence and testimony, including Howell\u2019s own admissions to police. Accordingly, we can say \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>617 F.3d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
