On appeal, Nunnally argues that the district court erred by failing to grant him relief under Amendments 518 and 667, and by construing his motion as one seeking relief under Amendment 750.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-22\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-23\">Section 3582 provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was <em>subsequently </em>lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-24\">Here, the district court properly denied Nunnally\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence under Amendments 518 and 667. Nunnally was sentenced in 2006, but Amendment 518 became effective in 1995, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 518, while Amendment 667 became effective in 2004, <em>see id., </em>Amend. 667. Because these Amendments became effective before Nunnally\u2019s sentencing date, they cannot serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>as the basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which is available only where the sentencing guidelines were amended subsequent to sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Nunnally contends that the district court erred by construing his motion as additionally seeking relief under Amendment 750. However, the district court merely concluded that this issue was not yet ripe and dismissed it without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Nunnally suffered no harm from this decision, we need not address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-19\">. In his initial brief, Nunnally does not mention Amendment 516, and thus he has waived any argument that his sentence should be reduced on this basis. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 713 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-16\">. We note that during the pendency of this appeal, Amendment 750\u2019s retroactivity was incorporated into the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. If he complies with the district court's orders, <em>see </em>dkt. 273 at 2-3, dkt. 392 at 1, Nunnally is free to file a new motion for relief that specifically addresses his arguments, if any, under these Amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-24\">. Nunnally's request for oral argument is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
