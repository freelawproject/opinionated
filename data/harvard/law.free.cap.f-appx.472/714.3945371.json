Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chairez\u2019s motion to reopen because the BIA considered the evidence submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining Chairez did not show prima facie eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought); <em>see also Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Chairez\u2019s motion to reopen based on further evidence of hardship to Chairez\u2019s son. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 599-603 (9th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae bars jurisdiction when question presented in motion to reopen is essentially the same hardship ground originally decided). We also lack jurisdiction to review Chairez\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s initial denial of cancellation of removal, because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Finally, because the agency did not err, Chairez\u2019s due process contentions fail. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring agency error for a petitioner to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Acd\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
