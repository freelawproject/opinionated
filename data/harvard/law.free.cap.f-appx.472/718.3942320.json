We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and of a motion to reconsider. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo due process claims. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny both petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Abrahamyan\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed over five years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), Abrahamyan failed to present sufficient evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel to warrant equitable tolling of the deadline, <em>see Hamoui v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 821, 826 (9th Cir.2004) (ineffective assistance of counsel may toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen if it amounts to a due process violation), and he also failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in Armenia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">In addition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Abrahamyan\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). In construing Abrahamyan\u2019s motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely and number barred, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), or in denying the motion because Abrahamyan failed to show that he was prejudiced by his former counsel\u2019s suspension from legal practice, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 901 (9th Cir.2003) (petitioner must show prejudice from the allegedly deficient representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">Finally, we reject Abrahamyan\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider evidence because he has not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">No. 08-74648: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">No. 09-71541: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
