We conclude that BMIC had a duty to defend Jessco, but we also conclude that the policy did not provide coverage for the $10,000 re-grading allowance paid by Jessco to the homeowners in the underlying construction-defect action. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-24\">Glenn and Tracie Mazyck hired Jessco to build a house for them in North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Charleston\u2019s Coosaw Creek subdivision. Shortly after moving into the house in September 2004, the Mazycks provided Jesseo with a punch list of mostly minor items to be completed or repaired. The punch list matters were not resolved to the Mazycks\u2019 satisfaction, and in February 2005, they filed suit against Jesseo in state court. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the lot flooded because it was not graded properly to direct surface water into the wetlands area adjacent to the lot. In May 2006, the state-court action was stayed so the claims could be pursued through arbitration, as required by the contract. In the fall of 2007, experts hired by the Mazycks identified substantial water damage to the house caused by the flooding of the property. The experts believed the problems were so severe that the best solution was to demolish the house and re-build on a re-graded lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In October 2007, after the escalation in the Mazycks\u2019 demands, Jesseo finally notified BMIC of the underlying claims. BMIC concluded that the Mazycks\u2019 claims were not covered by the Policy and that Jesseo failed to promptly notify BMIC of the lawsuit, and BMIC therefore refused to defend Jesseo against the Mazycks\u2019 claims or to indemnify Jesseo for any damages paid to the Mazycks. Jesseo thereafter filed a declaratory judgment action in state court seeking a declaration that the claims in the underlying action were covered by the Policy. BMIC removed the action to federal court and counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that it was not obligated under the Policy to defend or indemnify Jesseo.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The arbitration hearing on the Mazycks\u2019 claims was conducted over several days in October and December 2008. The arbitrator issued his award in April 2009, ordering Jesseo to pay almost $55,000 in damages for various items that were in need of repair or completion. As to the flooding issue, the arbitrator relied on the testimony of the Mazycks\u2019 experts to conclude that the flooding was proximately caused by \u201cthe overcapacitation of the wetlands, caused by the overall design and development of the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d J.A. 265. Although the arbitrator specifically found that Jessco\u2019s work was \u201cnot the legal proximate cause of the flooding of [the Mazycks\u2019] property,\u201d J.A. 265, the award included a $10,000 allowance for regrading of the lot, which the arbitrator indicated would provide better surface-water management. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">After the arbitrator issued his award, BMIC moved for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action. The district court concluded that while most of the Mazycks\u2019 claims did not fall within the scope of the Policy, the flooding-related claims were covered by the Policy. The court rejected BMIC\u2019s assertion that Jessco\u2019s untimely notice barred recovery under the Policy, and the court therefore concluded that BMIC breached its duty to defend Jesseo against the claims. The district court ordered BMIC to pay more than $68,000 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Jesseo in defending against the Mazycks\u2019 claims and to reimburse Jesseo for the $10,000 regrading allowance ordered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) insurance policies like the one at issue in this case generally contain two significant coverage provisions: \u201cone, providing for the payment by the insurer of sums the insured shall become obligated to pay, the other providing, in substance, for the defense of any suit alleging bodily injury or property damage and seeking damages payable under the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Sloan Constr. Co. v. Central Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>of Omaha, </em>269 S.C. 183, 236 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1977).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough these duties are related in the sense that the duty to defend depends on an initial or apparent potential liability to satisfy the judgment, the duty to defend exists regardless of the insurer\u2019s ultimate liability to the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>BMIC\u2019s challenges on appeal involve both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify Jessco.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">A. Duty to Defend</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Under South Carolina law, questions of coverage and the duty to defend under an insurance policy generally \u201care determined by the allegations of the complaint. If the underlying complaint creates a possibility of coverage under an insurance policy, the insurer is obligated to defend.\u201d <em>City of Hartsville v. South Carolina Mun. Ins. &amp; Risk Fin. Fund, </em>382 S.C. 535, 677 S.E.2d 574, 578 (2009) (citation omitted). Although the duty to defend typically is determined by the allegations of the underlying complaint, \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend is not strictly controlled by the allegations in [the c]omplaint. Instead, the duty to defend may also be determined by facts outside of the complaint that are known by the insurer.\u201d <em>USAA Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, </em>377 S.C. 643, 661 S.E.2d 791, 798 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The Policy provides coverage for sums Jessco becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d to which the insurance applies. J.A. 75. The Policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201c[pjhysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property,\u201d and as \u201c[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d J.A. 87. \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d J.A. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">BMIC does not dispute on appeal that the allegations of the Mazyeks\u2019 complaint raised the possibility of \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the Policy. <em>See Horry Cnty. v. Insurance Reserve Fund, </em>344 S.C. 493, 544 S.E.2d 637, 641 (S.C.Ct.App.2001) (concluding that flooding of land was \u201cwithin the ordinary meaning of physical injury to property\u201d and that damages caused by flooding were thus \u201cclearly within the definition of property damage\u201d); <em>Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Newman, </em>385 S.C. 187, 684 S.E.2d 541, 544-45 (2009) (concluding that \u201ccontinuous moisture intrusion\u201d causing damage to property other than the insured\u2019s work constitutes an occurrence). Instead, BMIC contends that it had no duty to defend because coverage for the Mazyeks\u2019 claims was excluded by the Policy\u2019s \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion. <em>See Clegg, </em>661 S.E.2d at 797 (\u201c[A]n insurer has no duty to defend an insured where the damage was caused for a reason unambiguously excluded under the policy.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The exclusion upon which BMIC relies is a standard exclusion in CGL policies that excludes from coverage any claims for \u201c \u2018[pjroperty damage\u2019 to \u2018your work\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it.\u201d J.A. 78. The Policy defines \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201c[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf,\u201d J.A. 88, a definition broad enough to encompass and thus preclude coverage for work done by the insured\u2019s subcontractors. <em>See French v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>448 F.3d 693, 700-01 (4th Cir.2006). Many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>CGL policies have an exception to the your-work exclusion that restores coverage for damage to work performed by a subcontractor. <em>See id. </em>at 701; <em>see also Newman, </em>684 S.E.2d at 546 (\u201c[T]he subcontractor exception preserves coverage for property damage that would otherwise be excluded as \u2018your work\u2019 .... \u201d). In this case, however, the Policy contains an endorsement that removes the subcontractor exception. According to BMIC, that endorsement \u201ccompletely eliminated all liability insurance coverage to Jessco for any work done by or on its behalf by one or more of Jessco\u2019s subcontractors.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 14. BMIC contends that all of the work on the property was done by subcontractors on Jessco\u2019s behalf and that the your-work exclusion therefore bars coverage for all of the claims asserted by the Mazycks. We disagree, albeit for reasons other than those set out by the district court. <em>See McMahan v. Iron Workers Union Local 601, </em>964 F.2d 1462, 1467 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201cWe of course have the power to affirm a judgment for any reason appearing on the record, notwithstanding that the reason was not addressed below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201cThe primary purpose of [the your-work] exclusion is to prevent liability policies from insuring against an insured\u2019s own faulty workmanship, which is a normal risk associated with operating a business.\u201d Lee R. Russ <em>&amp; </em>Thomas F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 129:17 (3d ed.). Contrary to BMIC\u2019s argument, however, the exclusion does not withdraw coverage for any and all work done <em>by </em>the insured or its subcontractors; it withdraws coverage in cases where the insured causes property damage <em>to </em>work done by the insured or its subcontractors: \u201cBy its plain language, the \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion- only excludes coverage for damage to an insured\u2019s work that arises out of the insured\u2019s faulty workmanship. It does not exclude coverage for damage to a third party\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Limbach Co. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., </em>396 F.3d 358, 365 (4th Cir. 2005) (per curiam); <em>see also Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 129:17 (\u201c[W]here all of the damage that is being claimed is damage to the work of the insured which is caused by the work of the insured, the \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion will apply to preclude coverage.\u201d). Accordingly, the Policy\u2019s elimination of the subcontractor\u2019s exception means that Jessco\u2019s subcontractors will not be viewed as third-parties for purposes of determining whose \u201cwork\u201d was damaged, but the elimination of the exception does not, as BMIC contends, preclude coverage if Jessco\u2019s work in fact damages the work of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The question, then, is whether the Mazycks\u2019 claims against Jessco created a possibility that a third-party\u2019s work or property was damaged by the faulty workmanship of Jessco or its subcontractors. We believe that question must be answered in the affirmative. The contract between Jessco and the Mazycks specifically contemplated that Glenn Mazyck would perform some of the work, and Mazyck himself installed (or hired a subcontractor to install) the flooring and landscaping. The lot-flooding claim first asserted by the Mazycks thus created a possibility of damage to the landscaping, which was Glenn Mazyck\u2019s work, not Jessco\u2019s. <em>See Limbach, </em>396 F.3d at 365 (\u201cSince the landscaping and concrete work were performed by third parties, the \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion does not preclude coverage for the costs of repairing and replacing the landscaping and concrete.\u201d). And when the Mazycks\u2019 claims expanded to include water damage to the house itself, those claims likewise raised the possibility of damage to Glenn Mazyck\u2019s work. Accordingly, we reject BMIC\u2019s claim that the your-work exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sion barred coverage for the claims asserted by the Mazycks.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Policy requires Jessco to notify BMIC of claims or lawsuits brought against it \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d J.A. 88. BMIC contends that even if the Policy otherwise provided coverage, Jessco lost its right to coverage by waiting more than two years to give notice of the Mazycks\u2019 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Although Jessco contends that it notified BMIC as soon as it became apparent that the Mazycks\u2019 claims might be covered, we will assume for purposes of this opinion that the notice was untimely. Under South Carolina law, however, recovery under the Policy is barred only if BMIC proves that it was substantially prejudiced by the late notice. <em>See Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Singleton, </em>316 S.C. 5, 446 S.E.2d 417, 421 (1994) (\u201cWhere the rights of innocent parties are jeopardized by a failure of the insured to comply with the notice requirements of an insurance policy, the insurer must show substantial prejudice to the insurer\u2019s rights.\u201d); <em>Squires v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>247 S.C. 58, 145 S.E.2d 673, 677 (1965) (\u201cThe burden of proof is upon the insurer to show not only that the insured has failed to perform the terms and conditions invoked upon him by the policy contract but in addition that it was substantially prejudiced thereby.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On appeal, BMIC asserts that the delay in notification \u201csubstantially prejudiced [its] ability to investigate, manage, handle, and/or settle the Mazycks\u2019 claims.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 27. BMIC, however, presented no evidence of prejudice to the district court, and it makes no effort to even explain to this court how it was prejudiced by the delay even though it had notice of the claims more than a year before the arbitration hearing took place. Because prejudice to the insurer may not be presumed, <em>see Vermont Mut., </em>446 S.E.2d at 422, BMIC\u2019s unsupported assertion of prejudice is insufficient to establish that it was substantially prejudiced by Jessco\u2019s delay in notification. The district court therefore properly rejected BMIC\u2019s assertion that Jessco\u2019s delay in notification precluded recovery under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">We turn briefly to the question of damages for BMIC\u2019s breach of its duty to defend. The district court ordered BMIC to pay more than $68,000 in legal fees incurred by Jessco in defending itself against the Mazycks\u2019 claims and in prosecuting the declaratory judgment action. <em>See Unisun Ins. Co. v. Hertz Rental Corp., </em>312 S.C. 549, 436 S.E.2d 182, 186 (S.C.Ct. App.1993) (\u201cAn insurer that breaches its duty to defend and indemnify the insured may be held liable for the expenses the insured incurs in providing for his own defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">In the statement of the issues on appeal included in its brief, BMIC lists ten issues, including two challenges to the attorney\u2019s fee award. In the body of its brief, however, BMIC substantively addresses only three issues, none of which include a challenge to the fee award independent from the merits of the underlying duty-to-defend issue. That is, while BMIC argues that the entire damage award must be set aside because the your-work exclusion precluded coverage for all claims, BMIC does not alternatively argue that, even if it had a duty to defend, the award of fees as damages, or the amount of fees awarded, was improper. Under these circumstances, BMIC has abandoned any challenge to the attorney\u2019s fee award by failing to substantively address it in brief. <em>See, e.g., Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>562 F.3d 599, 607 (4th Cir.2009) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>(\u201cFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A) requires that the argument section of an appellant\u2019s opening brief must contain the \u2018appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u2019 Because Wahi has failed to comply with the specific dictates of Rule 28(a)(9)(A), we conclude that he has waived his claims.... \u201d); <em>Williams v. Giant Food Inc., </em>370 F.3d 423, 430 n. 4 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cWilliams makes no argument in her brief to support this assertion, and we deem it abandoned on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">B. Duty to Indemnify</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">While the duty to defend exists where there is a possibility of a covered claim, an insurer is obligated to indemnify the insured only for claims that in fact fall within the scope of the coverage provided by the policy. On appeal, BMIC contends that the $10,000 re-grading allowance was not compensation for loss caused by a covered risk and that the district court therefore erred by requiring it to indemnify Jessco for the re-grading allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Resolution of this issue requires us to determine the legal basis for the re-grading allowance ordered by the arbitrator. In their state-court action, the Mazycks asserted contract- and negligence-based claims against Jessco. If the re-grading allowance was awarded by the arbitrator as compensation for negligence by Jessco in grading the property, Jessco\u2019s negligence would constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d and the Policy would provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Although the arbitrator stated that Jessco and the Mazycks both \u201cb[ore] some responsibility for the flooding,\u201d J.A. 262, the arbitrator ultimately determined that the flooding was caused by \u201cthe overcapacitation of the wetlands, caused by the overall design and development of the surrounding neighborhood,\u201d J.A. 265. The arbitrator concluded that the development and overeapacitation was \u201can unforeseen intervening cause,\u201d and Jessco\u2019s work was \u201cnot the legal proximate cause of the flooding of [the] property.\u201d J.A. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The arbitrator\u2019s determination that Jessco\u2019s work was not the proximate cause of the flooding necessarily amounted to a rejection of any negligence-based claim asserted against Jessco. <em>See, e.g., Hurd v. Williamsburg Cnty., </em>353 S.C. 596, 579 S.E.2d 136, 144 (S.C.Ct.App.2003) (\u201cIt is apodictic that a plaintiff may only recover for injuries proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d). While there may have been some negligent conduct by Jessco, the proximate-cause determination means that Jessco could not have been held accountable to a third-party for that negligence. <em>See, e.g., Howard v. Riddle, </em>266 S.C. 149, 221 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1976) (\u201cPlaintiff must show, as a matter of law, not only that defendant was negligent but also that his negligence was a contributing or proximate cause of the injury .... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Because there was no actionable negligence on the part of Jessco, the regrading allowance could only have been awarded as compensation for a breach of contract. The Policy, however, unambiguously excludes coverage for breaeh-of-eontract damages, <em>see </em>J.A. 76, and BMIC therefore had no obligation to indemnify Jessco for the re-grading allowance paid to the Mazycks.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and damages awarded with regard to the duty-to-defend issue. The district court erred, however, in concluding that BMIC was obligated to indemnify Jessco for the $10,000 regrading allowance paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Mazycks. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> A federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice-of-law rules of the forum state. <em>See Klaxon Co. </em>v. <em>Stentor Elec.
