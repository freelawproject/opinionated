We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, and we review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Tamami\u2019s experiences in Indonesia do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1059-60 (concluding petitioner experienced discriminatory mistreatment). In addition, the record does not compel that Tamami will be individually targeted for persecution, <em>see Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.2007), and he failed to establish there is a pattern or practice of persecution against moderate Muslims in Indonesia, <em>see Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Tamami failed to show it is more likely than not he will be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\"> The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
