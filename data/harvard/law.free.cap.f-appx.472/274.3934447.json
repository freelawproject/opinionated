Arizpe-Rios challenges this sentence on appeal. He argues that the district court erred by denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on his denial of previous involvement in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">A defendant may receive a two-level reduction in offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d \u00a7 3El.l(a). A reduction for acceptance of responsibility requires, inter alia, \u201ca showing of sincere contrition on the defendant\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In evaluating a defendant\u2019s sincerity, a sentencing court \u201cmay consider a defendant\u2019s refusal to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his offense to the probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the reduction is warranted. <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996). This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction ... unless it is without foundation, a standard of review more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">The district court did not err in denying credit for acceptance of responsibility because the finding that Arizpe-Rios had lied regarding his prior involvement with drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>trafficking activity was not without foundation. Arizpe-Rios admitted that his family in Mexico was the source of the approximately three kilograms of cocaine, that he was to negotiate a price for the cocaine, and that he paid $24,000 per kilogram for the cocaine. These facts are not consistent with his statement that this drug offense was his first. Given the deference owed to a district court\u2019s findings on acceptance of responsibility, Arizpe-Rios has not shown that the denial of the reduction was without foundation. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
