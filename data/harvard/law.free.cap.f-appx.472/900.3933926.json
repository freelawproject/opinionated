Freeman, counsel for the creditor, WDG Construction, Inc., (\u201cWDG\u201d) opposed the enforcement of the settlement agreement on the ground that his charging lien attached to plan payments due under the settlement agreement. The bankruptcy court, however, disagreed, and ruled that Freeman\u2019s charging lien did not attach to plan payments, and further, that Freeman was es-topped from enforcing his lien as to those payments. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and Freeman then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-19\">The issues presented on appeal are (1) whether the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly held that Freeman\u2019s charging lien applies only to the funds recovered by his client under the settlement agreement; (2) whether the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly ruled that Freeman\u2019s charging lien did not attach to the subject plan payments subsequent to their assignment under the settlement agreement; and (3) whether the bankruptcy court and district court correctly held that Freeman was estopped from asserting a charging lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-20\">In bankruptcy proceedings, we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Gen. Trading, Inc. v. Yale Materials Handling Corp., </em>119 F.3d 1485, 1494 (11th Cir.1997). We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, that were in turn reflective of conclusions of the bankruptcy court, <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs and having the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the debtors\u2019 motion to enforce settlement agreement based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order filed on August 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
