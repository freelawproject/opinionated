The removal proceedings are based on Petitioner\u2019s criminal conviction. At the time of the pertinent criminal conviction, Petitioner was a naturalized American citizen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, Petitioner\u2019s citizenship was revoked; Immigration and Customs Enforcement charged Petitioner as a removable alien and began removal proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-23\">The BIA erred in construing statutory language \u2014 \u201c[a]ny <em>alien </em>who <em>is convicted </em>of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable,\u201d 8 U.S.C. section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added) \u2014 to apply to Petitioner. This issue of pure statutory construction is for courts to decide. <em>See INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1221, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>cf. United States v. Home Concrete &amp; Supply, LLC, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1836, 1843, 182 L.Ed.2d 746 (2012) (involving re-enactment of a statute after it had been construed by Supreme Court). And given the statute\u2019s wording, the guidance of <em>Costello v. INS, </em>376 U.S. 120, 84 S.Ct. 580, 11 L.Ed.2d 559 (1964), the rule of lenity, and Congress\u2019s long acquiescence in <em>Costello\u2019s </em>construction of the words \u201c \u2018[a]ny <em>alien </em>... shall ... be deported who ... at any time after entry <em>is convicted,\u2019 \u201d id. </em>at 581 (emphasis added) (quoting the INA of 1952, ch. 5, \u00a7 241(a)(4), 66 Stat. 204 (current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae)), we grant the petition for review and vacate the removal order. The pertinent statute does not apply to a person who was a naturalized citizen when convicted. Petitioner may not be deported pursuant to section 1227(a)(2)(A)(in) for this criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-25\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-20\">. In response to Adams\u2019s petition for review, the government argues for the first time that the pertinent criminal conviction became final after Petitioner lost his citizenship. By failing to present this argument to the IJ and to the BIA, the government waived the argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
