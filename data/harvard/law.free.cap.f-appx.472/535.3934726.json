Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Osua-Madricales\u2019 counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We provided the appellant with the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief has been filed. We ordered counsel for both parties to submit supplemental letter briefs to the court addressing whether, in light of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Reina-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>655 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir. 2011), the district court properly applied a 16-level sentencing enhancement based on defendant\u2019s 2003 conviction under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 13-3407.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We decline the government\u2019s request to take judicial notice of documents that are not part of the district court record. <em>See id. </em>at 1193. We remand to the district court so that the district court can apply a modified categorical approach in determining whether Osua-Madricales was necessarily convicted of a drug trafficking offense with respect to his conviction under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 13-3407. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The motion of Alex D. Gonzalez, 2340 W. Ray Road, Suite 1, Chandler, AZ 85224, to withdraw as counsel is GRANTED. The district court is instructed to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b565-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
