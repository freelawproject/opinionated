Ermovick argues: (1) that the administrative record did not support the district court\u2019s conclusion, (2) that the district court applied a test for \u201cdisability\u201d not found in the Plan, and (3) that the district court did not accord Ermovick a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d as purportedly required by ERISA. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Ermovick filed a claim in the district court after Prudential Insurance Company of America (\u201cPrudential\u201d), which insured and administered the Plan, determined that Ermovick was not disabled under the Plan. The Plan stated that \u201c[ajfter 24 months of payments, you are disabled when Prudential determines that due to the same sickness or injury, you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201cWhere, as here, a district court has conducted a de novo review of an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s decision, we review the [district] court\u2019s factual findings only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Muniz v. Amec Constr. Mgmt., Inc., </em>623 F.3d 1290, 1294 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotations marks and citation omitted). \u201cReview under the clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential, requiring for reversal a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. The standard does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trial court simply because the reviewing court might have decided differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Asagba, </em>77 F.3d 324, 326 (9th Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Ermovick first argues that Judge Nguyen\u2019s decision was not supported by the administrative record. We disagree. Judge Nguyen\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous because the administrative record amply supports that Ermovick was not disabled under the terms of the Plan. Nor are we persuaded by Ermovick\u2019s argument that Judge Nguyen applied an incorrect definition of disability. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that Judge Nguyen applied the correct standard in the Plan for disability addressing whether, due to Ermovick\u2019s physical impairments, he was unable to perform \u201cany gainful occupation for which [he is] reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.\u201d Upon her <em>de novo </em>review Judge Nguyen concluded that Ermovick could engage in gainful employment with a sedentary job and suitable accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Finally, Ermovick argues that he was denied a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d as required by ERISA. That provision of the statute describes the obligation of a plan administrator. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(2). Given Judge Nguyen\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the administrative record, Ermovick was accorded the full, fair, and independent review of the district court. <em>See Muniz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>623 F.3d at 1298 n. 4 (\u201cThe district court conducted a de novo review of the record and thus did not accord any deference to [the plan administrator\u2019s] decision. The adequacy of [the plan administrator\u2019s] review is therefore not before this court.\u201d). Judge Nguyen did not give deference to Prudential\u2019s findings or conclusions, so Ermovick\u2019s arguments regarding Prudential\u2019s purported procedural misconduct are not relevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Similarly, Ermovick\u2019s argument that he did not have a chance to supplement the administrative record to provide additional evidence of the nexus between his injuries and his inability to engage in any gainful employment is not persuasive. Ermovick had to prove eligibility, but he did not proffer additional evidence during his third administrative appeal and did not ask to submit additional evidence to the district court before it conducted its <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
