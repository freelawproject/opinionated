After an evidentiary hearing and exhaustive briefing, the bankruptcy court granted Rosenberg\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary bankruptcy case, concluding that the Plaintiff-Appellants were not real parties in interest for numerous reasons (including having no financial interest in the case) and thus lacked standing to pursue the asserted claims as petitioning creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">In its order filed on September 28, 2011, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of the involuntary petition with prejudice. Although the. district court disagreed with one of the reasons given by the bankruptcy court for the dismissal, the district court agreed with all of the other findings and grounds for dismissal outlined in the bankruptcy court\u2019s 34-page order, which the district court commended as \u201cwell-reasoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-23\">After careful review, we conclude that the Plaintiff-Appellants have not shown reversible error in the district court\u2019s Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>tember 28, 2011 order. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
