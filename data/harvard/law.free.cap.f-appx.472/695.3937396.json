R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Manjit Singh Walia, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and adjustment of status. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings and review de novo questions of law. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Walia\u2019s admission that he presented fraudulent claims and evidence in the asylum application he submitted in 2000 and in his testimony before an asylum officer. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1065-67 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Sarvia-Quintanilla v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1393 (9th Cir.1985) (history of dishonesty can support an adverse credibility finding). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, Walia\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Walia failed to establish it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Wakkary, 558 </em>F.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of Walia\u2019s application for adjustment of status, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), and Walia has not raised a colorable due process challenge to this discretionary determination, <em>see Bazua-Cota v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 747, 748-49 (9th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
