We affirm. Even assuming Hutton had an employment contract with the County providing that he could only be fired for cause, the record shows that the County had good cause to discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Hutton is not a civil service employee whose termination would be subject to procedural due process requirements. <em>See Papadopoulos v. Or. State Bd. of Higher Educ., </em>14 Or.App. 130, 511 P.2d 854, 870-72 (1973). Accordingly, we review the County\u2019s action under the standard set forth in <em>Simpson v. Western Graphics Corp., </em>53 Or.App. 205, 631 P.2d 805 (1981), <em>aff'd </em>293 Or. 96, 643 P.2d 1276 (1982). Under this standard, a reviewing court \u201cneed only find that there was substantial evidence to support the employer\u2019s decision and that the employer believed that evidence and acted in good faith in discharging the worker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">It is undisputed that Hutton received multiple reprimands for violating the County\u2019s vehicle policy and that he took firewood from a County park for personal use at his home without permission. These undisputed facts constitute substantial evidence supporting the County\u2019s decision. Hutton does not dispute that the County believed the evidence. To the extent he contends the County\u2019s reliance on these incidents is mere pretext, Hutton failed to set forth facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the County acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
