Her claims were referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2006). The magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss her actions. Assa\u2019ad-Faltas filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, but the district court accepted the recommendations and dismissed her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to file specific objections will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985). We have limited our review to the issues raised in Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s informal briefs, <em>see </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b), and to the extent Assa\u2019ad-Faltas filed specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. <em>See Assa\u2019ad-Faltas v. Columbia, SC, </em>No. 3:10-cv-03294-TLW, 2011 WL 3417836 (D.S.C. Aug. 3, 2011); <em>Assa\u2019ad-Faltas v. Wilson, </em>No. 3:11-cv-00278-TLW (D.S.C. July 28, 2011); <em>Assa\u2019ad-Faltas v. South Carolina, </em>No. 3:11-cv-00809-TLW (D.S.C. filed July 27, 2011; entered July 28, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
