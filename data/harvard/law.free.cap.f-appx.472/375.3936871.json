Thomas Lee PICKETT, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b405-11\">No. 10-2396.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b405-12\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b405-14\">March 29, 2012.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b405-21\">Before: MARTIN, COOK, and KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-22\">KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b405-23\">Thomas Lee Pickett pled guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of children in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). In a written plea agreement, he \u201cwaive[d] any right he has to appeal his conviction or sentence[,]\u201d so long as \u201cthe sentence imposed d[id] not exceed 180 months[.]\u201d On October 12, 2010, the district court sentenced him to 180 months. Two days later, the court entered judgment accordingly. On October 25, Pickett filed a motion to correct his sentence and a notice of appeal of the October 14 judgment. Three months later, on January 12, 2011, the district court purported to amend its judgment, changing one special condition of supervised release. Neither Pickett nor the government appealed the amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">As an initial matter, the district court\u2019s amended judgment is not before us. Pickett\u2019s notice of appeal designated the initial judgment as \u201cthe judgment ... being appealed.\u201d Fed. R.App. Proc. 3(c)(1)(B). No one has appealed the amended judgment, which is likely ineffective anyway because it was untimely entered. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-25\">As for Pickett\u2019s appeal of the initial judgment, the government argues that Pickett\u2019s right to bring the appeal was waived per the plain terms of his plea agreement. That agreement waived Pickett\u2019s right to challenge his \u201csentence\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the district court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment or less. The district court sentenced Pickett to 180 months; and the condition of supervised release to which he appeals is part of his \u201csentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>669 F.3d 756, 765-67 (6th Cir.2012). Pickett therefore waived his right to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
