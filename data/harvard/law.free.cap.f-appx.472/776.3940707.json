Our jurisdiction is governed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies between Tobar-Ascencio\u2019s testimony and her asylum application regarding whether her father had been kidnapped and whether he was deceased. <em>See id. </em>at 1040-44 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d). The agency properly rejected Tobar-Ascencio\u2019s explanations for these inconsistencies. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007) (upholding agency finding that explanations were insufficient). In the absence of credible testimony, Tobar-Ascencio\u2019s asylum claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review Tobar-Ascencio\u2019s contention regarding waiver of her right to legal counsel because she failed to raise this claim to the BIA. <em>See Bamn v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (no jurisdiction over claims not presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
