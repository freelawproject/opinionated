LEVAL, ROBERT D. SACK, PETER W. HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b66-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">Appellant Neb Morrow, III, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his request for an adjournment of his trial date, denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, and overruling his objection to the district court\u2019s jury instructions. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">I. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">Morrow complains that venue was not proper in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. Venue in the Southern District of New York was properly supported in two ways \u2014 first by evidence that Morrow, in furtherance of the robbery conspiracy, attempted to rob a Radio Shack store in Manhattan, and, second, by evidence that interstate commerce in the Southern District of New York was affected when, as a result of the robbery of Radio Shack stores in Queens and Brooklyn and the attempt in the Manhattan store, the Manhattan store was closed for two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">II. The Alleged Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b66-20\">Morrow further argues that he was denied due process of law in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), because the police suppressed and failed to turn over to him the surveillance video in the Manhattan store, which he asserts might have shown that it was not he who tried to rob it, and a box in the store that was handled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>by the person who entered, which might have had fingerprints on it. But he has made no showing that the police ever had possession of the evidence, or destroyed or suppressed it, much less that the evidence would have supported his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">III. Denial of Adjournment Request</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The decision whether to grant an adjournment or a continuance is a matter \u201ctraditionally within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>650 F.3d 839, 854 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review an order denying a continuance for abuse of discretion, and \u201cwill find no such abuse unless the denial was an arbitrary action that substantially impaired the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe burden of showing such an impairment is on the party complaining of the lack of a sufficient continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Morrow\u2019s second request to adjourn the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">IV. Post-Submission Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">After the case was submitted to the Court, Morrow filed a motion to supplement the record on March 8, 2012, pursuant to Fed. R App. P. 10(e)(2)(C). Morrow seeks permission to add trial transcripts from a state-court proceeding that, he asserts, demonstrate that a police officer who testified at Morrow\u2019s trial lied about the circumstances leading to Morrow\u2019s arrest. The state trial, however, took place after the federal trial on which this appeal is based. Because the proposed new materials could not have been part of the district court record in any event, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2), we deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">We have considered Morrow\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
