We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">The district court did not err in admitting the jury verdict during the hearing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. We assume, without deciding, that the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to a hearing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b)(2) permits a court to take judicial notice of a fact that \u201ccan be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Those requirements plainly were met here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Judicial notice of the verdict, as was requested by the government, was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
