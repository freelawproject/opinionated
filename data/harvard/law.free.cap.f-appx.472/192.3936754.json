Counsel for Johnson filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning the reasonableness of Johnson\u2019s sentence. Johnson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government has chosen not to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">This court reviews Johnson\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, applying the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. Id.; <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). After determining whether the district court correctly calculated Johnson\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, this Court must decide whether the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, analyzed the arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 575-76; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009). If the sentence is free of significant procedural error, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 575; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that Johnson\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and that the district court complied with Rule 11 in accepting the plea. We therefore affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction. As for Johnson\u2019s sentence, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines range and appropriately applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The sentence is thus procedurally reasonable. Further, we conclude that Johnson\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is presumed reasonable on appeal). Counsel\u2019s assertions are not sufficient to rebut this presumption. We therefore affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this ease and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We thus affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Johnson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Johnson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
