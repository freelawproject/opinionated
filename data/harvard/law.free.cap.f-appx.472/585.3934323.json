The BIA upheld the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) determination that McBarango had been convicted of an aggravated felony that was also a particularly serious crime, thus rendering him ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The BIA also upheld the IJ\u2019s ruling that McBarango did not prove that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted for his political beliefs upon his return to Nigeria, thus denying deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">McBarango argues, for the first time in his petition for review, that errors by his second and third attorneys prejudiced his removal hearing and his appeal to the BIA. Because McBarango has not previously raised this claim with the BIA, we dismiss the claim for failure to satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirement. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">McBarango also argues that the BIA erred in denying his request to continue his appellate proceedings while he awaited disposition of his wife\u2019s next-relative petition. McBarango argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>BIA categorically denied his request, thus presenting a question of law that we have jurisdiction to review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We disagree with this characterization of the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA did not categorically deny McBarango\u2019s request. To the contrary, it analyzed the individual factual circumstances of McBarango\u2019s case, ultimately exercising its discretion to deny the request. Because MeBarango was convicted of an aggravated felony, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision on this issue. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
