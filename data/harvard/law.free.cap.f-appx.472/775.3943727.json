We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kravchuk\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed four years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), and Kravchuk did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief, <em>see Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir.2008) (evidence must demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief warranting reopening based on changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-25\">To the extent Kravchuk challenges the BIA\u2019s underlying order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we decline to consider his contentions because the court previously rejected them in <em>Kravchuk v. Mukasey, </em>263 Fed.Appx. 599 (9th Cir.2008). <em>See Merritt v. Mackey, </em>932 F.2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that under the \u201claw of the case doctrine,\u201d one panel of an appellate court will not reconsider questions which another panel has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>decided on a prior appeal in the same case).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b805-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
