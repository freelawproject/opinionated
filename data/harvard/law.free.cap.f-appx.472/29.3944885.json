Sullivan. We address Fnu Lnu\u2019s appeal in a separate Per Curiam opinion filed contemporaneously with this Summary Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-21\">Here we address only the appeals of Ogunrinka and Oyewumi. In Oyewumi\u2019s case, defense counsel has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the government has moved to dismiss Oyewumi\u2019s appeal based on the appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement, and, in the alternative, for summary affirmance of Oyewumi\u2019s conviction and sentence. Ogunrinka appeals his sentences as being procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-22\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-23\">\n<em>1. Ogunrinka\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-24\">Appellant Ogunrinka argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury and his Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Amendment Due Process rights because the district court based Ogunrinka\u2019s sentence on its finding that a preponderance of the evidence established that Ogunrinka was responsible for between 100 and 400 grams of heroin. At trial, applying a reasonable doubt standard, the jury found that Ogunrinka was responsible for less than 100 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The district court committed no constitutional or legal errors in using the preponderance of the evidence standard in calculating the drug quantity involved in Ogunrinka\u2019s criminal conduct and thereafter sentencing defendant accordingly. <em>See United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 525 (2d Cir.2005). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s sentence of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>2. Ogunrinka\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Ogunrinka also contends that the district court erred in declining to impose a \u201cminor role\u201d reduction pursuant to section 3B1.2(b). To be eligible for a minor role adjustment, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct must be minor or minimal as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 235 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s findings of fact were well-founded in the record. We find no error in the court\u2019s decision that Ogunrinka was not a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Based on the foregoing, we find Ogunrinka\u2019s 63-month sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\n<em>3. Oye wumi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Mary Anne Wirth moves to be relieved as counsel for Kay Oyewumi, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the government moves to dismiss Oyewumi\u2019s appeal, or in the alternative, for summary affirmance. Because we find that Oyewumi\u2019s plea agreement included a valid waiver of his right to appeal a within-Guidelines sentence, we grant Wirth\u2019s motion to be relieved as counsel and grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Oyewumi\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court with regard to both Ogunrinka and Oyewumi is AFFIRMED. This summary order disposes of Mary Anne Wirth\u2019s Anders Motion as well as the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or dismissal of Oyewumi\u2019s appeal. Both pending motions are therefore moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
