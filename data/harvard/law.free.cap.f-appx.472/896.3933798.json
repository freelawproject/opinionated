Ramjeawan sued the Defendant Bank of America, N.A. for negligence and civil theft. The case was tried to a jury, which found in favor of the Ramjeawans on the negligence counts and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $528,531.01 and punitive damages in the amount of $150,000.00. The jury found in favor of the Bank on the civil theft claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-20\">The Bank appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of the Bank\u2019s post-trial Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, which alleged that the Ramjeawans failed to present sufficient evidence to support the award of punitive damages. We have considered the briefs of the parties and conclude that the district court did not err in denying this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-21\">The Bank also contends that the district court erred in denying the Bank\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees because the civil theft claim was without substantial factual or legal support. We conclude that the denial of this motion did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
