We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Hao did not suffer past persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.2006) (persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d that \u201cdoes not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u201d) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Hao does not have a clear probability of future persecution based on his practice of Tibetan Buddhism. <em>See Fakhry v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1057, 1066 (9th Cir.2008) (the \u201csum of evidence\u201d does not compel a finding that petitioner has a clear probability of future persecution). Accordingly, Hao\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Hao failed to establish it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
