We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for a continuance. <em>Sandova-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1245-46 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon inconsistencies between Garcia Morales\u2019 asylum applications, asylum interview, and testimony regarding the basis for his claim. <em>See Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997). Garda-Morales\u2019 assertion that the IJ misinterpreted or failed to address his explanation is belied by the record. In the absence of credible testimony, Garcia Morales\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Garcia Morales did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Guatemalan government. <em>See Villegas v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 984, 988-89 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, his CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Garcia Morales\u2019 motion for a continuance and declining to remand to allow him to obtain the testimony of the asylum officer who interviewed him. <em>See Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b497-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
