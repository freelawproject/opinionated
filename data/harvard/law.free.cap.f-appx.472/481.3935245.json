We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>Harper v. City of Los Angeles, </em>533 F.3d 1010, 1030 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding trial evidence concerning Blaisdell\u2019s other lawsuits and claims against the prison because it limited the scope of the exclusion in the manner recommended by Blaisdell. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 103(a) (when the court excludes evidence, a party must inform the court of its substance by an offer of proof in order to claim error); Price <em>v. Kramer, </em>200 F.3d 1237, 1252 (9th Cir.2000) (failure to object to evidence at trial on the specific basis raised on appeal results in waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Blaisdell\u2019s treating physician to testify at trial because the testimony that Blaisdell objected to either was relevant to Blaisdell\u2019s claim or did not \u201c \u2018substantially prejudieef ]\u2019 \u201d him. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (affording broad discretion to a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding costs to defendants because defendants were the prevailing party, <em>see Dawson v. City of Seattle, </em>435 F.3d 1054, 1070 (9th Cir.2006) (stating standard of review and that \u201cthere is a presumption that the prevailing party will be awarded its taxable costs\u201d), and the amount of costs awarded was a \u201crelatively small sum[.]\u201d <em>Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, </em>335 F.3d 932, 946 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Blaisdell\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning the \u201cLuna\u201d complaint and his attempts to obtain or listen to his audio cassette tapes, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">To the extent that Blaisdell seeks injunctive relief from this court, his request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b511-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
