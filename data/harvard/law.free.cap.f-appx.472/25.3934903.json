LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir.2000). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to the challenged revocation for clear error, <em>see United States v. English, </em>629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir.2011), and will not reverse \u201cunless on the entire evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>United States v. Sabhnani, </em>493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We assume familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">A district court may revoke a prior grant of bail based on a finding, made after a hearing, that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a crime while on release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(A), and that \u201cthere is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3148(b)(2)(A), or that \u201cthe person is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B). A finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony while on release gives rise to \u201ca rebuttable presumption ... that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3148(b). Such a rebuttable \u201cpresumption does not disappear once the defendant has produced some rebuttal evidence, but continues to be weighed along with other factors.\u201d <em>United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the felonious conduct prompting revocation was Bartok\u2019s purported perjury in a March 15, 2011 financial affidavit filed with the court pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (\u201cCJA\u201d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">1. <em>The \u201cHearing\u201d Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">As a preliminary matter, Bart\u00f3k faults the district court for revoking his bail without holding the hearing required by \u00a7 3148(b). We are not persuaded. Bail revocation hearings are \u201ctypically informal\u201d affairs. <em>United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d at 131 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Martir, </em>782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir.1986). We afford district courts wide discretion regarding the scope of such hearings, so long as the chosen procedures are sufficient to ensure the reliability of questioned evidence. <em>See United States v. Martir, </em>782 F.2d at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">Here, the government filed a letter on August 8, 2011, accusing Bart\u00f3k of perjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>in his CJA affidavit. One week later, on August 15, 2011, the district court informed the parties that the issue would be considered at a previously scheduled August 18, 2011 conference. At the conference, Bartok\u2019s counsel first told the district court that he was prepared to respond to the government\u2019s allegations. Later, however, Bartok\u2019s counsel claimed that he had not yet had sufficient opportunity to verify the government\u2019s information regarding his client\u2019s financial situation. The district court nevertheless instructed the parties to proceed by proffer on the issue of whether bail should be revoked. After a short recess, the court engaged in a detailed discussion with the parties regarding the proffered evidence of perjury and concluded that bail should be revoked. Before so ruling, however, it advised that it would leave the evidentiary record open should either party wish to supplement the record or seek reconsideration. Bart\u00f3k has not availed himself of these options. In these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold more extensive hearings before ordering revocation. <em>See id. </em>at 1145 (warning against allowing bail hearing to become \u201cmini-trial\u201d or \u201cdiscovery tool for the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">2. <em>The Perjury Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Bart\u00f3k argues that the district court clearly erred in finding probable cause to believe that, by submitting the undisputedly \u201cincomplete\u201d financial affidavit, Revocation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 58, Bart\u00f3k committed the federal felony of perjury. We are not persuaded. For Bartok\u2019s affidavit to have been perjurious, he would have had willfully to subscribe as true to material matter that he did not believe to be true. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(2). While probable cause requires more than a mere suspicion of such wrongdoing, its focus is <em>on </em>probabilities, not hard certainties. <em>See Walczyk v. Rio, </em>496 F.3d 139, 156 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Here, Bart\u00f3k failed truthfully to disclose certain assets, namely, his withdrawal of $21,000 from a retirement account on the very day he filed the financial affidavit or shortly before that day. In response to the question on the form asking whether he received any income during the past twelve months from \u201cself-employment, or in the form of ... retirement or annuity payments, or other sources,\u201d Bart\u00f3k listed only $50,000 from \u201cself-employment,\u201d [Ex. C] with no mention of the $21,000 withdrawal. Further, in response to the question whether he owned \u201cany real estate, stocks, bonds, notes, automobiles, or other valuable property,\u201d Bart\u00f3k listed only $26,000 in a retirement account \u2014 the balance <em>after </em>the $21,000 withdrawal. Nor did he disclose his partial equity in a 2009 Mercedes Benz automobile purchased for approximately $120,000. The district court acted well within its discretion in inferring from \u201cthe magnitude of the omissions\u201d and the timing of the withdrawal that the omissions were probably willful. Revocation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 64.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">3. <em>The Public Danger Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Bart\u00f3k contends that a probable cause finding of perjury should not trigger \u00a7 3148(b)\u2019s rebuttable presumption of dangerousness. However, the law plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>states that the presumption may be triggered by a probable cause finding as to a defendant\u2019s commission of <em>any </em>felony, regardless of whether the felony itself involves violence, threats, or other indicia of dangerousness. <em>See United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d at 134. Perjury is a Class D federal felony crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (providing for five-year maximum prison sentence); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3559(a)(4) (providing that offense with maximum prison term of \u201cless than ten years but five or more years\u201d is Class D felony). Moreover, conduct by a defendant that \u201cpose[s] a serious threat to the court\u2019s processes\u201d has long been recognized as a ground for pretrial detention, <em>see United States v. Payden, </em>768 F.2d 487, 490 (2d Cir.1985), and a defendant\u2019s submission of a materially false affidavit to the court signifies such a threat. No different conclusion is warranted because the affidavit pertained to defendant\u2019s eligibility for publicly funded legal counsel rather than the merits, particularly where, as here, defendant was already charged with obstruction of justice and fraud on a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">At the hearing, Bart\u00f3k proffered no evidence to rebut \u00a7 3148(b)\u2019s presumption in favor of detention. Thus, we cannot identify clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that no conditions of release were adequate to safeguard against the risk of public danger posed by Bart\u00f3k. As such, we need not and do not reach Bartok\u2019s argument that the district court clearly erred in its separate factual finding that Bartok\u2019s history of deceiving the court also warranted his detention as a risk of flight. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order revoking bail is AFFIRMED. The district court may revisit its decision to revoke bail at any time in light of new information.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">. Like the district court, we need not consider any other possible knowing misstatements in the affidavit, <em>e.g., </em>whether Bartok's statement that he had no cash on hand or money in bank accounts was false in light of evidence that (1) during Bartok's release, he and his family frequently withdrew funds from a business account for personal use; and (2) over the course of the month following Bartok's submission of the affidavit, he purchased some $40,000 in chips at Atlantic City casinos.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
