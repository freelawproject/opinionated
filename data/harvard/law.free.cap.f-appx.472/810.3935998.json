We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, </em>485 F.3d 463, 470 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants Harris and Taylor in their individual capacities as to Simmons\u2019 malicious prosecution claim because Simmons failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether these defendants interfered with the prosecutor\u2019s independent judgment in initiating criminal proceedings, and whether they acted with the purpose of denying Simmons a fair trial or violating another constitutional right. <em>See Lacey v. Maricopa County, </em>649 F.3d 1118, 1133 (9th Cir.2011) (elements of a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983); <em>Harper v. City of Los Angeles, </em>533 F.3d 1010, 1027 (9th Cir.2008) (presumption that prosecutor\u2019s filing of a criminal complaint immunizes investigating officers unless \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence shows that \u201c\u2018the district attorney was pressured or caused by the investigating officers to act contrary to his independent judgment\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Simmons\u2019 motion to file a third amended complaint. <em>See Chodos v. </em>W. <em>Publ'g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth the standard of review and requirements for leave to amend, and noting that a district court\u2019s discretion is particularly broad where it has already granted leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Simmons\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Simmons\u2019 motion for a status update on this appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
