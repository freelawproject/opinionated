Stearns appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying her motion to sever joint liability and other alternative relief. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-27\">Stearns contends that the district court erred when it held that it lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment to sever joint liability, or to compel the government to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>pursue the estate of her co-defendant to recover restitution payments. Stearns fails to establish the applicability of any of the limited circumstances under which an order of restitution may be altered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(o); <em>see also United States v. Morales, </em>328 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2003) (district courts do not have \u201cinherent authority\u201d to modify a fine imposed as part of a sentence). Additionally, Stearns identifies no authority upon which the court may compel the government to pursue the estate of her co-defendant to recover restitution payments. <em>See generally United States v. Bright, </em>353 F.3d 1114, 1124 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cNothing in the [Mandatory Victims Restitution Act] indicates that district courts themselves are required to reach out and order the government to transfer forfeited funds from government entities to victims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
