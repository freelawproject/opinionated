We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Vega\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. The district court\u2019s order affirming the denial of benefits neither relied on any manifest errors of law or fact nor resulted in a manifest injustice. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Herron, </em>634 F.3d 1101, 1111 (9th Cir.2011). In his motion, Vega did not provide any new evidence or identify any intervening change in controlling law. <em>Id. </em>Rather, Vega attempted to raise a new argument based on a purported factual finding in the district court\u2019s order affirming the denial of benefits regarding his alleged illiteracy. When ruling on a Rule 56 motion, however, the district court does not make findings of facts. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(3), 56(a); <em>Scott v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist., </em>306 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, Vega, who was represented by counsel, could have included the argument regarding his alleged illiteracy as support for his summary judgment motion. <em>Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201c[a] Rule 59(e) motion may not be used to raise arguments or present evidence for the first time when they could reasonably have been raised earlier in the litigation.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s ruling on Vega\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b857-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
