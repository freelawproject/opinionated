Straus, which denied his application for a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>In re Devon Ian King, </em>No. A047 569 681 (B.I.A. Apr. 25, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A047 569 681 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, Conn. Jan. 11, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">We have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Because King is challenging the denial of discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\u00ae, we have jurisdiction to review only constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">King argues that the IJ erred by finding him inadmissible on grounds of fraud or willful misrepresentation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae. Petitioner did not raise this issue before the BIA, which consequently did not address it. \u201c[W]e are precluded from considering this challenge because [Petitioner] failed to raise this issue before the BIA, and the government raises issue exhaustion as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 36 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">King also asserts that the BIA improperly relied on <em>Matter of Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 299-300 (B.I.A.1996), a case involving a waiver application under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), in balancing the equities within the context of its discretionary determination under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\u00ae.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Mendez-Moralez </em>requires an \u201cImmigration Judge [to] balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on his behalf to determine whether the grant of relief in the exercise of discretion appears to be in the best interests of this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We need not reach the question whether the BIA correctly applied the standard from <em>Mendez-Moralez </em>to Petitioner\u2019s case, because the only negative equities considered by either the IJ or the BIA were the various misrepresentations Petitioner made in seeking to remain in this country. The BIA has made clear that fraud or misrepresentation in seeking an immigration benefit may \u201cproperly [be] considered ... as an adverse factor in denying ... relief under section [1182\u00ae ] ... as a matter of discretion.\u201d <em>Matter of Cervantes-Gonzalez, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 560, 569 (B.I.A. 1999). Petitioner does not challenge the actual weighing of his misrepresentations against the positive equities involved in his case, and, even if he did, we would have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s discretion in weighing these equities. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the rule of <em>Cervantes-Gonzalez </em>is dispositive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-13\">. This contention raises a question of law, over which we may exercise jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. Because we affirm the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner would not be entitled to discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i) even had he shown extreme hardship, we do not reach the question whether the IJ erred in concluding that Petitioner failed to show such hardship.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
