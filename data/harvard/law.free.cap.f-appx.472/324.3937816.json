California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Meneweather has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Meneweather\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the instant appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">We note that in Meneweather\u2019s response he seeks relief from the dismissal of his direct criminal appeal (Case No. 09-30294) for failure to prosecute. The instant appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, however, is not the proper forum for granting such relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
