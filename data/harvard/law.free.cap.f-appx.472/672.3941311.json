Flewell maintains that his confession and consent to search his computer were involuntary because Flewell was not advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights prior to an in-home interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The district court properly denied Flewell\u2019s motion to suppress. The interrogation was non-custodial, as \u201ca reasonable person in [Flewell\u2019s] position would [not] have felt deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way ...\u201d <em>United States v. Craighead, </em>539 F.3d 1073, 1082 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Bassignani, </em>575 F.3d 879, 883 (9th Cir.2009), <em>as amended </em>(\u201cAn officer\u2019s obligation to give a suspect <em>Miranda </em>warnings before interrogation extends only to those instances where the individual is in custody.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The officers\u2019 deceptive tactics did not render Flewell\u2019s confession involuntary. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>372 F.3d 1048, 1060-61 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (\u201cTrickery, deceit, even impersonation do not render a confession inadmissible, certainly in noncustodial situations and usually in custodial ones as well ... \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Flewell voluntarily consented to the search of his computer. The officers never compelled Flewell to consent and Flewell signed a consent form informing him of his right to refuse consent. <em>See United States v. Vongxay, </em>594 F.3d 1111, 1119-20 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Childs, </em>944 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe consent form clearly states that a person may refuse to sign it. Knowledge of the right to refuse consent is highly relevant in determining whether a consent is valid.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
