We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>evidence. <em>Ahmed v. Keisler, </em>504 F.3d 1183, 1191 (9th Cir.2007). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Chen failed to establish it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See id. </em>at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">With respect to Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Chen did not suffer harm that rises to the level of persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2006) (petitioner did not establish past persecution where the petitioner was arrested and detained for three days, interrogated, and struck with a rod ten times). However, as to Chen\u2019s future fear, substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s nexus determination, because Chen\u2019s testimony and supporting affidavits establish that an imputed religious opinion was one central reason for the police\u2019s interest in her. <em>See Kebede v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 812 (9th Cir.2004) (statements by persecutor can establish nexus); <em>Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (9th Cir.2000) (persecutor\u2019s motive can be established by petitioner\u2019s credible testimony and witness testimony). Because the BIA erred in its nexus determination, it did not fully consider Chen\u2019s claim of future persecution. Accordingly, we grant the petition as to Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
