We have jurisdiction to consider questions of law raised in the petition of an alien who is removable because of a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Garcia-Jimenez v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 1082, 1085 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Long is a seventy-two year old citizen of the Philippines. She has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1964. Long was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude more than thirty years ago. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) served Long with a notice to appear when she returned from a brief trip abroad. ICE alleged that Long was inadmissible as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Long argued that she was returning from an \u201cinnocent, casual and brief\u2019 trip abroad, which was not meant to be meaningfully interruptive of her lawful permanent resident status. <em>See Rosenberg v. Fleuti </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963). The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) abrogated the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) (lawful permanent residents who have committed a crime involving moral turpitude must seek admission to the United States upon return from travel abroad); <em>Vartelas v. Holder, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 1483-84, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">In <em>Vartelas v. Holder, </em>the Supreme Court held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to an alien\u2019s pre-IIRIRA conviction. <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1483-84. The Court\u2019s opinion applies to pre-IIRIRA convictions, regardless of whether the alien was convicted after entry of a guilty plea or after a jury trial. <em>See Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1491-92 (rejecting the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion that evidence of reliance is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle); <em>see also id. </em>at 1483-84, 1487-88, 1488-90. It appears that Ms. Long is eligible for relief under <em>Vartelas. </em>Nonetheless, we remand to the BIA to address this legal issue in the first instance. <em>Perdomo v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 662, 669 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
