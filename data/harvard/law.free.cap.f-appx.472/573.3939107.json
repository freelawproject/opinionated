Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and we review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Juarez-Contreras\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed over three years after the final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Juarez-Contreras did not establish he acted with due diligence required for equitable tolling, <em>see Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Juarez-Contreras\u2019 contentions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>BIA\u2019s October 7, 2003, order denying his appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s decision, because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v.
