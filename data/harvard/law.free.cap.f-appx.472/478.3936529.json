We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The United States charged Cruz with unlawful entry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b). It then filed a superseding information charging Cruz with using false documents to obtain entry in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). Cruz pled guilty to the \u00a7 1546(a) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">A probation officer prepared a presentence report detailing Cruz\u2019s lengthy criminal and immigration history. Cruz had 21 criminal history points, which translated to a criminal history category of VI \u2014 the highest in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines table. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. The Guidelines\u2019 recommended range of imprisonment was 18 to 24 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2. The presentence report then addressed \u201cfactors that may warrant departure.\u201d It noted that Cruz \u201cwas originally charged with a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and had he been convicted of that offense, his guideline range of imprisonment would have been 77 to 96 months.\u201d In calculating this hypothetical sentence, the presentence report apparently relied on the assumption that Cruz, if he had been convicted of and sentenced for violating \u00a7 1326, would have received a 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>enhancement under the unlawful entry Guideline for deportation after a \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I). The report recommended a four-point upward departure for uncharged conduct under Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.21, resulting in a recommended range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the judge stated that he had considered the document fraud Guideline\u2019s recommended range, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and all the factors discussed in the presentence report in determining the sentence. He expressed agreement with the report\u2019s upward departure recommendation. The government then clarified for the judge that the documents justifying the 16-point enhancement in the hypothetical \u00a7 1326 sentence were not available. The probation officer in turn explained that the judge could alternatively achieve the above-Guidelines sentence through an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The judge said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and then read out loud the sections of the presentenee report stating that the \u00a7 1546 offense was Cruz\u2019s second consecutive federal offense; that he committed it within days of his release from prison; that he had 21 criminal history points; that he has a history of committing a serious offense, being ordered removed, and then committing another serious offense; that the justice system has not instilled in Cruz an adequate level of deterrence; and that the Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months did not capture the full scope of the offense and was not likely to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) objectives. He expressed agreement and ordered a four-point upward departure and a 36-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On appeal, Cruz argues that the district court committed procedural error by making reference to, and giving \u201cundue weight to,\u201d the hypothetical unlawful entry sentence of 77 to 96 months, which was based on \u201cunsupported assumptions,\u201d and which the court \u201cused to ... justify a substantial upward departure\u201d from \u2022 the document fraud Guideline range. We do not review the kind of error Cruz alleges here as part of our review for <em>procedural </em>error. Where, as here, \u201ca district court has framed its analysis in terms of a downward or upward departure, we will treat such so-called departures as an exercise of post-<em>Booker </em>discretion to sentence a defendant outside of the applicable [Guidelines range,\u201d which is \u201csubject to a unitary review for [substantive] reasonableness, no matter how the district court styles its sentencing decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>see also United States v. Lichtenberg, </em>631 F.3d 1021, 1027 n. 8 (9th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>641 F.3d 411, 420-21 (9th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Tankersley, </em>537 F.3d 1100, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u201c[T]he substantive reasonableness of a sentence \u2014 whether objected to or not at sentencing \u2014 is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Autery, </em>555 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2009). \u201cFor a non-Guidelines sentence, we are to \u2018give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[w]e may not reverse just because we think a different sentence is appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). In determining a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the degree of variance for a sentence imposed outside the [Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA substantively reasonable sentence is one that is \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>accomplish \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2019s sentencing goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Crowe, </em>563 F.3d 969, 977 n. 16 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As in <em>Ellis, </em>here, \u201c[ultimately, [Cruz]\u2019s ... objections to the reasons the district court gave for \u2018departing1 upward are beside the point. The question for our purposes is whether a moderately above-Guidelines sentence for a defendant who\u201d committed his second consecutive federal offense within days of his release from federal prison, who has a history of committing serious offenses and being ordered removed, only to be arrested on another serious offense, who had 21 criminal history points \u2014 well above the number needed to put him in the highest criminal history category \u2014 and in whom the criminal justice system has evidently not yet instilled an adequate level of deterrence \u201cis reasonable under the broad discretion afforded the district court.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>641 F.3d at 423. It is. The district judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that a shorter term of 18 to 24 months would not meet the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2014 specifically, \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B). A review of the record does not generate \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amezcua-Vasquez, </em>567 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
