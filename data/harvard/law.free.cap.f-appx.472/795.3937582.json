We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Guzman does not allege he suffered past persecution, but fears persecution based on a pattern or practice of persecution against individuals with AIDS as well as homosexuals in Mexico. The agency concluded that Guzman failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on the perception that he is homosexual or his HIV/AIDS status. The record does not compel a contrary result. <em>See Castro-Martinez v. Holder, </em>674 F.3d 1073, 1082-83 (9th Cir.2011) (applicant failed to establish the existence of a pattern or practice of persecution against homosexuals in Mexico or that he had a well-founded fear of persecution as a man with HIV/AIDS in Mexico). Accordingly, Guzman\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Because Guzman failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Guzman failed to establish that it is more likely than not he would be tortured by a public official or at the instigation or acquiescence of an official. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1068 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b825-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
