Linder contends his guilty plea, entered pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by misadvising him as to the potential sentence as a result of the <em>Alford </em>plea. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Linder\u2019s statements at the plea colloquy and in the guilty plea agreement, coupled with the charges in the information, provided sufficient \u201cstrong factual basis,\u201d <em>see Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 38, 91 S.Ct. 160, from which a reasonable jury could find that Linder strangled the victim and that he did so with malice aforethought. <em>See United States v. Neel, </em>547 F.2d 95, 96 (9th Cir.1976) (per curiam) (\u201cThe court need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused is guilty. It need only be convinced that there is sufficient evidence to justify the reaching of such a conclusion.\u201d). The Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that this evidence was sufficient to support a charge of second degree murder was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Moreover, Linder\u2019s statements in the plea agreement and in response to the trial court\u2019s questions at the plea colloquy indicated his \u201cclearly expressed desire\u201d to enter the plea, <em>see Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 38, 91 S.Ct. 160, especially in light of the mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole or with possibility of parole after twenty years that he might have received if he was convicted of first degree murder. <em>See id. </em>at 31, 91 S.Ct. 160 (an <em>Alford </em>plea must represent \u201ca voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Similarly, considering the options available to Linder at the time of the plea colloquy, the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that he suffered no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s alleged misadvisement as to the potential sentence was not unreasonable. First, there was no prejudice because the plea agreement clearly informed Linder that he could be sentenced to life imprisonment with a possibility for parole after ten years. <em>See Womack v. Del Papa, </em>497 F.3d 998, 1003 (9th Cir. 2007). Second, in light of the State\u2019s \u201cformidable\u201d case against him, <em>see Premo v. Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 733, 744, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011), Linder failed to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Linder\u2019s motion to expand the certificate of appealability is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">Linder\u2019s request for judicial notice is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b855-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
