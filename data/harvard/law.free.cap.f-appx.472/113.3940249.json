However, on February 2, 2012, the District Court dismissed the motion without prejudice to its being refiled upon the resolution of Morris\u2019s pending direct appeal; the District Court also denied Morris\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider. Therefore, this petition for writ of mandamus will be dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
