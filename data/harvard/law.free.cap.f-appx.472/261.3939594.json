The order is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006); <em>Madley v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>278 F.3d 1306, 1309-10 (D.C.Cir.2002). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); see <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Malede has not made the requisite showing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> In particular, we note that the timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation. <em>United States v. Midgette, </em>478 F.3d 616, 621-22 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Because Malede, a <em>pro se </em>litigant, received notice of the consequences of a failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and yet failed to do so, he has waived appellate review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
