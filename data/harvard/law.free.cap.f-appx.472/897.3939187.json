Plaintiffs sought to have certain agreements between United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local Georgia law enforcement agencies declared unconstitutional and permanently enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">The defendants moved to dismiss, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs had no standing to bring this action because they could not meet the injury-in-fact requirement by showing an imminent risk of future harm to them. The district court agreed and dismissed the case. Plaintiffs filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and record in this case. We have also examined the district court\u2019s opinion in which it thoughtfully and completely considered whether plaintiffs could show the requisite injury-in-fact for standing. We agree with the district court that plaintiffs have not made that showing. Since we find no legal error in the district court\u2019s opinion and agree with its analysis and conclusions on this issue, we shall affirm the judgment of the district court on the basis of that opinion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing this case is</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
