Our review of the record reveals that Blair\u2019s outside work for pay understandably terminated her entitlement to the long-term disability benefits she had been receiving from her former employer\u2019s welfare benefit plan, which was covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <em>See generally Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (providing de novo review for denial of ERISA benefits, absent a grant of discretion to administrator in contested benefits plan); <em>Bogart v. Chapell, </em>396 F.3d 548, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that Rule 59(e) motions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Blair v. Nat\u2019l City Mortg. Corp. Welfare Benefits Plan, </em>No. 8:09-cv-00906-AW, 2011 WL 2471768 (D. Md. June 20, 2011) &amp; (Sept. 2, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
