We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>diction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that the beating and subsequent threat Rios-Flores suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (beating and repeated threats of harm or death were not \u201cso severe as to compel a finding of past persecution\u201d). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Rios-Flores did not establish a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See Canales-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>441 F.3d 739, 747 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that threats received thirteen years prior did not establish clear probability of future persecution). Accordingly, Rios-Flores\u2019 withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Rios-Flores failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured upon return to El Salvador. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Finally, we decline to consider the new evidence Rios-Flores references in his opening brief because our review of the BIA\u2019s order is limited to the administrative record. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
