We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">Cherry does not advance any coherent argument on appeal as to why the district court erred in refusing to grant his motion. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.1995) (noting that while \u201cappellate courts generally do not hold <em>pro se </em>litigants rigidly to ... formal briefing standards,\u201d \u201cwe need not manufacture claims of error for an appellant proceeding <em>pro se </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-21\">We note only that while Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) permits a \u201ccourt [to] relieve a party ... from a final judgment\u201d under certain circumstances, a claim that a judgment should be set aside because of \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>under Rule 59(b),\u201d or \u201cmisconduct by an opposing party\u201d must be made \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), (c). Cherry\u2019s motion to re-open was filed more than seven years after the judgment against him was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED, and the motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
