Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">The record does not compel the conclusion that the Maoists were motivated, even in part, by Sharma\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Further, here, where Sharma\u2019s wife and five daughters have remained in Nepal unharmed, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ing that petitioner failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.2009) (concluding that petition failed to make a compelling showing of the objective component).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Sharma did not raise it to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (no jurisdiction over legal claims not presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b763-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
