Williams alleges on appeal that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance, and that his 50-year sentence for two counts of murder and thirteen counts of attempted murder constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">Where a state court summarily denies a habeas petition by issuing a one-line disposition, as the California Supreme Court did here, a federal court must nonetheless afford \u00a7 2254(d)(1) deference to that disposition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williams an evidentiary hearing, since \u201creview under 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the merits.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398-99, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). And the California Supreme Court was not objectively unreasonable in determining that Williams\u2019s trial and appellate counsel was not objectively deficient or, even if deficient, did not prejudice Williams, nor was it objectively unreasonable in determining that Williams\u2019s sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments, applicable to the states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>though the Fourteenth Amendment.
