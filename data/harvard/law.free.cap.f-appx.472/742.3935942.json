Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-25\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of removal as untimely because the motion was filed over five years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and petitioners failed to present material evidence of changed circumstances in Colombia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limitation for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 991 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-26\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture because it considered the evidence submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining petitioners did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-27\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte power to reopen proceedings. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>Mejia-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b772-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
