Medina-Fructuoso now appeals: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>(1) the district court\u2019s denial of the parties\u2019 joint motion to withdraw Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s guilty plea; (2) the district court\u2019s denial of Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s unopposed motion to calendar a hearing to waive indictment on a proposed superseding information; and (3) the district court\u2019s imposition of an 8-level sentencing enhancement on the ground that Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s prior conviction for resisting a police officer causing serious bodily injury under California Penal Code \u00a7 148.10(a) was categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(d) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Read, </em>778 F.2d 1437, 1440 (9th Cir.1985). Medina-Fructuoso argues that the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea because the presentence report recommended that he be given a 16-level enhancement for his prior conviction for resisting arrest \u2014 a possibility he claims the parties had not contemplated at the time of the plea agreement. Although Rule 11(d)(2)(B) allows a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea for any \u201cfair and just reason,\u201d \u201c[a] defendant cannot withdraw his plea because he realizes that his sentence will be higher than he had expected.\u201d <em>United States v. Nostratis, </em>321 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, the parties\u2019 plea agreement explicitly contemplated the possibility that the PSR would uncover more information about Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s criminal history and affect his guidelines range. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the parties\u2019 motion to withdraw Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Medina-Fructuoso also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his unopposed motion to calendar a hearing to waive indictment on and plead guilty to the proposed superseding information charging him with two counts of illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325. Medina-Fruetuoso\u2019s motion for calendaring was effectively a new plea agreement that he and the government were presenting to the court: The government would dismiss the \u00a7 1326 charge and bring a superseding information charging Medina-Fructuoso with two counts under \u00a7 1325, and in exchange, Medina-Fructuoso would waive indictment on the superseding information and plead guilty.to the \u00a7 1325 charges. We review a district court\u2019s rejection of a plea agreement for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Morgan, </em>506 F.3d 705, 708 (9th Cir.2007). Here, the district court rejected the new plea agreement for the same reason it denied the parties\u2019 motion to withdraw Medina-Fructuoso\u2019s guilty plea, which, as explained above, was not an abuse of discretion. Thus, the district court\u2019s rejection of the new plea agreement was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Finally, the parties agree that the district court erred in holding that MedinaFructuoso\u2019s prior conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 148.10(a) was categorically an aggravated felony warranting an 8-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), to constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d (and thus an aggravated felony), a prior offense must require the intentional use of physical force or a substantial risk of the intentional use of physical force. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Leon, </em>545 F.3d 777, 787-88 (9th Cir.2008). But California Penal Code \u00a7 148.10(a) makes it a crime to resist arrest and thereby cause injury or death to a police officer \u2014 even if the defendant did not intentionally use force or risk the intentional use of force. <em>See People v. Superior Court, </em>132 Cal.App.4th 1525, 34 Cal.Rptr.3d 481 (2005). And the underlying conviction documents merely parrot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the language of \u00a7 148.10(a), so MedinaFructuoso\u2019s conviction is not an aggravated felony under the modified categorical approach. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in imposing an 8-level enhancement. We thus vacate his sentence and remand solely for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b788-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
