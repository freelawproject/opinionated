We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if Nunez-Saldana\u2019s asylum application was timely, his onetime beating by political opponents and subsequent harassment did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009) (incidents including being \u201cbeaten by a mob of rioters\u201d did not rise to the level of past persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that NunezSaldana failed to establish an objective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (petitioner\u2019s claims \u201ctoo speculative to be credited as a basis for fear of future persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Nunez-Saldana\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Because Nunez-Saldana failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Nunez-Saldana failed to show it is more likely than not he will be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Peru. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
