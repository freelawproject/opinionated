We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that a reasonable jury could conclude that Lamar\u2019s complaints \u2014 made prior to her providing her employer with a letter, dated January 26, 2009, from her psychiatrist\u2014 were sufficient to put the Institute on notice that she believed John McAndrew\u2019s alleged misconduct amounted to sexual harassment, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Lamar\u2019s lengthy delay in reporting such harassment was, as a matter of law, unreasonable, given that she alleges that the harassment began as early as 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in the Institute\u2019s favor on the basis that the Institute was, as a matter of law, entitled to an affirmative defense against liability. <em>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
