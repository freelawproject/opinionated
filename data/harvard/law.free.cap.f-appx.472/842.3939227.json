Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed nearly four years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), and petitioners did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief, <em>see Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996 (9th Cir.2008) (evidence must demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief warranting reopening based on changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Further, even if the BIA erred by failing to consider Garcia-Delgado\u2019s affidavit in denying the motion to reopen, petitioners\u2019 due process claim fails because they have not established prejudice. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process claim). We lack jurisdiction to consider any additional challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision not to sua sponte reopen proceedings. <em>See Mejia-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b872-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
