Hellerstein, Senior United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b515-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In these consolidated appeals, Plaintiffs Aid, Inc. and Andrew Armaswalker (collectively, the \u201cFranchisees\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant Equilon Enterprises, LLC. We affirm the grant of summary judgment in <em>Armaswalker v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC, </em>reverse the grant of summary judgment in <em>Aid v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC, </em>and reverse the award of expert fees in both <em>Armaswalker </em>and <em>Aid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">1. <em>Statutory Framework </em>\u2014 The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (\u201cPMPA\u201d) forbids a franchisor from \u201cfailing] to renew any franchise relationship,\u201d except for reasons specified by statute. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a)(2). One such reason, at issue in this appeal, allows for termination or non-renewal of a franchise relationship if the franchisor determines to sell the premises of a retail station \u201cin good faith and in the normal course of business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2802(b)(8)(D). As applicable to these cases, the franchisor must either (1) \u201cma[ke] a bona fide offer to sell, transfer, or assign to the franchisee such franchisor\u2019s interest in such premises\u201d or (2) \u201coffer[ ] the franchisee a right of first refusal of at least 45-days duration of an offer, made by another, to purchase such franchisor\u2019s -interest in such premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii). Equilon offered each of the Franchisees a right of first refusal (\u201cROFR\u201d) based on a third-party offer to purchase the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We begin with the reasons why we affirm the grant of summary judgment in the <em>Armaswalker </em>case. For reasons specific to the <em>Aid </em>case, we describe later why we ultimately reverse summary judgment in the <em>Aid </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">2. <em>Affirmance of Summary Judgment in the </em>Armaswalker <em>case </em>\u2014 No evidence in the record shows that Equilon made the determination to sell the Armaswalker premises in bad faith by \u201cconcealing] selective discrimination against\u201d Armaswalker. <em>See Unocal Corp. v. Kaabipour, </em>177 F.3d 755, 767 (9th Cir.1999). It is undisputed that Equilon provided Armaswalker more than 90 days notice that its franchise agreement was not going to be renewed, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804(a). It is also undisputed that Equilon offered Armaswalker a ROFR within the 90-day period after notice was given, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii). Finally, it is undisputed that Equilon kept the ROFR open to acceptance for at least a 45-day duration, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(II). Given the absence of evidence of bad faith, Equilon satisfied its statutory obligations for the nonrenewal of Armaswalker\u2019s franchise agreement. We reject any contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">Armaswalker contends that we must review the terms contained in the ROFRs for commercial reasonableness. However, in this case, Equilon did not choose to extend Armaswalker a \u201cbona fide offer\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(I). It instead chose to extend ROFRs pursuant to \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(II). Armaswalker supports his position in favor of judicial scrutiny of the ROFR terms with cases involving a \u201cbona fide offer.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Ellis v. Mobil Oil, </em>969 F.2d 784, 787 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cIt is settled law that a bona fide offer under the PMPA is measured by an objective market standard.\u201d); <em>Slatky v. Amoco </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>Oil Co., </em>830 F.2d 476, 485 (3d Cir.1987) (\u201cbona fide offer\u201d case). Unlike with respect to a \u201cbona fide offer,\u201d neither the statutory text nor any case law suggests that a court is to review the commercial reasonableness of ROFR terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Armaswalker complains of a provision in the contract giving Equilon certain rights of access to the UST System if the franchisee defaulted in its obligation to maintain insurance on the System. However, Equilon did not retain any ownership or possessory interest in the UST System. Thus, unlike in <em>Roberts v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>740 F.2d 602, 604 (8th Cir.1984), where the franchisor retained title to gas-dispensing equipment on the premises, Equilon has merely retained a contractual right of access to the UST System under limited and specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">By failing to raise the challenges to the deed restrictions in the district court, Armaswalker waived the issue on appeal. <em>See Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 958-59 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The challenge to the release of liability also fails. The plain language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(f) does not prohibit a franchisor from conditioning the termination of a franchise relationship on a general release of liability. It prohibits only a waiver of rights afforded by the PMPA as \u201ca condition of entering into or renewing the franchise relationship.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(f). In any event, the provision for a release was withdrawn. Furthermore, the release does not evince a bad faith determination to sell the premises. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D). Nothing about the releases shows that Equilon\u2019s actions \u201care designed to conceal selective discrimination against individual franchises.\u201d <em>Kaabipour, </em>177 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Armaswalker\u2019s ROFR did not include a leaseback provision contained in the third-party offer. Armaswalker fails to show that these leaseback provisions render the ROFR materially different from the third-party offer. The leaseback provision requires Equilon to forward rent payments made by the franchisee to the third-party purchaser once Equilon sells the property to a third party. Whether the ROFR contains a leaseback provision or not, Armaswalker has no rent expense if he accepts the ROFR.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">3. <em>Reversal of Summary Judgment in the </em>Aid <em>Case </em>\u2014 We now discuss why we reverse the grant of summary judgment solely in the <em>Aid </em>case. Where the third party offer and the ROFR contain materially different terms or conditions, the franchisor has not \u201coffered the franchisee a right of first refusal ... of an <em>offer, </em>made by another, to purchase\u201d the premises. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(II). The summary judgment record shows that, before the third party, Harry Hahn, bid on the premises, Hahn and Equilon reached a side agreement. We do not describe it here because it has been filed under seal. Suffice it to say that it was an agreement that was to be executed at closing. That the side agreement was not written into the final agreement between Equilon and the third party is not determinative. If an agreement is not part of a third-party offer for purposes of the PMPA merely because it was not written into the formal agreement, this would provide an easy way to evade the requirements of \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Equilon counters that it later extended the side agreement to Aid, making the issue \u201cmoot\u201d or meritless. Equilon\u2019s decision to extend the side agreement came too late. Equilon must tender an ROFR \u201cduring the 90-day period after\u201d the notice of nonrenewal sent pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(D)(iii). Equilon sent Aid the notice of nonrenewal on September 8, 2009. It extended the side agreement to Aid on January 13, 2010. January 13 is more than 90 days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>September 8, 2009, rendering its attempt to cure the ROFR defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">4. <em>Reversal of the Award of Expert Fees </em>\u2014 We reverse the award of expert fees in both the <em>Armaswalker </em>and the <em>Aid </em>cases. The district court found that the Franchisees\u2019 actions were \u201cfrivolous\u201d pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(d)(3) and so awarded expert fees to Equilon. The Franchisees appeal from the district court\u2019s award of expert fees. Because the Franchisees have \u201craised [several] question[s] that [were] not answered clearly by our precedent,\u201d <em>Gibson v. Office of Attorney Gen., State of Cal., </em>561 F.3d 920, 929 (9th Cir.2009), we reverse the awards in both <em>Aid </em>and <em>Armaswalker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
