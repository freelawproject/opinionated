R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b873-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-24\">Yamin Tedja, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chawla v. Holder, </em>599 F.3d 998, 1001 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Tedja established changed circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Tedja\u2019s claim for withholding of removal on the basis of his Chinese ethnicity and Christian religion also fails. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Tedja has not demonstrated the harms he experienced in Indonesia rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2009) (beatings, robbery, and threats by mob did not compel a past persecution finding). Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Tedja did not show it is more likely than not he will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (continued presence of similarly situated, unharmed family members undermined future fear).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Finally, Tedja does not raise any arguments in his opening brief regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b873-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
