Ercole, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the claims in Ercole\u2019s third amended complaint, which were brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 <em>et seq., </em>the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301 <em>et seq., </em>the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution, the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et seq., </em>and Article 15 of the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 290-301. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-23\">This Court reviews <em>\u201cde novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). To avoid dismissal, the complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). While <em>pro se </em>complaints must contain sufficient factual allegations to meet the plausibility standard, a court should look for such allegations by reading <em>pro se </em>complaints with \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d and interpreting them to raise the \u201cstrongest arguments that they <em>suggest.\u201d Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Having conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its order dated March 29, 2011, which also incorporated, in part, the district court\u2019s orders dated September 10, 2008, and March 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We have considered all of Ercole\u2019s remaining arguments,- including his arguments that the district court should have allowed discovery, and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
