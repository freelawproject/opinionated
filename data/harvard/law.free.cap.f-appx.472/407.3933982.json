U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (b)(1), (c)(3) (2005). Coverson\u2019s total offense level of 36 combined with his criminal history category of V yielded an imprisonment range of 292 to 365 months. The court sentenced Coverson in the middle of that range to 328 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">In 2007 the Sentencing Commission retroactively lowered the base offense levels for crack offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713. The following year Coverson moved for a reduced sentence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a revised imprisonment range of 235 to 293 months. His appointed lawyer requested a full re-sentencing and a prison term at or below the low end of that range. In August 2011 the district court lowered Coverson\u2019s sentence to 264 months (the middle of the new range) but rejected his request for a full resentencing. Coverson filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Meanwhile, as Coverson pursued this appeal, his lawyer filed a second motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in November 2011. This time he relied on Amendments 748, 750, and 759, which, effective that month, had retroactively implemented the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372, by further reducing the base offense level for crimes involving crack, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 748, 750, 759. In December the district court granted the motion and reduced Cover-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>son\u2019s sentence to 211 months. This term falls in the middle of the revised imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months, and is well below the minimum of the range generated by his first motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Coverson did not file a notice of appeal to challenge the outcome of his second motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), nor has he mentioned the further reduction in sentence in this appeal from the first reduction in August 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Coverson\u2019s lawyer asserts that this appeal is frivolous and seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). But because there is no right to appointed counsel in a proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>see United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585, 590 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>178 F.3d 946, 949 (7th Cir.1999), counsel need not have complied-with the <em>Anders </em>safeguards before moving to withdraw, <em>see Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 554-55, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987); <em>DiAngelo v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Aid, </em>891 F.2d 1260, 1262 (7th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, we invited Coverson to respond to his attorney\u2019s motion, and he has done so. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> Coverson argues that, when his sentence was reduced the first time, the district court should have conducted a full resentencing and better explained its evaluation of the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Yet \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes \u201conly a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>611 F.3d 399, 401 (7th Cir.2010). And Coverson\u2019s argument concerning \u00a7 3553(a) became moot when his sentence was reduced again, to 211 months, in December 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
