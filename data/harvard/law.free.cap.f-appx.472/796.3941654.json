Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.G. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Adedje does not challenge the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding the IJ reasonably refused to entertain a previously withdrawn asylum application that contained incorrect information. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Adedje\u2019s request to remand on the basis of his claimed marriage because Adedje did not provide documentary evidence of the marriage. <em>See Malhi </em>336 F.3d at 994 (applicant \u201cmust offer evidence that is probative of the motivation for marriage, not just the bare fact of getting married\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Adedje\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance by former attorneys and another individual, as well as his due process claims regarding the IJ\u2019s conduct at his individual hearing, because he failed to raise these issues to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (no jurisdiction over claims not presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
