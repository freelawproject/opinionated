We conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination on instructional error was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We also conclude that the California Court of Appeal erroneously determined that no sentencing error had occurred, but the court\u2019s error was harmless because the jury would have found one aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">The California courts did not err, let alone unreasonably, in concluding that Beamon had not established the basis for a duress defense. Beamon failed to provide any evidence that a reasonable person would fear his life was in <em>immediate </em>danger as required for an instruction on duress. CALCRIM No. 4.40 (emphasis added). Under California law, threats and fear of <em>future danger </em>are not sufficient to warrant an instruction on duress. <em>Id. </em>Beamon only provided testimony of vague, future threats of harm. Given that Beam-on played an active role in the robbery, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on duress did not \u201chave a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Fry v. Pliler, </em>551 U.S. 112, 116, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 163 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007) (quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the evidence required to establish a duress defense is a matter of state law and a state court\u2019s holding on state law binds a federal court on habeas review. <em>Brad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>shaw v. Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 76, 126 S.Ct. 602, 168 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that no sentencing error occurred was contrary to federal law. <em>See Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 288-98, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007); <em>see also Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On habeas review, state court errors are subject to harmless error analysis, however. <em>See Butler v. Curry, </em>528 F.3d 624, 648 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We must find the sentencing error harmless unless we have \u201cgrave doubt\u201d that a jury would have found one aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>The failure to submit the elements of the aggravating factors to the jury was ultimately harmless because the jury would almost certainly have found that the threat of great bodily harm existed beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>Many victims present during the armed robbery had a gun pointed at their heads, and a security guard fired a shot into the interior of the bank as the robbers were fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Accordingly, the district court correctly denied federal habeas relief. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
