We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Chawla v. Holder, </em>599 F.3d 998, 1001 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">The IJ found Tegeneghe failed to provide any country conditions evidence that shows individuals who are half-Ethiopian are persecuted in Eritrea. This is belied by the record; for' example, the record includes a report from Amnesty International specifically addressing persecution of such individuals. In addition, substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s conclusion that Tegeneghe\u2019s half-Ethiopian ethnicity was not \u201cat least one central reason\u201d for the harms he experienced.. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>cf. Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 742 (9th Cir.2009) (concluding \u201cthat the utterance of an ethnic slur, standing alone,\u201d does not constitute one central reason for an attack). Accordingly, we grant the petition with respect to Tegeneghe\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">In light of our above conclusions we also remand Tegeneghe\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 937 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b875-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
