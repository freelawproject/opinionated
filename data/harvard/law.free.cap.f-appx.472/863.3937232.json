GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Andrew Rutherford filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking relief from his conviction for conspiring to traffic marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. The district court denied his petition, and he now asks us to issue a certificate of appealability (COA) to allow him to contest that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">We may grant a COA only if Mr. Rutherford makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Under this standard, an applicant must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation omitted). Because Mr. Rutherford proceeds in this court <em>pro se, </em>we review his pleadings with special solicitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\"> Even by this forgiving standard we cannot grant a COA, because binding precedent forecloses all of Mr. Rutherford\u2019s claims. The bulk of the petition is devoted to arguing that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 exceed the federal government\u2019s constitutional authority. But we have already held that these statutes fall within Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Price, </em>265 F.3d 1097, 1106-07 (10th Cir. 2001). Mr. Rutherford argues that these laws violate the Tenth Amendment, which he says \u201creserved\u201d for the states the power to punish drug cultivation. But ours is a system of dual sovereignty, and the existence of state regulatory authority doesn\u2019t preclude Congress from legislating in the same area so long as it stays within its enumerated powers. <em>See Abbate v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 187, 192-194, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959). Because \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 are valid exercises of the commerce power and regulate private parties as opposed to the states themselves, they do not contravene the Tenth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Hampshire, </em>95 F.3d 999, 1004 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">Mr. Rutherford\u2019s as-applied challenge fares no better. In his guilty plea colloquy he admitted to conspiring to ship drugs across state lines, conduct that plainly would fall within the federal government\u2019s authority to punish. <em>See Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 17-19, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">Mr. Rutherford\u2019s other claims fall along with his challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. His lawyers couldn\u2019t have been constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to statutes that are plainly valid. And his claim that the District of Kansas lacked jurisdiction to try his case likewise hinges on his assertion that the federal government had no business outlawing his drug operation. Finally, his argument that \u201cthe State of Kansas is not a \u2018state\u2019 under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d lacks any basis in law or logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">The request for a COA is denied, as is Mr. Rutherford\u2019s motion for leave to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b894-10\"> This order is <em>not </em>binding precedent <em>except </em>under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
