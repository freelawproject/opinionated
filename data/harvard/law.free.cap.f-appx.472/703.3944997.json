On de novo review, <em>Stanley v. Schriro, </em>598 F.3d 612, 617 (9th Cir.2010), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">Because Petitioner filed his petition after April 24, 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) of 1996 governs review of his claims. Under AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), our review is highly deferential. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 785, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). The California Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim summarily, so we must decide what theories could have supported the state court\u2019s decision and then ask whether fair-minded jurists could conclude that those theories followed applicable Supreme Court precedents. <em>Id. </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-27\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel obtained the assistance of three mental health experts, including one psychiatrist, whose qualifications are not in question. Counsel gave the experts some background materials, including a discharge summary from the Atascadero State Hospital and writings by Petitioner. Counsel succeeded in having Petitioner declared incompetent to stand trial and in having him committed for treatment for a significant period of time. Counsel also presented the mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>experts at the eventual trial, two of whom opined that Petitioner was not guilty of the crimes by reason of insanity. Nonetheless, Petitioner contends that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain and to give to the experts easily obtainable mental health records, thus enabling the prosecutor to argue that Petitioner was malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">On this record, the state court permissibly could conclude that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient, which is the first prong of the required analysis under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Petitioner points to cases such as <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 389-92, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005); <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 524-25, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003); and <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 395-97, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), finding deficient performance where trial counsel failed adequately to investigate their clients\u2019 mental health. But these cases are distinguishable on several grounds. First, all of them deal with capital sentencing. We are aware of no Supreme Court decision that has extended the same strict standard of investigation to the guilt phase of noncapital cases. Second, trial counsel in the present instance put forward a well-developed insanity defense whereas, in some of the cases to which Petitioner points us, the issue of mental illness was ignored or treated cavalierly. Third, we are aware of no Supreme Court opinion that places on trial counsel an affirmative duty to supply all potentially relevant material even when not requested by the retained experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Additionally, the state court permissibly could conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to obtain the records did not prejudice Petitioner, which is the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. This material is not entirely favorable to Petitioner\u2019s insanity defense. For example, the records reveal that, at age 14, Petitioner admitted to faking hallucinations in order to escape his group home. A discharge report from a San Antonio facility noted that Petitioner suffered from \u201c[n]o psychosis.\u201d The Alaska period of institutionalization resulted from a run-in with the law. Finally, the complete records from Atascadero include reports that Petitioner delayed taking steps to restore competency and that he said, \u201cI want to plead to whatever gives me the least time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">In summary, although trial counsel could have done more, we cannot conclude that the state court\u2019s decision failed to meet the standards of AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
