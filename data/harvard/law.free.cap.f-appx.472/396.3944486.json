BATCHELDER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">Appellant Richard A. Thompson is a diabetic who worked for Appellee UGL Unicco. After UGL fired him in 2008, Thompson sued UGL for, among other things, disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d), and the Tennessee Disability Act, Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-50-103 (\u201cTDA\u201d). At the close of discovery, UGL moved for summary judgment. Finding that Thompson had failed to show that he was \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA or the TDA, the district court granted UGL\u2019s motion. Thompson appealed, arguing that, with the facts construed in his favor, he had produced sufficient evidence to create a jury question over whether he was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">After carefully reviewing the district court\u2019s opinion, the briefs, and the record in this case, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to UGL. As the district court correctly set out the applicable law and correctly applied that law to the undisputed material facts contained in the record, issuance of a full written opinion by the court would serve no jurisprudential purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-20\">Accordingly, on the grounds stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
