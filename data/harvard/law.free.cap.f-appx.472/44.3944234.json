Horn, New York City Department of Investigation (\u201cDOI\u201d), DOI Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn, and the City of New York (jointly, the \u201cdefendants\u201d), and dismissing his national origin and religious discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the New York State Human Rights Law (\u201cNYSHRL\u201d), N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 290-97, and the New York City Human Rights Law (\u201cNYCHRL\u201d), N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107 <em>et seq., </em>as well as his First and Fourteenth Amendment claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cdrawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Paneccasio v. Unisource Worldwide, Inc., </em>532 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doninger v. Niehoff, </em>642 F.3d 334, 344 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Upon a review of the record and the arguments of counsel, we affirm the judgment of the District Court substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Block in his Memorandum and Order dated August 3, 2011. We have considered all of Abdelhadi\u2019s arguments on appeal and conclude that each of them is without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
