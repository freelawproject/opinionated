We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Lolli v. County of Orange, </em>351 F.3d 410, 414 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Butler\u2019s excessive force claim against defendant Manu because Butler failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Manu\u2019s use of force against him was not \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Lolli, </em>351 F.3d at 415 (discussing the legal standard applicable to excessive force claims brought by pretrial detainees).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">However, the district court improperly granted summary judgment on Butler\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">As to Butler\u2019s excessive force claim against defendant Ferreira, Butler stated in his declaration that Ferreira slammed and pressed him against a concrete wall while he was handcuffed and not actively resisting. These facts create a triable dispute as to whether Ferreira\u2019s use of force was objectively reasonable. <em>See Lolli, </em>351 F.3d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-18\">As to Butler\u2019s deliberate indifference claim against defendant Lopez, Butler stated in his declaration that he passed a kidney stone while in detention, and the episode continued for about four hours after he asked staff for help. Lopez stated in her declaration that she was aware that Butler complained of a kidney stone, and Butler\u2019s medical records show that although Butler had a history of kidney stones and requested pain medication, Lopez provided him no pain medication. These facts create a triable dispute as to whether Lopez was deliberately indifferent to Butler\u2019s kidney stone and related pain. <em>See id. </em>at 419 (standard for evaluating a claim of deliberate indifference to medical needs brought by a pretrial detainee).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-19\">As to Butler\u2019s conditions-of-confinement claim against defendants Anakalea and Lopez, the district court applied the wrong standard for determining the constitutionality of these conditions. <em>See Pierce v. County of Orange, </em>526 F.3d 1190, 1205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(9th Cir.2008) (setting forth the standard for determining whether conditions of pretrial detention are constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and explaining that this standard \u201cdiffers significantly\u201d from the standard applied to conditions of confinement claims brought by convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings on the excessive force claim against Ferreira and the deliberate indifference claim against Lopez. We also reverse and remand on the conditions-of-confinement claim against Anakalea and Lopez for the district court to apply the correct standard in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Butler\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
