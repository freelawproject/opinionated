We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-19\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including ... its assessment that the probative value of relevant evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, are reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>214 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">We do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the government to introduce evidence at trial relating to statements made by Chen\u2019s husband. The husband\u2019s statements showed how and why Chen\u2019s attitude changed from one of denial to admission of her guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Furthermore, we are unable to conclude that the district court improperly prevented Chen from cross-examining a government witness regarding his having been involved in a prior disciplinary investigation. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (\u201c[T]rial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
