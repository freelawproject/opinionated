He moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that his deportation could not serve as the basis for a \u00a7 1326 conviction because his deportation hearing did not comport with due process. In support of the motion, he submitted a declaration he wrote over four years after the deportation hearing \u2014 and after he was indicted \u2014 in which he alleged that he had had trouble understanding the deportation proceedings because his headset was faulty and that the Immigration Judge had \u201cbec[o]me angry\u201d with him during the proceedings. The district court found no due process violation and denied the motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Section 1326(d), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">[A]n alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order [underlying a \u00a7 1326 charge] ... unless the alien demonstrates that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">(3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">A removal order is fundamentally unfair if (1) defects in the underlying proceedings violated the alien\u2019s due process rights and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result. <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir.2004). A deportation proceeding violates due process if it prevents the deportee from knowingly and voluntarily waiving his rights. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe government bears the burden of proving valid waiver in a collateral attack of the underlying removal proceedings,\u201d but the defendant carries the overall burden to \u201cshow[ ]\u201d fundamental unfairness. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>623 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir.2010). We review <em>de novo </em>a claim that a defect in a prior removal proceeding precludes reliance on the final removal order in a subsequent \u00a7 1326 proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">The Immigration Judge considered but justifiably discounted the probative value of Delgado\u2019s declaration. The court-certified transcript of the deportation hearing provided a more reliable picture of what transpired - than Delgado\u2019s four-year-old memory. The transcript indicates almost no misunderstanding on the part of Delgado. Delgado cites to the three questions in a row in which the Immigration Judge asked him, \u201cAre you a citizen or national of the United States of America?\u201d to which Delgado responded, \u201cMexico\u201d or \u201cMexican\u201d instead of \u201cNo.\u201d But, contrary to Delgado\u2019s contention, the answers are sufficiently responsive to demonstrate his understanding. Delgado cites another question and answer. When asked whether he had any children who are permanent residents or citizens of the United States, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d even though he had a five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>month-old son at the time. Delgado\u2019s answer possibly reflects a failure to understand that question. But that is the sole interchange in the record that arguably evidences misunderstanding. Delgado\u2019s responsive answers to every other question the judge asked him indicate that he <em>did </em>understand the questions, including those, asking him whether he wished to appeal and to apply for voluntary departure. <em>Cf., e.g., Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 777-79 (9th Cir.2000) (due process violation where there were \u201cnumerous instances in which [the deporteej\u2019s answer [wa]s not responsive to the question he was asked,\u201d repeated expressions by the deportee that he did not understand the question, and evidence that the deportee <em>never </em>understood some questions, despite repeated questioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Nor did the Immigration Judge coerce Delgado into waiving his rights. The judge did express impatience with Delgado after the citizenship exchange (\u201cApparently Sir, you do not understand what it means to answer my question yes or no. Have a seat, Sir. If I get to your case at the end of today, we\u2019ll do it at the end of today, otherwise, I will do it around the 10th of October. Matter\u2019s trailed.\u201d). The judge resumed the proceeding later that day. Delgado points to no other instances of arguably intimidating behavior. An Immigration Judge does not violate due process simply by \u201casking tough questions or assuming an unfriendly manner.\u201d <em>Perez-Lastor, </em>208 F.3d at 782 n. 9; <em>see, e.g., Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir.2003). Here, the Immigration Judge\u2019s tone of irritation and his abrupt termination of the hearing amounted to nothing more than \u201can unfriendly manner.\u201d <em>Perez-Lastor, </em>208 F.3d at 782 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The government proved, through the transcript of Delgado\u2019s deportation hearing, that Delgado validly waived his rights to appeal and to apply for voluntary departure. Delgado\u2019s declaration did not rebut that showing. He thus failed to demonstrate that his deportation proceeding deprived him of due process and was \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d He cannot collaterally attack that proceeding now. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Delgado\u2019s other contentions \u2014 that the district court ignored his declaration, and that the court was required, <em>sua sponte, </em>to hold an evidentiary hearing \u2014 are merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b495-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
