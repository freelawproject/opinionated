The district court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, finding that Jackson had not exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to challenging the ruling on the deductions. The court further noted that Jackson\u2019s complaint was untimely in that it had not been filed within 60 days of the Appeals Council\u2019s favorable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Jackson appeals but his appellate brief does not address the district court\u2019s grounds for dismissal. Although Jackson asserts that the court\u2019s decision \u201cconstituted restraint on liberty activity,\u201d he does not explain how the court erred in concluding that dismissal was appropriate. And although we construe pro se filings liberally, even uncounselled litigants must present arguments supported by citations to the record and legal authority. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
