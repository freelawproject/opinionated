We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Cabrera-Sanchez contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because he presented new evidence of the requisite hardship-a psychologist\u2019s report that his oldest United States citizen daughter is experiencing psychological problems due to the removal proceedings, and evidence that the daughter is enrolled in a gifted students educational program-to support his application for cancellation relief. Cabrera-Sanchez further contends that the BIA violated his due process rights by applying the wrong hardship standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">To the extent we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, <em>see Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006), we conclude the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen based on new evidence of hardship because the BIA considered the evidence and acted within its broad discretion in determining the evidence was insufficient to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The record does not support petitioner\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard, and petitioner\u2019s due process claim does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. She <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
