We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">Federal law requires district court judges to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for [their] imposition of the particular sentence[s]\u201d they have chosen. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). \u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201c[W]e never have required a District Court to make specific responses to points argued by counsel in connection with sentencing.... Referring to Supreme Court precedent, we have held that the District Court must satisfy us only that it has considered the party\u2019s arguments and has articulated a reasonable basis for exercising its decision-making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>618 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">Here, while the district court judge was concise in explaining her reasons for arriving at the sentence she chose for VanegasGomez, we do not believe that she was required by federal law to say any more than she did. The district court judge stated: \u201cSo in considering all of the factors that [a court] must\u201d consider, including \u201cthe nature of the crime, the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>individual involved, the general deterrence factor, as well as the specific deterrence factor, I am not inclined to downwardly depart from the guidelines.\u201d The district court continued: \u201cI think a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range is appropriate and not excessive, and it does address the issues that we have in front of us, but I don\u2019t think anything below that is justified, and I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d In addition, the district court explicitly stated that it \u201cha[d] tried to give consideration to the arguments you\u2019ve made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The court also addressed Vanegas-Gomez\u2019s request for a reduced sentence on the basis that the delayed federal prosecution deprived him of an opportunity to receive a federal sentence that was concurrent with his state sentence. The court rejected the suggestion that the delay warranted a below-Guidelines-range sentence, but it stated that \u201cthat is one of the factors that persuades me that the bottom of the guideline range is appropriate.\u201d In sum, Vanegas-Gomez\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s explanation for Vanegas-Gomez\u2019s sentence was insufficient is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Nor, in light of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), do we believe that the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Vane-gas-Gomez, who had been deported after having been convicted on two separate occasions for molesting children, to around five years in prison for illegally re-entering the United States was substantively unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing as defined by federal law.); <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc) (\u201cWe will ... set aside a district court\u2019s <em>substantive </em>determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We have considered Vanegas-Gomez\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
