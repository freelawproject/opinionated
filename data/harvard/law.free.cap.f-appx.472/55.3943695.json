R.Civ.P. 60(b) for relief from the 1996 dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action challenging his 1995 state murder conviction. We review the denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion, <em>see Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, </em>561 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir.2009), and where, as here, a plaintiff proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we afford his submissions special solicitude, <em>see Sledge v. Kooi, </em>564 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir.2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We affirm the denial of Washington\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well reasoned order. <em>See Washington v. Hirsch, </em>No. 95-CV-2167 (JG)CLP), 2011 WL 4711879 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2011). As the district court concluded, Washington has failed to show that the motion, filed more than fifteen years after the challenged dismissal, was filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Fed R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Moreover, the district court correctly concluded that Washington has provided no basis for reopening under Rule 60(b), whether under any of the specific grounds provided in Rule 60(b)(1)-(5), or for extraordinary circumstances under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Washington\u2019s motion for \u201csummary judgment\u201d on the ground that Appellee failed to file a brief is denied. <em>See Chao v. Russell P. Le Frois Builder, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir.2002) (observing that sole sanction for failure to file appellee brief is inability to be heard at oral argument absent permission of court).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Washington also asks that this Court convert his motion for reconsideration into a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because a prior habeas corpus petition attacking Washington\u2019s conviction has already been filed and denied, <em>see Washington v. Walsh, </em>No. 01-CV-250 (JG), 2002 WL 2003207 (E.D.N.Y. Aug.1, 2002), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>No. 02-2694 (2d Cir. Feb. 28, 2003), a second habeas corpus petition would require leave to file from this Court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), and Washington has not met the criteria for such a second petition, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The order of the district court is AFFIRMED and Washington\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
