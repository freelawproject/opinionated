He appeals, arguing that his jury waiver was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent and that his statements were not \u201ctrue threats\u201d and are therefore protected speech. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the adequacy of a jury waiver. <em>United States v. Duarte-Higareda, </em>113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1997). Given the \u201csuspected presence of mental or emotional instability\u201d in a defendant, the district court is required \u201cto conduct an in-depth colloquy\u201d to assure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Id. </em>at 1003 (internal citation and quotations omitted). The record establishes that the district court\u2019s colloquy was sufficiently in-depth to assure that Heizelman\u2019s waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">If a defendant moves for acquittal at trial, we review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>420 F.3d 1007, 1014 (9th Cir.2005). If a party fails to make a timely assertion of rights, however, the right is forfeited and we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.1997). We must also determine whether the statement constitutes a true threat, unprotected by the First Amendment, <em>Stewart, </em>420 F.3d at 1015, which requires proof \u201cthat the speaker subjectively intended the speech as a threat,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1017 (internal citation and quotations omitted); <em>see United States v. Bagdasarian, </em>652 F.3d 1113, 1117 (9th Cir.2011) (subjective test \u201cmust be read into all threat statutes that criminalize pure speech\u201d). There was no error. The record contains sufficient evidence to establish the elements of the statutory violation, <em>see Stewart, </em>420 F.3d at 1015, and Heizelman\u2019s calls to the district court were \u201ctrue threats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
