Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010) (explaining that this court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s \u201cconclusion on the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (clarifying that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a resentencing, but rather permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the Sentencing Commission). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>No. 3:07-cr-00016-JPB-DJJ-1 (N.D.W.Va. Nov. 1, 2011). We deny Stewart\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
