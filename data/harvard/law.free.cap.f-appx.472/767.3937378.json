We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Rahman testified inconsistently regarding whether she learned she was charged with a crime before she fled Bangladesh and omitted from her asylum application that her brother was arrested and interrogated when police came to her home to look for her. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043. In the absence of credible testimony, Rahman\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Because Rahman\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and Rahman does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not she would be tortured if returned to Bangladesh, her CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b797-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
