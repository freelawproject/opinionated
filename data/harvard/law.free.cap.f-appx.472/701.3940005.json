We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The agency properly deemed Quintanar-Olivera\u2019s application for adjustment of status abandoned after he failed to file the application by the deadline set by the IJ. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c) (authorizing IJ to set filing deadlines and deem waived any application not filed by the deadline).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The IJ did not err by issuing a decision without a further hearing. Both the IJ and BIA granted Quintanar-Olivera\u2019s request for voluntary departure, and there was no need for the IJ to rule on Quintanar-Olivera\u2019s motion to suppress because it was relevant only to his eligibility for the abandoned application.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
