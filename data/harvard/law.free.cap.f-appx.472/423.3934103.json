Blea (\u201cBlea\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his conviction for aggravated murder, in violation of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.095, and robbery in the first degree, in violation of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 164.415. Blea claims that the advice provided by his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate, thereby rendering his guilty plea to aggravated murder unknowing and involuntary. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-20\">The Oregon state court\u2019s rejection of Blea\u2019s claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, and was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). According to Blea, his counsel failed to explain that aggravated murder requires intent to kill the victim and, further, that if he lacked such intent, he could only be convicted of felony murder (a lesser-included offense). But Blea\u2019s self-serving statements during post-conviction proceedings cannot overcome his admissions before the trial court and in his Plea Petition to the contrary, including that he understood the charges against him and that he had \u201cpersonally and intentionally caused the death\u201d of the victim. <em>See Womack v. Del Papa, </em>497 F.3d 998, 1004 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cSolemn declarations in open court carry , a strong presumption of verity.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b453-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
