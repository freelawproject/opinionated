R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b602-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-24\">Iwan Susanto, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-25\">Susanto does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that his asylum application was time-barred. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed waived). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-26\">Similarly, Susanto has not raised any argument challenging the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, his CAT claim also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-27\">With respect to withholding of removal, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Susanto\u2019s experiences in Indonesia did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, the record does not compel the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Buddhists in Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1061. However, in assessing Susanto\u2019s risk of future persecution, the agency did not have the benefit of our opinion in <em>Wakkary. </em>Accordingly, we grant the petition with respect to Susanto\u2019s withholding of removal claim, and we remand for the agency to consider it under a disfavored group analysis. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The government shall bear the costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW IS DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
