We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen because it considered the record and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. <em>See Mendez-Gutierrez v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Gomes v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1264, 1267 (9th Cir.2005) (prior relocation was evidence that petitioners could again relocate).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">Singh\u2019s contention that the agency failed to consider how his new evidence related to a future fear of persecution is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
