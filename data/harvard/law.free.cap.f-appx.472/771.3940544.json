Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Franklin\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided Franklin the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Franklin waived his right to appeal his sentence with the exception of the court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history category and the imposition of conditions of supervised release. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief as to Franklin\u2019s conviction and indicates that the appeal waiver is operative. Accordingly, we affirm Franklin\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of the sentence in part. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000). With regard to the court\u2019s calculation of the criminal history category and its imposition of conditions of supervised release, our independent review of the record discloses no arguable grounds for relief on direct appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The conviction is AFFIRMED, and the appeal of the sentence is DISMISSED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
