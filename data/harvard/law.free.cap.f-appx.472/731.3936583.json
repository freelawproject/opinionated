Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Robleto-Pastora v. Holder, </em>591 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2010), and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kaptyug did not qualify for withholding of removal because he failed to establish a clear probability of persecution on account of his religion. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1016; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">The IJ correctly determined that Kaptyug was ineligible to adjust his status. Kaptyug had previously adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) and therefore cannot \u201cre-adjust\u201d his status to that of an LPR under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159, to avoid removal. <em>See Robleto-Pastora, </em>591 F.3d at 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Kaptyug\u2019s asylum, cancellation of removal and CAT claims because he failed to exhaust his challenges to the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he is ineligible for these forms of relief due to his prior criminal convictions. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
