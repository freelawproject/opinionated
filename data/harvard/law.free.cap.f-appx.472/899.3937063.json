We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">In September 2009, Moyo pleaded guilty to distributing and possessing with intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Because Moyo was responsible 49.5 grams of crack cocaine and was a career offender, his presentence investigation report provided an offense level of 34, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) (Nov.2008), and then reduced that level by three points for Moyo\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history category of VI, the report provided an advisory guideline range between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-19\">At Moyo\u2019s sentencing hearing, the parties agreed that Moyo should be sentenced as if his offense involved powder cocaine, which would lower Moyo\u2019s total offense level to 29 and subject him to a guideline range between 151 .and 188 months of imprisonment. The district court accepted the recommendation to apply the lower offense level and sentenced Moyo to 151 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">On November 8, 2011, Moyo moved to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moyo argued that he was entitled to a two-level reduction of his offense level under unspecified \u201camendments\u201d to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 that altered the offense levels in Section 2D1.1 applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Moyo argued that he had not received the full benefit intended by the Act and that the Act \u201cshould ... apply to career offenders that are charged with cocaine an[d]/or crack offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">The district court denied Moyo\u2019s motion to reduce. The district court ruled that \u201cUSSG \u00a7 1B1.1 only allows a reduction for Amendment 750 where the original sentence was derived from USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 and not the career offender provision, USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">Moyo argues, for the first time on appeal, that he was entitled to a reduction of sentence under Amendment 706, but that provision, which became effective in November 2007, was not a \u201csubsequent\u201d amendment under section 3582(c)(2). The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">The denial of Moyo\u2019s motion to reduce is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
