Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that the removability finding rested on an erroneous determination that a particular criminal conviction constituted an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as that term is used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Whether an offense is an aggravated felony is a question of law over which we have jurisdiction. <em>Morales-Alegria v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir.2006). In light of new evidence not considered by the BIA, we now remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">1. In denying Petitioner\u2019s appeal, the BIA considered a record containing an original sentencing order and an amended sentencing order that was entered nunc pro tunc for the same conviction. Respondent asked us to take judicial notice of a <em>second </em>amended sentencing order, entered nunc pro tunc for the same conviction underlying the other two sentencing orders. Petitioner did not oppose judicial notice, and we took notice of the second amended sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The second amended sentencing order is not part of the administrative record. Our review is generally \u201cconfined to the administrative record before the BIA.\u201d <em>Dent v. Holder, </em>627 F.3d 365, 371 (9th Cir.2010). Thus, having taken notice of the latest sentencing order, we now remand to the BIA to consider, in the first instance, that order\u2019s effect on Petitioner\u2019s arguments. <em>See Fregozo v. Holder, </em>576 F.3d 1030, 1039 (9th Cir.2009) (remanding to BIA where all relevant evidence had not been presented to the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">2. Respondent\u2019s arguments in favor of dismissal are unpersuasive. The second amended sentencing order is not a change of circumstances that would moot this case; it is merely new evidence that has yet to be considered by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
