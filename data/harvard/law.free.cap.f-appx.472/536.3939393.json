We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, and we review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the incidents of harassment and discrimination experienced by petitioners do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003) (record did not compel finding that Ukrainian Pentecostal Christian who was \u201cteased, bothered, discriminated against and harassed\u201d suffered from past persecution); <em>Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2003) (lifetime of harassment, threats, and mistreatment including one beating did not compel finding of past persecution). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even under a disfavored group analysis, petitioners have not shown sufficient individualized risk to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 977-79 (9th Cir. 2009) (ethnic Chinese Indonesian failed to establish he was individually targeted or likely to be individually targeted); <em>cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
