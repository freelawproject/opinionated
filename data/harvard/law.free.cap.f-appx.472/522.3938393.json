We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We review the denial of Hager\u2019s habeas petition <em>de novo. Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Solis v. Garcia, </em>219 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2000). To receive habeas relief, Hager must show the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). He cannot carry this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Hager has not shown his guilty plea was involuntary. Plea agreements are contractual in nature, and we enforce unambiguous plea agreements according to their terms. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>218 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). Hag-er\u2019s plea agreement allowed the maximum sentence. Preliminary comments by the trial judge cannot reasonably be viewed as a promise of a lighter sentence. <em>See id. </em>This is especially true when neither counsel nor Hager indicated any understanding of such a promise during the plea colloquy. Instead, Hager acknowledged that the maximum sentence was possible and that there were no other agreements concerning his sentence. These \u201c[sjolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Second, Hager has not shown th\u00e1t he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. There is \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We are particularly cautious about second-guessing counsel when a plea is entered. <em>See Premo v. Moore, </em>- U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 733, 745, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). Here, Hager\u2019s counsel advised Hager to sign a plea agreement that reflected the parties\u2019 understanding about the possible sentence range and benefitted Hager by shielding him from further charges. Hager\u2019s counsel pursued a mitigation strategy that focused on contriteness rather than character. Hager\u2019s counsel could not effectively object to the probation report when its supposed problems were unsubstantiated, implausible, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
