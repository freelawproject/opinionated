R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b464-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">Marcelo Gonzalez-Lopez appeals his conviction following a conditional guilty plea for attempted reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the case history, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Gonzalez-Lopez argues that the government\u2019s failure to advise him of his due process right to counsel in a language he could understand invalidated the removal order that was the basis of the \u00a7 1326 conviction. The district court denied his motion to dismiss the \u00a7 1326 indictment after finding that Gonzalez-Lopez could not demonstrate a plausible claim of prejudice resulting from these due process violations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Prejudice cannot be presumed from a failure to adequately inform an alien of his right to counsel when the alien is an aggravated felon. <em>United States v. Reyes-Bonilla, </em>671 F.3d 1036, 1049 (9th Cir.2012). Because he was incarcerated in state prison for more than a year for a robbery conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 211, Gonzalez-Lopez is considered an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(f). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(f) (defining an aggravated felony as \u201ca crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year\u201d), <em>United States v. McDougherty, </em>920 F.2d 569, 573 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that \u201crobbery under California law is ... by definition a crime of violence\"). Therefore, the district court correctly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Gonzalez-Lopez alternatively argues that the conviction documents relied upon to establish his aggravated felony conviction were improperly certified and could have been challenged by competent counsel. However, he presents no evidence to cast doubt upon the authenticity of the certified abstract of judgment in the file. Nor did he submit any evidence contrary to the facts disclosed in the abstract. The certified abstract describes the criminal charge, discloses the fact of conviction, and reflects the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Under the standards applicable to evidence admitted in immigration proceedings, Gonzalez-Lopez was not denied his due process rights. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 823 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c \u2018[T]he sole test for admission of evidence [in immigration proceedings] is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b464-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
