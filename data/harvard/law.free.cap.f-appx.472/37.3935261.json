LOHIER, JR., Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Petitioner Yuanzhe Piao, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of a March 9, 2011, order of the BIA affirming the March 9, 2009, decision of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yuanzhe Piao, </em>No. A088 524 661 (B.I.A. Mar. 9, 2011), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A088 524 661 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 9, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also, e.g., Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">Although Piao challenges the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application as untimely, we do not address the issue because the agency\u2019s alternative basis for the denial of asylum, the adverse credibility determination, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">The agency concluded that Piao was not credible based on inconsistencies in his testimony and his asylum applications. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>For asylum applications, such as this one, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Piao\u2019s asylum application stated that when he was beaten he suffered a nose bleed and some bruises, while his testimony about the event added the detail that he passed out after being beaten. Piao challenges the agency\u2019s conclusion, <em>inter alia, </em>that his failure to mention that he passed out was an omission which undermined his credibility. In support of this argument, Piao relies on <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003), a pre-REAL ID Act case which cautioned against basing adverse credibility determinations on the omission of information from an asylum application because an application is not expected to constitute \u201ca perfectly complete and comprehensive recitation of an applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>Secaida-Rosales\u2019s </em>holding, \u201cthat an IJ may not base an adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies and omissions that are \u2018collateral or ancillary\u2019 to an applicant\u2019s claims,\u201d was abrogated by the REAL ID Act under which \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission, as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (emphasis in original; quoting <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). The REAL ID Act, however, does not alter whether something <em>is </em>an inconsistency or omission. Accordingly, we consider whether Piao \u201cwould have been expected to mention [that he passed out] in his asylum application.\u201d <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). While generally asylum applications are not expected to provide details about every incident, we defer to the IJ\u2019s implicit conclusion that Piao was expected to provide the detail that he passed out because he provided other details about the beating he received. Thus, the agency reasonably concluded that Piao\u2019s failure to mention this detail, in the circumstances of this case as a whole, was an omission undermining his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was additionally supported by Piao\u2019s inconsistent statements about when he entered the United States. As the IJ noted, while Piao testified that he entered the United States in July 2006, his asylum applications also stated that he entered in June or May 2006. Piao did not attempt to explain why he stated that he entered in June 2006 and now argues that he <em>may </em>have given an explanation for his statement that he entered in May 2006 during the hearing, but that the explanation was lost due to a transcription error. He further argues that this transcription error has resulted in a denial of due process. This argument is unavailing because he does not now identify what that missing explanation was and thus has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced. <em>See Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir.2008) (an alien alleging a due process violation must demonstrate \u201ccognizable prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The adverse credibility determination was further supported by Piao\u2019s inconsistent statements about when he lost his factory position. He testified and noted in the written statement in support of his application that he lost his position in No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>vember 2005, but in the employment history section of his application indicated that he worked at the factory until 2006. Piao\u2019s argument that the agency erred in relying on this inconsistency because it was minor is unavailing because under the REAL ID Act the agency may rely on any inconsistency. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Together, these inconsistencies provide substantial evidence for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because Piao\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief all rely on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination forecloses all relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
