We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen, and review de novo questions of law. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny both petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider where they failed to identify any error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order concluding that petitioners\u2019 June 19, 2006, motion to reopen was properly denied as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in rejecting petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim where they failed to comply with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and the ineffective assistance they alleged was not plain on the face of the record. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir.2004). Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated due process by disregarding their evidence of ineffective assistance therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The agency correctly concluded that the IJ lacked jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 October 19, 2007, motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (the IJ may reopen a case \u201cunless jurisdiction is vested with the [BIA]\u201d); <em>In re C-W-L.-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 351 (BIA 2007) (jurisdiction over a motion to reopen lies with the BIA when it was the last body to render a decision in the case). In light of the foregoing, petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ violated due process by failing to consider the merits of their motion is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 January 23, 2008, motion to reopen as untimely where, even assuming petitioners were entitled to equitable tolling, they filed them motion more than 90 days after meeting with present counsel and learning of the alleged ineffectiveness of their prior attorneys. <em>See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir.2007) (under equitable tolling doctrine, statutory filing period begins once' a petitioner \u201cdefinitively learns\u201d of her claim). Given its dispositive untimeliness determination, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by declining to address the merits of petitioners\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b743-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
