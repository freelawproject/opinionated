Health Net removed to federal court. Health Net\u2019s notice of removal sufficiently alleged that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)\u2019s jurisdictional requirements were met. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a). After removal, Janis moved to remand to state court, arguing that Health Net had not proved that \u00a7 1332(d)\u2019s requirements were satisfied. Health Net opposed the motion. It submitted evidence to prove that \u00a7 1332(d)\u2019s requirements were more likely than not met. <em>See Lowdermilk v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>479 F.3d 994, 998 (9th Cir.2007). The district court refused to consider Health Net\u2019s evidence because Health Net did not submit the evidence at the time it filed its notice of removal. The district court ordered the case remanded to state court. We granted Health Net\u2019s petition for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">Nothing in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446 requires a removing defendant to attach evidence of the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction to its notice of removal. Section 1446(a) requires merely a \u201cshort and plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d Moreover, we have observed that \u201cit is clearly appropriate for the district courts, in their discretion, to accept certain post-removal [evidence] as determinative of the [jurisdictional requirements].\u201d <em>Abrego Abrego v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>443 F.3d 676, 690-91 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>see Singer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>116 F.3d 373, 377 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe district court may consider whether it is \u2018facially apparent\u2019 from the complaint that the jurisdictional amount is in controversy. If not, the court may consider facts in the removal petition, and may \u2018require parties to submit summary-judgment-type evidence relevant to the amount in controversy at the time of removal.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Allen v. R &amp; H Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>63 F.3d 1326, 1336 (5th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">The district court erred as a matter of law and thus abused its discretion in refus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ing to consider Health Net\u2019s evidence. The only grounds for its refusal were that Health Net submitted the evidence after it filed its notice of removal and that the evidence was from Health Net itself rather than an admission by Janis. Neither is a valid reason for ignoring Health Net\u2019s evidence. Moreover, the district court\u2019s decision prejudiced Health Net. The evidence appears to establish that \u00a7 1332(d)\u2019s requirements were met. <em>See Orr v. Bank of Am., NT &amp; SA, </em>285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir.2002) (under abuse-of-discretion standard, \u201c[w]e must affirm the district court unless its evidentiary ruling was manifestly erroneous <em>and </em>prejudicial\u201d); <em>c.f. Abrego, </em>443 F.3d at 691 (\u201c \u2018trial court\u2019s refusal to grant [jurisdictional] discovery\u2019 \u201d should be reversed if \u201c \u2018the dismissal resulted in actual and substantial prejudice to the litigant\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., </em>556 F.2d 406, 430 n. 24 (9th Cir.1977)) (alteration in <em>Abrego).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We reverse the district court\u2019s order remanding the case to state court, and we remand with instructions for the district court to consider the jurisdictional evidence Health Net submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
