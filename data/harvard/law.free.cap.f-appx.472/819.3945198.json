R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b849-17\">MEMORANDUM.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">We affirm the conviction of Alex TorresIbarra (\u201cTorres\u201d) for twenty-one charges of Aiding and Abetting False Statements During Purchase of Firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 2(a), and one count of Engaging in the Business of Dealing Firearms without a License, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(1)(A) and 924(a)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">The district court had jurisdiction over violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 922(a)(1)(A), whether or not an interstate commerce nexus is alleged or included in the text of the statute. <em>See Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 17, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005); <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 833, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974). In addition, the interstate commerce nexus is not an element required to be charged for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Redus, </em>469 F.2d 185, 187-88 (9th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">The clear and detailed statutory and regulatory requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) are not unconstitutionally vague. <em>See United States v. Jae Gab Kim, </em>449 F.3d 933, 942 (9th Cir.2006). These requirements apply to the false representations Torres aided and abetted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">The indictment sufficiently alleged aiding and abetting, because this charge is embedded in every federal crime. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>400 F.3d 816, 820 (9th Cir.2005). Even assuming any deficiency, Torres has not shown that he was prejudiced, because he was fairly informed of the charges against him. <em>Hagner v. United States, </em>285 U.S. 427, 431-32, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-25\">There was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support Torres\u2019 convictions for aiding and abetting, <em>id. </em>at 431, 52 S.Ct. 417, because 1) Torres was the one who took the \u201corders\u201d for the firearm purchases, believing that the ultimate purchaser could not buy firearms himself because he was not a United States citizen; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>2) Torres contacted his cousin and directed him to purchase certain types and quantities of firearms, because Torres believed he was prohibited from purchasing firearms due to an outstanding arrest warrant; 3) after Torres\u2019 cousin purchased the firearms, Torres then provided the firearms to the ultimate purchaser and gave a \u201ccut\u201d of his profits to his cousin; and 4) Torres admitted that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and it was his fault for getting his cousin involved in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d <em>United States v. Nevils, </em>598 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc), the district court did not err by concluding that, since Torres was the one who directed his cousin\u2019s activities and told his cousin how to go about purchasing the firearms, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that Torres aided and abetted his cousin. Furthermore, the evidence demonstrates that Torres knew that the identity of the purchaser was important for the purchase of a firearm, and that a misrepresentation of identity was necessary for his cousin to purchase the firearms on Torres\u2019 behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b849-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
