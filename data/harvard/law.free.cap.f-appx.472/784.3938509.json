We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-45 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on He\u2019s evasive, inconsistent, and implausible account of how she obtained her passport. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir.2007) (claimed fear of authorities implausible where petitioner interacted with them and drew attention to himself); <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1257-58 (9th Cir.2003) (adverse credibility finding supported by evasive testimony and by inconsistencies including how petitioner obtained notarial certificate from county he claimed to have fled). Further, He\u2019s explanation of why she went to the public security bureau to obtain the passport does not compel an opposite result. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, He\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because He\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same statements that the agency found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the finding that it is more likely than not He would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to China. <em>See id </em>at 1156-57. Accordingly, He\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b814-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
