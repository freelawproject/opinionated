We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 931 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if petitioner credibly demonstrated past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner could reasonably relocate within India, including the Punjab, to avoid harm. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>see also Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum claim fails. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-23\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Zheng v. Holder, </em>644 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b750-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
