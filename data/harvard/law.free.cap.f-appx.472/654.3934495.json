Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Sanchez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided the appellant with the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief on direct appeal with respect to either of Sanchez\u2019s convictions, or the 180-month sentence imposed for being a felon in possession of a firearm. We dismiss Sanchez\u2019s appeal of the 180-month sentence imposed for bank robbery in light of the valid appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">Sanchez\u2019s convictions and the sentence imposed for being a felon in possession of a firearm are AFFIRMED. Sanchez\u2019s appeal of the sentence imposed for bank robbery is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b685-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
