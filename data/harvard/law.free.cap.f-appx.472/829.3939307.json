Despite his assertions to the contrary, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings and affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Morrison\u2019s motion for acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d 962, 971 n. 8 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>357 F.3d 980, 983 (9th Cir.2004). We examine \u201cthe ruling in the light most favorable to the Government and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>357 F.3d at 983 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThere is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if, \u2018viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d at 971 n. 8 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-25\">Morrison admitted that he was aware of his obligation to update his registration under SORNA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>termination that he knew that he was required to notify the authorities when he left the Hardin shelter at the end of February was reasonably drawn from evidence that: (a) Morrison notified the Big Horn County Sheriffs Office when he moved to the Hardin shelter because of lack of power at his residence two miles east of Busby; (b) his stay at the shelter lasted weeks, not days; (3) Morrison left the shelter because his sister came for him; (4) the power was not restored at his residence two miles east of Busby; (5) Morrison represented that he notified the Sheriffs Office when he left the Hardin shelter, but there is no record of such a notification; and (6) Morrison\u2019s credibility was undermined by such evidence as his admission that he lied to the low-income housing energy assistance program and his letter to Morris concerning his testimony at Morrison\u2019s trial. Because the district court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, Morrison\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-18\">.

At oral argument, Morrison\u2019s counsel for the first time asserted that under Mont. Code \u00a7 46-23-502(7)(b) a homeless shelter is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>considered a residence. Because counsel\u2019s argument based on this statute was not raised in the district court, or in the briefs, it is considered waived. See <em>Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999). We note, however, that Morrison was convicted for failing to register under SORNA, a federal statute, and that the Montana Code has a separate provision requiring transients to register and may require the transient \u201cto provide the locations where the transient stayed during the previous 30 days and may stay during the next 30 days.\u2019\u2019 Mont.Code \u00a7 46-23-504(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
