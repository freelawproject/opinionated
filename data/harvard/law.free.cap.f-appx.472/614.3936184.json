She contends that the remand should have been solely for computation of benefits. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">A district court\u2019s decision whether a remand should be for further proceedings or for a calculation of benefits is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000). Remand for a computation of benefits is not appropriate unless the record proves that the claimant is in fact disabled. <em>Strauss v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. See. Admin., </em>635 F.3d 1135, 1138 (9th Cir.2011). While the length of the proceedings here is regrettable, there are outstanding issues to be determined on remand before a finding can be made that Garcia was disabled for the relevant period. The vocational expert presented evidence that there were jobs in the regional economy that Garcia could perform, but the expert\u2019s testimony conflicted with the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d). The district judge did not abuse his discretion because further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the vocational expert can present a reasonable explanation for the conflict with the DOT. <em>See Massachi v. Astrue, </em>486 F.3d 1149, 1152-53 (9th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. For similar reasons, we also reject Garcia's argument that the district court abused its discretion in not applying the credit-as-true doctrine to her expert witness\u2019s testimony. In cases, as here, where there are outstanding issues to be determined on remand before a finding of disability can be made, application of the credit-as-true rule is discretionary, <em>see Vasquez </em>v. <em>Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 586, 593 (9th Cir.2009), and can be overturned only by the district court abusing its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
