We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003), and we grant the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-24\">The agency found that, even if Silaban suffered persecution in the past, there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Indonesia such that he no longer has a clear probability of persecution. Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s finding. <em>See Mutuku v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir.2010) (agency \u201cmust provide an individualized analysis of how changed conditions will affect the specific petitioner\u2019s situation\u201d and country reports did not support changed circumstances finding). In addition, in assessing Silaban\u2019s fear of future persecution, the agency did not have the benefit of our decisions in <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1064-65 (9th Cir.2009) and <em>Tampubolon v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 1056, 1062 (9th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for the BIA to assess Silaban\u2019s withholding of removal claim under the disfavored group analysis in the first instance. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067; <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b807-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
