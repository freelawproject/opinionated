She argues that the administrative law judge erred by ignoring the opinion of her treating psychiatrist. We disagree. While the ALJ does not mention the treating psychiatrist by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>name, he repeatedly cites and discusses the psychiatrist\u2019s medical reports. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Epps\u2019s \u201csymptoms appear to be adequately controlled with prescribed treatment\u201d is based upon and consistent with the treating psychiatrist\u2019s treatment records. Thus, the ALJ did not reject the treating physician\u2019s ultimate conclusions. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence in the whole record supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Epps also argues that the ALJ did not adequately analyze and present to the vocational expert limitations deriving from Epps\u2019s mental impairments. To the extent the ALJ erred, such error was harmless. <em>See Curry v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir.1990). Although the ALJ did not present Epps\u2019s alleged mental impairments to the vocational expert, all the jobs identified by the expert were unskilled and therefore consistent with Epps\u2019s residual functional capacity. Based on her psychiatrist\u2019s conclusions, her mental impairments would not affect the vocational expert\u2019s conclusion, because they were well controlled by medication. Thus, no reasonable ALJ could have concluded that Epps could not perform the jobs identified by the vocational expert. See <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r, </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1055-56 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b680-23\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
