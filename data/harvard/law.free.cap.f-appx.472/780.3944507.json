We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Wan established changed circumstances to excuse the delay in filing her asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-658 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, her asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">With respect to Wan\u2019s withholding of removal claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Wan failed to establish past persecution where police detained, questioned, and hit her once, and where she was subsequently fired from her job and required to report to the police. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that the fact petitioner was fired from her job because of her religious beliefs, while discriminatory, is not the type of economic deprivation that rises to the level of persecution). Additionally, the record does not compel the conclusion that Wan has established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See Ramadan, </em>479 F.3d at 658. Accordingly, Wan\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Wan failed to establish a likelihood of torture if returned to China. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1068. Accordingly, Wan\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
