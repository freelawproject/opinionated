Thereafter, Arender brought suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>against the County based on a claim of retaliatory discharge, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court found that because Arender\u2019s comments did not address matters of public concern, they were not protected speech under the First Amendment. Thus, on Arender\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Arender now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in finding that his comments did not involve a matter of public concern. Reviewing the record de novo, we agree that Arender\u2019s comments did not address matters of public concern. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, essentially for the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
