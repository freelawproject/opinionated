We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Cholla, Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The district court properly dismissed Nosie\u2019s discrimination claims because Nosie failed to allege facts sufficient to show that she \u201cwas singled out and treated less favorably than others similarly situated on account of\u2019 her sex, race, color or age. <em>Beck v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 99, </em>506 F.3d 874, 882 (9th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (setting forth prima facie case for a Title VII discrimination claim against a union); <em>see also Shelley v. Geren, </em>666 F.3d 599, 607-08 (9th Cir.2012) (applying Title VII analysis to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">The district court properly dismissed Nosie\u2019s fair representation claims as time-barred because Nosie did not file her action within six months of learning that her former union would pursue her grievance no further. <em>See Stallcop v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., </em>820 F.2d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.1987) (plaintiffs fair representation claim was time-barred because she did not file her action within six months of receiving the union\u2019s letter notifying her it would pursue her grievance no further); <em>Kelly v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>896 F.2d 1194, 1197 (9th Cir.1990) (six-month statute of limitations applies to fair representation claims brought against unions covered by the Railway Labor Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Nosie\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b833-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
