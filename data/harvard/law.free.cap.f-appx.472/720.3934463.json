We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if Singh is credible and was persecuted on account of a protected ground, the government rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by establishing changed circumstances in India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) and (ii); see <em>also Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 998-1001. The agency rationally construed evidence in the record and provided a sufficiently individualized analysis of Singh\u2019s future fear. <em>See id. </em>at 1000. We reject Singh\u2019s contentions that the BIA failed to consider all relevant evidence. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must overcome the presumption that the agency has considered all the evidence). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Singh failed to show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured in India. <em>See Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1288-89 (9th Cir.2008) (evidence of changed country conditions in Sierra Leone defeated CAT claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b751-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
