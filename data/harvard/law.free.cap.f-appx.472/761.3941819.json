R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b791-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-24\">Darshan Kaur and her son, natives and citizens of India, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Kaur gave inconsistent testimony regarding her husband\u2019s whereabouts on the date of her first alleged arrest, <em>see id. </em>at 1040-44 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d), and Kaur\u2019s explanation does not compel a different conclusion, <em>see Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007) (upholding agency finding that explanations were insufficient). In the absence of credible testimony, petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Because Kaur\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and she does not point to any evidence that shows it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to India, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156\u2014 57. We reject Kaur\u2019s contention the BIA failed to properly analyze her CAT claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
