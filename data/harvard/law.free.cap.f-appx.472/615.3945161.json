We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">The district court dismissed Franceschi\u2019s claims under the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\u201cCLRA\u201d) and the California Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d) for two reasons: (1) Nevada law specifically allows the allegedly unfair practices; and (2) Franceschi could not meet the \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d consumer test under California law because he is, by his own admission, a sophisticated consumer and not an average one. On appeal, Franceschi does not address or acknowledge the district court\u2019s second rationale, so he has waived his challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of the California statutory claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, the district court dismissed Franceschi\u2019s fraud claim for two reasons: (1) he failed to allege facts sufficient to show the existence of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties that would give rise to a duty on defendants\u2019 part to affirmatively disclose certain facts; and (2) he likely could not prove justifiable reliance. On appeal, Franceschi addresses only the reliance holding, so he has not preserved his challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his common law fraud claim. <em>Cf. Hillis v. Heineman, </em>626 F.3d 1014, 1019 n. 1 (9th Cir.2010) (failure to address each of the district court\u2019s alternative holdings on appeal results in waiver); <em>Navellier v. Sletten, </em>262 F.3d 923, 948-49 (9th Cir.2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(issues not supported by argument or citations to authorities and supporting documents in the record are waived). We therefore do not reach the merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\">. At oral argument, counsel was unable to cite to any page of the brief challenging this ruling. Our own review of the brief confirms this. To the extent Franceschi challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he is a \"sophisticated card counter who could not possibly be deceived and therefore could not have relied on Defendants\u2019 advertising materials,\u201d he is clearly addressing the district court\u2019s fraud ruling, rather than its CLRA/UCL ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
