We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-21\">1. We assume, without deciding, that in the circumstances of this case, the district court erred by failing to apply mitigating procedures to the dual fact-and-expert testimony of some of the government\u2019s witnesses, and that this error was plain. <em>See United States v. Freeman, </em>498 F.3d 893, 903-04 (9th Cir.2007) (describing the dangers of dual testimony). The assumed error did not affect Defendant\u2019s substantial rights, however, because he has not shown \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the error claimed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 81-82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The evidence of Defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, and the allegedly impermissible expert testimony affected only minor topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-22\">We carefully have considered Defendant\u2019s other arguments concerning other alleged plain errors by the district court concerning expert testimony, and we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-23\">2. The district court did not err under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), by admitting the statement by a co-defendant, because the statement did not \u201cfacially, expressly, or powerfully implicate[]\u201d Defendant. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Orellana, </em>539 F.3d 994, 1001 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, even assuming that the admission of the statement violated <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), <em>see United States v. Tuyet Thi-Bach Nguyen, </em>565 F.3d 668, 674-75 (9th Cir.2009) (interpreting <em>Craw</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>ford </em>broadly), any such error was harmless. The statement\u2019s implication of Defendant was not great and, as noted above, the evidence against Defendant was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">3. The district court did not err \u2014 let alone plainly err \u2014 by admitting the \u201cprior acts\u201d evidence relevant to two co-defendants. The district court gave a limiting instruction, and Defendant cites no support for his argument that the district court sua sponte must deny admission of relevant evidence simply because it may have some small prejudicial effect on a co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting lay testimony identifying Defendant\u2019s voice. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>358 F.3d 1194, 1205 (9th Cir.2004) (stating the standard of review). Federal Rule of Evidence 901 contemplates this type of testimony, and Federal Rule of Evidence 701 is not to the contrary. The district court did not abuse its \u201cwide discretion\u201d in admitting this evidence. <em>Alvarez, </em>358 F.3d at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">5. The district court did not err at sentencing. The district court\u2019s determination not to grant a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not clearly erroneous, particularly in light of the \u201cgreat deference\u201d that we owe to the court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>369 F.3d 1076, 1088-89 (9th Cir.2004). The imposition of a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
