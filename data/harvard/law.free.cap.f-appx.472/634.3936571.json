Hanrahan (\u201cHanrahan\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s judgment affirming Appellee Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s determination that Hanrahan was not disabled. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-25\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Hanrahan retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work existing in the national economy and was therefore not disabled. The ALJ chose to adopt the treating physician\u2019s and non-examining physician\u2019s conclusions because they accurately reflected the medical evidence. The ALJ gave little weight to the examining physician\u2019s conclusions because he found them unsupported by the diagnostic tests and the treating and non-examining physicians\u2019 assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-26\">The ALJ\u2019s statements regarding the medical evidence as it related to the conflicting medical opinions provided a specific and legitimate explanation for rejecting the examining physician\u2019s opinions. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1043 (9th Cir.1995). Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-27\">The ALJ also properly discounted Hanrahan\u2019s credibility. The ALJ may reject the claimant\u2019s pain testimony by offering \u201cspecific findings stating clear and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>vineing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.Sd 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ specifically found that Hanrahan\u2019s lack of treatment, failure to seek aggressive treatment, and daily activities as reported by Hanrahan\u2019s son, were all inconsistent with Hanrahan\u2019s subjective complaints. These are specific findings stating clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Hanrahan\u2019s pain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by <em>9th </em>Cir.
