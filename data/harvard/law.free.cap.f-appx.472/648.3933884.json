Daly, </em>839 F.2d 598, 599 (9th Cir.1988). Cuneo\u2019s probation was subject to the special condition that he submit to a computer search \u201cat a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.\u201d The conditions for the search set by the probation officer were\u2019 reasonable and properly within his discretion, <em>see United States v. Stephens, </em>424 F.3d 876, 880 (9th Cir.2005), and thus the district court\u2019s revocation of Cuneo\u2019s probation for failure to abide by them was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">This court \u201creview[sj conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion,\u201d and the petitioner \u201cbears the burden of showing that the [conditions of supervised release] set by the district court involve[ ] a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably required.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeremiah, </em>493 F.3d 1042, 1046-47 (9th Cir. 2007). The district court\u2019s refusal to permit Cuneo to use marijuana was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). The district court\u2019s imposition of a condition requiring that Cuneo participate in a program for monitoring his computer use connected to the Internet, as described in its oral order of March 16, 2011, was also not an abuse of discretion. The court related the condition to the purposes of supervised release, and the condition is not a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary. <em>See United States v. Quinzon, </em>643 F.3d 1266, 1271-73 (9th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Goddard, </em>537 F.3d 1087, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s written order of March 30, 2011, however, differs from its oral order in that it places no limitations on the computer monitoring to which Cuneo must submit. We vacate the computer monitoring condition described in that written order and remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to conform the written order describing the computer monitoring condition to its prior oral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
