The district court dismissed this argument as foreclosed by <em>Lee v. Lampert (Lee I), </em>610 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir.2010). The panel opinion in <em>Lee I </em>is no longer circuit precedent, <em>see </em>9th Cir. R. 35-3, and was superseded by the en banc opinion issued in <em>Lee v. Lampert (Lee II), </em>653 F.3d 929, 932 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc), which recognized an equitable exception to the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period based on a credible showing of actual innocence. \u201cAn actual innocence exception to the limitations provisions does not foster abuse or delay, but instead recognizes that in extraordinary cases, the societal interests of finality, comity, and conserving judicial resources must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration.\u201d <em>Lee II, </em>653 F.3d at 935 (quoting <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>478, 495, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Israel is entitled to an opportunity to make a credible showing of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Israel\u2019s other argument for tolling \u2014 his alleged inability to obtain language assistance \u2014 fails. He was able to get such assistance in filing a state petition. No reason appears why he could not have done as much to file a federal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Israel\u2019s motion to file a supplemental reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal for untimeliness and REMAND for a determination of actual innocence under <em>Lee II, </em>653 F.3d 929.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
