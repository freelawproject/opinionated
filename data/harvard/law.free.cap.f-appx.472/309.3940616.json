In addition to his federal convictions, Galvan was convicted in Texas state court of one count of credit card abuse. A portion of his two-year state jail sentence was undischarged when- the district court imposed sentence. Galvan argues that the district court erred by not applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">As Galvan concedes, his failure to properly preserve for appeal the issue of the application of \u00a7 5G1.3(b) results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.1994). To establish plain error, Galvan must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">The sentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment is addressed by \u00a7 5G1.3. In a case falling under \u00a7 5G1.3(b), the district court \u201cshall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l). Also, \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">Section 5G1.3(b) applies when \u201ca term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under ... \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and that was the basis for an increase in the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>level for the instant offense.\u201d \u00a7 5G1.3(b)'. It is applicable where the relevant conduct from another offense \u201chas resulted in an increase in the Chapter Two or Three offense level for the instant offense.\u201d \u00a7 5G1.3, comment (n. 2(A)). An incremental loss that does not affect the defendant\u2019s offense level cannot be regarded as forming the \u201cbasis\u201d for an increase in that level under \u00a7 5G1.3(b). <em>United States v. Carrasco-de-Jes\u00fas, </em>589 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The record establishes that Galvan\u2019s state conviction for credit card abuse stems from his unauthorized use of a MasterCard credit card that belonged to Francisco Bulnes. That state conviction was relevant conduct with respect to his federal offense of fraud in connection with an access device. However, because Gal-van did not raise the applicability of \u00a7 5G1.3(b) in the district court, the record is not developed sufficiently to establish whether the relevant conduct from the Texas state conviction \u201cwas the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense.\u201d \u00a7 5G1.3(b). \u201cQuestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir. 1991). Galvan has failed to make the requisite showing under the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
