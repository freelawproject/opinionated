Because the parties are familiar with the history of the case, we need not recount it here. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b777-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Bowen\u2019s motion to continue his sentencing hearing. A district court has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to grant or deny a continuance. <em>United States v. Kloehn, </em>620 F.3d 1122, 1126 (9th Cir.2010). Its decision \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal absent clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1126-27 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for a continuance because Bowen had enough time to analyze the error found in Exhibit 299, and he did not specifically explain why a continuance would have been necessary given his familiarity with Exhibit 299 and the underlying shipping records. <em>See United States v. Sarno, </em>73 F.3d 1470, 1493 (9th Cir.1995) (Although \u201cadditional time can often be put to good use,\u201d \u201cgeneral allegations that a continuance would have allowed [the defendant] to prepare a better defense ... are insufficient to allow [the Court] to find an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to construe Bowen\u2019s motion for continuance as a motion for a new trial. A \u201cmotion must state the grounds on which it is based and the relief or order sought.\u201d Fed.R.CrimP. 47(b). Bowen clearly requested a continuance of his sentencing, not a new trial. Indeed, Bowen\u2019s motion in response to the government\u2019s Notice of Errata was titled \u201cRequest for Continuance of Sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b777-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
