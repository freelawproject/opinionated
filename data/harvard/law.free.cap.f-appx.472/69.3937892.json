We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">Guckenberger argues on appeal that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Prudential Insurance Company of America. \u201cOur standard of review for ... motions for summary judgment is <em>de novo.\u201d Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cOn a motion for summary judgment, all factual inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">We believe that Prudential\u2019s evidence, including Jennifer M. Ervin\u2019s detailed supplemental affidavit, was sufficient to raise a presumption that proper notice was mailed as required under New York state law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Ins. L. \u00a7 3211(c). Indeed, Prudential\u2019s evidence provided the district court with sufficient basis to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Prudential\u2019s \u201coffice practice ... [was] geared so as to ensure the likelihood that a notice of cancellation is always properly addressed and mailed.\u201d <em>Nassau Ins. Co. v. Murray, </em>46 N.Y.2d 828, 830, 414 N.Y.S.2d 117, 386 N.E.2d 1085 (1978). Because Guckenberger failed to present any evidence to rebut the presumption raised by Prudential, and indeed concedes that she could not have rebutted such a presumption, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Furthermore, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over the claim on appeal that the district court improperly sanctioned Guckenberger\u2019s counsel pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 11. \u201cWhere an award of sanctions runs only against the attorney, the attorney is the party in interest and must appeal in his or her name.\u201d <em>DeLuca v. Long Island Lighting Co., Inc., </em>862 F.2d 427, 429 (2d Cir.1988). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, however, makes clear that \u201c[a]n appeal must not be dismissed ... for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Here, even though the notice of appeal does not specifically list Guckenberger\u2019s counsel as a party, counsel\u2019s intent to appeal from the district court\u2019s order sanctioning counsel is sufficiently clear, given that the notice of appeal specifies that the judgment from which an appeal was taken <em>not </em>only \u201cdismiss[ed] plaintiffs complaint\u201d but also \u201csanction[ed] plaintiffs counsel in the amount of $500.\u201d In this context, we believe that the notice of appeal makes clear that counsel intended to be a party to the appeal because counsel alone was the subject of the court\u2019s sanction and Guckenberger would have had no direct personal stake in the outcome of an appeal from the portion of the district court\u2019s order sanctioning counsel. <em>Cf. Agee v. Paramount Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 395, 399 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination with respect to sanctions under ... Rule 11 for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Gurary v. Winehouse, </em>235 F.3d 792, 798 (2d Cir.2000). We conclude there was no proper basis for sanctioning Guckenberger\u2019s counsel. While we believe that Prudential\u2019s evidence was sufficient to raise the presumption at issue, we are unable to conclude that counsel\u2019s pursuit of Guckenberger\u2019s claim \u2014 including counsel\u2019s argument that Ervin\u2019s supplemental affidavit was insufficient to entitle Prudential to summary judgment \u2014 warranted the sanction imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Prudential\u2019s favor is AFFIRMED, while the order of the district court sanctioning Guckenberger\u2019s counsel is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
