We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-23\">Escobar-Mejia testified that he was shot at one time and verbally threatened while working as a bus driver in Guatemala. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Escobar-Mejia failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an actual or imputed political opinion or any other protected ground. <em>See Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865-66 (9th Cir.2001) (no nexus between rape by guerillas and a protected ground). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that EscobarMejia failed to establish that the government is unwilling or unable to protect him. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005) (German police took reports and investigated incidents, but were unable to solve the crimes). Accordingly, Escobar-Mejia\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Because Escobar-Mejia failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Escobar-Mejia failed to show it is more likely than not he will be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Guatemala. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
