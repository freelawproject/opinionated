The district court sentenced Mendez to a total of 240 months of imprisonment and sentenced Diaz-Vega to a total of 300 months of imprisonment, and they now appeal. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On appeal, Mendez argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding the amount of drugs for which it could find Mendez responsible. As Mendez failed to object to the jury instructions before the district court, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To meet this standard, Mendez must demonstrate that there was error, that was plain, and that affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, even if Mendez demonstrates plain error occurred, we will not exercise discretion to correct the error \u201cunless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u201cWe review a jury instruction to determine whether, taken as a whole, the instruction fairly states the controlling law.\u201d <em>United States v. Hurwitz, </em>459 F.3d 463, 474 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) (West 2006 &amp; Supp. 2011), \u201cthe amount of narcotics attributable to a defendant dictates the period of incarceration for a defendant convicted of the substantive offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>415 F.3d 304, 312 (4th Cir.2005). In a prosecution for a conspiracy involving multiple drugs, a district court must assess the quantity of drugs attributable to each coconspirator by relying on the principles set forth in <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder current precedent, rather than the district court applying <em>Pinkerton </em>principles when determining the appropriate sentence under \u00a7 841(b), that same court must instead instruct the jury to use <em>Pinkerton </em>principles when making the same determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Pursuant to <em>Pinkerton, </em>a coconspirator is liable for the amount of drugs with which he was personally involved, or the amount that other members of the conspiracy were involved in whose actions \u201cwere both reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311 (citing <em>Pinkerton, </em>328 U.S. at 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180). Here, the district court properly instructed the jury regarding the amount of drugs for which it could hold Mendez responsible in accordance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>principles. We therefore find no plain error in the court\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Mendez and Diaz-Vega also argue that the district court erred in allowing a witness to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a hearing on the Appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe Sixth Amendment grants a defendant the right to compel testimony by witnesses in his defense. When a defendant\u2019s right to compel testimony conflicts with a witness\u2019 privilege against self-incrimination, however, a court must make a proper and particularized inquiry into the legitimacy and scope of the witness\u2019 assertion of the privilege.\u201d <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court may excuse a witness from testifying only upon a finding that the witness \u201ccould legitimately refuse to answer any and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>relevant questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court conducted a proper inquiry and did not err in allowing the witness to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
