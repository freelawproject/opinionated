We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">An alien \u201cwho falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter ... or any Federal or State law is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i) (2006); <em>see also Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 773, 777 (8th Cir.2008) (an alien who falsely represented himself to be a United States citizen in order to procure private employment has falsely represented himself for a benefit or purpose under the INA); <em>see generally United States v. Castillo-Pena, </em>674 F.3d 318 (4th Cir.2012). The Government bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that an alien who was admitted to the United States is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">In order to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status, an alien must show she is admissible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (2006). An alien who falsely represents herself to be a United States citizen in order to gain a benefit under the law is inadmissible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">No decision on removability is valid \u201cunless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A). This court\u2019s review of a final order of removal, however, is limited. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (2006). This case turns on factual findings, which are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">We conclude that the evidence before the IJ supports her finding, by the applicable clear and convincing standard, that Davis falsely represented herself to be a United States citizen in order to gain employment. Davis was not eligible for employment. However, the IJ found that she sought employment and completed the employee portion of the Form 1-9. The form was signed by Davis and the box indicating that she was a national or United States citizen was checked. She also provided documents establishing her identity and eligibility to work. While she denied checking the box indicating she was a national or citizen, other evidence showed that Davis told a special agent with the DHS that she checked the box because she was married to a citizen. This, along with other evidence, led to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which we conclude is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Djadjou v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 265, 273 (4th Cir.2011) (stating standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>review). Based on the evidence of record, we conclude that the immigration judge did not err in her finding that Davis falsely represented herself to be a United States citizen in order to gain employment. Accordingly, Davis was removable and not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
