The Immigration Judge denied the motion on three grounds. First, the evidence of U.S. citizenship Garcia sought to submit in the reopened proceedings, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>trary to the requirement of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3), was available and could have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Second, Garcia\u2019s evidence of U.S. citizenship was unreliable and was rebutted by the government\u2019s evidence that Garcia was born in Mexico. Third, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) jurisdictionally bars an immigration court from reopening removal proceedings \u201cwhere th[e] alien departed the United States pursuant to a final administrative order.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (\u201cA motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The Board of Immigration Appeals relied solely on the third ground in affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. Thus, our review is limited to that ground for affirmance. <em>See Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cIn reviewing the decision of the B[oard], we consider only the grounds relied upon by that agency.\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). <em>See Lin v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 979, 981 (9th Cir.2007). We review the legal question of an agency\u2019s jurisdiction <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">After the Board issued its order, we decided <em>Lin v. Gonzales. See id. </em>We held in <em>Lin </em>that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) \u201cd[oes] not preclude jurisdiction over motions to reopen filed by petitioners, like [Garcia], who [were] lawfully removed after the completion of immigration proceedings, and only bar[s] motions filed by an individual \u2018who departs the United States while he or she <em>is </em>the subject of removal ... proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Lin, </em>473 F.3d at 982) (first four alterations added) (emphasis in <em>Lin). </em>We recently reaffirmed, in construing the substantially identical regulation 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), that the physical removal of a petitioner by the United States does not preclude the petitioner from pursuing a motion to reopen. <em>See Reyes-Torres v. Holder, </em>645 F.3d 1073, 1076-77 (9th Cir.2011). The government recognizes that <em>Lin </em>invalidated the Board\u2019s ground for affirming the denial of Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen \u2014 that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction. Since we only review the ground relied upon by the Board, we must grant Garcia\u2019s petition and remand to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Petition for review GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
