I went, very early in the morning. I knocked at the chamber door, and he, <em>Tobias Stehman </em>asked me to come in. I went in; said he, You come very early. I said I had word to come very early. I asked him what was the mason for it. He told me he had a mind to make another will to-day. I asked him then what is the reason : he told me he does not like that will, he wanted to make a new one. I said, Mr <em>Stehman, </em>I would leave it by the old will; well, he again asked me if I would not draw the minutes in German. I said first and foremost, I cannot write a will; then he asked me to write the minutes in German; says he, <em>Hubley </em>will be here about two o\u2019clock, and he had to pick the. notes and put them in English. Well, about that time the house was full of people, his own, and comers and goers, about breakfast time. Well, then he called for his wife to come into the room where he lay. She came <em>in; </em>then he said to her, to go into the room and tell the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>to go out of the house and lock the door. Well, then she done so; she returned into the chamber room, and said they were all out, and locked the door. Well, then said he, Mammy, now take a sheet of paper and ink, and a feather, and set alongside a little table, and set it aside the bed. Well, says he, <em>Frederick, </em>take a chairand setdown, and mammy, said he, you take a chair and set alongside the bed. Well, then I asked him what I should set down first. Well, says he, I should set down one hundred acres in the Long lane, which I bought of <em>Daniel Brenneman. </em>When Ihad set down that, then he said, Have you set down that <em>1 </em>I said I had. Well, then says he, I think there are thirty-five acres of woodland about \u00e1 mile oif the one hundred acres. When I had set down, I asked him what wood; he said, I bought fifty-two acres of <em>Samuel Simpson </em>of Martick township; I should set down the fifth part of twenty-five acres. When I had set down that, he said, That is all the land my grandson shall have. Next, he was saying he had two hundred acres lying on the west side of the road leading from Millerstown to his mill, and from thence to Safe Harbour road. He meant to make four lots of the two hundred acres. Well, he said, there is a sawmill on one of the lots ; that same lot he thought <em>Betsey, </em>his daughter, should have; that was the east lot; and the next lot, north-west, towards the mill, should be <em>Kitty\u2019s. </em>And for the other two lots adjoining lands of <em>Jacob Fehl, </em>there were two girls he had, <em>Veronica </em>and <em>Peggy, </em>they should cast lots for them. And the court should value these\u2014-four or five men to value the lots\u2014get it appraised. The highestlots they should make up, so that they should come equally in the money way ; they should come out equal. Next, he was'saying, he allowed there were three hundred acres on the east side of Millerstown road, where he resided. He allowed two hundred acres that his son <em>Tobias </em>should have, and the half of the house on the east side, and have to give out 2000 pounds to four of the sisters, and should have the whole team of horses. I think there were four horses, with the gears, wagon, cloth and hand-screw : he should have the apple mill and windmill, and blacksmith\u2019s tools ; should have three steers, four cows, or three cows and two beds and bedsteads ; however, he said he should be furnished oif with every thing like his eldest son. Next, was the ten acres. I should set down ten acres adjoining lands of <em>Kitty\u2019s </em>lot, which was erected on the ten acres a two story dwelling house : \u25a0 this was lying on the west side of Millerstown road, leading to Safe Harbour, adjoining Conestoga. Then h.e, I think that time <em>George Zeigler </em>came there, we broke up and set it on aside; when he came, my mother had been very sick, about a mile from <em>Stehman\u2019s. </em>I asked <em>Stehman </em>if I could not go to see my mother ; he said, Yes, you have time enough ; for <em>Zeigler </em>and he had something to talk about other things, and I might go. I went. I stayed at my mother\u2019s till two o\u2019clock, and then went to Mr <em>Stehman\u2019s. </em>When I came there Mr <em>Zeigler </em>had been there yet. They wished to stay longer together. It was near three o\u2019clock before <em>Zeigler </em>started. So he said, now I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>should begin at the will; <em>Tobias </em>.said this I should set down : ninety acres on the east side of Millerstown road ; about that time somebody knocked at the door, which was locked; Mrs <em>Stehman </em>went and looked; it was <em>John Hubley; </em>he came in ; as soon as he was in, <em>Hubley </em>said, Have you done any thing in the business ? I said, Yes, we had done a little; and I took it to him and told him, Here is the business we have done. He took it in his hand and looked over it; <em>Hubley </em>did. He then asked for a loose sheet of paper; <em>Hubley </em>did ; and laid the notes I had made, down ; some was right and some was not; and he made it in better style in English. He began at the place were I finished', about the mill. So he asked <em>Stehman </em>what was to be done with the mill; ninety acres were set down already. The mill, and all the implements belonging to it, and all that was in it, the ninety acres, the ten acres, and the mill, and the dwelling house, that is what I will keep till I die; and after my decease, or if I should die, my wife should have it as long as she lives; if she should die, his son <em>Tobias </em>should have all this if-he gets boys; and if he don\u2019t get no boys, his eldest son\u2019s son should have it\u2014the' mill, one hundred acres and dwelling house. If that boy, <em>Tobias, </em>should die before he was twenty-one, his brother, <em>Christy, </em>was to have it; and if <em>Christy </em>should die under <em>age, </em>then <em>John </em>should have it; and if <em>John </em>should die under age, <em>Jacob </em>should have it: and if they should all die under age, the mill and- one hundred acres should be sold, and the money should be divided among his own children. That was the last; then it was read by Hubley\u2014the minutes; when it was reading, his wife was by; says she, There is something forgot about the mill\u2014if was not valued; she was saying about 2000 pounds; \u2019he did not give her an answer on that; so he was considering. He said, I don\u2019t know how to do about that. Then I was saying to him, I heard <em>Zeigler </em>once saying <em>Christy Rohrer </em>would willingly give 5000 pounds for the mill, and fifty acres, and the dwelling house; then he began to laugh a little\u2014to smile; then we were talking how the money would be at that time; it might be very scarce ; then he said it must be valued whoever gets it; it must be valued at the time he gets it; then <em>Hubley </em>lined it in the notes, that whoever gets it, it must be valued to ; it must be valued by men to be appointed by the court. Well, it was read over again by <em>Hub</em>ley\u2014the whole. Well, said <em>Stehman, </em>now it is right; and he told Mr <em>Hubley </em>to do it by to-morrow for him, according to law. <em>Hubley </em>made an excuse, said he could not to-morrow, he had some business on the turnpike. Well, <em>Stehman </em>told him to do it as soon as possible. <em>Hubley </em>promised he would. Then <em>Hubley </em>asked him who should be-the executors ; he fixed out his right hand, and pointed with his finger against me ; he said, <em>Frederick Fehl </em>should be one, and his son, <em>Tobias, </em>second, and <em>Jacob Fehl </em>the third ; so it was dark\u2014almost dark. He called the wife to get a little water and wine ; we refused ; did not drink any, saying there was no need. We bid good night to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>him, shook hands and went off. Mr <em>Hubley </em>and I went away together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">\u201c <em>Stehman </em>lived about a mile beyond Millerstown. He was at that time in good health. He thought himself to live at the mill.

I did not see him from that time till the 22d of November, he was then pretty weakly; he was very glad to see me ; glad. I came to see him ; he was well in his memory and understanding. He did not say any thing about these minutes. [Shown the notes.] -I think this is the very paper <em>Hubley </em>wrote; I did not see it since that day ; this is the paper he wrote in my presence and read to the old man, and when it was read, he said it was all right; I think it is the paper to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-10\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>\u201c I and he married sisters; I cannot read English writing well; I did not read, the minutes that <em>John Hubley </em>wrote ; I never had them in my hand before to-day; I know it by the letters of his handwriting; I am not acquainted with the handwriting of Mr <em>Hubley, </em>but think this is the very writings he drew that day.\u201d Asked, why <em>% </em>\u201cI think so because I saw it that day when <em>Hubley </em>read it; that is all the reason I have for thinking'this is the paper; no mark on the paper by which I know it to be the paper ; did not take notice at the time of any marks. <em>John Hubley </em>put them in his pocket and took them away that day; from that time to this I have not seen them; I cannot read this handwriting at all; Mr <em>Stehman </em>agreed to them when read a second time. The substance that was communicated to Mr <em>Hubley </em>was the same with what was read, except the style was altered. The substance communicated to me, <em>Hubley </em>picked out the best of it, and asked <em>Stehman </em>if it was right, and he said Yes. <em>Hubley </em>spoke toffiim in the German, and he spoke German to <em>Hubley </em>and I also ; we all spoke German ; Mr <em>Hubley </em>read it in English to Mr <em>Stehman </em>the first and second time ; he explained the queery words in German ; Mr <em>Stehman </em>understood English, but could not read or write English ; the last time he read it slowly and carefully.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-11\">\u201c Mr <em>Stehman </em>died'25th or 26th of November 1814. <em>Tobias, </em>his eldest son, was then above age ; twenty-three or twenty-four ; always lived with his father ; he was very industrious ; his father had a great liking to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The counsel for the defendants admit that the notes now produced are in the handwriting of the late <em>John Huhley, </em>Esq.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">The plaintiffs then offered <em>Jacob Fehl </em>as a witness ; who being sworn according to law, testified as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">\u201c I went to the doctor\u2019s always when he (Mr <em>Stehman) </em>was sick. He was eleven or twelve weeks sick; he sent his daughter for <em>me; </em>I went there between, nine and ten <em>o\u2019clock; </em>his wife gave me a wink that I should come to him\u2014into the room to him ; I asked him how he was; said he was not quite well, but a great deal better than he had been. He said he- had made a will but it never should stand; that was the first will <em>Gloninger </em>had made; he said I should go to <em>John Huhley, </em>he should come out and draw me another will. I said, <em>Tobias, </em>I do not like t\u00f3 do such business; he said I should go, and be afraid of nobody; I took his horse and went to Mr <em>Huhley\u2019s </em>office; he was sitting <em>there; </em>I told him; he said he could not go to-day, he would try to get out the day after to-morrow; I must try to get somebody to do it in German, and that I must tell <em>Tobias; </em>he said he could write English or German. I told this to Mr <em>Stehman; </em>Mr <em>Stehman </em>called in <em>Frederick Fehl\u2019s </em>son, and told him to tell his father to come over very early in the morning; I was with Mr <em>Stehman </em>till twelve o\u2019clock in the night; he told me I should come out in the morning again ; <em>Frederick Fehl </em>would be there early; I went home; when I came out <em>Frederick </em>was drawing the writing in German; he was in bed, and his wife was sitting there; when <em>Frederick </em>heard somebody was coming, he took the papers up and stopped; the old man said I knew what they were <em>doing; </em>I went in; he had don\u00e9 with the grandchildren; I said he might make his will as he liked. <em>Frederick </em>read it to me; then he said I will begin about the four hundred acres which the four daughters should have; then he was considering a little whether <em>Betsey </em>or <em>Kitty </em>should have the sawmill and the fifty acres. He said <em>Betsey </em>should have it; he said <em>Kitty </em>should have fifty acres of the land going down <em>to </em>the mill; as to <em>Fanny </em>and <em>Peggy </em>they were single, and if they married they should draw lots for the choice of the other two; then if they should not agree they should get five men to appraise it, if one should be of more value than the other; that they should have an equal share in money; then he was done with that, and he said he would go to the house where he lived; two hundred acres of land; he said <em>Tobias </em>should have them two hundred acres more or less; he should give three thousand pounds out to the girls; then <em>Frederick </em>stood up and said Hoi! Hoi! and he then said two thousand pounds; he said that should be among my four daughters, <em>Betsey </em>and <em>Kitty </em>and <em>Fanny </em>and <em>Peggy; </em>half of the house he lived in he made to his wife, and I don\u2019t know what all, and horse and bridle; <em>Tobias </em>should feed it and haul the fire wood and make it fine for her, six barrels of cider, and she should go into the orchard and pick as many apples as she pleased, and the gardens and one thing and another, I cannot just name it <em>all; </em>he said if she cannot live with her son <em>Tobias, </em>she might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>rent it away if he did not use her like another; that was done; then he began about the ninety acres, and the mill, and the ten acres, and the new house; then as he was speaking about it who should come riding but <em>George Zeigler; </em>.he was speaking then and he said, This mill and the ten acres, and the ninety acres belongs to my wife, and she can move to the mill if I don\u2019t come down or rent it out\u2014she should do what she pleased wi,th it\u2014she. was to have it as long as she was alive. If her son-in-law, <em>Rohrer, </em>used her well, she could stay there too if she-choose\u2014a piece of it; if <em>Tobias </em>gets a boy before his mother died he should have the mill; if'he should not get a boy it should fall to <em>John Stehman; </em>and if that one should die under age it should fall to <em>Christy; </em>if he should die under age it should <em>go </em>to <em>Johnny; </em>if that one died under age-it should go to <em>Jacob; </em>then it should be appraised by five men to be \u00bfppointed. If one'gets hold of the mill, they should have five men appointed by the court to appraise the mill, the ninety acres and the ten acres and the new dwelling house, and' that should be made into six shares, and every one was to have a share. His debts should be paid, and the over-plus to be divided among his own children and grandchildren in equal shares in money; the two single daughters were to be furnished like <em>JDietricKs </em>wife and <em>Rohrer's </em>wife, each 500 dollars, to be taken first out of the personal property. Then <em>Zeigler </em>was coming, and he said he would quit it a little, and I went away, my mother was sick. If <em>Tobias </em>was to have a son at any time during his life <em>Tobias </em>was to have it, and it was to be appraised by men; the court was to appoint the men if they could not agree. The day after <em>Hubley </em>was there I went there. He said he was glad <em>Hubley </em>was there, he was drawing the will in town; took the papers there. He said <em>Hubley </em>would be out again, but I should ride in and tell Mr <em>Hubley </em>to make his will ready, what he was writing, to make haste and make this thing ready, these papers that he took oflf ready; then he said I should tell <em>Hubley </em>to put the grain in it if he forgot it; <em>Tobias, </em>was to have it; I should tell <em>Hubley </em>so; I told <em>Hubley; Hubley </em>said he was very glad I had come, he said he had it in his minutes-that the girls should have 500 pounds every one out of the two hundred acres; then I rode home and told <em>Tobias Hubley </em>did not know rightly about; he said, The dumb old man, don\u2019t he know, that the girls were to have 500 pounds each out of the two hundred acres. Then I went into <em>Hubley </em>and he brought me the paper, such a paper as this. He looked into it and said, Yes, the girls are to have 500 pounds a-piece. Mr <em>Stehman </em>told me to tell <em>Hubley </em>if he was done he should bring the will out; he gave it to me and I took it out; he said in the morning he would be out to read it to him if he was well enough, and I should tell <em>Stehman </em>so; I gave it to Stehman; he said I should call all the children in; I think this is the paper I gave to him, and he had this paper; all were there but <em>Kitty, </em>and he said, This is now my last will. <em>Henry Rohrer </em>was there, and he sent for <em>Michael. Rathfon, </em>and <em>Henry Gall </em>came in too; then he signed it, put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>' his name down,- and said, Thank God I made my will; then <em>Michael Rathfon </em>and <em>Henry Rohrer </em>and <em>Henry Gall, </em>as witnesses. It was not read to him:\u2014nobody there could read English.

That those notes which he read over to <em>Stehman </em>as aforesaid, meaning these notes hereto attached, marked A, are the same notes, and that he believes them to be the same as they were then. And deponent further saith, that there was a great deal of conversation at that time, and that deponent supposed that he would be able to write the will from those explanatory observations and the minutes taken by him, but that the deponent does not now recollect what those explanatory observations were ; that those explanatory observations were made at and after the notes were read to <em>Stehman </em>the second time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\"><em>Cross-examination. \u201c </em>At the time of taking these minutes was it not understood, both by you and the testator, that they were not to be considered as his will, but a mere memorandum from which you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>were to draw an instrument of writing, afterwards to be executed by the testator as his will <em>\u00cd\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">Answer. \u201c It was so understood.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">Question. \u201c Had not <em>Frederick Fehl </em>taken some notes in German in respect to the will of <em>Tobias Stehman </em>before you came to Mr <em>Stehman\u2019s 1\u201d </em>Answer. \u201cYes, <em>Fehl </em>had begun when I came, but had not proceeded far, but I had nothing to do with the notes taken by <em>Fehl. </em>Mr <em>Stehman </em>sat up in bed and took a snuff occasionally. \u2022 I did not conceive him to be so very ill.

I cannot tell when the word No, in the query, was put there. I cannot tell whether the word No, was put to the query after the inquiry was made of <em>Fehl </em>or not. That the minutes were so dark in some places that he had to run his pen over them when he came home to make them plainer. I cannot tell what the meaning of the cross opposite the letter B is. I cannot tell whether that part with the cross was considered as part of the minutes or not. I afterwards drew an instrument' of writing, purporting to be the will of <em>Tobias Stehman, </em>and sent it out by <em>Jacob Fehl, </em>and told him to read it or have it read to Mr <em>Stehman, </em>and if the instrument was not right he should just let me know, that I would come out and make it right.

There was a paper produced, but whether this is the paper I will not undertake to swear. I think the paper which was produced in the handwriting of Mr <em>Hubley ; </em>it was brought there*for the purpose of being proved as the last will and testament of <em>Tobias Stehman. </em>I don\u2019t know where it was brought from, nor do I know who brought it. I don\u2019t recollect any thing about it being said to be brought from the register\u2019s office. [Opened and shown letter B.] I cross-examined Mr <em>Hubley </em>at that time. [Asked to turn to the part where B is referred to.] I have no recollection of any reference but what appears here in Mr <em>Hubley\u2019s </em>deposition ; it appears from this that I cross-examined him ; I have no doubt that I cross-examined Mr <em>Hubley, </em>and put this question to him; but whether the instrument of writing was marked B by Mr <em>Carpenter, </em>or how the B came, or whether it was put upon that instrument [the minutes] I don\u2019t know. What is on the face of the deposition was taken down in my presence. I have no doubt the deposition was taken down fairly and correctly at the time. 1 have no doubt there was a letter B on the instrument of writing at the time, or that it was placed there, and that on putting that question I had reference to it.\u201d \u201c Have you any doubt but that the B placed on the minutes is the B referred to in the question and answer ?\u201d Answer. \u201c If this paper was the paper that was there, I have no doubt that the B on the paper is the one referred to in my question, but I don\u2019t know that this is the paper. I believe this is the paper that was there, I mean the minutes. My only reason for believing that it is the paper, is from what I see on the deposition of <em>John Hubley, </em>and from supposing that Mr <em>Frazer </em>would hardly bring any other paper to be proved. I never knew of any other paper drawn by Mr <em>Hubley </em>as the minutes of the will of Mr <em>Stehman </em>but that paper.

I do not think it was. I have iio recollection of the paper being marked with the letter A, or any other letter. I judge of it merely from what appears upon that paper. It don\u2019t look to me like a mode of authenticating any instrument. I don\u2019t know whose letter it is.

That the authentication of the miTiutes taken by <em>John Hubley, </em>Esq. and alleged by the plaintiff to be the last will and testament of <em>Tobias Stehman </em>deceased, by the requisite number of persons, is a mere abstract question of law to be decided by the court. The jury are therefore bound by the opinion of the court as to whether there has been the requisite proof in this case to establish those minutes as the last will of the alleged testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-14\"><em>2. </em>In order to establish these minutes as the last will of <em>Tobias Stehman, </em>there must be proof by two witnesses that he knew their whole contents. In cases in which the testator has signed the instrument, and his signature is established by the testimony of two witnesses, such knowledge is presumed; but in this case, where the minutes were neither written nor signed by the testator, such knowledge must be clearly proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>3. That the proof of the execution of these minutes must be made by two witnesses, each of whom must separately depose to all facts necessary to complete the chain of evidence, so that no link in it may depend upon the credibility of but one. Each of the two witnesses in this case must make proof so complete in itself that if the act of assembly were out of the question, the case would be well made out by the evidence of either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">4. That the two witnesses, to wit <em>John Hubley </em>and <em>Frederick Fehl, </em>who were present at the time when the instructions were given and the minutes were taken, must therefore correspond with each other as to every material particular, otherwise the minutes cannot be established; that therefore, as there is a variance between the minutes and the instructions as they are proved by <em>Frederick Fehl </em>in the following among other important particulars, these minutes cannot be established, to wit, by the minutes the mill, house and one hundred acres of land are devised to the widow of the alleged testator for life, remainder to the male heirs of his son <em>Tobias </em>in fee, and for want of such male'heirs \u201c it shall go to the males of <em>John </em>in fee,\u201d to be valued amongst them in parcels or in whole by five men after the death of his widow, but if no grandchildren, it shall go to all my children and be parted and appraised among them. By the testimony of <em>Frederick Fehl, </em>the instructions of the alleged testator were, that the premises, after the death of his widow, should go to his son <em>Tobias </em>if he gets boys, and if he don\u2019t get no boys, then to <em>Tobias </em>the eldest son of his son <em>John, </em>and if he should die before twenty-one, then to <em>Christian </em>the'second son of his son <em>John, </em>and so on in succession <em>; </em>but whoever was to get the premises it should be appraised to him and the money divided into six shares among all his children and the children of his son <em>John </em>deceased. The testimony <em>o\u00ed Jacob Fehl </em>corresponds with that of <em>Frederick, </em>except that <em>Jacob </em>expressly mentions what the law would have implied, that it should go to <em>Tobias Stehman </em>the son of the alleged testator if he gets a boy before his mother\u2019s death. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">5. That as <em>John Hubley </em>has sworn, that there was a great deal of conversation at the time he took the minutes, and he \u201c supposed he would be able to write the vfill from those explanatory observations and the minutes taken by him\u201d and that it was understood both by him and the alleged testator, that these minutes were not to be considered as his will, but a mere memorandum from which be was to draw an instrument of writing, afterwards to be executed by the alleged testator as his will, and that the said minutes were merely intended to assist his recollection; the testimony of <em>John Hubley </em>is not sufficient, nor is he one sufficient witness, admitting all he has sworn to be true, to establish the minutes as a will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">6.

That it should be in writing. 2. That it should be proved by two witnesses. The question of the authentication of an instrument is a matter of law for the decision of the court. 6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>489. Was <em>John Hubley </em>such a witness as contemplated in the case in 3 <em>Yeates </em>511? These notes were taken as mere memoranda to refresh the memory of <em>John Hubley, </em>and there were explanatory observations which were never read to <em>Tobias Stehman. John Hubley </em>is an insufficient witness, and even if he is sufficient, the other two do not amount to another witness. 6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>47. Every thing contained in <em>Hubley\u2019s </em>notes is in direct opposition with what is contained in the testimony of <em>Frederick Fehl </em>ana <em>Jacob Fehl, </em>and therefore, there is no connection between the witnesses in support of the will, and no one would be sufficient with respect to all the bequests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-13\">There are in fact two wills, one of <em>John Hubley, </em>the other of <em>Frederick Fehl, </em>each of which is contrary to the other. 16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>82.

Every scrap of paper made in contemplation of death, is not to be received as a will. <em>Burnet's Appeal, </em>opinion delivered by Chief Justice <em>Gibson, </em>at Philadelphia.

If the identity of the paper had not been denied, the court below would not have left it to the jury. Mr <em>Fehl </em>having heard the minutes read by Mr <em>Hubley </em>to <em>Tobias, </em>and Mr <em>Stehman </em>having made no objection to the correctness of these minutes, is one good and sufficient witness' to establish the validity of the will. Mr <em>Hubley, </em>the person who drew the minutes, read them to T. <em>Stehman, </em>and having corrected and made the alterations directed by <em>Stehman, </em>and having afterwards read the minutes as corrected to <em>Stehman, </em>without any. objection from him, makes <em>John Hubley </em>a second complete witness. An ambiguity appearing on the face of the will, is not sufficient, to invalidate it, and is not a question on the issue of <em>devisavit vel non. </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>56.

At the time of the concoction of such an instrument, there would be a great deal of conversation, and the testator would necessarily say many things, which after-wards he might think better of, upon the consequences being explained, and would after direct a different disposition of what he first mentioned, but after the instrument had been read to him, and he approved of it, every thing which had been said (except in cases of fraud and imposition) contrary to the instrument became of no effect, and <em>F.

Mr <em>Hubley </em>has testified that he drew the instrument, and that after he drew it, he read it twice to him deliberately, and that it was written to the entire satisfaction of Mr <em>Stehman; </em>and he constitutes^ second witness.

The law has determined, that two witnesses are necessary for the proof of the execution of a will, and if the matter were submitted to a jury one witness would in all cases substantiate the will.

Thetestimony of <em>Frederick Fehl </em>is in direct opposition to the evidence of <em>John Hubley, </em>with respect to a number of dispositions of the property. One set of instructions has been proved by Mr <em>Fehl, </em>and another set of instructions has been proved by Mr <em>Hubley. </em>Mr <em>Hubley </em>does not constitute one complete witness; for he says, that these notes do not contain the whole of the instructions given to him by <em>Tobias Stehman. John Hubley </em>was a witness to support the regular will, but could not be a witness to substantiate these notes; and being a witness to the former will, would be in direct opposition to these minutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-10\"><em>Powell on Dev. </em>29.

This act of 1705 differed widely from that which our ancestors had left in force in England, both as to the substantial and formal requisites of a valid will of lands. The construction put on it, soon after its enactment, handed down by tradition, is first found in <em>Dallas\u2019s Reports, </em>in a written and permanent form; but that decision was made by judges who had been lawyers as early as 1750, and who in their youth must have been. acquainted with others who had practised, in 1730, or even 1720. Some have in our day questioned the correctness of the construction early given to this law; but as it has been acted upon to. the present day, and as it has been decided that a trial and decision expressly on the validity of a will does not preclude heirs or devisees from again contesting the matter in ejectment for lands, that construction has become a rule of property, and if we should now change it, we should give occasion to many suits and destroy many titles (now held good) in the hands of heirs and purchasers. The legislature have at present before them \u00e1 bill on the subject; until some provision by them, we are bound by many considerations to adhere to what has been decided, even though some of those decisions have gone further than we could wish. \u201cAll wills in writing, wherein or whereby lands, tenements or hereditaments within this province have been or shall be devised, being proved by two or more credible witnesses, upon their solemn oath, <em>or by other legal proof, </em>in this province,\u201d &amp;c. The case of <em>Slight </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>94, has remained unshaken; it settles: first, that it is not necessary that a will devising real estate in Pennsylvania; should be sealed; second, nor that all the subscribing witnesses should prove the execution; third, nor that the proof of the will should be made by those who subscribed as witnesses; fourth, nor that the will should be subscribed by witnesses. See also 2 <em>Binn. </em>414. I shall not cite all the cases in our books. <em>Lessee of Eyster and others </em>v. <em>Young, </em>3 <em>Yeates </em>511, is nearly this case. There Mr <em>Rudisill </em>took drawn notes from the mouth of the testator, of the disposition of his property, intending to draw a formal will; two persons were in the room and heard them dictated; they heard them read over to testator and approved. Mr <em>Rudisill </em>drew them into a formal will more copiously and fully, and containing some clauses which Mr <em>Rudisill </em>had. trusted to his memory. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>identity of the paper-was contested, and not more fully proved, not so fully as in this case. The notes were established as the will by a verdict in conformity to the charge of the court. That case, and <em>Arndt </em>v. <em>Arndt, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 256, </em>fully establish, that memoranda written by another, and proved by two witnesses to have been approved by the testator or written by the testator himself, though not put into a formal will and not signed, being proved by two witnesses to be the testator\u2019s handwriting, may be a good will.</p>\n<p id=\"Adk\">In the present case, <em>Frederick Fehl </em>and <em>John Hubley </em>fully prove the memoranda to have been dictated by the testator, and to have been read over to him and explained by Mr <em>Hubley, </em>and in some parts corrected at this reading; and then to have been declared to be all fight by the testator. It was read a second time after these corrections had been made, and these explanations given, and declared to be all right. This paper was taken home by <em>Hubley </em>to draw a formal will, and one was drawn, but executed by the testator without being read to him, and for that reason rejected from probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"><em>Jacob Fehl </em>corroborates these witnesses; he was present while part of the directions were given, but went away; the next day the testator told him <em>Hubley </em>was drawing the will; and again told the witness to bring it out from <em>Hubley </em>to him, and the witness did so. It was executed without being read, because all these were Germans, and could not read English.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The identity of the paper was as fully proved as is generally possible; and that was left to the jury, together with the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">But the counsel for the opponents of this paper as a will, taxed the memory of <em>Frederick </em>and <em>Jacob Fehl, </em>and supposed the account they gave of the several bequests differed in some of the details from the written memoranda, and drew an argument against its validity from this. Now if a formal will is read in the presence of the witnesses, before its execution, and they in court prove the sanity of the testator and see the execution of the will, and then on being asked as to its contents, differ a little or a good deal, or if after the lapse of fifteen years, as in this case, this want of recollection or inaccurate recollection would at all affect the validity of the will, or the bequest contained in it, we had better cease to write wills. So in this case, after the proof given, that it was dictated by the testator, read over and explanations made and corrections, and then read again -and all approved, it is beyond being impugned by the failure of minute recollection of witnesses as to its minute details. The witnesses prove distinctly, that every possible pains were taken to have these minutes correct; they were written item by item as dictated; read oyer item by item, explained and approved; and then all read together, and all approved. That those who did this, or who were present when this was done, do not recollect, after fifteen years, all that was then written, or do not recollect it exactly as written is natural; is what must always happen; and is one main reason why wills must be in wri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ting. It is possible to destroy the force of written memoranda, by proving them to have been unfairly taken down, or falsely read. In the same manner a will or deed may be impugned. It was not openly, nor I think covertly, suggested, that <em>John Hubley </em>was guilty of any thing like this. It was not put to the witnesses to say positively, that any thing was in these minutes which the testator did not direct; nor to say, that the witness was sure he directed any thing which is not to-be found there. They stated the directions according to their recollection; but no one of them was asked to point out n material variance, nor to say, that his recollection of any particular was so perfect that he would himself rely on his own recollection in contradiction to the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">There were two bills of exceptions to the admission of testimony; neither of which was much insisted on here.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The first is, that the memorandum or minutes taken down by Mr <em>Hubley </em>should not be read to the jury~now I should like to know how the jury could have decided one of defendant\u2019s points, viz. whether the parol proof of instructions, and the minutes agreed or differed, unless the minutes had been read; but I pass this. Wherever two witnesses prove a paper as a will, such paper always has gone, and always must go to the jury, who are to decide whether, on the whole proof, it is the will of testator or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The next bill of exceptions is still less tenable. After the plaintiffs had gone through their testimony, the defendants produced the paper drawn by <em>John Hubley </em>as a formal will, and which had not been read by or to the testator; but which the testator had executed in the presence of two persons, who had subscribed it as witnesses; \u25a0and the defendant called those witnesses and proved the execution of it by them; this, evidently, with the intention of arguing to the jury, that, this latter paper was the true will.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">That paper had, however, been offered for probate, by the same persons who now offered the minutes as the Will, and on a trial of a feigned issue in the same court, before the same judges, it had been decided that the paper now offered by the defendants as the will, was not the last will of <em>Tobias Stehman; </em>and the plaintiffs offered and read the record of such trial and decision. In /act, the defendant\u2019s counsel ought not to have offered as the will that condemned paper; if objected to, the court ought to have rejected it/when it had been read, the shortest way of disposing of it was, to show the record which had disposed of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Points were proposed as matters of law, on which the court was requested to instruct the jury. Some of these are not in the most perspicuous form; some are immaterial; some suggest matters not material in this cause. The charge of the court was an answer to all that was material in this case, and in it there was no error against the party complaining; if any thing was at all wrong, it was in their favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
