In 1805 when <em>John </em>was married, the testator owned six hundred and thirty-three acres of land, from which time for eight years and a half <em>John </em>was in possession of the two hundred acres devised by the will to his sisters, and for nine years and two months he and his family occupied an additional tract of one hundred and thirty-three acres. These were advantages that <em>John </em>and his children enjoyed over the other devisees when the will was made. <em>Tobias, </em>who was of age in 1806, worked for his father both before and after that period, till the death of the latter, without compensation. The rents, issues and profits of the three hundred and thirty-three acres received by <em>John </em>for eight or nine years, and the loss of <em>Tobias </em>in working for his father after 1806, were the causes of the testator\u2019s devising two hundred acres to him. This devise to <em>Tobias </em>should, therefore, be thrown out of view, and it should be considered that <em>John\u2019s </em>children have received one hundred and thirty-three acres of land under the will, whilst the children of <em>Tobias </em>will receive but one hundred by the construction we contend for. Mr <em>Frazer </em>here went into a calculation to show that the proceeds of the land received by <em>John, </em>with the devise to his children, placed him and them in a better situation than <em>Tobias </em>and his children. He further contended, that the testator never contemplated limiting the time of <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>having children to the death of the widow, who was a very old woman, and lived but six weeks after her husband <em>; </em>more especially, as <em>Tobias </em>was unmarried when the will was made. The language of the will is, <em>after </em>her death; it is not said if <em>Tobias </em>have no male heirs <em>at </em>her death, or <em>when </em>she dies. It was a life estate to the widow, with an executory devise over upon a condition, which might be performed at any time during the life of <em>Tobias; </em>and until his death, or the birth of a male heir, the fee was in abeyance. A limitation over after a freehold estate that is not concurrent with the freehold estate, such limitation will take effect as an executory devise, if it be within a time that does not produce a perpetuity ; <em>2 Fearne on Dev. </em>(by Powell) 21. Here a freehold estate has been created, but the limitation' over is to go upon the contingency of having male heirs ; the fee, therefore, would rest in the heirs at law until the happening of the contingency\u2014the birth of children of <em>Tobias. </em>The first taker has only the use of the estate, pending the contingency mentioned, which must happen within the time limited. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>264, 265. When no person <em>in </em>esse in whom the fee can vest, it is in abeyance. 2 <em>Tucker\u2019s Black. </em>107. Where a future estate is devised upon a contingency, until that contingency happen, the fee simple descends to the heir at law. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>173. As to the construction of the will, he cited, 3 <em>Com. Dig. </em>448, N. 16, <em>tit. Devise ; </em>7 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>341, <em>F. tit. Will.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\"><em>Rogers, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-7\">A remainder is a remnant of an estate in lands or tenements, expectant in a particular estate, .and created at the same time with it. Remainders are vested or contingent. <em>Fearne </em>says, there are four kinds of <em>contingent </em>remainders. <em>Fearne </em>3, 4, 5, 6, 7. More properly reducible to two kinds\u2014to an <em>uncertain person, </em>and upon an <em>uncertain event: </em>they are so treated by <em>Blackstone, </em>and adopted by Chancellor <em>Kent. </em>4 <em>Kent's Com. </em>The definition of an <em>executory devise </em>by <em>Blackstone </em>is incorrect, it is that of a contingent remainder. See <em>Fearne's </em>definition. <em>2 Fearne </em>1, 2, 3, (298), (299). It follows,if the same estate that is created by devise could be created by deed or common law conveyance, it is not an executory devise, but a contingent remainder. The great difference between the two is, that a contingent remainder can be barred by a fine levied, or common recovery suffered by the tenant for life. An estate limited on any event cannot take effect as an executory devise when there is a particular estate of freehold capable of supporting it; it is a contingent remainder. 2 <em>Fearne </em>3, (299), <em>et seq. </em>And again, in same book 496 (418), whenever a contingent limitation is preceded by <em>a freehold </em>capable of supporting it, it is construed a contingent remainder, and not an executory devise. In <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>Lord <em>Hale </em>says, where a contingency is limited to depend upon an estate of freehold which is capable of supporting a remainder, it shall never be construed to be an executory devise, but a contingent remainder. <em>2 Saunders </em>381 to 388, <em>note </em>9. The same principle is recognized in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>765; <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Billington, 2 Doug. </em>758 ; and by Chief Justice <em>Tilghman </em>in <em>Dunwoodie </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>3 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>441. It follows, that where a life estate is created in one person, and a limitation over, or a contingency to another, the contingent limitation is not an executory devise, but a contingent <em>remainder; </em>and the rule holds good in <em>all cases </em>when the estate for life goes into operation. Events that take place <em>previous </em>to the death of the testator (as the death of the tenant of the particular estate) may alter a contingent remainder into an executory devise. This is from the necessity of the case, otherwise the devise would fail altogether ; <em>ut res magis valeat quam pereat. 2 Fearne </em>494, 495, 496, (418), (419). But events happening <em>subsequent </em>to the death of the devisor cannot have this effect, and therefore held, that <em>\u201c </em>where a freehold has once <em>vested, </em>it seems no subsequent accident will make a contingent remainder enure as an executory devise.\u201d <em>2 Fearne </em>498, (420), (421); 1 <em>Roberts oh Wills </em>478, and cases there referred to; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>766 ; <em>Carlyle </em>v. <em>Carman, 3 Rawle </em>491. In this case, had the widow died before the testator, the contingent remainder would have been changed into an executory devise, and then <em>Tobias's </em>sons would have taken the estate; but the freehold <em>vested </em>in the widow, and the limitation over was a contingent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>remainder. On the death of the widow, 4th January 1815, <em>Tobias </em>had no male heirs, and as the remainder could not vest it was gone, and the devise over to <em>John\u2019s </em>sons took effect. When was the fee simple to pass <em>l At the death of the widow. </em>This appears fully from the will. Clearly the testator contemplated a state of the parties at the death of the widow, not at <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>death. The estate was ordered to be parted and divided at the death of the widow, among the grandchildren, if they were alive at the time ; if dead, then among the heirs at law. Yet, according to the argument urged, if there had been no grandchildren at the widow\u2019s death, the estate could not be parted among the heirs at law, but must remain in abeyance, until after possibility of issue extinct of <em>Tobias. </em>The fee was intended at the death of the widow to vest in some one, in <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>sons if he had any, if not, in <em>John\u2019s </em>sons. These limitations then are contingentremainders in fee, depending on an uncertain event. The words used, \u201c heirs male,\u201d <em>are words of purchase, </em>descriptive of the parties to take. No estate was created in Tobias; of course the sons would take nothing by descent. The rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case is, therefore, inapplicable. See <em>Archer\u2019s Case, 2 Coke\u2019s Rep. </em>66; 1 <em>Rob. on Wills </em>466, note. It is a <em>special description </em>of the devisees, and comes within <em>Dunwoodie </em>v. <em>Reed, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>451. It is contended that there is an estate tail male in <em>Tobias </em>by implication. Estates by implication arise in two ways. 1. By express words when there is a devise to the party: as an estate to A and his heirs, but if he die without issue of his body then to B, is an estate tail by <em>implication </em>in A. <em>2. </em>By force of implication without express words of devise to the party himself, upon the principle of giving effect to the <em>intention </em>of the testator. Here no necessity for implication, because <em>John\u2019s </em>sons could have taken at the death of the widow, and no implication can arise in violation of the testator\u2019s intention. The devises over were contingencies with a double aspect. The case of <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Keim, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>224; <em>Ld. Raym. </em>203. They are contemporary remainders, not expectant one after another; the limitations depend upon the event of the birth of a son by <em>Tobias </em>during the life of the widow. They are not dependent contingent remainders and to take effect in <em>succession, </em>but merely the substitution of one contingent remainder for another. 18 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>402, <em>title Remainder. </em>2 <em>Doug. </em>505, <em>note; 4 Kent </em>200, 201; 2 <em>Doug. </em>758; 1 <em>Doug. </em>264; <em>Goodwright </em>v. <em>Dunbar, 2 Black. Rep. </em>777; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holme, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>451, 452. The distinction between a fee to succeed a fee and a collateral fee is, whether the first estate vests or not. If it does, the second estate is <em>void, </em>because there can be no limitation after a prior vested fee simple ; but if the first estate never vests, and it.cannot take effect at the time when it ought to vest by the happening of the contingency, the second estate takes its place and vests when the first limitation should have vested. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>200, 201 ; 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>441. The estate in fee, therefore, becoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>vested in <em>John\u2019s </em>sons, all other limitations were void. <em>2 Fearne </em>420 to 440.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-6\">Jenkins, on'same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-7\">It is better that the law should be fixed and certain, than that it should be made to bend to cases of supposed hardship. This is a plain case of two concurrent contingent remainders in fee, and is more so than the case of <em>Dunwoodie </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>where the court decided the remainders to be contingent and good. The male heirs of <em>Tobias </em>take by purchase and not by descent\u2014they \u00e1re described ; besides which the testator recognized <em>Tobias </em>as living, which in the case just referred to was held to make a distinction. It is evident the testator did not intend <em>Tobias </em>to take any estate. Whenever a devise is made to the \u201cmale heirs\u201d of a person who is living, such words are words of description, and the male heirs take by purchase and not by descent; 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. 220. </em>No estate by implication can arise, for there is a freehold to support the remainder. <em>Tobias </em>was amply provided for by the devisor in his will, who, as if to make it clear that <em>Tobias </em>should have no estate in the land in dispute, required him to convey a water right to the mill which forms a part of the property covered by the devise to widow and his \u201cheirs male\u201d or for want of them <em>John\u2019s. </em>It is an axiom that where there is a particular estate the limitation over is never an executory devise, but a contingent remainder; 1 <em>Fearne </em>401, <em>550, 554; </em>with this single exception, where the devisee of the particular estate dies in the lifetime of the testator. Were the intention of the devisor in conflict with this rule it could not prevail, but it is manifestly in accordance with it; 2 <em>Saunders </em>388, A, G; 2 <em>Fearne </em>10 (495) ; 3 <em>Rawle. </em>Here the particular estate had vested in the <em>widow; </em>the limitations over were consequently contingent remainders, and must vest at the determination of the particular estate or never vest at all. <em>Tobias </em>having no \u201c male heirs\u201d at the widow\u2019s death the remainder as to them was gone. A remainder to B\u2019s eldest son then unborn, after the determination of A\u2019s life estate, is absolutely gone if A die before B has a son; 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>169. So strict is this rule, that if the child were <em>in ventre samere, </em>and born after the determination of the particular estate, the remainder could not vest. <em>Tobias </em>having no male heirs, the remainder vested in the sons of <em>John. </em>Two or more concurrent remainders in fee simple may be limited over, though one only can take efiect, so that when the male heirs of <em>Tobias </em>have failed, those of <em>John </em>are substituted ; 2 <em>W. Black. Rep. </em>777; <em>Douglass </em>753; <em>Dunwoodie </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>438. The difficulty in this last case was, whether the first remainder was vested or contingent; here there is no doubt it is contingent. It is apparent then that the limitation over to <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>children is a contingent remainder and not an executory devise, and that it fell through for want of male heirs at the death of the widow, upon the plain rule that a remainder must vest at the determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>particular estate or <em>eo instanti </em>it determines. The remainder to <em>John\u2019s </em>children is also contingent, and res.ted on the chance of a failure of \u201c male heirs\u201d of <em>Tobias. </em>If there were none <em>at </em>the death of the widow, then this second was substituted for the first remainder, as effectually as if the testator had .said in so many words there should be a substitution. The estate therefore goes to <em>John\u2019s </em>children, and that too in accordance with the intention of th\u00e9 testator, which was that the grandchildren living at the widow\u2019s death should take; but if there were no grandchildren living at that time then it. was to go to the testator\u2019s own children.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-6\"><em>Hopkins, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anr\">Every will is to be construed according to the intentions of the testator, and if that be apparent, courts will carry it into effect, if not contrary to the rules of law. It is certain a preference is given by the will to the male heirs of <em>Tobias </em>over the male heirs of <em>John; </em>these latter could not take until <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>heirs were extinct, and then, and not till then, was the estate to go over. We say not till then, for it is manifest that the limitation to the \u201c male heirs of <em>Tobias, if any he gets,\u201d </em>is not confined in point of time to the death of the widow, but is coextensive with the life of <em>Tobias, </em>and a son born ten years after is as fair a subject of the testator\u2019s bounty as one born before the widow\u2019s death. The devisor could not have intended to limit the time to the life of his widow who was an old woman. The condition attached required time for its performance.; and the life of the son, not the death of the widow was its limit. To say that <em>Tobias\u2019s </em>children shall not take, would be contrary to the intention expressed. If <em>Tobias </em>had had sons before and after the death of the widow, all would have come in equally, although the estate in the first instance vested in those living at the widow\u2019s death. The whole issue male of <em>Tobias </em>is meant, and the devise would be open to let in each subsequent son born after the remainder vested. After the death of the widow, and until <em>Tobias </em>had male issue, there would be an intestacy; after their birth they would take the estate as the chief objects of the testator\u2019s bounty. This may be done by an executory devise if within a time to avoid a perpetuity. <em>Fearne </em>21. The limitation, \u201c after the death of the widow, to the male issue of <em>Tobias, </em>if any he gets,\u201d is an executory devise. The ulterior limitation has no connexion with the point of time when the particular estate determines, which is manifest from the condition, that <em>John\u2019s </em>children are not to take but for <em>want </em>of <em>male heirs </em>of <em>Tobias. </em>It amounts to this; an estate to the widow for life, and if, after her' death, <em>Tobias </em>should have any children, the estate in fee simple to go to them, but in default of male issue on his part, <em>then </em>to <em>John\u2019s </em>children. The limitation to the children of <em>John </em>is void, being an attempt to limit a fee, upon a fee which cannot be done. No remainder can be limited after a grant in fee simple. 2 <em>Black. Com. </em>164; <em>Fearne </em>8; <em>Coke Lit. </em>18 a. A contingent fee absorbs the estate as much as a vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>fee, because it runs to perpetuity. <em>Coke Lit. </em>18 a. The words of the will are not <em>at </em>the death, but <em>after </em>the death of the widow; it directs the parting of the mill, houses, &amp;c. <em>after </em>that event. To carry into effect the general intention of the testator, this may be construed to be an estate in tail male to <em>Tobias. </em>He was the stock from whom the whole would pass; it is to go to all his heirs' male; and he may fairly be said to have an estate tail by implication. The expression \u201cmale heirs\u201d brings them within the letter of the statute <em>de donis, </em>and they fall under the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s </em>case; they are heirs and not purchasers. In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 <em>Burrowes </em>38, to effectuate the general intention of the testator, an estate tail was implied against the express words of the will. Here an implication may be made without interference with express words, <em>Tobias </em>being the stock from whom the male heirs are to issue. <em>Pebis </em>v. <em>Mitford, </em>1 <em>Ventris </em>372, is the case of an estate by implication. It is done to save the estate and carry into effect the intention of the party, and courts are <em>astute </em>for these purposes. 1 <em>King </em>v. <em>Milling, </em>1 <em>Ventris </em>225. The last son of <em>Tobias </em>being as much an object of the testator\u2019s bounty as the first, the remainder by implication vests in <em>Tobias. </em>2 <em>Levinz </em>58 ; <em>Lessee of Haines </em>v. <em>Witmer, </em>2 <em>Yeates </em>401. In <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>a son by a mere recital was permitted to take by implication, and so prevent the estate from going over. A devise was, \u201c if A die without issue the estate to go to B,\u201d and A took an estate by implication. <em>Cases temp. Hardwicke </em>258; <em>Fearne </em>300. By giving an estate tail to <em>Tobias, </em>the intention of the testator is preserved, and the estate is kept in the line of <em>Tobias </em>in preference to that of <em>John.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b473-7\">Gibson, C.

The plaintiffs insist that these limitations present a case of concurrent remainders dependent on a contingency with a double aspect: while the defendant insists that the general and paramount intent was to secure the estate to the children of <em>Tobias </em>at all events, and without regard to the time of their birth; that to effectuate this intent, it is necessary either to imply the existence of an estate in tail male in <em>Tobias </em>himself, or to sustain the limitation to his children as an executory devise, supposing the estate to have descended at the death of the widow to the testator\u2019s right heirs, in order, to await the expected contingency which was to happen, if at all, within the lifetime of <em>Tobias </em>and the usual period of gestation afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Granting that subordinate objects must yield to the general intent, and that to effect it an estate may be enlarged, restricted or implied, yet it is evident that to strain the limitation to the children of <em>Tobias </em>so as to give their father an estate tail, would dislocate every joint and articulation of what seems to have been the general and para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>mount design. An adequate provision had been made for <em>Tobias, </em>it is to be presumed, in the devise to him of the mansion-house and farm though burthened with a pecuniary charge; and the object to be accomplished by the limitation in question, was evidently to secure the land in contest to his children or the children of <em>John, </em>without subjecting it to his debts, or exposing it to the accidents that might befall it as his property. That the precaution taken to effect this might have been eluded, had there been an estate tail in him, by turning it into a fee, is too obvious to need remark. Without having children of his own, he could by the same means have disappointed another principal object of the testator in the further limitation to the children of <em>John, </em>who w\u00e9re intended to take certainly in any other event than the existence of children born to <em>Tobias </em>himself. The object was not so much to vest the estate in these children at all events, as to protect it from the acts or disposition of their father. What if <em>Tobias </em>had suffered a common recovery, and the present were a contest between the plaintiffs and a purchaser under a judgment against him, or, to make the case more glaring, between such a purchaser and his own children <em>? </em>The construction contended for, fatal as it must have proved to the testator\u2019s whole plan, would have been thought a monstrous one. But his children were directed in express terms to take a fee; which would have been inconsistent with the derivation of an estate tail from him. To imply an estate in him, then, that would be subversive of the leading objects of the will, could be justified on no principle of construction. So that the question is whether the limitation to his children can be supported as an executory devise; and the decision of it must be governed by the testator\u2019s intent in respect to the time of its vesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">If it be found that the estate was to go over at the death of the widow, to whom an estate of freehold was given, we shall have one of the plainest cases in the world, of concurrent remainders limited to take effect on the happening of a contingency-with a double aspect\u2014much more so than that presented by the limitations in <em>Dunwoodie </em>v. <em>Reed. </em>The devise over is so expressed in this will as to indicate what has been supposed an apparent intent that it should take effect <em>after </em>and not <em>at </em>the death of the widow\u2014a difference of little account in common parlance, and absolutely worthless in the expression of an intention accidentally suffered to rest in the loose memoranda of a scrivener, intended at the time to be but the material of a more precise and formal declaration of the testator\u2019s will. Were it important to ascertain the exact sense in which this word \u201c after\u201d was used by the scrivener, it might be done by adverting to the clause in which the testator directs the other land devised to the children of <em>John </em>to be valued \u201c after\u201d the. death of their mother, to whom it was given for their support during her life by way of exception out of the fee; and there it was used incontrovertibly to denote the very point of time when her interest should cease. It is supposed, however, that as the testator\u2019s widow followed him in little more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>than a month from the date of the will, he could scarce have supposed it probable that <em>Tobias </em>would marry and procreate within the apparently short compass of her life; and that he never could have meditated a disposition which, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of it, would, on any calculation of the chances, almost certainly prove abortive\u2019. We are left without information, by the verdict, of the widow\u2019s constitution and age; but the testator has nowhere intimated that the probable duration of her life was, in his opinion, such as to preclude a reasonable expectation of children from <em>Tobias </em>before its termination. The estate was to be taken by the children at a valuation of it to be made by the testator, or men appointed by him; and if the latter, he could not have supposed it probable that all the men would survive <em>Tobias, </em>without which the purpose to be effected by their appointment would have been frustrated. If it be said that he contemplated a valuation to be made presently, the remark is open to this objection that, familiar as he must, have been with the changes in the price of land that are perpetually taking place, he would scarce have expected it to be a just or reasonable one at the period of his son\u2019s death. It would, therefore, seem fair to conclude, that the making of this valuation, and the consequent vesting of the successful limitation over, were coupled in his mind with the death of the widow. But the consequence of postponing them till the possibility of children by <em>Tobias </em>should have become extinct, would be inconsistent with any reasonable presumption of intent in another view. No presumption of an intent to die intestate as to any part of the estate, is to be made, where the words of the testator will carry the whole ; and certainly no such intent is apparent here. Yet, according to the hypothesis of the defendant, the estate descended to the testator\u2019s right heirs at the death of the widow, and was paitable during the interval between that event and the happening of the contingency, as in the case of a common intestacy, by the orphan\u2019s court. Can it be supposed that such a partition was thought of <em>% </em>Had a temporary descent been contemplated, a temporary valuation would doubtless have been directed, and to be made by the men who, according to the defendant\u2019s construction, were to' appraise the portions of the children at the death of <em>Tobias </em>or the sooner happening of the contingency. But putting all this aside, the inflexible rule which demands that no limitation be deemed an executory devise if it may by any practicable construction be sustained as a contingent remainder, overbears all implications of an intention inconsistent with it, and is decisive of the question. This, too, for the all-sufficient reason that these executory devises, being inconsistent with the policy of the common law, which, on account of its abhorrence of estates commencing <em>in futuro, </em>requires all the precedent parts of the fee to pass out of the grantor at the same instant, are barely tolerated, and only in favour of the explicit declaration of one who may have been compelled to dispose of his estate when unassisted by counsel. They are therefore to be sustained but in clear cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>absolute necessity ; and nothing remains but to inquire whether the present is such. In the first place, then, there was a sufficient particular estate of freehold in the widow ; next there were limitations after her death, to the male heirs of <em>Tobias, </em>if he should have any, in fee <em>; </em>or in default of such heirs, to the males of <em>John; </em>and finally these limitations were concurrent and in defeasance of each other. What more was necessary to give effect to all the practicable parts of the testator\u2019s <em>plan? As </em>contingent limitations of a remainder, they would have been effectual to preserve the estate for <em>all </em>the children of <em>Tobias, </em>had <em>any been </em>born in time to take ; for their remainder having vested in some of them, would undoubtedly have opened to let in the rest though subsequently bom. But in the succession of the events that have taken place, the limitation to them having been passed by, is gone for ever; and the estate is irrevocably vested in those who answered the description in the posterior limitations at the death of the particular tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
