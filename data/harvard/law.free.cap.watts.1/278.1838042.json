The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to its admission, on the ground that it had never been delivered; and gave evidence to the court to establish that fact; upon which evidence the deed was rejected.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-14\"><em>McCormick, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-15\">If the deed offered in evidence were a perfect one, having the properties of execution and delivery, its effect would have been to determine every thing in the cause. Whether it possessed those essential qualities was a substantive matter of fact; which alone the jury were competent to decide. As well might the court assume the power to determine, upon the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>whether the signature was a forgery or not, and, determining it affirmatively, reject the deed.

There are several decisions to this effect, of which <em>Crotzer </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>9 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>68, is an <em>instance; </em>notwithstanding which, we are sorry to see the practice persevered in. Our course, in all instances of it, is a plain one. Here <em>prima facie </em>evidence had been given of the execution of a conveyance, which, if found to be the deed of the plaintiff, made an end of the controversy; yet, this was successfully rebutted before the court, and not the jury, who were the constitutional judges of the fact on which the cause turned. On the very evidence submitted, a jury might have found in favour of the defendant. But the degree of the proof is immaterial, if it makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of competency. Here a deed, apparently well executed on the face of it, acknowledged, recorded and produced by the grantee, was rejected on the faith of proof introduced to rebut the delivery; and this we are compelled to say was gross error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
