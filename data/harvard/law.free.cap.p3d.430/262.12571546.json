Jensen repeatedly violated court orders, engaged in frivolous litigation, made misrepresentations to the court, and made threatening and harassing contacts with parties that he knew to be represented by counsel. He also refuses to accept responsibility for his misconduct. He acknowledges that the protracted litigation has harmed his wife but seems unable to recognize that his own actions were the source of her injuries. Nor did he see fit to show up to his own disciplinary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Following testimony from his wife, her brother, and her attorney, the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) hearing officer found that Jensen violated the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) and recommended disbarment. The WSBA Disciplinary Board (Board) unanimously adopted the hearing officer's recommendation. We adopt the Board's recommendation and disbar Jensen from the practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Factual background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Jensen was admitted to practice law in Washington on October 27, 2008. On August 15, 2013, Jensen's wife, Therese Jensen,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed for dissolution of marriage in Snohomish County Superior Court. Therese and Jensen owned their family home in Mukilteo. Therese has severe multiple sclerosis and was dependent on Jensen for care. After filing for dissolution, Therese moved to Nebraska.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Mukilteo house\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On December 24, 2013, the superior court entered an order granting Therese control and authority to list the Mukilteo house for sale. Therese contacted listing agent Leanne Finlay to help sell the Mukilteo house. In January 2014, Jensen placed a \"for sale by owner\" sign on the front lawn. He refused Finlay's request to remove his sign. When workers later came to install Finlay's \"for sale\" sign, Jensen became irate and tore the post out of the ground. Jensen also placed a Post-it Note on the front door of the Mukilteo house, stating, \"Buyer Beware Title is unlikely to be cleared for A sale-call [Jensen's phone number].\" Ex. A-208; Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Hr'g Officer's Recommendation (FFCL) 22. On January 22, 2014, Jensen sent an e-mail to Finlay and to Therese's attorney telling them that they could not sell the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On February 10, 2014, the superior court found that Jensen had \"obstruct[ed] the listing and sale of the Mukilteo residence,\" and it ordered Jensen to \"fully cooperate with the sale of the Mukilteo residence up to [the] point of signing closing document.\" Ex. A-220; FFCL 27. At the hearing, Jensen agreed to cooperate. On February 11, 2014, Jensen filed a motion for revision in which he falsely stated that he had \"made no efforts of any kind\" to obstruct Therese's efforts to list and show the home. Ex. A-222; FFCL 28-29. On February 12, 2014, Finlay declared to the superior court that Jensen's \"for sale by owner\" sign was still on the lawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Therese received a written offer to buy the Mukilteo house. On February 14, 2014, Jensen phoned the buyer's agent. Jensen told the agent that he intended to block the sale\n   by refusing to sign the sale documents. Jensen then offered to sign the documents if the buyer agreed to pay Jensen an extra $50,000 outside of the sale and escrow process. Jensen instructed the agent not to tell anyone about his offer. The agent declined his offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 On February 20, 2014, the superior court denied Jensen's motion for revision. On March 7, 2014, the superior court entered an order (1) approving the pending sale of the house, (2) ordering Jensen to \"execute any and all necessary documents to effectuate the closing of the sale,\" (3) authorizing Therese to sell the home unilaterally if Jensen refused to sign documents, and (4) ordering Jensen to \"remove himself and his personal belongings\" from the house. Ex. A-235; FFCL 38. Jensen filed another motion for revision. The superior court denied it and ordered Jensen to vacate the premises. Jensen vacated the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Jensen filed an emergency request with the Court of Appeals to stay the superior court's order. Jensen and Therese filed multiple briefs; in addition to oral argument, there were two emergency hearings. On April 17, 2014, the Court of Appeals terminated review, finding that Jensen had consented to the sale and there was no basis for discretionary review, and awarded Therese attorney fees. Jensen still refused to sign the documents, and the buyer backed out of the sale. The stress of these events exacerbated Therese's multiple sclerosis symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 A second buyer made an offer on the house. On May 14, 2014, Jensen signed an agreement under CR 2A awarding the Mukilteo house to Therese and agreeing to transfer real property to her without further litigation, delay, appeal, or clouding of title. Jensen then conveyed the house to Therese by quitclaim deed but listed his name incorrectly on the deed. Jensen refused the title company's request to correct the deed and threatened to sue the title company. On June 30, 2014, the superior court ordered Jensen to execute the closing documents by close of the business day. Jensen did not comply. On July 9, 2014, the superior court sanctioned Jensen for failing to cooperate in the closing and for creating further litigation and delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Therese eventually convinced a second title company to close the sale with the existing quitclaim deed, but only after agreeing to indemnify it. Jensen then wrote letters to the buyers and their mortgage company, claiming that the sale was void and that he might still own the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 On September 23, 2014, the superior court entered a decree of dissolution. Jensen then filed an appeal, asking the Court of Appeals to overturn all superior court orders that led to the sale of the house, including the final decree. On December 1, 2014, the superior court entered a judgment in the amount of $19,290.55 against Jensen for attorney fees and debts owed to Therese. As of the disciplinary hearing, Jensen had not paid the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 On July 10, 2015, following a motion by Therese, the superior court entered an order finding that Jensen had engaged in vexatious litigation against Therese and requiring that Jensen post a $10,000 bond before filing further pleadings. Even at oral argument, Jensen continued to argue that the superior court lacked authority to compel the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Savage property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Prior to their marriage dissolution, the Jensens also jointly owned stock in Apollo Land Company, whose sole asset was a parcel of real property in Savage, Minnesota. After vacating the Mukilteo house in spring 2014, Jensen moved to Arden Hills, Minnesota. Jensen changed the mailing addresses filed with the state of Minnesota regarding the Savage property so that real property tax notices for the Savage property-including delinquency notices-were sent to his Arden Hills home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 On May 9, 2014, the Savage property was sold to the state of Minnesota to pay delinquent real property taxes. On May 14, 2014, the Jensens signed an agreement under CR 2A,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra at\n   </em>\n   section I.A.l, that awarded the Apollo stock to Jensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 On August 20, 2014, Jensen registered the newly formed M.J. Scott Company with the Minnesota secretary of state, listing himself as its registered agent. On September 8,\n   2014, Jensen, through the M.J. Scott Company, repurchased the Savage property for $500 or less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 On September 19, 2014, Jensen filed a signed declaration with the superior court, stating (1) that Therese had lost the Savage property by failing to pay property taxes, (2) that this had rendered the Apollo stock awarded to him under the CR 2A agreement worthless, and (3) that he was entitled to $150,000 compensation for that loss. Jensen did not disclose that the delinquency notices were sent to his home address (not Therese's) or that he had repurchased the Savage property for under $500. Nor did Jensen disclose these facts at a September 23, 2014 hearing on the motion to which his declaration related. Instead, it was Therese's attorney who informed the superior court of these facts after having discovered them herself. The superior court denied Jensen compensation for the alleged loss of the Savage property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Communication with represented parties (Therese and James Brown)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Jensens also owned other real property in Minnesota, some of it jointly with Therese's brother, James Brown. Jensen, Therese, and Brown engaged in litigation in Minnesota related to these properties. Therese and Brown were represented in Minnesota by attorneys Stanford Hill and Daniel Olson; Therese was represented in Washington by attorney Sabrina Layman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 Jensen, while acting pro se, repeatedly wrote letters and e-mails to Therese and Brown. These communications included threats-for example, that Brown would go to jail and that if Jensen were disbarred, Therese's alimony would be lowered. Jensen knew that Therese and Brown were represented because he copied their attorneys on these communications. Jensen also harassed the attorneys, calling Olson a \"shill\" and Layman \"dirtball scum.\" Ex. A-508; FFCL 92. Layman, Hill, and Olson all asked Jensen to stop communicating with their clients, and Brown asked Jensen to stop communicating directly with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Further litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Jensen continued to litigate in Minnesota. On April 28, 2015, Minnesota's Anoka County District Court granted Therese and Brown's motion for sanctions against Jensen. The court found that Jensen had made misrepresentations of fact in his pleadings and acted in a \"vexatious and oppressive manner.\" Ex. A-601; FFCL 98. On June 2, 2015, it imposed $20,747.50 in sanctions against Jensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 On June 16, 2015, the district court ordered Jensen to stop contacting Therese and Brown. On June 21, 2015, the district court found that Jensen had repeatedly brought motions and pleadings in which he misrepresented facts and which had little or no basis in law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Prior discipline\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Jensen has been previously disciplined in Minnesota, where he was admitted to practice law in 1985, for misconduct similar to that at issue in this case. In 1991, the Minnesota Supreme Court reprimanded Jensen for mishandling money held in trust, disobeying a court order to return funds, violating procedural rules of appeal, disobeying Court of Appeals orders, making ex parte communications with Court of Appeals judges, and incompetently representing a client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 In 1995, the Minnesota Supreme Court admonished Jensen for abusive behavior toward someone who had filed an ethics complaint against him. In 1996, the Minnesota Supreme Court suspended Jensen's law license indefinitely for asserting frivolous claims, making false statements to a tribunal, and disobeying obligations under that tribunal's rules, and for conduct involving misrepresentations and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In 1999, Jensen was reinstated to practice law in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. Procedural history\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Based on the above conduct, the WSBA charged Jensen with six counts of violating the RPCs. Jensen filed an answer, and the parties engaged in informal discovery under ELC 10.11. Acting under ELC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   10.11 (d), the hearing officer denied Jensen's request for additional formal discovery, including, inter alia, requests to serve interrogatories on nonparties and requests to produce privileged information. Jensen then informed the WSBA, \"I will not attend the hearing,\" and, \"I will save my arguing for the appeal to the Supreme Court.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 034 (e-mail from Jensen to Erica Temple, WSBA Disciplinary Counsel (June 22, 2016, 2:45 PM PDT) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 Jensen did not attend his hearing. The hearing officer found that the WSBA proved all six counts by a clear preponderance of the evidence. Applying the American Bar Association's\n   <em>\n    Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\n   </em>\n   (1991 &amp; Supp. 1992) (ABA\n   <em>\n    Standards),\n   </em>\n   the hearing officer noted that the presumptive sanction was disbarment. He found that no mitigating factors applied and that eight aggravating factors applied: (1) prior disciplinary offenses, (2) dishonest or selfish motive, (3) a pattern of misconduct, (4) multiple offenses, (5) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, (6) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct, (7) vulnerability of victim, and (8) substantial experience in the practice of law. The hearing officer recommended disbarment and further recommended that \"[a]s a condition of reinstatement from any suspension or disbarment, [Jensen] shall pay any and all judgements owed by him to Therese Jensen, James Brown, and/or the Therese Brown Jensen Trust.\" FFCL 138. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A.

Under RPC 8.4(d), it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \"engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\" Under RPC 8.4(j), it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \"willfully disobey or violate a court order directing him ... to do or cease doing an act which he ... ought in good faith to do or forbear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 28 There is substantial evidence in the record for the hearing officer to reasonably have found by a clear preponderance of the evidence that Jensen violated RPC 8.4(d) and (j). First, the record supports a finding that Jensen violated the December 24, 2013 order granting Therese, as part of their dissolution proceedings, sole authority to list the Mukilteo house for sale. Jensen placed his own \"for sale by owner\" sign on the property, refused to remove his sign, tore the \"for sale\" sign of Therese's listing agent out of the ground, placed a note on the front door warning\n   potential buyers that the property was unlikely to have clear title, and e-mailed Therese's attorney and her listing agent, telling them that they could not sell the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29 Second, the record supports a finding that Jensen violated the February 10, 2014 court order directing Jensen to \"fully cooperate\" with the sale \"up to [the] point of signing closing document.\" Ex. A-220; FFCL 27. He continued to leave his \"for sale by owner\" sign on the lawn. He also told the first prospective buyer's agent that he intended to block the sale by refusing to sign the sale documents, unless the buyer agreed to secretly pay Jensen $50,000 outside of the sale and escrow process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 30 Third, the record supports a finding that Jensen violated the February 20, 2014 court order directing Jensen to \"execute any and all necessary documents to effectuate the closing of the sale.\" FFCL 38; Ex. A-235. He continued to refuse to sign sale documents, causing the first buyer to back out of the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31 Fourth, the record supports a finding that Jensen violated the June 30, 2014 order directing Jensen to sign the sale documents by the close of the business day. Jensen never signed the sale documents. After Therese convinced a second title company to close without Jensen's signature, he wrote letters to the buyers and their mortgage company claiming that the sale was void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 32 Jensen argues that because these were interlocutory and not final orders, he was not legally obligated to comply with them. Jensen cites no authority and offers no argument to support this claim. We have held that when a party cites no authority, we \" 'may assume that counsel, after diligent search, has found none.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because it is not immediately apparent that the argument is well taken, we disregard it. For the same reason, we also disregard Jensen's argument that RPC 8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct \"prejudicial to the administration of justice\") is overbroad and \"does not bear any review.\" Opening Br. of Appellant at 33 n.62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Count 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 The hearing officer concluded that \"[b]y repeatedly filing frivolous and/or vexatious motions and appeals relating to the sale of the Mukilteo home, [Jensen] violated RPC 3.1 and RPC 8.4(d).\" FFCL 120. RPC 3.1 prohibits attorneys from asserting claims or issues in litigation \"unless there is a basis in law and fact ... that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\" RPC 8.4(d) prohibits conduct \"prejudicial to the administration of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 34 There is substantial evidence in the record for the hearing officer to reasonably have found by a clear preponderance of the evidence that Jensen's litigation strategy violated RPC 3.1 and 8.4(d). At several points, Jensen agreed to the sale of the Mukilteo house. He failed to object to Therese's initial December 2013 motion seeking \" 'control and authority' \" to list their real property assets for sale. Ex. A-253 at 6. He wrote to Therese and her attorney in January 2014 that she could \"go ahead and sell the properties\" and that he would not \"get in the way.\" Ex. A-207. He also represented to the superior court that he would \"fully cooperate with the sale.\" Ex. A-220.

Both courts eventually sanctioned Jensen for vexatious litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35 Jensen argues that his actions were justified by a good faith argument that under RCW 26.16.030 and RCW 6.13.060, courts lack the authority to give one spouse the right to unilaterally sell the community-owned family home. His continuing failure to acknowledge directly on-point contrary authorities, even after courts have brought them to his attention, undercuts this argument.

A-220, and Jensen stated in a subsequent motion that he had \"made no efforts of any kind\" to obstruct the sale, Ex. A-222. Jensen argues that these were statements of opinion, not fact, and thus do not fall under RPC 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4(c). But there is substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officer's finding that Jensen made false allegations of material fact to the superior court. Prior to these statements, Jensen had placed his own \"for sale by owner\" sign on the lawn, torn the listing agent's sign out of the ground, and placed a \"Buyer Beware\" Post-it Note on the door. After making these statements, Jensen left his sign on the lawn; called the first buyer's agent, threatening to block the sale; and consistently refused to sign closing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 39 With respect to the Snohomish County Superior Court, the record indicates that Jensen had already repurchased the Savage property for under $500 when he declared to the court that he was entitled to its $150,000 value. Jensen also declared to the court that Therese lost the Savage property by failing to pay its taxes.

Jensen engaged in similar conduct in this case. Jensen's frivolous litigation caused Therese and Brown to incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and also wasted court resources, and his misrepresentations to the public caused the first Mukilteo house buyer to back out-of the sale.

The hearing officer properly found that eight aggravating factors apply in Jensen's case: (1) prior disciplinary offenses, (2) dishonest or selfish motive, (3) a pattern of misconduct, (4) multiple offenses, (5) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, (6) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct, (7) vulnerability of victim, and (8) substantial experience in the practice of law. Jensen was disciplined multiple times in Minnesota for similar conduct. His repeated misrepresentations to the superior and district courts suggest a dishonest motive. Because lawyers \"given notice of [their] hearing must attend the hearing\" and failure to attend\n   without good cause may itself be grounds for discipline, ELC 10.13(b), Jensen's willful failure to attend his hearing constitutes an intentional failure to comply with the disciplinary agency's rules and orders. Therese, whose already severe multiple sclerosis is (according to the uncontested factual record) aggravated by the stress of Jensen's misconduct, is an especially vulnerable victim. And Jensen, who was admitted to the Minnesota bar in 1985, has substantial experience in the practice of law. Despite this experience, Jensen maintains that he did nothing wrong and refuses to acknowledge his role in his wife's physical and financial suffering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 51 Jensen's briefs do not address either of the first two prongs. Instead, his argument appears to be that under the third prong, the presumptive sanctions are disproportionate enough when applied to his conduct to justify departure from the Board's recommendation. Under\n   <em>\n    Behrman,\n   </em>\n   Jensen must provide a clear reason for departure from the Board's unanimous recommendation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751871\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/165/414/#p422\">\n    165 Wash.2d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20P.3d%201177\">\n    197 P.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He supports his disproportionality argument by briefly restating the reasons that he does not believe his actions constitute violations of the RPCs. Because we hold that Jensen did violate the RPCs, it follows that we reject his proposed reasons for departing from the Board's unanimous recommendation. Moreover, \"[t]he attorney facing discipline bears the burden of bringing to the court's attention cases that demonstrate the disproportionality of the sanction imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottingham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Wash.%202d%20450\">\n    191 Wash.2d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569352\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/423/818/\">\n    423 P.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Layman is a nonparty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ELC 10.1(b)(2). CR 33 - 34 allow interrogatories and requests for production to be served only on parties. CR 33(a), 34(a). Even if the hearing officer were to use his discretionary authority under ELC 10.11(c)-(d) to grant Jensen the right to serve interrogatories and requests for production under CR 33 - 34, Jensen could not serve them on Layman. In contrast, the WSBA is a party. But Jensen requested privileged information from the WSBA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   without any showing that he had substantial need and was unable without undue hardship to obtain their equivalent by other means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CR 26(b)(4) (requiring litigants to make such a showing when requesting discovery of privileged information)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ELC 10.1(a) (stating that the superior court civil rules \"serve as guidance\" in disciplinary hearings). Thus, the hearing officer properly exercised his discretion in denying Jensen's requests for formal discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 57 Jensen's third due process claim, which attacks the hearing officer's qualifications and volunteer status, is also meritless. Jensen argues that hearing officers \"do not even have to practice law.\" Opening Br. of Appellant at 28. This ignores the rigorous qualifications that ELC 2.5(b) requires of hearing officers, who must (1) be active members of the WSBA, (2) have been active or judicial members for at least seven years, (3) have no record of public discipline, and (4) have experience as adjudicators or advocates in contested adjudicative hearings. And while Jensen accurately points out that hearing officers are volunteers, he provides no argument as to why paid hearing officers would better ensure due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 58 Jensen's fourth due process claim-that the disciplinary procedure violates due process because the Board \"retain[s] the power to overrule the hearing officer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%20332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7-is nonsensical. Jensen argues, in effect, that his due process rights would be better protected if he had no right of appeal to the Board. This goes against the conventional wisdom in American jurisprudence that rights of appeal increase, rather than decrease, procedural fairness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary ProceedingAgainst Osborne,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452136\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/188/#p205\">\n    187 Wash.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20P.3d%20288\">\n    386 P.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (stating that the ELC rules \"ensure adequate [due] process by allowing for an appeals process\"). It is also at odds with his own purported strategy in this case, which was to skip the hearing on the grounds that it was a \"worse than useless ... travesty,\" Opening Br. of Appellant at 28, and save his arguments for the Board and this court. This claim, like Jensen's other due process claims, is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 59 Jensen did not attend his disciplinary hearing and entered no factual evidence into the record. The hearing officer found that Jensen violated the RPCs and recommended disbarment, and the Board unanimously affirmed. There is substantial evidence in the record for the hearing officer to have reasonably found that Jensen violated the RPCs, and Jensen presents no clear reason to depart from the Board's unanimous recommendation of disbarment. For these reasons, we adopt the recommendation of the hearing officer and the Board and disbar Jensen from the practice of law. As a condition of reinstatement, Jensen must pay all judgments owed by him to Therese Jensen, James Brown, and the Therese Brown Jensen Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Johnson, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Madsen, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Owens, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Stephens, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Wiggins, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Gordon McCloud, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Yu, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    We use Therese Jensen's first name in this opinion for clarity and intend no disrespect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Instead the record contains a declaration from the WSBA counsel, stating that the WSBA provided Jensen with nonprivileged documents obtained during the course of its investigation and that the WSBA public records officer confirmed with the WSBA counsel that as of April 8, 2016, she had not received any requests from Jensen for information.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    For example, Jensen requested production of notes from disciplinary counsel's internal communications, information related to any \"consulting experts,\" confidential disciplinary information about any lawyers who might be called as witnesses, and \"any notes of any attorney-client privileged or other confidential client information in [the WSBA's] possession relative to this case.\" CP at 016 (Interrogs. and Req. for Produc. of Docs.
