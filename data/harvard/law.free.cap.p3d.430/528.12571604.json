Its case title, cause number, and disposition shall be included in this Court's quarterly list of noncitable cases published in the Pacific Reporter and Montana Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Shawn Earl McDowell appeals from the Order of the First Judicial District, Broadwater County, denying McDowell's Petition for Postconviction Relief (PCR). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 24, 2008, the State charged McDowell with attempted deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary. McDowell was indigent, and Kristina Neal of the Helena Office of Public Defender (OPD) was appointed to represent him. Initially, their relationship was amicable. However, Neal and McDowell both testified the relationship deteriorated when Neal would not file certain motions for McDowell, and McDowell felt Neal was not doing enough on his behalf. Due to the strained relationship with Neal, and against her advice, McDowell began filing his own pleadings with the District Court. Without resolution of McDowell's pro se filings, and on Neal's motion, the District Court vacated the scheduled trial date and set a change of plea hearing and status hearing for January 9, 2009. The parties had reached a plea agreement whereby the State would reduce the attempted homicide charge to assault with a weapon and make certain sentencing recommendations to the District Court. At the January 9, 2009 hearing, McDowell declined to change his plea as contemplated and stated that he no longer wanted OPD representation and intended to either hire private counsel or proceed pro se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court set another status hearing for January 30, 2009. The District Court requested that Neal appear at that hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On January 30, 2009, McDowell appeared in chambers with Neal, Prosecutor John Flynn, and Judge Dorothy McCarter for a status hearing. It is unclear whether Neal acted in her capacity as counsel or to provide standby representation to McDowell. There is no mechanical recording of the meeting, and no court reporter was present. Both McDowell and Neal recall Judge McCarter advising McDowell he should accept the plea agreement because it was \"a good deal,\" a \"great offer,\" \"the best deal\" he could get, and that it would be \"unwise\" to reject the agreement. Neal did not object to Judge McCarter's comments, either at the time of the hearing or afterwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On April 24, 2009, the State filed an Amended Information and Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty. Pursuant to the Amended Information, McDowell was charged with assault with a weapon, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, and felony burglary, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA. The same day, McDowell signed an acknowledgment and waiver, and pled\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to the State's charges.\n   <em>\n    State v. McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745575\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/360/83/\">\n    2011 MT 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745575\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/360/83/\">\n    360 Mont. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745575\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/360/83/\">\n    253 P.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On May 28, 2009, McDowell obtained new OPD representation, Bryan Norcross. On June 12, 2009, the District Court held a sentencing hearing. Through Judge Jeffery Sherlock, the District Court imposed a twenty-year prison sentence, with five years suspended, on the count of assault with a weapon and a twenty-year sentence, with ten years suspended, on the count of burglary, to run concurrent to the assault conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On June 10, 2010, McDowell moved to withdraw his plea, and the District Court denied his Motion. McDowell appealed, arguing (1) Prosecutor Flynn breached the plea agreement, and (2) the District Court erred for not crediting McDowell for time served.\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. In 2011, this Court affirmed McDowell's convictions and remanded for the sole purpose of crediting McDowell's pre-conviction time served.\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. McDowell did not further appeal his judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 On May 1, 2012, McDowell filed a pro se PCR Petition. The State filed an objection. In McDowell's May 29, 2012 reply to the State's objection and in his October 27, 2014 amended PCR Petition, McDowell argued, in relevant part, that Judge McCarter impermissibility participated in the plea negotiations and this participation had a coercive effect on his decision to accept the State's plea offer. He also argued Neal was ineffective when she failed to object to Judge McCarter's improper participation during the plea negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 On September 9, 2016, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing into the merits of McDowell's PCR Petition. The parties offered evidence and testimony and subsequently submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. McDowell testified that although he wanted to \"go to trial,\" he nevertheless \"felt forced to plead guilty and accept the bargain or [ ] proceed to trial and face certain conviction.\" McDowell testified that he \"felt there was no other option\" but to plead\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   . McDowell stated, \"I felt what Judge McCarter said to me and what [ ] Neal said was the right way to go.\" When asked by the District Court what would have happened had Neal objected to Judge McCarter's comments or advised him to ignore them, McDowell testified, \"I more likely would have thought about what was going on. But at the time I felt like she wasn't doing her job or she wouldn't even object to anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Neal testified that throughout her representation of McDowell, McDowell was frustrated by the slow pace of his case and with the State's evidence against him, and that he went back and forth on whether he wanted to accept a plea offer from the State. Neal testified that Judge McCarter's comments during the status hearing struck her as odd and potentially coercive at the time, but that she did object or raise concerns. Neal testified that, in hindsight, she worried that raising a contemporaneous objection to the comments would have angered Judge McCarter. Neal testified that she never discussed Judge McCarter's comments with McDowell. Neal stated McDowell never explicitly commented on or indicated Judge McCarter's comments had any effect on his decision to accept the guilty plea. However, Neal admitted their relationship was strained and that McDowell might not have shared his concerns with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 Norcross also testified. He could not recall any conversation with McDowell regarding Judge McCarter's comments. He testified that had McDowell raised such concerns, Norcross would certainly have included them in the Motion to Withdraw McDowell's Guilty Plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 The District Court denied McDowell's PCR Petition. McDowell appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 We review a district court's denial of a PCR petition to determine whether the district court's findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct.\n   <em>\n    Wilkes v.

The District Court concluded that Judge McCarter's comments were not coercive as evidenced by: (1) the unclear status of whether McDowell was representing himself or not at the status hearing; (2) McDowell never identifying the comments as coercive through multiple fillings with multiple parties over several years until his May 2012 response to the State's objection to his PCR Petition; (3) McDowell's testimony at the evidentiary hearing that he did not give much weight to Judge McCarter's comments about rejecting the plea offer; (4) McDowell's persistence and desire to go to trial even after Judge McCarter's comments; (5) the passage of three months between the comments and McDowell's plea entry; and (6) McDowell's sentencing by a different judge. The District Court determined that McDowell failed to meet his burden to show it was reasonably probable that but for Neal's failure to object to Judge McCarter's comments or to advise McDowell to ignore them, he would not have changed his plea and instead would have insisted on going to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 The District Court's determination that Judge McCarter's comments did not coerce McDowell into entering his plea was not clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkes\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. Because Judge McCarter's comments lacked coercive effect, McDowell has failed to demonstrate actual prejudice under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stock\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. It is therefore unnecessary to analyze the merits of the first prong.\n   <em>\n    See Whitlow\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. The District Court properly denied McDowell's PCR Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkes\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    Ellenburg\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 We have determined to decide this case pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 3(c) of our Internal Operating Rules, which provides for memorandum opinions.
