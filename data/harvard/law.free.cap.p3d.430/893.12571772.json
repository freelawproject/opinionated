Stoute (Stoute) appeals from the September 2, 2016 District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment (Judgment). After a bench trial, the District Court convicted Stoute of Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Third Degree (Promoting Drugs 3), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1249(1) (2014),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced him to five days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Stoute contends that the District Court did not obtain an on-the-record waiver of his constitutional right to counsel and did not obtain a valid waiver of Stoute's right to testify in his own defense at trial. In addition, he argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon review of the record on appeal and the relevant legal authorities, giving due consideration to the issues presented and the arguments raised by the parties, we resolve the issues presented as follows and reverse the District Court's Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stoute argues that insufficient evidence to support his conviction for Promoting Drugs 3 was presented as the State failed to present evidence that he possessed \"marijuana\" as defined.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is well established; namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the evidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case requires substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense charged. Substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. Under such a review, we give full play to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because this Court must \"ascertain that the [prosecution's] confession of error is supported by the record and well founded in law,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the State attempted to establish that the presence of THC and cystolith fibers\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the \"green vegetation\" recovered in evidence indicated it to be \"marijuana,\" the State presented no evidence that said vegetation was \"part of the plant (genus) cannabis\" for purposes of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 712-1240 and 712-1249(1). Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support Stoute's conviction for Promoting Drugs 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our resolution in Stoute's favor makes it unnecessary to address the other issues raised in his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the September 2, 2016 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered by the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The Honorable Adrianne N.
