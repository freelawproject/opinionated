The tender of the defaulted superpriority portion of the HOA's lien cured the default as to that portion of the lien such that the ensuing foreclosure sale did not extinguish the first deed of trust.\n   <em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/#p117\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/#p117\">\n    at 118-121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant contends that NAS's belief that collection costs were part of the superpriority portion of the lien constituted a good-faith basis for rejecting the tender. Even if such a belief would provide a good-faith basis to reject the tender, the record contains no evidence indicating why the tender was rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Nev.

Additionally, although appellant contends that (1) the tender was ineffective because it imposed conditions, (2) U.S. Bank's predecessor needed to record evidence of the tender, and (3) appellant is protected as a bona fide purchaser, we recently rejected similar arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n<em>\n    Bank of America,\n   </em>\n   134 Nev., Adv.

If the HOA had thereafter incurred such costs, it would have been required to issue new foreclosure notices if it sought to afford those costs superpriority status.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n<em>\n     Property Plus Invs., LLC v.

The letter refers to \"the facts stated herein,\" which can only be reasonably construed as contemplating the underlying foreclosure proceeding and not a future scenario in which the deed of trust beneficiary might again need to cure a default to avoid foreclosure. Nor are we persuaded by appellant's argument that the check's description contained a condition purporting to absolve the homeowner of liability for the remaining unpaid balance.\n   </p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n"}}
