We previously issued orders affirming the trial court's rulings that the measure qualifies for the ballot. We now explain our reasoning for those orders. (At the election, the voters rejected the measure, but that does not affect our pre-election decisions.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 2 Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona (the \"Committee\") is a political action committee (\"PAC\") that sought placement of an initiative measure on the November 2018 general election ballot. To that end, the Committee formed on February 9, 2018, by filing a \"statement of organization\" with the Secretary of State (\"Secretary\") on a form provided by her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 16-906(A). The statement identified and provided contact information for the Committee's chairperson, treasurer, and bank, as required by \u00a7 16-906(B). The statement did not identify a \"sponsor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-906(B)(1)(b), (2) (requiring a statement of organization to list information about \"any sponsor\"). On receipt of the statement, the Secretary issued an identification number to the Committee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-906(D), which was then authorized to perform lawful activities, including applying for an initiative petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-906(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 3 On February 20, the Committee filed an application with the Secretary for an initiative measure that proposes a constitutional amendment to \"require electricity providers to generate at least 50% of their annual sales of electricity from renewable energy sources\" (the \"Initiative\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-111(A) (setting forth initiative application requirements). The application was printed on a form issued by the Secretary, and it included the Committee's identification number where indicated. Upon receipt of the application, the Secretary assigned the Initiative petition a serial number,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-111(B), which enabled the Committee to gather the 225,963 valid signatures required to qualify the Initiative for the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 Two days after the Committee filed its application with the Secretary, NextGen Climate Action (\"NextGen\"), a California-based entity, made the first of several substantial contributions to the Committee (totaling more than $4 million in the first and second quarters of 2018 alone) by paying FieldWorks, LLC, about $140,000 to gather petition signatures for the Initiative. NextGen's contributions were publicly reported by the Committee in its mandatory campaign finance reports filed on April 17 and July 14. The Committee did not report receiving any contributions during the period before filing its application with the Secretary on February 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona, LLC (\"CEHA LLC\") formed on February 27, and the Arizona Corporation Commission approved its articles of organization on March 22. According to the Committee,\n   CEHA LLC formed to protect the Committee's officers from personal liability. The Committee amended its statement of organization on May 14 to identify CEHA LLC as its \"sponsor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-906(C) (authorizing amendments to the statement of organization). The Committee's campaign finance reports for the first and second quarters of 2018 did not reflect any contributions from CEHA LLC. The Committee did not list NextGen as a sponsor in the amended statement of organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 FieldWorks hired, registered, and paid more than 1500 circulators to collect signatures supporting placement of the Initiative on the ballot. On July 5, the Committee filed petition sheets containing 480,707 signatures with the Secretary. The Secretary reviewed the sheets for statutory compliance pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.01(A) and determined that 454,451 signatures were eligible for verification. She then randomly selected a five percent sample (22,722 signatures) for verification by county recorders for the counties in which the signatories claimed to be qualified electors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-121.01(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 Plaintiffs are qualified electors. On July 19, before completion of the signature verification process, they filed a complaint in the trial court against the Secretary, the Committee, all county recorders, and all members of county boards of supervisors, challenging the petition signatures on several bases and seeking to enjoin placement of the Initiative on the ballot. In an interlocutory judgment entered pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the trial court dismissed Plaintiffs' claim alleging deficiencies in the Committee's statement of organization. The court also dismissed the claims against the county recorders and the board members as unripe. In addition, the court rejected the Committee's argument that Plaintiffs can only challenge petition signatures within the random five percent sample submitted to the county recorders for verification. On expedited appeal and cross-appeal, in an order filed August 20 (with an opinion to follow), this Court affirmed the trial court's interlocutory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 Meanwhile, the county recorders completed their signature review of the five percent sample. After disqualifying some signatures and validating others, they established a 72.37% validity rate. The Secretary applied that rate to the 454,451 signatures eligible for verification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.04(A)(3), and concluded that \"the estimated total number of valid signatures is 328,908, which exceeds the 225,963 minimum\" number of required signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 Plaintiffs filed new complaints against eleven county recorders, alleging they improperly accepted invalid signatures during their reviews. The trial court consolidated these cases with the initial case. Although Plaintiffs raised several challenges, the core issue before the court was whether the Committee had obtained the 225,963 valid signatures required to place the Initiative on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 A five-day trial of extraordinary logistical complexity began on August 20. Approximately 5500 exhibits were admitted in evidence, some of which were thousands of pages in length, and more than fifty witnesses testified. Plaintiffs subpoenaed more than 1180 witnesses, most of whom were petition circulators. The trial court struck petition signatures gathered by more than 300 circulators because they either did not comply with their subpoenas,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-118(C), or violated statutory requirements when gathering signatures,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 19-112(A), -114(A). Ultimately, the court found that the Committee had gathered a sufficient number of valid signatures to place the Initiative on the ballot and therefore denied Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. On expedited appeal, we affirmed the trial court's judgment in an order filed August 29 (again, with an opinion to follow).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 This Court has jurisdiction over this expedited election matter under article 6, section 5 of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 19-118, -122. As noted above, we previously issued orders affirming both the trial court's initial Rule 54(b) judgment and its final judgment with opinions to follow. We have consolidated the appeals and provide a single opinion to explain our reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The defective statement of organization claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Plaintiffs argue the Committee filed a defective statement of organization on February 9 by naming CEHA LLC as a sponsor before it existed, failing to name NextGen as a sponsor, and failing to incorporate \"NextGen\" into the Committee's name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Plaintiffs assert, the Committee never properly formed, and the Initiative application was a nullity under \u00a7 19-111(A) because a valid statement of organization was not filed with the application. Because \u00a7 19-114(B) provides that signatures on initiative petitions \"are void and shall not be counted\" if collected by a PAC \"prior to the filing of the committee's statement of organization,\" Plaintiffs claim that none of the petition signatures here are valid and the Initiative fails to qualify for the ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacion v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055929\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/168/\">\n    225 Ariz. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055929\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/168/\">\n    236 P.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397 (2010) (recognizing that \u00a7 19-114(B) disqualifies signatures on initiative petitions collected before formation of a PAC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 The trial court dismissed this claim without deciding whether the statement of organization was defective, ruling that Plaintiffs did not have a private right of action to make this challenge. Alternately, the court found that Plaintiffs' claim was barred by laches. Reviewing the dismissal of Plaintiffs' claim de novo as an issue of law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. City of Mesa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060971\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/352/\">\n    230 Ariz. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355-56 \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060971\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/352/\">\n    284 P.3d 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 866-67 (2012), for the reasons below we affirm the trial court's ruling on the first ground and therefore do not address laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 Any person may \"contest[ ] the validity of an initiative or referendum measure based on the actions of the secretary of state or compliance with [chapter one of Title 19].\" \u00a7 19-122(C). The issue here is whether the Plaintiffs' challenge based on the statement of organization identifies grounds for invalidating the initiative measure. The Committee argues, and the trial court agreed, that Plaintiffs' claim can only be asserted under Title 16, which sets forth the required contents for a statement of organization and provides remedies for non-compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 16-906(B), -938, -1021. Plaintiffs counter that their claim arises under \u00a7 19-122(C) because it challenges both (1) the Secretary's act in accepting a defective application package and issuing an official serial number in violation of \u00a7 19-111(A) and (B), and (2) the Committee's failure to file a valid statement of organization with its application as required by \u00a7 19-111(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Before resolving this issue, it is useful to consider the interplay between Titles 16 and 19 concerning a statement of organization. An entity wishing to form as a PAC to support or oppose an initiative measure must file a statement of organization in compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B). That statute directs how a committee must be named and requires the statement of organization to list other information, including \"[t]he name, mailing address, e-mail address, website, if any, and telephone number of any sponsor.\" \u00a7 16-906(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 The statement of organization must be filed with a \"filing officer,\" \u00a7 16-906(A), who is either the Secretary, for a statewide ballot measure, or a county, city, or town officer, for a local ballot measure, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 16-901(27), -928(A). \"On filing a statement of organization, the filing officer shall issue an identification number to the committee,\" \u00a7 16-906(D), which implicitly evidences the statement's compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B) and authorizes the now-formed committee to \"perform any lawful activity,\" including making expenditures and advocating for an issue,\n   \u00a7 16-906(G). The committee must amend its statement of organization within ten days of any change in committee information. \u00a7 16-906(C). Importantly here, nothing in Title 16 provides that if a facially valid statement contains errors or omissions, it is a nullity and voids the PAC's lawful authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 Title 16 also provides remedies if a PAC's statement of organization fails to comply with \u00a7 16-906(B). On receipt of a complaint by a third party, the filing officer who accepted the statement of organization is authorized to investigate a violation of \u00a7 16-906 and refer any violation to an \"enforcement officer\" for further investigation and proceedings. \u00a7\u00a7 16-901(21), -938(A), (C), (E). (Depending on the identity of the filing officer, the \"enforcement officer\" is either the Attorney General, a county attorney, or a city or town attorney. \u00a7\u00a7 16-901(21), -938(C).) \"The enforcement officer has the sole and exclusive authority to initiate any applicable administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce an alleged violation of [ \u00a7 16-906 ].\" \u00a7 16-938(F). If a violation is found, the committee is permitted to avoid any penalty by taking corrective action within twenty days after issuance of a notice of violation. \u00a7 16-938(G). The enforcement officer may also initiate civil or criminal proceedings to enforce provisions of Title 16, including \u00a7 16-906.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-1021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 A PAC that proposes a statewide or local initiative measure must apply for an official petition serial number by filing an application with the Secretary on a form provided by her. \u00a7 19-111(A). The application must provide identifying information, the text of the proposed initiative, and a 100-word summary of the initiative's principal provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060971\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 The committee must also simultaneously file \"its statement of organization\" with the Secretary, and if it fails to do so, she is prohibited from accepting the application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060971\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If a committee files an application with an accompanying statement of organization, the Secretary \"shall assign an official serial number to the petition,\" which is affixed to all petition sheets circulated for signatures. \u00a7 19-111(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-112 (addressing petition signatures). Signatures collected on initiative petition sheets by a PAC or its agents \"prior to the filing of the committee's statement of organization are void and shall not be counted in determining the legal sufficiency of the petition.\" \u00a7 19-114(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 We agree with the trial court that \u00a7 19-122(C) does not authorize Plaintiffs to either challenge the Secretary's actions or contest the validity of the Initiative based on the statement of organization's alleged non-compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B). Those claims do not arise under Title 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 First, \u00a7 19-111 is not the statutory vehicle for validating a statement of organization. Instead, that statute requires an initiative applicant to file an existing statement of organization, presumably to demonstrate its lawful authority to file an application. There is no requirement in \u00a7 19-111 to disclose an existing sponsor, as the dissent repeatedly states. Because a PAC is not formed and cannot perform lawful activities until its statement of organization is filed with the appropriate filing officer under Title 16, \u00a7 19-111(A) necessarily contemplates that the statement of organization has previously been filed and an identification number issued under Title 16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-111(A) (requiring the applicant to file \"its statement of organization\"). Here, for example, the Committee's application included the statement of organization identification number issued under Title 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Second, an applicant satisfies \u00a7 19-111(A) by filing its existing statement of organization, even if the statement contains an error or omission. Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 19-111(A) must require a valid statement of organization or applicants could bypass legislative intent by simply jotting \"statement of organization\" on a paper and filing it. We agree that \u00a7 19-111(A) requires an applicant to file a facially valid statement of organization; a bare scribbling would not suffice. But a statement of organization bearing an identification number issued by the appropriate filing officer demonstrates compliance with \u00a7 16-906.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b616. The PAC is formed and may engage in lawful activity, such as filing an initiative application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 16-906(G), 19-111(A). In short, a statement of organization filed under \u00a7 16-906\n   and accepted by the filing officer, as evidenced by issuance of an identification number, is valid for purposes of \u00a7 19-111(A), even if it contains errors or omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Third, the Secretary is statutorily required to assign an official serial number upon the applicant's filing of an application and a statement of organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-111(B) (\"On receipt of the application [with the accompanying statement of organization], the secretary of state shall assign an official serial number to the petition....\"). Nothing in \u00a7 19-111, or any other provision in Title 19, authorizes the Secretary to investigate a statement of organization's compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B) or to reject an application if a statement is found lacking. Relatedly, nothing in Title 19 authorizes or requires the Secretary to disqualify petition sheets or signatures if the statement of organization, or any amendments to it, did not comply with \u00a7 16-906. In contrast, elsewhere in Title 19, the legislature has explicitly stated the Secretary's obligation to investigate the accuracy of initiative-related filings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(h) (requiring the Secretary to remove filed initiative petition sheets if the circulator was not properly registered at the time of circulation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Fourth, and finally, Title 16 establishes exclusive procedures for challenging a statement of organization. As previously explained, a third party can challenge compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B) by filing a complaint with the filing officer, who can then investigate and refer any violations to an enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 16-901(21), -938(A), (C), (E). \"The enforcement officer has the sole and exclusive authority to initiate any applicable administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce an alleged violation\" of the statement of organization requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-938(F). And if a violation is found, the committee is permitted an opportunity to take corrective action before suffering a penalty. \u00a7 16-938(G). Interpreting \u00a7 19-122(C) as authorizing a plaintiff to file a lawsuit to challenge an initiative measure due to an allegedly defective statement of organization would nullify these Title 16 provisions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler Law Firm, PLC v. Higgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20456\">\n    243 Ariz. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564648\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/1223/#p1226\">\n    410 P.3d 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 (2018) (\"Statutes relating to the same subject or general purpose should be considered to guide construction and to give effect to all the provisions involved.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 The dissent passionately argues that third parties must be entitled to challenge initiative petition signatures based on a PAC's failure to disclose a sponsor in its statement of organization so that citizens signing petitions are not misled. But the dissent fails to explain why this public protection goal cannot be achieved through Title 16. Here, for example, Plaintiffs could have filed a complaint with the Secretary as early as February and at least by mid-April (after the Committee filed its first required campaign finance report revealing NextGen as a substantial donor) alleging that the Committee's statement of organization was false because it failed to list NextGen as a sponsor. The Secretary could have investigated and referred any violation to the Attorney General, and the Committee could have taken corrective action by disclosing NextGen as a sponsor (if required) or faced an enforcement action that may have nullified its statement of organization and thus its ability to continue to act. The benefit of pursuing the Title 16 remedy early is obvious: waiting until hundreds of thousands of signatures are gathered to address the issue, as the dissent contends should occur, risks disenfranchising citizens who signed petitions because they supported the Initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 In sum, even though the Committee was required to file its statement of organization with the initiative application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-111(A), the statement's contents are not governed by chapter one of Title 19. Further, nothing in Title 19 authorizes the Secretary to reject a facially valid statement that did not, in fact, comply with \u00a7 16-906(B).

Subsection (F)(2) did not define \"paid circulator\" but instead described what the definition in (F)(1) \"[did] not include\"-employees whose primary responsibility was not circulating petitions. Subsection (F)(2) was an exception, not a rule. The caveat in (F)(2) (\"unless that employee's primary responsibility is circulating petitions to obtain signatures\") limited the exception and kept the employee category described in the caveat within the definition of \"paid circulator\" if (F)(1) otherwise applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 37 Plaintiffs assert that interpreting \u00a7 19-118(F)(1) as setting forth the single definition for \"paid circulator\" and viewing (F)(2) as an exception is absurd and contrary to the legislative intent, as evidenced by A.R.S. \u00a7 19-118.01. In 2017, twenty years after enacting the definition of \"paid circulator\" in \u00a7 19-118(F), the legislature added \u00a7 19-118.01, prohibiting circulators from being paid based on the number of signatures collected and declaring any violation a misdemeanor, but left the definition of \"paid circulator\" in \u00a7 19-118(F) intact. 2017 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 52, \u00a7 3 (1st Reg. Sess.). Thus, anomalously, circulators are prohibited from being paid by the signature but if paid by the signature, they must register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 38 Sections 19-118(F) and 19-118.01 cannot be reconciled.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

And assuming the 2017 legislature intended to nullify \u00a7 19-118(F)(1) and apply\n   (F)(2) as Plaintiffs interpret it, the legislature did not amend \u00a7 19-118(F) to reflect that intent.

Effective August 3, 2018, \u00a7 19-118(F) defines \"paid circulator\" as \"a natural person who receives monetary or other compensation for obtaining signatures on a petition or for circulating petitions for signatures\" unless an employee exclusion applies. Had this definition been in effect during the events here, the circulators would have been required to register. But it was not, and the trial court did not err in interpreting the prior version of \u00a7 19-118(F) as not applying to circulators paid by the hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 40 We also reject Plaintiffs' alternate argument that by voluntarily registering with the Secretary, the circulators were required to provide a proper service-of-process address per \u00a7 19-118(B)(2), and their failure to do so should have invalidated all signatures they collected. Section 19-118(B) provides requirements only for \"registration required by subsection A,\" which, as relevant here, applies to \"paid circulators.\" Because the circulators here are not \"paid circulators,\" subsection (A) did not impose the registration requirement that subsection (B) addressed. The circulators' voluntary registration did not require them to comply with subsection (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 41 Relatedly, the circulators' declarations that the information in the registration forms was \"true, complete, and correct\" did not make their registrations \"unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-118(D) (authorizing any person to \"challenge the lawful registration of circulators\"). Subsections (A) and (B), the only provisions addressing the requirement to register and the form of registration, were inapplicable. Nothing required any registration, voluntary or mandatory, to be made under oath. In short, even assuming the circulators made false declarations, this did not make their registrations \"unlawful\" and subject to challenge under \u00a7 19-118(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 42 Our resolution of this issue is consistent with the trial court's ruling that \u00a7 19-118(C) applied to disqualify signatures collected by circulators who did not appear at trial after being served with subpoenas. Unlike subsection (B), which applies only to registrations required by subsection (A), subsection (C) has no such restriction: \"If a registered circulator is properly served with a subpoena\" and fails to appear, \"all signatures collected by that circulator are deemed invalid.\" Thus, if a circulator registers voluntarily, he or she is \"a registered circulator\" and subsection (C) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 43 In sum, the circulators here were paid on an hourly basis and were therefore not \"paid circulators\" required to register with the Secretary. Their voluntary registration did not require them to comply with \u00a7 19-118(B)(2), and their failure to provide proper service-of-process addresses did not make their registrations \"unlawful\" and subject to challenge under \u00a7 19-118(D). The trial court did not err by refusing to invalidate 116,098 signatures collected by these circulators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exhibit C issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 44 Plaintiffs attached to their second amended complaint a spreadsheet identifying one or more deficiencies in 384,459 petition signatures (\"Exhibit C\"). At Plaintiffs' request before trial, and without objection, the trial court ordered the Committee to provide Plaintiffs with a written response to these challenges within eleven days. The Committee complied by providing its own spreadsheet, created from its pre-existing quality control research, identifying which challenged signatures had \"no problem,\" a \"potential problem,\" or were \"unreviewed.\" The Committee failed to make any notation\n   regarding several thousand signature lines because, according to counsel, the Committee had not conducted research regarding those lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 45 Plaintiffs moved to strike 272,245 signatures on Exhibit C to which the Committee had responded by noting anything other than \"no problem.\" They argued that Exhibit C was part of the complaint, and the court's order for a response meant the Committee was required to deny the alleged signature deficiencies or they would be admitted, as would occur with any answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(6). Relatedly, Plaintiffs later moved to strike about 46,000 signatures based on the Committee's failure to make any responsive notation to those signatures within Exhibit C. The court denied both motions, reasoning its prior order was one for expedited discovery and did not require the Committee to \"stipulate or admit\" to Plaintiffs' challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 46 Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred because the Committee's \"calculated decision not to admit the invalidity of signatures it knew to be invalid should not benefit the Committee.\" But this argument incorrectly presupposes that the Committee was required to admit or deny the Exhibit C challenges. The court's discussion with counsel that culminated in the order for a response to Exhibit C makes clear that the court entered a discovery order. Nothing required admissions or denials.

R. Evid. 1006. But Exhibit C was admitted in evidence, and the court relied on it in deciding the challenges, even though the court reviewed some signatures individually. Plaintiffs have not directed us to any ruling refusing to consider this exhibit or requiring them to address each signature individually, and our review of this voluminous record has not turned up one. It appears the issue was not raised to the trial court and is therefore waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , 245 Ariz. at 66 \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569724\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/230/#p240\">\n    425 P.3d at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 51 Finally, Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by failing to resolve challenges to 72,014 signatures based on various deficiencies, as set forth in Exhibit C. The court concluded it did not need to address these challenges because invalidating 72,014 signatures would still leave a sufficient number to qualify the Initiative for the ballot. Plaintiffs agree that this group of signature challenges is not dispositive but contends it could be in combination with other challenges. Plaintiffs do not ask us to remand to the trial court to rule on these challenges. Rather, they argue these signatures should be invalidated because \"the Committee failed to rebut [the] evidence\" on these challenges. But Plaintiffs fail to develop this argument. They do not identify which signatures comprise this group, the bases for objection, or what other evidence impacted these challenges. The Committee asserts it provided rebuttal evidence. In short, we cannot assess whether Plaintiffs satisfied their burden of proof as to these challenges, and we do not attempt to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569724\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/230/#p240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent Plaintiffs assert the Committee admitted these challenges or bore the burden to disprove them, we reject those arguments for the reasons previously explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs argue the court erred by relieving the Committee of the burden to demonstrate that the signatures were nevertheless valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 53 Before addressing Plaintiffs' argument, we consider the Committee's cross-appeal assertion that Plaintiffs were restricted to challenging signatures within the five percent random sample submitted by the Secretary to the county recorders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b66, and that the trial court erred by ruling otherwise. This issue is moot considering our holding permitting placement of the Initiative on the ballot. Because the issue is likely to recur, however, we address it to provide guidance in future cases.

Instead, the county recorders examine petition signatures in the five percent random sample and certify the number of signatures disqualified for statutorily enumerated reasons, including voter non-registration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.02(A), (B). These certifications establish a signature validity rate, which the Secretary applies to the total number of eligible signatures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-121.04(A)(3). Section 19-121.03(B) authorizes any citizen to challenge the county recorders' certifications, which, if successful, would change the validity rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 55 The Committee argues that because the random sample process provides the only mechanism for reviewing compliance with \u00a7 19-112(C) 's voter registration requirement, \u00a7 19-121.03(B) necessarily provides the exclusive remedy for challenging signatures on that basis. It adds that permitting a challenge to signatures outside the random sample would be unworkable because it could conflict with the valid signature count derived from the random sample process or result in double counting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 56 We agree with the trial court that Plaintiffs were entitled to challenge petition signatures outside the random sample based on voter non-registration. Section 19-122(C) authorizes any person to contest an initiative based on \"compliance with this chapter,\" which includes \u00a7 19-112(C) 's voter registration requirement. Nothing suggests that \u00a7 19-121.03(B) precludes such a challenge.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kromko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p59\">\n    168 Ariz. at 55-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p59\">\n    811 P.2d at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a former, similar version of \u00a7 19-122(C) \"permits any citizen to explore beyond the county recorder's certification and question the overall legal sufficiency of an initiative petition,\" and noting that \"[t]he elector status of each signatory ... is only one of the many facets of the court's inquiry into whether a petition is legally sufficient under \u00a7 19-122(C)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 57 We are not persuaded that permitting a challenge that encompasses signatures outside the random sample would be so unworkable that the legislature could not have intended to authorize it. The random sample process establishes procedures for the Secretary and county recorders to follow to determine whether an initiative has a sufficient number of valid signatures for placement on the ballot. Those officials are not required to exclude any non-compliant signatures identified in a private action under \u00a7 19-122(C). If the valid signature count totaled by the Secretary would qualify the measure for the ballot while the count identified by the \u00a7 19-122(C) plaintiff would not, the trial court would resolve the conflict as it resolves other conflicts in election challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 58 Turning now to Plaintiffs' challenge, we confront a signature calculation dispute. The trial court found that 116,237 signatures were subject to objection 12 while Plaintiffs contend that the correct number is 179,119. Resolving the dispute is imperative. Even if 116,237 signatures are invalidated, the Initiative petition would still exceed the 225,963 signatures required to place the Initiative on the ballot (401,455 - 116,237 = 285,218). But if Plaintiffs' calculation is correct, the Initiative petition would fail to meet the required mark (401,455 - 179,119 = 222,336).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 59 Plaintiffs have not shown that the trial court erred by finding that objection 12 applied to 116,237 signatures. To support its 179,119 calculation, Plaintiffs rely on a chart created for this appeal, which they say is derived from four trial exhibits. But Plaintiffs do not explain how 179,119 is calculated from the exhibits, which contain more than thirty thousand pages, and our cursory review was unenlightening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 60 In contrast, the trial court's 116,237 calculation is supported by the record. Objection 12 originally challenged 204,740 signatures. During trial, that number was reduced as signatures subject to objection 12 were invalidated for other reasons. At the start of the final trial day, Plaintiffs informed the court that objection 12 then applied to 117,519 signatures and introduced a demonstrative chart to that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   trial exhibit 5687. At the end of the day, Plaintiffs updated the chart to reflect that objection 12 applied to 116,237 signatures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   trial exhibit 5689.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 61 The trial court's finding that objection 12 applied to 116,237 signatures was not clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shooter v.

As they point out, the majority does not decide whether the NextGen Action Committee is a sponsor for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 16-906(B).\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b673. The dissent contends that NextGen had to be identified as a sponsor in CEHA's statement of organization and name. I disagree. When \u00a7 16-906(B) is properly construed along with other provisions in Title 16, NextGen falls outside the definition of \"sponsor\" even though it provided nearly all the contributions to CEHA after the political action committee's formation. Regardless of whether Plaintiffs can challenge the adequacy of CEHA's organizational statement or name under A.R.S. \u00a7 19-122(C), their claims based on NextGen's alleged status as a sponsor fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 65 Section 16-906(B) requires that, if a committee is sponsored, the committee must include the name of its sponsor in the committee's name. Section 16-901(47), in turn, defines a sponsor as \"any person that establishes, administers, or contributes financial support to the administration of a political action committee or that has common or overlapping membership or officers with that political action committee.\" If these two statutes were the only relevant sections of Title 16, our dissenting colleagues might be correct that NextGen is a sponsor of CEHA. Read literally and in isolation, these provisions might suggest that any \"person\" that establishes or contributes financial support to a political action committee is a \"sponsor.\" That reading is mistaken, however, because we must consider the \"context of the statute\" when interpreting its meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glazer v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329746\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/160/\">\n    237 Ariz. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329746\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/160/\">\n    347 P.3d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1144 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 66 Section 16-906 can only sensibly be understood in context. Under A.R.S. \u00a7 16-911(B)(9), payments made by a sponsor \"for the costs of establishing, administering, and soliciting contributions from its employees, members, executives, stockholders, and retirees\" are excluded from the definition of \"contribution\", which in turn exempts such payments from the campaign finance reporting requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 16-926. Thus, \u00a7 16-906 's requirement for the identification of a \"sponsor\" serves to ensure that the ongoing relationship between an entity and its affiliated political action committee (e.g., one operated by a corporation or labor union) is reflected in the committee's name and organizational statement, as such support is not otherwise required to be reported as campaign contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 67 The rationale for \u00a7 16-906(B) is further illuminated by other provisions of Title 16. In that title, there is only one provision that specifically authorizes sponsorship-\u00a7 16-916(B). That section authorizes corporations, limited liability companies, and labor organizations to sponsor a separate segregated fund. Such a fund must register as a political action committee. A.R.S. \u00a7 16-916(C)(1). Thus, sponsors are those corporations, LLCs, and unions that create separate segregated funds, and thereby may lawfully use entity resources to support committees that can make direct candidate contributions that may not be permitted for the entities themselves. Such a construction matches federal law, to which our own statutes refer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 16-916(C)(5) (referencing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030118\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 68 The fact that NextGen made nearly all the contributions to CEHA after its formation-contributions that were publicly reported pursuant to Arizona's campaign finance laws-does not mean that NextGen was a sponsor. Every functioning political action committee is established by some person, and all monetary contributions received by such a committee to some degree support its administration (either directly or by freeing up other funds for administrative costs). But creating a committee or making reportable contributions to it cannot suffice to make someone a sponsor. Such an interpretation would be contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 16-906(B), which expressly contemplates that a committee may not be sponsored at all. Moreover, requiring even major contributors to be identified as sponsors would be unworkable, as it would result in unwieldy committee names that could require amendment\n   as contributors change. (This problem is not avoided by the dissent's novel interpretation proposing that only those contributors who \"actually\" contribute to the administration of the committee,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at \u00b697, qualify as sponsors.) Instead, when considered in context, the term \"sponsor\" in \u00a7 16-906(B) is most reasonably understood as referring to an entity sponsoring an affiliated committee as allowed by A.R.S. \u00a7 16-916(B). NextGen is not such an entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 69 The dissent seems particularly concerned that not identifying NextGen as a sponsor could perpetrate some great deception on Arizona's citizens. But other provisions of Title 16 address that concern. Contributions made by NextGen to CEHA are subject to periodic reporting requirements-and there is no contention here that those requirements have been violated. Moreover, the legislature has specified when it believes it appropriate for committees to otherwise identify their major funding sources. In its current version, A.R.S. \u00a7 16-925(B) requires committees to identify in their campaign advertising the names of the three political action committees \"making the largest aggregate contributions to the political action committee making the expenditure and that exceed twenty thousand dollars during the election cycle.\" This requirement-which did not apply to CEHA because NextGen is not itself a political action committee-is narrower than the statute's predecessor, which applied to contributors broadly and not only other political action committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 16-912.01 (2015). (Incidentally, the principal committee opposing Proposition 127-Arizonans for Affordable Electricity-received all its funding from one source (some $30 million from Pinnacle West Capital Corporation) without identifying that contributor in its name or advertising.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 70 Our campaign finance and disclosure laws seek to facilitate free and open elections. Those same laws, however, are complicated, technical, and legitimately subject to persons structuring campaign strategies within the existing legal requirements. Those requirements did not require CEHA to identify NextGen as its sponsor. If that conclusion raises concerns about the adequacy of our disclosure requirements, they should be addressed by the legislature, and not by this Court stretching A.R.S. \u00a7 16-906(B) to apply in a way neither compelled by the statutory language nor recognized in prior administrative guidance or caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 71 I join in the majority's analysis regarding the interplay between Title 16 and Title 19 and its conclusion that Plaintiffs may not \"contest the validity of the Initiative based on the statement of organization's alleged non-compliance with \u00a7 16-906(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b620;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b626. But I share the dissent's concerns regarding the need for full, honest disclosure of those who actually spearhead and fund initiative measures, and the danger of misleading or deceiving petition signers (inadvertently or intentionally) when such information is lacking. In addition, reasonable minds may differ on the meaning and scope of \"sponsor\" as broadly defined in \u00a7 16-901(47), but on that point I join in the Chief Justice's concurring opinion. Given the sharp differences of opinion among the justices on the meaning, overlap, and application of key Title 16 and 19 provisions in this context, legislative review and clarification would be helpful so that everyone knows and complies with the applicable requirements regarding initiatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 72 The Committee received millions of dollars-essentially all of its funding-to circulate petitions for its Initiative from one source: \"NextGen Climate Action\" (\"NextGen\"), a San Francisco-based organization. Nonetheless, the Committee never disclosed NextGen as its sponsor. This conduct violated Title 19 ( A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 19-101 to -161) rendering the Committee's petition signatures void. As a result, the Initiative should not have been placed on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 73 The majority, however, never reaches this issue. Rather, it concludes that Plaintiffs, as private parties, have no remedy under Title 19. I disagree. Section 19-122(C) allows Plaintiffs to bring a private cause of action to\n   strike the Committee's petition signatures. As a result, while I concur in the remainder of the majority's decision, I dissent on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 74 Plaintiffs allege two separate causes of action under A.R.S. \u00a7 19-122(C). The first cause of action alleges that the Initiative is invalid because the Committee violated Title 19.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-122(C) (permitting \"[a]n action that contests the validity of an initiative ... based on ... compliance with this chapter\"). Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the Committee failed to disclose NextGen as a sponsor in its statement of organization, committee name, and initiative application. As a result, they contend that the Committee's statement of organization and initiative application are invalid, and all of its petition signatures are void pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-114(B). As to this claim, Plaintiffs have named the Secretary of State as a party solely because she is the public officer responsible for approving the Initiative for placement on the ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.04(B) (stating the Secretary of State must certify and approve whether an initiative has a sufficient number of signatures to be placed on the ballot).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 75 Plaintiffs' second claim is based on the actions of the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-122(C) (permitting \"[a]n action that contests the validity of an initiative ... based on the actions of the secretary of state\"). Plaintiffs assert that because the Committee failed to disclose NextGen as a sponsor on its statement of organization and initiative application, the Secretary of State should have rejected these \"defective\" documents and declined to issue the Committee a serial number to circulate initiative petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 76 I agree with the majority's conclusion that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a cognizable claim against the Secretary of State. No statute requires the Secretary of State to investigate or reject a statement of organization or initiative application that appears, on its face, to be complete. Moreover, as a practical matter, when these documents are filed, the Secretary of State does not have the time or information to determine whether they contain errors or omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 77 However, Plaintiffs' first cause of action under \u00a7 19-122(C) is distinct from its claim against the Secretary of State. Section 19-122(C), by its terms, provides that \"[a]ny person\" can \"contest the validity of an initiative\" based on \"compliance with this chapter.\" In\n   <em>\n    Kromko v.

This document, regardless of whether it was filed pursuant to \u00a7 16-906 or \u00a7 19-111(A), required the Committee to disclose the name of any sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b679.

When a PAC conceals the name of a sponsor during the petition signature process, voters may sign the petition without knowing exactly who is sponsoring the initiative. In short, voters are deprived of information that may have affected their decision to sign the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b681-83. Imposing a fine or suspension\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the voters have signed the petitions under these circumstances is not an adequate remedy.

There are several flaws in this argument. Based on the record, nothing would have alerted Plaintiffs that NextGen was a sponsor in February. The Committee's original statement of organization and application certainly make no reference to NextGen. Indeed, there were no public filings indicating NextGen's role as sponsor until the Committee's April 17 campaign finance report. As noted above, for the thousands of uninformed voters who may have signed the initiative petitions before that date, Title 16 does not provide a suitable remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b688.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 90 More importantly, assuming there was sufficient information to initiate a Title 16 action by mid-April, it does not follow that Plaintiffs are, as a matter of law, precluded from bringing an action under Title 19. If a Title 16 action had been initiated in April, this might have allowed the Committee to correct its defective filings and obtain enough signatures to place the Initiative on the ballot. But the duty to comply with the law is on the Committee, and its failure to do so is not grounds to abrogate the important right of all citizens in this state to pursue a private cause of action under \u00a7 19-122(C). In some circumstances early detection of fraud might not be possible; there is no guarantee that\n   such conduct will come to light before the filing deadline for initiative petitions. Section 19-122(C) serves as an important backstop in keeping the initiative circulation process free from fraud. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Kromko\n   </em>\n   , \"fraudulent conduct in connection with the circulation or signing of a petition may be very difficult for even state officials to detect,\" and therefore a private cause of action under \u00a7 19-122(C) is vital \"to keep[ing] the circulation process free from fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p59\">\n    168 Ariz. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459030\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/51/#p59\">\n    811 P.2d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Our statutes do not limit the definition of a sponsor to corporations and labor unions establishing separate segregated funds.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b692. Indeed, the Secretary of State, who drafted the current statutory definition, has not restricted the application of sponsor to corporate and union PACs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b679. In contrast, the Legislature\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   specifically limited the application of statutes regarding PACs based on \"separate segregated funds\" to those \"established by a corporation, limited liability company, labor organization or partnership.\" \u00a7 16-901(45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 97 Chief Justice Bales' concern that Arizona's broad statutory definition of a sponsor results in \"unwieldy committee names\" and eliminates unsponsored PACs is based on the unwarranted assumption that any person or organization contributing money to a PAC qualifies as a sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b668.

The Committee's first-quarter report (filed April 17) shows it received $957,346.67 from NextGen, while all other contributions were $0.

These reports do show NextGen's financial contributions to the Committee. However, this information was not available to the people who signed the Initiative petitions before the Committee filed its first campaign finance report on April 17. And, of course, if the Committee had properly disclosed NextGen as a sponsor, voters may well have learned that NextGen was sponsoring the Initiative when-by virtue of the committee name-they read the Committee's solicitation letters or watched its campaign advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 108 In either case, it is not up to the Committee to decide how it will comply with the law. It must comply with both the campaign finance requirements of Title 16\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the sponsor disclosure requirements of Title 19. Here, Title 19 required the Committee to disclose NextGen as a sponsor. It is no defense that the Committee believed the disclosure laws were not very effective, or that there were \"better\" ways to disclose NextGen as a sponsor. It is also no defense that other PACs, including those opposing the Initiative, may have failed to disclose their sponsors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b669.

Plaintiffs filed their \u00a7 19-122(C) claim ten business days after the Committee filed its initiative petitions with the Secretary of State. This does not constitute delay, much less unreasonable delay; indeed, filing suit before the Committee filed its petitions would raise issues of ripeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 110 Although NextGen's financial contributions have been available to the public since April 2018, it would be unreasonable to expect private parties to investigate and call attention to potential legal violations at the risk of foreclosing a then-unripe private cause of action-especially where there is no guarantee that a circulating initiative measure will garner the requisite signatures to qualify for the ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Senate of Cal. v.
