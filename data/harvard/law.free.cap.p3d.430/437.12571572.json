The respondent did not file an answer to the complaint. On September 7, 2017, the respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a joint motion for temporary suspension; the motion was granted by order dated September 18, 2017. The hearing panel granted respondent's motion to continue the hearing, set a date for a prehearing conference on October 4, 2017, and, after the prehearing conference, set December 5, 2017, as the date for the hearing. On December 5, 2017, respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a joint stipulation in which respondent stipulated to the admission of the exhibits of the office of the Disciplinary Administrator, to extensive facts, and to rules violations. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on December 5, 2017, where the respondent was personally present. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.15(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 3.2 (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

R. 246) (failure to cooperate in disciplinary investigation); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 211(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251) (failure to file answer in disciplinary proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"DA12724\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"16. In Douglas County District Court, W.S. was convicted of felony crimes. Years later, W.S. filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The Douglas County District Court dismissed the motion. Counsel for W.S. docketed an appeal on his behalf. The Kansas Court of Appeals allowed counsel to withdraw on behalf of W.S. and issued a stay on the appeal until new appellate counsel could be appointed. Thereafter, the respondent was appointed to represent W.S. in his appeal of the dismissal of his motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"17. After receiving notice that the respondent had been appointed to represent W.S., on June 1, 2016, the Kansas Court of Appeals lifted the stay and ordered that W.S.'s brief be filed by July 5, 2016.

On July 18, 2016, the Kansas Court of Appeals granted the motion, directing that the respondent file a brief on behalf of W.S. by August 4, 2016.

The order warned the respondent that if he failed to file W.S.'s brief by September 14, 2016, W.S.'s appeal would be dismissed without further notice. The respondent neither filed a brief nor otherwise responded to the court's order by September 14, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"19. On October 3, 2016, the Kansas Court of Appeals dismissed W.S.'s appeal. Thereafter, on November 16, 2016, the court issued the mandate. On November 14, 2016, Jennifer Bates, Chief Deputy Clerk of the Kansas Appellate Courts, notified the disciplinary administrator's office that the respondent failed to file an appellate brief on behalf of W.S., resulting in the dismissal of the appeal. The disciplinary administrator's office treated the correspondence from Ms. Bates as a complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"20. On November 15, 2016, the disciplinary administrator's office sent a letter to the respondent notifying him that a complaint had been filed regarding the respondent's failure to file a brief on behalf of W.S.

The letter reminded the respondent that he had a duty under Rules 8.1 and 207, to provide a response to the complaint. The disciplinary administrator's office directed the respondent to provide a written response within 10 days. The respondent failed to provide a written response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"22.

On January 5, 2017, Sherri Loveland, chairman of the Douglas County Ethics and Grievance Committee, spoke to the\n   respondent over the phone regarding the complaint filed against him. The respondent told Ms. Loveland that he would draft a response as soon as possible and provide copies to Ms. Loveland and the disciplinary administrator's office. Additionally, on January 25, 2017, Ms. Loveland also wrote to the respondent directing him to provide a written response to the complaint.

In August, 2016, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The respondent failed to file responses to the motions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"28. The district court scheduled a pretrial conference and a hearing on motions for September 21, 2016, 9:00 a.m. The respondent failed to appear at the pretrial conference. The district court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment.

The respondent failed to inform J.S. that the court dismissed the case. J.S. learned of the dismissal after receiving a copy of the order in the mail from the court.

Sometime after learning that the court dismissed the case, J.S. went to the respondent's office to speak with him about the order of dismissal. J.S. noticed that the respondent's office was open, but the respondent was not present. J.S. sent the respondent a text message informing him that he was in the building and was waiting to speak with him. After a period of time, J.S. entered the men's room near the lobby of the building. When he went in the men's room, J.S. found the respondent inside the men's room talking on a cell phone. At the hearing on this matter, the respondent denied waiting in the men's room to avoid J.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"31. J.S. asked the respondent about the order of dismissal. The respondent told J.S. that he was not aware that the case had been dismissed. The respondent told J.S. that he would have the case refiled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"32. The respondent did not take any further action on behalf of J.S. Additionally, the respondent failed to return J.S.'s phone calls after speaking to him about the order of dismissal in late September, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"33. Later, J.S. retained new counsel to determine whether the case could be salvaged. J.S.'s new attorney sent a letter to the respondent on January 3, 2017, requesting a complete copy of the file.

On February 24, 2017, Ms. Loveland met the respondent at the Douglas\n   County courthouse and accompanied him to his office so she could retrieve J.S.'s file from the respondent.

On March 20, 2017, Ms. Loveland contacted J.S.'s new attorney regarding his representation. The new attorney told Ms. Loveland that he still needed more documents from the respondent before he could proceed with J.S.'s case. On March 22, 2017, Ms. Loveland returned to the respondent's office and asked him to provide the documents that the new attorney requested. The respondent provided Ms. Loveland with discovery responses and electronic copies of other documents and pleadings from J.S.'s case. The respondent never provided the new attorney with the deposition transcripts, summary judgment pleadings, or the summary judgment order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"37.

Additionally, prior to bringing the claims against the title companies, the respondent failed to obtain the district court's leave to file a third-party petition as required by K.S.A. 60-214. Finally, the respondent failed to serve a summons or copy of the petition on the title companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"40. On February 5, 2016, the title companies filed a motion to dismiss the third-party petition. The respondent filed a response on March 2, 2016.

On August 29, 2016, the title companies renewed their motion to dismiss. The respondent did not amend the pleadings or file a response to the title companies' second motion to dismiss.

In late December, 2016, the respondent (falsely) told G.H. that he would be requesting that S.M.'s case be scheduled for trial.

The disciplinary administrator's office enclosed a copy of the complaint, directed the respondent to provide a written response to the complaint within 20 days, and informed the respondent that William C. Delaney, special investigator with the disciplinary administrator's office would be investigating the complaint. On June 21, 2017, Mr. Delaney left a message for the respondent to call.
