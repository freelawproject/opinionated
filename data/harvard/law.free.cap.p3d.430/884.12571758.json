A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4062(1). We hold that when a defendant commits a crime against his or her spouse and is charged for that crime, the crime exception to the anti-marital fact privilege allows the witness-spouse to testify regarding not only that charge, but also any charges arising from the same unitary event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 The City of Phoenix (\"the City\") alleges that H.C., the husband of Real Party in Interest Claudette Craig, called the police to report that Craig had been drinking and was attempting to leave their residence. H.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   tried to prevent Craig from driving by parking one of their cars behind her mini-van. Craig backed into the parked car, damaging both vehicles, which were jointly-owned by H.C. and Craig. Craig was charged with one count of criminal damage, a domestic violence offense under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1602 and -3601(A), and three counts of driving under the influence (\"DUI\") under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-1381(A)(1) (\"impaired to the slightest degree\"), -1381(A)(2) (blood \"alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more\"), and -1382(A)(1) (\"extreme influence of intoxicating liquor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Before trial, Craig moved to preclude H.C. from testifying about the DUI charges and to sever those charges from the criminal damage charge. Both motions were based on Craig's invocation of the anti-marital fact privilege. The municipal court granted Craig's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The City petitioned the superior court for special action relief, arguing that H.C. could testify about the DUI charges based on the crime exception to the anti-marital fact privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-4062(1). The superior court accepted review but denied relief. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that severance was proper because the anti-marital fact privilege precluded H.C. from testifying about the DUI charges.\n   <em>\n    Phx. City Prosecutor v.
