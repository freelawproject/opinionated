DFS dismissed Ms. Lietz from her position as a fraud investigator when it discovered that she signed daycare logs for her grandchildren that resulted in overpayment of DFS child care benefits to daycare providers in the amount of $196.95. Ms. Lietz appealed, and the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) reversed. DFS appealed, and the district court found that the OAH erred as a matter of law because it failed to apply the\n   <em>\n    Life Care Centers of America, Inc. v.

On remand, the OAH again found in favor of Ms. Lietz. DFS appealed, and the district court again reversed, finding that the OAH had improperly substituted its judgment for that of DFS. Ms. Lietz timely appeals from the district court's determination. We reverse the district court and reinstate the OAH decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Both parties present several issues, which we consolidate into the following issue and sub-issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Was the OAH's determination that DFS lacked good cause for dismissing Ms. Lietz supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   A. Does the good faith standard require notice and an opportunity to be heard beyond that which is contained in the employment contract?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   B. What is the role of the fact-finder in evaluating cause under the good faith standard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   C. Was the OAH's determination that DFS lacked good cause for dismissing Ms. Lietz supported by substantial evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Lucy Lietz, a fraud investigator, worked for DFS for just short of 25 years when it terminated her employment. The series of events that led to her termination began in May of 2010, when Ms. Lietz learned that her pregnant daughter was drunk and was driving with her three children from Fort Collins, Colorado, toward Casper. Ms. Lietz called in a REDDI report, and knowing that her daughter would be arrested, headed south on I-25 from Casper so that she could meet up with law enforcement and take her grandchildren if necessary. As she anticipated, her daughter was arrested, and Ms. Lietz began caring for her three grandchildren that night. The children were 9 years, 6 years, and 18 months old at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Ms. Lietz immediately sought daycare for the children. Because daycare for a child under the age of two is expensive, she applied for daycare benefits through DFS. In addition, because one of the children had a hereditary illness that required daily medication, Ms. Lietz applied for Medicaid benefits. Ms. Lietz was also eligible for benefits under the POWER program, which pays cash directly to family members who care for children who would otherwise go to foster care. Ms. Lietz testified that she did not apply for POWER benefits because she did not need the money to pay for the children's daily needs. That program would have paid Ms. Lietz approximately $550 per month during the time she had the children, for a total of over $3,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In late 2010, DFS received a \"complaint\" asking how Megan Juarez's (Ms. Lietz's daughter) children could be receiving public assistance when she did not have the children with her. Michelle Rossetti, Ms. Lietz's supervisor, was assigned to investigate. Ms. Rossetti set out to determine whether the children (and Ms. Lietz) were eligible for benefits. Ms. Lietz was eligible for benefits, including financial assistance for her grandchildren's daycare during the time\n   she was working or engaged in an otherwise approved activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 6] However, during her investigation, Ms. Rossetti discovered that \"there were days in which Ms. Lietz was not in an approved activity and yet DFS had paid for daycare.\" On eight days between June and October, Ms. Lietz was not engaged in an approved activity (she had taken personal, sick or vacation leave on those days rather than working) and therefore she was not eligible for DFS assistance. Nevertheless, she signed daycare time logs approving DFS payment for daycare on those days, which resulted in an overpayment of benefits actually due by DFS to the daycare providers of $196.95. Ms. Rossetti concluded her investigation without speaking with Ms. Lietz. Based upon her findings, on January 4, 2011, DFS placed Ms. Lietz on administrative leave, and on January 21, 2011, notified Ms. Lietz of its intent to dismiss her from her employment because she engaged in \"an act of intent to fraud the Child Care Program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Ms. Lietz immediately repaid the $196.95 overpayment and responded to the DFS intent-to-dismiss letter. In her response, Ms. Lietz admitted that she made a mistake when she signed the daycare logs without reviewing them, she explained that she signed the logs without thinking because she was under a lot of pressure caring for all three children and with her daughter in jail, but \"vehemently disagree[d]\" with DFS's allegations of fraud and theft. On February 10, 2011, DFS dismissed Ms. Lietz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Ms. Lietz requested a hearing before the OAH, and the OAH hearing examiner reversed the dismissal. The State appealed that decision, and the district court reversed, directing the OAH to apply the good faith standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Life Care Centers of America, Inc. v. Dexter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9345664\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/65/385/\">\n    2003 WY 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9345664\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/65/385/\">\n    65 P.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2003). On remand, the OAH again found in favor of Ms. Lietz. The State appealed, and the district court again reversed, finding that the OAH erred as a matter of law when it concluded that DFS failed to follow procedural requirements and because it substituted its own discretion for that of DFS. The district court also found that DFS met the\n   <em>\n    Life Care\n   </em>\n   good faith standard. Ms. Lietz timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act establishes the scope of this Court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (c) To the extent necessary to make a decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.

For a conclusion to be reasonable, it must be supported by substantial evidence gathered through an adequate investigation that includes\n   <strong>\n    notice of the claimed misconduct and a chance for the employee to respond\n   </strong>\n   . The facts in this case clearly established Lietz was not notified of the claimed misconduct and not given a chance to respond until after the Notice of Intent to Dismiss had been issued. Since Lietz was not put on notice and not given an opportunity to respond, there was not an adequate investigation, and this appears to make the decision to terminate arbitrary or pretextual. After a one-sided investigation, the [DFS] determined Lietz's violation of the Child Care Program Rules and Policy constituted flagrant dishonesty, insubordination, misconduct, theft, unsatisfactory work performance, violation of agency rules, violation of Personnel rules, and violation of the Code of Ethics. The [DFS's] witnesses concluded Lietz's conduct was intentional and that she deliberately attempted to defraud the State and receive benefits for which she was not entitled. It is difficult to understand how these conclusions could reasonably be made without obtaining Lietz's input.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   65. There is no question that Lietz signed a series of day care provider logs claiming day care benefits for which she\n   was not entitled on eight days in a four-month period. There is also no question that Lietz was not working on the days she received those benefits. The [DFS's] witnesses all concluded this was evidence of intentional fraud. This Hearing Examiner disagrees. Lietz was a credible witness and clearly explained she was under a lot of stress, signed the day care logs without properly reviewing them, and that she received benefits for which she was not entitled. It does not make sense to believe a 25-year employee who routinely applies the rules and knows the consequences of violating the rules intentionally violated the rules and attempted to obtain payment of $196.95 for which she was not entitled. Lietz made a series of mistakes by signing the day care logs for the months of June through September 2010, admitted this fact, and paid the amount in question. Lietz was eligible for a caretaker stipend of approximately $500.00 per month for taking care of her grandchildren instead of the State paying for foster care. Lietz was aware this money was available, but she chose not to take advantage of the program. If Lietz wanted to obtain money from the State, she would have taken advantage of that program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   66. This Hearing Examiner finds and concludes the evidence presented established Lietz made a series of mistakes over a four-month period, which does not equate to a reasonable good faith conclusion to terminate Lietz's employment.

The [DFS's] decision to dismiss Lietz is rescinded. While the [DFS] complied with the Personnel Rules' procedural requirement that a decision to discharge be based on an investigation of the facts and circumstances, it was not an adequate investigation. The evidence did not establish the [DFS's] decision to terminate Lietz was reached honestly, after an appropriate investigation, and for reasons not arbitrary or pretextual.

We address each of these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Does the good faith standard require notice and an opportunity to be heard beyond that which is contained in the employment contract?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b6 22] DFS first argues that\n   <em>\n    Life Care\n   </em>\n   's definition of cause does not include notice and opportunity to be heard, and as a result, the OAH misapplied the law when it examined the notice provided to Ms. Lietz and when it concluded that Ms. Lietz was entitled to notice prior to the issuance of the notice of intent to dismiss letter. DFS also contends that it provided all the notice that was required by the personnel rules (the contract in this case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b6 23] The personnel rules provide that \"[p]rior to the dismissal of a permanent employee, the agency head shall provide to the employee written notification specifying ... the reason(s) and summary of the evidence for the dismissal\" and that the employee be given ten days in which to respond to\n   the charges in writing. Personnel Rules, Ch. 11, \u00a7 3(d)(i)(A). DFS claims that it complied with this rule when it provided Ms. Lietz with the intent-to-dismiss letter and gave her ten days to respond.

The OAH was bothered by the fact that the investigation was \"one-sided\" and that Ms. Lietz \"was not notified of the claimed misconduct and not given a chance to respond until after the Notice of Intent to Dismiss had been issued [and DFS had decided to terminate her employment].\" The OAH concluded that this fact \"appears to make the decision to terminate arbitrary or pretextual\" and expressed its difficulty in understanding how the conclusion that Ms. Lietz intentionally defrauded the State \"could reasonably be made without obtaining Ms. Lietz's input.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b6 25]\n   <em>\n    Cotran v.

The OAH necessarily took those facts into account in its evaluation of the objective reasonableness of DFS's response to her conduct. The OAH was, however, entitled to make other relevant factual findings pertaining to its inquiry. The OAH properly examined the facts leading to Ms. Lietz's termination, including DFS's investigation of her conduct, the conclusions it reached, the reasonableness of those conclusions, and Ms. Lietz's circumstances. In evaluating the reasonableness of DFS's conclusion that Ms. Lietz committed a dischargeable act, the OAH determined that because Ms. Lietz had the ability to obtain much more money from the State through the POWER program than she had received due to the improper daycare time records, it was not reasonable for the DFS to conclude that she intended to defraud DFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   [\u00b6 35] The OAH did not apply the wrong standard when it reached the conclusion that DFS lacked cause to terminate Ms. Lietz, nor did it substitute its judgment for that of the DFS.

DFS argues that the OAH's conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence and that it had good cause, as defined by\n   <em>\n    Life Care\n   </em>\n   , because it believed Ms. Lietz, who was a fraud investigator, had defrauded it. Our review of the record reveals that the OAH's finding that DFS lacked cause to terminate Ms. Lietz's employment under the\n   <em>\n    Life Care\n   </em>\n   standard was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   [\u00b6 37] As discussed in the previous section, the OAH found that DFS's conclusion that Ms. Lietz intentionally defrauded the State was unreasonable and not made in good faith.

I didn't want\n   them to actually pay me money to take care of my grandchildren.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Lietz signed daycare logs that were submitted by daycare providers to DFS for payment. Those logs contained entries for eight days over a 3-month period on which Ms. Lietz was not engaged in an approved activity. She was accordingly not entitled to receive DFS payment of child care on those days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Lietz's error led to a $196.95 overpayment in benefits by the DFS to the child care providers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Lietz testified that she made mistakes in signing the daycare logs, but that she did not do so intentionally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Lietz was under a great deal of stress and pressure caring for her three grandchildren and dealing with her pregnant, alcoholic daughter who was in jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \u2022 When she discovered she had been overpaid, Ms. Lietz immediately paid the $196.95 back to DFS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   [\u00b6 38] Based upon this evidence, the OAH concluded that \"[i]f Lietz wanted to obtain money from the State, she would have taken advantage of [the POWER] program,\" that \"the evidence presented established Lietz made a series of mistakes over a four-month period,\" and that the evidence \"does not equate to a reasonable good faith conclusion [that there was cause] to terminate Lietz's employment.\" This evidence is relevant evidence that \"reasonable minds would accept as adequate to support\" the OAH's conclusion that Ms. Lietz did not intend to defraud the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coggins\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10, 421 P.3d at 559. Accordingly, we conclude that the OAH's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   [\u00b6 39] DFS also argues that it had the discretion to terminate Ms. Lietz's employment under the terms of the personnel rules that allow immediate discharge in cases of flagrant behavior at the \"sole discretion\" of an agency head.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Personnel Rules, ch. 11 \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.

Personnel Rules, ch. 12, \u00a7 7(g)(iv). Accordingly, the OAH had the responsibility to analyze whether DFS's conclusion that Lietz's behavior was \"flagrant\" was a reasonable one and thus justified a failure to apply progressive discipline procedures. Personnel Rules, ch. 12, \u00a7 7(g)(iv). It follows from the OAH's conclusion that it was unreasonable for DFS to conclude that Ms. Lietz acted with an intent to defraud, that Ms. Lietz's conduct could not reasonably be considered \"flagrant,\" and DFS should have applied progressive discipline instead of terminating Ms. Lietz's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   [\u00b6 41] The OAH's decision was supported by substantial evidence and complies with the law. While the OAH properly examined the adequacy of the investigation, it misapplied the good faith standard to the extent that it determined that DFS did not provide\n   Ms. Lietz with the notice to which she was entitled under the terms of her employment contract. The OAH's application of\n   <em>\n    Life Care's\n   </em>\n   good faith standard was appropriate and its conclusion that DFS lacked good cause to terminate Ms. Lietz's employment was supported by substantial evidence.
