Because Joseph Workman\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that either of these circumstances happened, summary judgment dismissal of his prescriptive easement claims was proper.

We affirm and also grant the Klinkenbergs their attorney fees on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Carolyn and Marvel (Marv) Workman, together with Clarence and Patricia Young, owned lot 129 of the Whidbey Shores development on Whidbey Island. In July 1982, the Workmans purchased the lot next door (lot 130) and sold their interest in lot 129 but continued to use a patio and stairway on lot 129 as guests of the Youngs. In 1990 and\n   1991, the Workmans transferred their interest in lot 130 to WCT Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 1992, David McClinton purchased lot 129 through a trust. McClinton and Marv were business partners and close friends. In about 1994, they agreed that the patio and stairway on lot 129, between their respective decks, would be a shared recreational space. Together, they paid for and built a brick patio, fire pit, and railroad tie stairs descending to the concrete bulkhead (the disputed area).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 When McClinton decided to sell lot 129, Marv requested that he have a \"first crack\" at trying to find a friend to buy it \"because of ... the joint area\" and in order to \"kind of continue this open concept ... between the two properties.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 359, 491.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 1999, Marv's friends, Jill and Lydell Knudson, decided to buy lot 129 with their family, Jerald and Sandra Lee Klinkenberg. When the Klinkenbergs bought lot 129, Lydell Knudson informed them \"that the Workmans occasionally used the Lot 129 brick patio and fire pit, and asked whether [they] would permit that use to continue.\" CP at 817. They agreed to give the Workmans permission to use the area. In 2009, the Knudsons transferred their interest in lot 129 to the Klinkenbergs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2013, Joseph, as trustee of WCT Trust, sent the Klinkenbergs a letter regarding the boundary and placement of a wooden planter box on the patio. In 2014, he sent another letter to the Klinkenbergs asking them to move the planter box \"pending clarification of the property lines.\" CP at 842.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 In 2015, Joseph, on behalf of the trust, filed a complaint in Island County Superior Court, alleging adverse possession, acquiescence, estoppel in pais, common grantor doctrine, and seeking adjustment of the boundary line. In October 2016, the Klinkenbergs moved for summary judgment to dismiss all four claims. Joseph amended his complaint to add claims for a prescriptive easement and easement by estoppel over the disputed area. At the hearing on summary judgment, the trial court summarily dismissed Joseph's claims on adverse possession (with the exception of a small area encompassed by a railroad tie planter), estoppel in pais, acquiescence, and the common grantor doctrine because there was no genuine issue of material fact that the Workmans' use of lot 129 was adverse rather than permissive. While not ruling on the added easement claims, the trial court did note that \"it seems fairly obvious that these claims have no merit,\" especially in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision on prescriptive easements in\n   <em>\n    Gamboa\n   </em>\n   . Report of Proceedings (RP) (Nov. 10, 2016) at 42. In that case, the Supreme Court held that there was no prescriptive easement where a presumption of permissive use existed and the claimant did not rebut that presumption by demonstrating a use that was adverse and hostile to the rights of the owners or that the owners granted the claimants an easement.\n   <em>\n    Gamboa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6791977\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/38/\">\n    183 Wash.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20P.3d%201214\">\n    348 P.3d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Klinkenbergs, relying on\n   <em>\n    Gamboa\n   </em>\n   , moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Workmans' use of the disputed area was permissive in its inception and permitted as a neighborly accommodation. They further argued that the Workmans did not make a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to their rights and that they did not give the Workmans an easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 In opposition to summary judgment, Joseph argued that the agreement between Marv and McClinton created \"an area for joint or common use.\" CP at 450. In doing so, he cited McClinton's declaration, McClinton's deposition, and Andrew Workman's deposition. The trial court granted the Klinkenbergs' motion for summary judgment, explaining that \"there is no evidence that any such agreement was intended to be a permanent, irrevocable right to use the disputed area.\" RP (Apr. 28, 2017) at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Joseph moved for reconsideration, arguing that McClinton's testimony as to McClinton's agreement with Marv inferred that their agreement was intended to be permanent when viewed in the light most favorable to Joseph. In doing so, he cited a new declaration by McClinton that stated the \"agreement was continuing and permanent\" and that they \"would never have invested the substantial amounts of money, time and effort\n   to construct the patio, fire pit, and stairs for an agreement for temporary use.\" CP at 195. On the Klinkenbergs' motion, the trial court struck this declaration because it was not newly discovered evidence. The trial court also denied Joseph's motion for reconsideration. In doing so, it entered a very detailed memorandum decision that outlined its evidentiary rulings and thoroughly explained its ultimate decision. The court concluded that \"it would not be reasonable to construe McClinton's general reference to 'an agreement' with [Marv] Workman to use the disputed area as giving [Marv] Workman a permanent, irrevocable right to use the disputed area.\" CP at 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Klinkenbergs then moved for an award of attorney fees and expenses. The trial court issued detailed findings and conclusions in support of its award of attorney fees, which totaled $131,749, and entered judgment in the same amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Joseph appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Prescriptive Easement\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Joseph argues that the trial court erred in concluding that there is no genuine issue of material fact whether a prescriptive easement exists over lot 129.

The evidence presented by Joseph does not raise a genuine issue of material fact that McClinton or the Klinkenbergs intended to give the Workmans a prescriptive easement over the disputed area.

It found that under RCW 7.28.083(3), the Klinkenbergs, as prevailing parties, were eligible for attorney fees on the adverse possession claim and its related legal theories that were dismissed in the first order on summary judgment. The trial court also found that they were entitled to fees for the easement claims that were dismissed in the second order on summary judgment because they were also the prevailing party on those claims. The court then applied the lodestar method for calculating attorney fees. First, it determined whether the hourly rates of each attorney and paralegal were reasonable. Some of the rates charged exceeded $400 per hour, and the court adjusted those down to $350, finding that rate to be justified in the locality, given the attorneys' experience. It then reviewed a breakdown of the hours spent per attorney, per category and included that breakdown in its findings. Although the number of hours charged was significant, the trial court found that several reasons justified the additional time, including the number of depositions needed; the time required to respond to Joseph's discovery requests; the fact that Joseph moved to amend his complaint shortly before the first summary judgment motion so that a second separate motion for summary judgment was necessary; and the fact that the Klinkenbergs had to respond to Joseph's motions for reconsideration on both summary judgment orders. The trial court also found that Joseph failed to \"identify a single billing entry ... as excessive\" or \"argue that the number of hours expended in any particular category of work was unreasonable.\" CP at 1127. The court did delete claims for time spent unsuccessfully opposing Joseph's motion to amend his complaint (totaling $7,003), and it deducted the overall award by five percent \"in light of the fact that [Joseph] prevailed on the minor issue of adverse possession of the small area occupied by the railroad tie planter box,\" which it found encompassed 22 feet-of the over 310 foot boundary. CP at 1125, 1129. In total, the trial court awarded $118,481 in fees expended on the litigation and $13,268 in fees for the fee petition, for a total of $131,749. CP at 1129, 1132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35 Although the total amount of fees awarded is high, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.

The trial court was well within its discretion to find that $350 per hour was justified in the locality for attorneys with the legal knowledge, education, and experience of the Klinkenbergs' attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 38 Finally, Joseph argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the Klinkenbergs attorney fees for defending the two easement claims on summary judgment because the trial court previously advised the parties that it believed\n   <em>\n    Gamboa\n   </em>\n   would be controlling on those claims. Regardless of whether the Klinkenbergs' attorneys knew what case would likely be controlling, they still had to spend time to draft and defend the motion for summary judgment. The trial court specifically found that \"the time spent by defense counsel preparing and arguing the second summary judgment pleadings was reasonable.\" CP at 1126. Furthermore, the trial court explained that it did direct the parties to\n   <em>\n    Gamboa\n   </em>\n   during the first summary judgment hearing and Joseph \"should have been on notice of the distinct possibility [he] may not prevail on the easement claims.\" CP at 1126. Although Joseph argues that the hours spent were not reasonable he does not take issue with any specific billing entry. Joseph has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in finding the amount of time spent on the second summary judgment motion was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Attorney Fees on Appeal\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 39 The Klinkenbergs request attorney fees on appeal under RAP 18.1 and RCW 7.28.083(3).
