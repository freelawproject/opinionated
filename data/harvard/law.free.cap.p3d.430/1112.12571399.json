What defendant challenges in this appeal are the judgment's instructions imposing a \"sex offender package\" (among other things, sex-offender treatment and registration; refrain from use or possession of nonprescription controlled substances, alcohol, and pornography; and no contact with the victim and the victim's daughter). Defendant argues that the court was not authorized to order conditions of an incarceration sentence, noting that only the Department of Corrections may do that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, defendant contends that the error is plain and asks us to exercise our discretion to correct it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred. We agree and accept the state's concession.
