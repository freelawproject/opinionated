This right persists even when an episode of incapacitation is unforeseeable. Should an employee invoke protected leave, including unforeseeable protected leave, an employer cannot use the employee's actions as a negative factor in a subsequent employment decision. Doing so would constitute retaliation in violation of state and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 While employed with Apple King, Maria Espindola discovered she was pregnant. Over the course of her pregnancy, Ms. Espindola experienced medical complications that caused her to miss work. Apple King was aware of Ms. Espindola's pregnancy and knew she had experienced some health problems. Nevertheless, Apple King used some of Ms. Espindola's work absences as negative factors in its ultimate decision to terminate employment. According to Apple King, Ms. Espindola was properly penalized because she failed to comply with the company's attendance policy, requiring at least one day's advance notice of all medical absences not involving hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Apple King's reliance on its attendance policy is unavailing. Because Apple King's policy did not account for an employee's right to take unforeseeable protected leave, Ms. Espindola's failure to comply with the policy was not a legitimate basis for an adverse employment action. Given that Ms. Espindola has produced sufficient facts to demonstrate Apple King was on notice of her need for unforeseeable protected leave, Apple King is not entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Espindola's retaliation claim. This matter is therefore reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Apple King operates a fruit warehouse and packing facility in Yakima County, Washington. Maria Espindola worked for Apple King from August 2, 2007, to April 20, 2012. On May 1, 2011, Apple King implemented an attendance policy. Ms. Espindola received and signed a copy of the policy on August 14, 2011. The policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   As of May 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , 2011, [Apple King] will put into practice a revised 24 point attendance scoring system. Each employee will have 24 points to use up between May 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   and the last day of April. You will start with 0 points and each attendance infraction will be counted in the following manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   NO POINTS will be counted for appts. with 24 hr. notice and proof of appt.2 Points for not giving 24 hr. notice regardless of proof2 Points for being Tardy2 Points for leaving before end of shift without proof of appointment3 Points per absence without proof of appointment (unless you use a Vacation Day)12 Points for a NO CALL-NO SHOWNo points will be counted for L&amp;I appointments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   If you reach the 24 point mark before the designated time, your employment with Apple King, LLC will be terminated. It is very important to understand that this will be the same for all Packing House employees. Every 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   of May each employee will start with 0 points once again only if they have managed not to reach the 24 point mark by the end of the last day of April. We strongly encourage you to set up your appointments on your day(s) off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 According to an Apple King representative, employees were verbally notified that no points would be assessed against them for attending funerals or for emergencies such as hospitalizations or car accidents. Apple King's attendance policy did not reference the federal or state medical leave acts. Nor did the policy explain how Apple King would account for leave that is protected under state or federal law. According to testimony from Apple King, the decision of whether to assess points for an employee absence is\n   determined solely by the company's attendance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 In June or July 2011, Ms. Espindola discovered she was pregnant and reported her condition to her supervisor. Ms. Espindola was then absent from work on July 20, 21, and 22. She produced a doctor's note dated July 21 stating she had been prescribed two days' bed rest. Pursuant to Apple King's attendance policy, Ms. Espindola was assessed two points for her absence on July 20 because she only provided same-day notice of a medical appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 In August 2011, Ms. Espindola developed kidney stones. Ms. Espindola was hospitalized from August 21 to 25, 2011, and submitted a doctor's note stating she was not clear to return to work until after a follow-up appointment on August 31. The doctor's note did not provide the reason for Ms. Espindola's hospitalization, but according to Ms. Espindola she had been hospitalized due to the kidney stones. Apple King did not assess Ms. Espindola any attendance points for her hospitalization. It is unclear whether Apple King knew of the reason for Ms. Espindola's hospitalization, but the company did at least know that Ms. Espindola had been hospitalized during the course of her pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 In the months following her hospitalization, Ms. Espindola had numerous medical appointments. Apple King was advised of the appointments, and Ms. Espindola was not assessed any attendance points for those absences. Ms. Espindola was also permitted to take time to check her blood sugar at work after reporting that she had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Ms. Espindola's gestational diabetes did not cause her to miss work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The last full month of Ms. Espindola's pregnancy was December 2011. During that month, Ms. Espindola left work early on three occasions. She was assessed two attendance points on each date. Also in December, Ms. Espindola missed a day of work and provided same-day notice of her absence. Ms. Espindola was assessed three points on this occasion. Ms. Espindola did not provide any doctors' notes explaining her December absences. However, Ms. Espindola has testified that she had told her supervisor she was in debilitating pain from kidney stones. According to Ms. Espindola, her supervisor provided permission to either leave work early or stay at home, as at times she was unable to work due to the pain. Apple King did not request medical documentation from Ms. Espindola to verify her explanations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Ms. Espindola began her maternity leave on January 9, 2012, and returned to work on March 4. During her maternity leave, Ms. Espindola reportedly had her kidney stones removed. Apple King did not assess Ms. Espindola any attendance points for her maternity leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Apple King fired Ms. Espindola on April 20, 2012, because she had exceeded the 24 points allowed annually by the company's attendance policy. The following chart illustrates Ms. Espindola's absences from work between May 1, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and the points she was assessed under the attendance policy:\n  </p>\n  <opinion class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Date\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Reason for Absence\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Points\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Record\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and/or Disposition\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    (CP)\n   </strong>\n   May 20, 2011 Unexcused Left work early (late proof of 2 239-40 appointment) June 6, 2011 Excused Dental appointment 0 252-53 June 10, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 252-53 July 8, 2011 Excused Illness (bladder infection) 0 254-55 July 12, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 256-57 July 20, 2011 Unexcused Left work early (same day notice of 2 38, 50, appointment) 258 July 21, 2011 Excused Illness (note from doctor dated July 0 38, 50, 21 calls for 2 days bed rest) 258-59\n   July 22, 2011 Excused Illness (note from doctor dated July 0 38, 50, 21 calls for 2 days bed rest) 258-59 Aug. 1, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 260-61 Aug. 21 to 25, Excused Hospitalization (note from doctor 0 262-63 2011 states she cannot return to work until after her follow-up appointment on Aug. 31) Sept. 9, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment (for imaging 0 264-65 studies) Sept. 16, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 266-67 Sept. 17, 2011 Excused Left work early (illness) 0 266 Oct. 11, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 268-69 Oct. 12, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment (for laboratory 0 268, 270 studies) Oct. 25, 2011 Unexcused Doctor appointment (no excuse slip) 2 243 Nov. 10, 2011 Unexcused Absent without advance notice 3 134-35, (called same day) 244, 756 Nov. 22, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 271 Dec. 9, 2011 Unexcused Left work early 2 245 Dec. 19, 2011 Unexcused Left work early 2 246 Dec. 20, 2011 Unexcused Absent (called same day) 3 134-35, 246 Dec. 27, 2011 Excused Doctor appointment 0 248 Dec. 30, 2011 Unexcused Left work early 2 248\n   Jan. 9 to Excused Maternity leave 0 38, 50, Mar. 2, 2012 59, 237, 306-07 Mar. 6, 2012 Excused Doctor appointment (for her baby) 0 273-74 Mar. 23, 2012 Unexcused Left work early due to suspension 2 249, 278 (work performance issue) Mar. 24, 2012 Unexcused Suspension (work performance 3 249, 278 issue) Mar. 26, 2012 Unexcused Suspension (work performance 3 250, 278 issue) Apr. 4, 2012 Excused Doctor appointment (for her baby) 0 275-76 Apr. 17, 2012 Unexcused Left work early 2 251 Ms. Espindola's employment was terminated on April 20, 2012, 237, 251 for accumulating 28 adverse attendance points\n  </opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 In July 2014, Ms. Espindola filed suit in Yakima County District Court alleging Apple King had terminated her employment in a discriminatory and retaliatory manner because she missed work due to serious health conditions. In January 2016, the district court dismissed most of Ms. Espindola's claims on summary judgment, leaving only claims for unlawful discrimination and retaliation under the state and federal family medical leave acts. In a letter decision dated June 22, 2016, the district court also granted summary judgment to Apple King on the remaining claims. The superior court affirmed on appeal.

Apple King contends that the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   analysis is inapplicable. According to Apple King, we should follow the lead of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and find the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme inapplicable to Ms. Espindola's claim.

Because the United States Department of Labor's regulation prohibits the use of\n   FMLA-protected leave as a \"negative factor\" in an employment decision, the Ninth Circuit recognized that an employee \"need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her taking of FMLA-protected leave constituted a negative factor in the decision to terminate her.

On July 20, Ms. Espindola became ill and left work early. She subsequently produced a doctor's note dated July 21 stating she had been prescribed two days' bed rest. A reasonable inference from these facts is that Ms. Espindola's absence on July 20 was related to the need for bed rest prescribed on July 21 and 22. Given that bed rest is a common prescription for pregnancy-related complications, a fact finder could determine that Ms. Espindola's notice was sufficient to reasonably apprise Apple King of the need for protected leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31 The second relevant time period was December 2011. This was the last full month of Ms. Espindola's pregnancy. According to Ms. Espindola, she told her supervisor she suffered from episodic debilitating pain due to kidney stones that required her to stay home from work or leave early. Ms. Espindola's attendance records confirm that in December 2011, Ms. Espindola left work early on three occasions and provided same-day notice of an absence on one occasion. A reasonable fact finder could infer that the absences in December were due to the episodic and unforeseeable kidney pain described by Ms. Espindola.
