The motion shall be served upon the representative in accordance with the provisions of Rule 25. If the deceased party has no representative, any party may suggest the death on the record, and proceedings shall then be had as that court shall direct. If an appellee dies after entry of the judgment or order in the court or agency appealed from but before a notice of appeal is filed, an appellant may proceed as if the death had not occurred. After the notice of appeal is filed, substitution shall be effected in the Hawai'i appellate courts in accordance with this subsection. If a party entitled to appeal shall die before filing a notice of appeal, the notice of appeal may be filed by the party's personal representative, or, if the party has no representative, by the party's attorney of record within the time prescribed by these rules. After the notice of appeal is filed substitution shall be effected in the Hawai'i appellate courts in accordance with this subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Roxas v. Marcos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/#p122\">\n    89 Hawai'i 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258910\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/89/91/#p122\">\n    969 P.2d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (1998), the supreme court held that an heir of an undistributed estate is generally not a proper party for substitution, unless he or she has been judicially appointed as the personal representative of the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It appears that the deceased party to this action, Dowling, has had no personal representative judicially appointed for his estate. Dowling III has presented no authority for the proposition that, by virtue of his serving as trustee of the Trust, he is a proper party for substitution in this appeal. There is no other appellee or cross-appellant. Accordingly, we conclude that it is appropriate to dismiss both the appeal and cross-appeal herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For these reasons, 808 Boats' appeal and Dowling's cross-appeal from the District Court's August 13, 2015 Judgment are dismissed; this case is remanded to the District Court to vacate the August 13, 2015 Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Honorable Melanie May presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
