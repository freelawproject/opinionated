The State alleged that Johnson defrauded elderly clients while selling insurance and annuities. According to the State, Johnson improperly accepted loans from elderly clients and transferred elderly clients' accounts to different annuities in return for substantial commissions without their full understanding of the penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Johnson pleaded guilty to two counts of felony theft, whereby the State dismissed the remaining charges. On May 17, 2010, the District Court imposed deferred sentences for six years on each count, to run concurrently. The District Court ordered Johnson to pay $87,339.50 in restitution plus interest and supervision fees. This Court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745842\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/360/443/\">\n    2011 MT 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20MT%20443\">\n    360 MT 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745842\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/360/443/\">\n    254 P.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Over the next six years, Johnson worked sporadically. He worked full-time for fourteen to sixteen months total, spread across three different jobs. He quit at least one job and was fired from two. By the end of the deferral period, Johnson had paid off $3,799 of his $87,339 restitution obligation. On May 12, 2016, the State filed a petition to revoke Johnson's deferred sentence for failing to make a good faith effort to pay restitution and supervision fees. At that time, Johnson had not made a restitution payment in seven months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 At a hearing on August 25, 2016, Johnson's probation officers testified regarding Johnson's lack of effort to find work. Johnson held out for high-paying, managerial jobs instead of accepting steady full-time work, albeit for less pay. Johnson confirmed his preference not to \"settle for something\" on the stand. According to one probation officer's testimony, Johnson would tell her \"about one position that would be in one state and then a couple weeks later it was a different job entirely, or he had to go to training for one and he would lose that one or quit because he was going to do this other\n   one.\" She stated she felt like she tried \"harder than he [did] to keep him on track.\" Johnson's work was \"sporadic at best.\" Another officer testified that Johnson, despite ample opportunity over the six years, had not made a concerted effort to maintain employment. He recommended the sentence be suspended, rather than deferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Johnson does not deny his failure to make regular restitution payments. He testified that his criminal record deterred employers from hiring him, but his probation officers stated that most probationers maintained full-time employment despite their criminal records. Furthermore, Johnson had a college degree, which his probation officers testified gave him an advantage many probationers\n   did not have. Johnson testified he completed 587 hours of community service, but did not receive credit because he failed to pay the required $1 per hour fee. He testified his income covered only living expenses. At one point, Johnson was living out of his car and showering at truck stops. He had a $58,000 tax liability, which the IRS stopped pursuing due to his indigence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 During this period Johnson collected unemployment ($4,433 in 2010) and received food stamps, but failed to inform the Department of Corrections of this income. From 2011 to 2015, Johnson received $500 per month following his mother's death. He also initially received commissions from his former work selling insurance and annuities worth $300 to $500 per month of taxable income. However, Johnson testified that by the end of his deferred sentence they were worth much less. Since 2010, Johnson made roughly fifty payments of an average $71.58. Meanwhile, he consistently paid $70 per month toward his credit card and $100 per month toward his daughter's student loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Based on the testimony and argument presented at the hearing, the District Court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The State has met its burden in this case of showing that there has not been a good faith effort in meeting the restitution obligations. The Court will therefore find a violation of the probation conditions ... imposed by [the court when it] deferred the imposition of sentence in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District Court revoked Johnson's deferred sentence and imposed a new sentence for six years on each count, to run concurrently, again deferred with the same conditions. Johnson was required to make monthly income and expense reports. Johnson appeals this decision, arguing he made a good faith effort to make the payments, but could not afford them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 This Court exercises plenary review over constitutional questions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A finding of good faith in the context of making restitution payments is similarly factual, and reversible only for clear\n   error.

The law requires full restitution\n   of deferred sentences, and the duty to pay remains with an offender until paid in full. Sections 46-18-201(5), -241(1), MCA. Revocation of a deferred sentence is appropriate where the State proves by a preponderance of the evidence a violation of the terms and conditions of the deferred sentence. Section 46-18-203(6)(a)(i), MCA. \"However, when a failure to pay restitution is the basis for the petition, the offender may excuse the violation by showing sufficient evidence that the failure to pay restitution was not attributable to a failure on the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the restitution payments as ordered.\" Section 46-18-203(6)(b), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Johnson did not make a restitution payment for seven months prior to the filing of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 The District Court found that Johnson did not make a good faith effort to pay restitution based on the substantial evidence presented by the State. Johnson had three probation officers over the period of\n   deferral. While Johnson argued that his criminal record deterred employers from hiring him, his probation officers testified that other probationers maintained full-time employment, despite their criminal records. Instead, Johnson's lack of effort and interest in working lower paying jobs kept him from steady employment. All three probation officers indicated that Johnson had not made a good faith effort to find consistent work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 Johnson asserts he made little income due to his struggle to find higher-paying work, and that he could not pay restitution because he spent his income on living expenses. However, Johnson's probation officers pointed to other sources of income (an inheritance, unemployment, food stamps, and commissions from former insurance sales) to explain Johnson's lack of motivation to maintain full-time work, and that he prioritized other monthly payments over his restitution payments. He consistently paid $100 per month toward his daughter's student loan, although he testified she could pay it herself. The District Court's finding that Johnson did not make a good faith effort to pay restitution is substantially supported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-203(6)(b), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Bucher\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17\n   <em>\n    2.
