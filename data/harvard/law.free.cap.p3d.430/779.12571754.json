The Campbell County District Court, for the Sixth Judicial District in the State of Wyoming, has jurisdiction and Venue in this matter, as all of the acts and omissions occurred within this Judicial District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2. The specific issues to be addressed by the District Court are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (a) On or about January 16, 2018, Thomas J. Roaber (hereinafter referred to as Claimant) filed a Claim for Wages (hereinafter Claim) against Badlands Energy Services, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Employer) in the amount of $5,025.40.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (b) On or about January 21, 2018, Employer submitted an Employer's Answer to Claim for Wages (hereinafter Answer) denying that any wages were due, as the Claimant was issued a paycheck for all money due and owing to him, less lawful deductions and withholdings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (c) On or about March 08, 2018, Employer received the Division's Preliminary Finding dated March 06, 2018 that indicated the Employer owes the Claimant $2,725.44.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (d) On or about March 10, 2018, the Employer submitted a request for review of the Preliminary Finding, citing its disagreement with the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (e) On or about April 05, 2017, the Employer received the Division's Determination dated April 02, 2017 that affirmed the Preliminary Finding and directed the Employer to pay the Claimant $2,725.44, stating that the Employer did not follow the Wage Offset Rules regarding withholding funds for unauthorized personal purchases and that the Employer did not pay overtime to the Claimant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (f) Employer maintains that the Division is incorrect and that the Division failed to appropriately apply the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (g) The Division has promulgated certain rules and policies that are intended to establish a procedure wherein Employers may withhold wages from employees known as the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services, Labor Standards, Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Filing, Investigation and Resolution of Unpaid Wage Claims under Labor Standards Wage Offset Rules (hereinafter Wage Offset Rules).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (h) Pursuant to Chapter 1, Section 6(b)(xi) of the Wage Offset Rules, the employer is entitled to deduct from an employee's wages any money that is missing that the specific employee had control or custody over during their employment. This would include a company credit card. Claimant admitted to using the company-issued credit card for personal expenditures, specifically for Christmas gifts for his children, to purchase lingerie for his wife, to pay for his cable and internet in his home, etc. Mr. Roeber was not authorized to make these personal charges and when Mr. Roeber was confronted about this by management, Mr. Roeber promised to repay these amounts and failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (i) In the instant case, Claimant was issued a credit card; Claimant was told what that card was permitted to be used for, the Claimant blatantly disregarded those rules; and the Claimant is responsible for those charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (j) The law permits the Employer to withhold wages for repayment of these unauthorized charges and the Division failed to apply the appropriate law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (k) The Division cannot expand upon the provisions set forth in the Wage Offset Rules, unless such expansion is established in current valid Wyoming State Statutes. Nowhere in the Wage Offset Rules or in Wyoming Statute is there a provision that the Employer cannot offset such unauthorized charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   3. The parties in this action, as defined by Wyoming State Statute \u00a7 16-3-101(b)(vi), are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (a) Petitioner is Badlands Energy Services, Inc., whose address is 201 West Lakeway Road, Suite 1003, Gillette, WY 82718;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (b) Thomas M.
