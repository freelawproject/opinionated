He argues that the trial court erred by designating his offense as a dangerous crime against children (\"DCAC\") and enhancing his sentence pursuant to the DCAC sentencing law because the child victim of the offense was not an actual child but an undercover police officer. In\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Gates\n   </em>\n   , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the definition of a dangerous crime against children generally does not apply to an offense where the \"child\" is an undercover police officer.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20118\">\n    243 Ariz. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121-22, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%201003\">\n    402 P.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006-07 (2017). Although we agree that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   requires that the DCAC designation be removed, the relevant language of the child prostitution statute nevertheless independently mandates that the DCAC sentencing provisions apply to Lantz's offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On November 15, 2016, undercover officers conducted a human trafficking sting operation by posting several online advertisements for child prostitution. Lantz responded to one of these advertisements and began a text message conversation with a male detective who was posing as a single mother offering sex with her thirteen-year-old daughter in exchange for a \"donation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 After exchanging texts, Lantz asked to speak over the phone and a female detective called him. During that conversation, Lantz requested a photograph of the thirteen-year-old daughter. Two female detectives then posed for a picture, pretending to be mother and daughter. After using a software application to obscure their appearances to some degree, they sent Lantz the photograph. When Lantz received the picture, he noted that the daughter appeared to be older than age thirteen. Explaining that the daughter was nearly fourteen years old, a female detective inquired whether Lantz was still interested, and he assured her that he was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 After establishing some parameters for the sexual encounter, the female detective gave Lantz directions to the sting house. When Lantz arrived, the female detective opened the door and invited him in, and officers arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State charged Lantz with one count of child prostitution, a class two felony and DCAC. At trial, Lantz admitted he had solicited prostitution, but claimed he believed he was hiring an adult prostitute who was simply role-playing a child sex fantasy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The jury found Lantz guilty of child prostitution, expressly finding that the \"persona of the minor ... was under the age of 15.\" The trial court found the offense was a DCAC and sentenced Lantz to a mitigated term of thirteen years' imprisonment. Lantz timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Lantz contends the trial court improperly designated his offense as a DCAC, and therefore incorrectly imposed an enhanced sentence pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-705 (2018). Relying on\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Gates\n   </em>\n   , he argues the DCAC sentencing enhancement \"does not apply when a defendant commits a crime against a fictitious child,\" and therefore he should have been sentenced under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In raising this claim, Lantz does not contest his conviction for child prostitution, and he expressly acknowledges that A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(C) forecloses any defense to that charge premised on a peace officer having posed as a fictitious minor victim. Instead, he challenges only the designation of his offense as a DCAC and the application of the DCAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   statutory enhancement to this case, because no actual minor was involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 We review questions of statutory interpretation\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Polk v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    239 Ariz. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 406, \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    372 P.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (2016). When the language of a statute is clear, \"we need not look further to determine the statute's meaning and apply its terms as written.\"\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031674\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/377/#p383\">\n    236 Ariz. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383, \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031674\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/377/#p383\">\n    340 P.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1091 (App. 2014). We also construe a statute in light of other statutes that relate to the same subject matter, \"as though they constituted one law.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Thomas v. Ditsworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544044\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/339/#p342\">\n    216 Ariz. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342, \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544044\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/339/#p342\">\n    166 P.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (App. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pinal Vista Properties, L.L.C. v. Turnbull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327320\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/188/#p190\">\n    208 Ariz. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190, \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327320\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/188/#p190\">\n    91 P.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033 (App. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 This case involves two interrelated statutes: A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212 (the \"child prostitution statute\"), which prohibits child sex trafficking, including child prostitution; and A.R.S. \u00a7 13-705 (the \"DCAC statute\"), which prescribes a range of sentences for a variety of crimes against children. In general, the DCAC statute sets forth enhanced sentences for crimes involving a minor victim under age fifteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The child prostitution statute enumerates ten different types of conduct, in addition to prostitution, that constitute unlawful child sex trafficking. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(A), (B). It also explicitly forecloses any defense to any of the enumerated crimes, including child prostitution, based on the putative child actually being an undercover peace officer. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(C). When a child sex trafficking victim is fifteen years old or older, the child prostitution statute sets forth an explicit sentencing scheme for the court to apply. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(G). When a child sex trafficking victim is under age fifteen, however, the statute directs the court to apply the DCAC statute's sentencing scheme. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(E), (F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Lantz was convicted and properly sentenced according to the provisions of the child prostitution statute, which forecloses any defense that the child was fictitious, and which requires imposition of an enhanced sentence for the offense of which Lantz was convicted. In other words, the specific child prostitution offense statute controlled the court's sentencing, and that statute imports the DCAC enhanced sentence under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 In 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court considered whether the sentencing provisions in subsection (G) of the child prostitution statute apply when an undercover officer poses as a minor age fifteen or older.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Polk v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    239 Ariz. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    372 P.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   court noted: \"[T]he legislature simultaneously provided that it is no defense to these offenses that the 'minor' is a peace officer posing as a minor, and it did not separately provide a sentencing provision or a felony classification for a person convicted of engaging in child prostitution with an undercover officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    at 408-09, \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    372 P.3d at 932-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the court held that the child prostitution statute's sentencing provisions apply to offenses involving an adult peace officer posing as a minor aged fifteen to seventeen years.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 408-09, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311760\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/405/#p406\">\n    372 P.3d at 932-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 The subsequent\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   decision does not alter the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   or our analysis here. In\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , the Arizona Supreme Court considered the application of the DCAC sentencing enhancement in the context of solicitation to commit molestation of a child. It held that the definition of a \"dangerous crime against children\" under the DCAC statute \"requires an actual child victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20118\">\n    243 Ariz. at 122, \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%201003\">\n    402 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1007 (citing A.R.S. \u00a7 13-705(P)(1) ). For this reason, the court held, DCAC enhanced sentences may not be imposed pursuant to the list of offenses in the definition of a \"dangerous crime against children\" absent an actual child victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121-22, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%201006\">\n    402 P.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -07. In reaching this conclusion, the court expressly noted that, unlike the child prostitution statute applicable here, the DCAC statute does not have any qualifying provision that would allow the term \"minor\" to refer to anyone other than \"an actual person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 121, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 402 P.3d at 1006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   distinguished\n   its earlier conclusions in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 402 P.3d at 1006. In short, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   construed the consequences of an offense not at issue here, in a way that is not relevant to the statutes that are applicable here. Lantz's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   is misplaced in light of the plain language of the child prostitution statute and\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Although the\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   holding does not alter our conclusion affirming Lantz's enhanced sentence, it does require that his conviction be modified to remove the DCAC designation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boynton v.
