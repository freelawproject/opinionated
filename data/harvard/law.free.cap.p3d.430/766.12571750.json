We conclude that the district court did not err in denying that motion, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Ms. Rodriguez states a single issue: Did the district court err in denying her motion to suppress?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b63] At 11:43 a.m. on December 1, 2016, Wyoming Highway Patrol Trooper William Beres was patrolling on Interstate 25 in Johnson County. He stopped a light blue Buick with Colorado plates for speeding, specifically for traveling at 105 miles per hour in an 80 mile per hour zone. As he approached the driver's side of the car, he noticed three occupants: the driver, a front-seat passenger, and an infant girl in a car seat in the back seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] Trooper Beres explained the reason for the stop and asked why they were speeding. The driver said the passenger was eight months pregnant and there was some sort of medical emergency. The trooper asked about their travel plans. He was informed that they\n   were driving from Laramie to Sheridan to visit the passenger's grandfather. Trooper Beres noticed that the driver was not wearing a seat belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] The trooper asked the driver for his license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. The driver said he did not have a license, and he volunteered that the passenger was the owner of the vehicle. He claimed his name was \"Joe Bravo,\" and struggled to state his date of birth. Trooper Beres believed that the driver was lying because he took a while to come up with a name and date of birth, and he seemed overly nervous. Trooper Beres asked the passenger for her driver's license. She produced a Colorado license identifying her as Vanessa Rodriguez. She informed the trooper that she had no proof of insurance for the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] Trooper Beres asked the driver to get out of the car. He frisked him before placing him in the back seat cage of the patrol car. Trooper Beres then contacted another state trooper, William Kirkman, because Trooper Beres had \"the trooper's intuition that something is not right here and [wanted] to have the backup officer here for officer safety reasons.\" During this time, the driver told Trooper Beres that the passenger was \"his woman,\" which the trooper took to mean that she was the driver's girlfriend, fianc\u00e9, wife, or significant other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] Trooper Beres then returned to the passenger side of the Buick to talk with Ms. Rodriguez. He confirmed with Ms. Rodriguez that she did not need medical attention. He asked her who the driver was. Ms. Rodriguez said that the driver was her friend \"Joe,\" that she had met him in California a few years ago, and that he was a friend of her father. She denied that the driver was the father of her infant daughter or unborn child. Because her answers were inconsistent with the driver's, Trooper Beres believed she was lying about the driver's identity. He warned her that she could go to jail for lying to him, but he was willing to \"start over fresh\" with her. He also warned her that if she were arrested for lying to him, the Wyoming Department of Family Services would take her infant child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b68] Trooper Beres then returned to his car to check on the information given to him by \"Joe Bravo\" and on the Colorado driver's license provided by Ms. Rodriguez. The dispatcher could locate no records concerning \"Joe Bravo.\" The information concerning Ms. Rodriguez's license indicated that she had obtained a protective order preventing a man named Jesse Grijalva from having contact with her. The physical description of Mr. Grijalva closely matched that of the driver who had identified himself as \"Joe Bravo.\" Trooper Beres believed the driver was, in fact, Mr. Grijalva, the subject of Ms. Rodriguez's protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69] Trooper Kirkman, who is part of a K-9 unit, arrived to assist. Together, they resumed questioning Ms. Rodriguez. When asked if the driver was Jesse Grijalva, she acknowledged that he was, and admitted she had lied about his identity. She also revealed that Mr. Grijalva was the father of both the infant girl in the car seat and the child with whom she was pregnant. Ms. Rodriguez did not deny that she had obtained a protective order against Mr. Grijalva, but she insisted that it had been lifted by this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b610] Trooper Beres told Ms. Rodriguez that he was suspicious of something else going on because they both had lied about Mr. Grijalva's identity, and he asked if there was anything illegal in the car. In response to questioning by Trooper Kirkman, Ms. Rodriguez admitted to possessing medical marijuana from Colorado for her anxiety. She said the marijuana was located in a diaper bag on the floor in the back of the car, and that there were eight ounces there. Trooper Beres moved Ms. Rodriguez and the infant into Trooper Kirkman's vehicle. At no time during her detention was Ms. Rodriguez handcuffed or otherwise physically restrained, and neither trooper drew his firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b611] Trooper Kirkman then brought his dog to the car. The dog alerted, and Trooper Kirkman removed a shopping bag from the diaper bag near the back seat. The shopping bag contained eight individually packaged baggies of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b612] Both Ms. Rodriguez and Mr. Grijalva were arrested. The Wyoming Department of\n   Family Services took the infant. Only after the arrest did Trooper Beres receive confirmation that Ms. Rodriguez was correct that the protective order was no longer valid. Ms. Rodriguez was charged with one count of felony possession of a controlled substance and one count of misdemeanor interference with a peace officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b613] Ms. Rodriguez filed a motion to suppress the statements she made to Troopers Beres and Kirkman, along with the evidence-the marijuana-the troopers found after her statements. She claimed, in summary, that her detention and the search of her vehicle were unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, and that her statements had not been made voluntarily. The district court held a hearing on the motion, during which both Trooper Beres and Trooper Kirkman testified, and the court received video offered by the State from the camera Trooper Beres was wearing at the time of the stop and arrest. After the district court denied the motion, Ms. Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea to the felony charge of possession of a controlled substance. In return, the State agreed to dismiss the misdemeanor charge of interference with a peace officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b614] As part of the conditional plea, Ms. Rodriguez reserved the right to appeal the district court's denial of her motion to suppress. She was sentenced to serve two to four years of incarceration, which was suspended in favor of two years of supervised probation. Ms. Rodriguez filed a notice of appeal, bringing her case before us now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b615] When faced with a challenge to the denial of a motion to suppress, we adopt the district court's factual findings unless the defendant proves that the findings are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

We \"view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's determination because the trial court has an opportunity at the evidentiary hearing to assess the credibility of the witnesses, weigh the evidence, and make the necessary inferences, deductions, and conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindsay v.

The ultimate question of whether the search or seizure was legally justified, however, is a question of law we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793961\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/375/788/\">\n    375 P.3d at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b616] There are two main prongs to Ms. Rodriguez's argument that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress. First, she asserts that the troopers' detention and questioning of her after the traffic stop was unreasonable under the circumstances. Second, she claims that her statements to the troopers were involuntary and nonconsensual. We consider each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The reasonableness of the troopers' actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b617] The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Article 1, Section 4 of the Wyoming Constitution also provides protections against unreasonable searches and seizures: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.\" Wyo. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 4. Trooper Beres's traffic stop of Ms. Rodriguez \"constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Garvin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363587\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/172/725/\">\n    2007 WY 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363587\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/172/725/\">\n    172 P.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728-29 (Wyo. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b618] In her brief, Ms. Rodriguez presents a well-developed argument that the state constitution provides even greater protections against unreasonable searches and seizures than does the federal constitution. We agree that, as she claims, our state constitutional provision is stronger than its federal counterpart because it requires search warrants to be supported by written affidavits.\n   <em>\n    State v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8515365\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/27/185/#p198\">\n    27 Wyo. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8515365\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/27/185/#p198\">\n    194 P. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345 (1920). However, no search warrant is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b619] Ms. Rodriguez further maintains that the state constitutional provision is\n   more protective because it requires a search to be \"reasonable under all the circumstances.\" For this proposition, she relies on\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11494809\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/990/476/#p488\">\n    990 P.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488-89 (Wyo. 1999), in which we held that a vehicle search was proper under the federal constitution because it was incident to a lawful arrest, and also under the state constitution because it was incident to a lawful arrest and \"reasonable under all the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Boyle v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933503\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/401/\">\n    2005 WY 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933503\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/401/\">\n    117 P.3d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (Wyo. 2005). But while\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   does indicate that our state constitution provides greater protection than the federal constitution, the test we apply under the federal constitution is notably similar to\n   <em>\n    Vasquez's\n   </em>\n   \"reasonable under all the circumstances\" test.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   To summarize, the standards applicable in considering the constitutionality of traffic stops under the Fourth Amendment are as follows: An officer's actions during a traffic stop must be reasonably related to the purpose of the stop. Absent valid consent, a reasonable suspicion of other unlawful activity or reasonable suspicion that a detainee is armed, an officer may not expand an investigative detention beyond the scope of the stop, ask questions unrelated to the stop or embark on a fishing expedition in the hope that something will turn up.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The relevant question is whether the scope of the stop was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    O'Boyle\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933503\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/401/\">\n    117 P.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added; internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Given the facts of Ms. Rodriguez's case, we would reach the same result whether we test for reasonableness under \"all the circumstances\" or under \"the totality of the circumstances.\" Accordingly, there is no need to resolve Ms. Rodriguez's contention that the state constitution provides stronger protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b620] Ms. Rodriguez does not contend that the initial traffic stop was improper. Her claim is that the troopers' detention and questioning of her after the traffic stop were unreasonable. As set forth above, the troopers' actions are considered proper if they were reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, and if the extension of the detention and questioning was justified by reasonable suspicion of other unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    O'Boyle\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933503\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/401/\">\n    117 P.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eckenrod v.

Having made that stop, it was reasonable for the trooper to ask the driver for his license and vehicle registration.\n   <em>\n    Damato v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371594\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/64/700/\">\n    2003 WY 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371594\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/64/700/\">\n    64 P.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (Wyo. 2003). The driver produced neither, nor did he have proof of insurance. The driver also gave a name and birthdate that the trooper found suspicious. In addition, the driver volunteered that the vehicle belonged to the passenger, and this information led Trooper Beres to ask the passenger for her documentation. She provided a driver's license, but no registration or other proof of ownership, and no proof of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b622] At this point, it was reasonable for Trooper Beres to be suspicious that several crimes were being committed, including driving without a license; driving without insurance, or at least without proof of insurance; driving without seatbelts fastened; and possibly auto theft. Further, Trooper Beres believed that the driver was trying to conceal his identity by giving a questionable name and birthdate, which made it reasonable for him to suspect other potential criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b623] The passenger's driver's license identified her as Ms. Rodriguez. It was appropriate for Trooper Beres to run a computer check on her license.\n   <em>\n    Damato\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371594\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/64/700/\">\n    64 P.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The computer check confirmed that Ms. Rodriguez's license was valid, but it also alerted Trooper Beres that a protective order had been issued restricting contact between Ms. Rodriguez and a man named Jesse Grijalva, whose physical description resembled the driver of Ms. Rodriguez's vehicle. Given this information, it was reasonable for Trooper Beres to suspect violations of the\n   protective order. This reasonable suspicion justified the trooper's continuing to detain Ms. Rodriguez and the driver and his asking them additional questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b624] In response to the additional questioning, Ms. Rodriguez and the driver gave inconsistent answers about their relationship, how and where they met, and the driver's relationship to the infant and unborn child. Such inconsistencies are \"one of several factors [supporting] the conclusion the trooper possessed reasonable articulable suspicion to justify continued detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Flood v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371317\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/169/538/\">\n    2007 WY 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30-32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371317\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/169/538/\">\n    169 P.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (Wyo. 2007). Ms. Rodriguez eventually admitted that the driver was Mr. Grijalva, thereby revealing that she had previously lied about his identity. Thus, while she claimed that the protective order was no longer valid, her previous dishonesty justified Trooper Beres's further efforts to verify the validity of that order, and his further detention of Ms. Rodriguez while he made those efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b625] At this point Trooper Beres told Ms. Rodriguez that he was suspicious of other criminal activity, and he asked if there was anything illegal in her car. Trooper Kirkman, who had arrived by this time, asked Ms. Rodriguez a similar question, and she admitted that there was marijuana in the diaper bag in the back seat. Ms. Rodriguez made this statement before Trooper Beres received confirmation that the protective order had been lifted. Given these facts, we conclude that Trooper Beres had \"reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity\" sufficient to justify the detention and questioning of Ms. Rodriguez.\n   <em>\n    O'Boyle\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933503\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/401/\">\n    117 P.3d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The troopers' actions were not unreasonable under all of the circumstances or under the totality of the circumstances.

She rests this claim on three separate legal bases. First, she claims that she was subjected to custodial interrogation without first having been advised of her constitutional rights pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966).

Third, she claims that her statements were elicited in violation of her rights to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b627] It is well established that an individual subject to custodial interrogation must be informed of certain constitutional rights, or else that individual's confessions or other statements will be inadmissible in court.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. at 1612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She was not in a familiar place such as her home, but she was not taken to a police station or detention center. Only Trooper Beres was present during most of the time Ms. Rodriguez was detained, although Trooper Kirkman joined them later. Ms. Rodriguez was not handcuffed or otherwise physically restrained, nor did either trooper draw his firearm. The district court found that the questioning lasted less than twenty-five minutes, and that finding is supported by the record.

The record indicates that physical force and handcuffs may also have been used in the initial detention.

The Court is unable to make that determination. The Court finds that when considering the totality of the circumstances in this matter, [Ms.] Rodriguez's free will was not overcome.
