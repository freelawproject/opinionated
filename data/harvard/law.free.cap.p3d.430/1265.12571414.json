He then submitted to a breath test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Soza filed a motion to suppress in Tucson City Court, arguing his breath test was subject to the Fourth Amendment, because, under\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , the admonition was coercive, and\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v.

Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    241 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    382 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2016). It asserted that Soza's consent had been voluntary under the totality of the circumstances, but, even if involuntary, the exclusionary rule did not apply because of the officer's good faith belief that the admonition was proper. Finally, it argued that suppression was unwarranted under the implied consent statute, even assuming a violation of \u00a7 28-1321.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The city court granted Soza's motion to suppress, concluding the admonition violated \u00a7 28-1321 and rendered his consent involuntary. The court determined the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply because, after our supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    232 Ariz. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    302 P.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), no binding precedent supported giving the admonition. The state appealed to the superior court, arguing the city court had erred by concluding \u00a7 28-1321 had been violated, by failing to apply the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and by finding that the search-incident-to-arrest exception does not apply to breath tests taken in violation of \u00a7 28-1321. It also argued that \"whether exclusion is an appropriate remedy for violation of\" \u00a7 28-1321 must be addressed separately from Fourth Amendment exclusion. The respondent judge reversed the city court's ruling, concluding that, pursuant to our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Weakland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%2079\">\n    244 Ariz. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n    418 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2017), the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply, and it therefore did not need to address the other grounds raised by the state. Soza then filed the instant petition for special action relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Soza argues that the breath-test evidence must be excluded because he did not voluntarily agree to the test, and therefore the evidence was not obtained in compliance with \u00a7 28-1321, which directs that \"[i]f a person under arrest refuses to submit to the test\" \"[t]he test shall not be given.\" The state argues that, even if the officer failed to comply with the statute, suppression of the evidence was not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Principles of Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Implied Consent and Chemical Testing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Arizona adopted an implied consent regime in 1969.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1969 Ariz.

The pertinent provision of our implied-consent statute violated here-that a test result can be secured only by voluntary submission or warrant-expressly sets forth that limitation for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   types of blood-alcohol tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321(D) (applying (D)(1) requirements to all tests itemized in \"subsection A\" including breath or urine tests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 Undeterred by the precedential weight of\n   <em>\n    Brita\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the majority contends that our supreme court has otherwise declined to apply the exclusionary rule to state statutory violations. The majority supports this claim with two Arizona Supreme Court cases that do not address that question. The first case,\n   <em>\n    State v. Moorman\n   </em>\n   , held that suppression is not a remedy for a violation of prison regulations governing the search of an inmate's cell. 154 Ariz. at 584, 744 P.2d at 685. The majority overlooks that prison regulations, while enabled by statute, are not themselves statutes and do not carry the weight of legislative deliberation and enactment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1604 (enabling prison officials to develop rules). And, the case that\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   cited in support of its terse holding,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, any ambiguity about the scope of the court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   was resolved a year later when the supreme court decided\n   <em>\n    Brita\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   : cases that, as seen, manifestly did apply the exclusionary rule to violations of state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 The majority's reliance on the more recent case of\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    232 Ariz. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    302 P.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is similarly misplaced. There, our supreme court \"decline[d] to address\" a juvenile's argument that violation of the Parents' Bill of Rights would justify suppression of his blood test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the court mentioned that the \"parental rights\" statute contained no provision for suppression, it concluded that the juvenile lacked standing to assert his parents' rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It did not address whether, or to what extent, the Court would view itself empowered to apply an exclusionary rule notwithstanding the lack of an express statutory provision for exclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the dicta in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   suggests at most that the express terms of a state statute might be a relevant factor in analyzing whether suppression would be required under a statutory provision. Of course, it would always be a relevant factor-if a state statute were to mandate suppression as a remedy for its violation, the court need not consider whether to apply a common law exclusionary rule at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32 The Arizona Court of Appeals has also applied the exclusionary rule to violations of Arizona statutes in the absence of any legislative guidance to the contrary. Specifically, we routinely suppressed evidence collected in violation of our state's statute forbidding the nighttime execution of search warrants without good cause, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3917.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 13-3925, while comprehensively addressing issues related to the exclusionary rule, as seen, implicitly exempts violations of the state search warrant statute from the exclusionary rule. But none of its other five parts exempt any other state criminal statutes from the application of the rule.
