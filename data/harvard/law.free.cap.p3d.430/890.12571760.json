On appeal, Kelly contends that: (1) the circuit court improperly considered and granted Palehua's request for money damages in conjunction with its award of attorneys' fees and costs; and (2) the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees against Kelly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues raised, we resolve Kelly's points on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Granting Palehua's Request for Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We first address Kelly's argument that the circuit court improperly considered and granted Palehua's request for money damages in its Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees, Costs, and Expenses (Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs). We review a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under the \"abuse of discretion\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/120/181/#p197\">\n    120 Hawai'i 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/120/181/#p197\">\n    202 P.3d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1242 (2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kelly argues that Palehua failed to explicitly state, claim, or demand money damages in its Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, filed September 2, 2011, by failing to allege either that Palehua's governing documents constitute a contract or that Palehua was damaged by Kelly's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When a homeowner fails to bring a property into compliance with a homeowners association's rules, the homeowner must pay the association for costs incurred from that failure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Kunia Community Ass'n ex rel. Bd. of Directors v. Nemoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310838\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/437/#p445\">\n    119 Hawai'i 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310838\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/437/#p445\">\n    198 P.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (2008) (Royal Kunia). Palehua's governing documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   require that homeowners pay not only for the enforcement costs associated with bringing the property back into compliance, but,\n   <em>\n    additionally,\n   </em>\n   for any attorneys' fees and costs associated with the enforcement of the covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the circuit court entered summary judgment and an injunction in favor of Palehua including,\n   <em>\n    Inter alia,\n   </em>\n   authorization for Palehua to incur compliance costs if Kelly failed to bring the property into compliance. Kelly does not dispute that she failed to bring the property into compliance or that, as previously authorized by the circuit court, Palehua included the costs of compliance in its request for attorneys' fees and costs. Thereafter, the circuit court awarded compliance costs, including attorneys' fees and costs, as required by the Covenants, Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 421J-10(a) (2004),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as previously ordered by the circuit court. Specifically, the circuit court awarded the following amounts for Palehua's efforts in enforcing the Covenants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Cleaning Costs: $3,361.46\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Attorneys' Fees: $10,140.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Costs: $1,257.30\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Additional Attorneys' fees and costs to be incurred: $900.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Total Judgment Amount: $15,658.76.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed above, the \"Cleaning Costs\" were incurred by Palehua when it conducted the clean-up of Kelly's property, in fulfillment of Covenant obligations and the circuit court's injunction, after Kelly refused to comply with the injunction. The \"Attorney's Fees,\" \"Costs,\" and \"Additional Attorneys' fees and costs to be incurred\" were or will be incurred by Palehua in the course of maintaining the present action to obtain the injunction to enforce the Covenants. All of these costs of enforcement are authorized by the Covenants and the HRS, and Kelly is liable for these costs of enforcement. Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when granting attorneys' fees and costs to Palehua.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kelly further argues that the circuit court improperly considered Palehua's Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs as a non-hearing motion when such a request cannot be categorized as a non-hearing motion under the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai'i (RCCH) Rule 7.2 and Civil Administrative Orders 9.1, 9.2, and 9.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pursuant to RCCH Rule 7.2(b), motions defined in Exhibit B to the RCCH can be considered non-hearing motions, including both motions for \"Attorney's Fees\" and for \"Reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses.\" Further, all Civil Administrative Orders were rescinded by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawai'i on June 9, 2010, prior to the commencement of this action, and have no authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, Palehua's Non-Hearing Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, which only sought reimbursement for out-of-pocket compliance expenses on behalf of Palehua, and attorneys' fees and costs of suit, was a proper non-hearing motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Kelly argues that the grant of compensatory damages against Kelly was preserved for appeal because it constituted plain error. As we addressed the issue on the merits above, we need not address the issue of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Necessity of the Original Law Suit Is Not at Issue on Appeal-Only the Resulting Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kelly's second point on appeal is that the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees against Kelly when \"the lawsuit [ ] filed against her was entirely unnecessary.\" Kelly argues that because Palehua is permitted under its Covenants to enforce the Covenants, remedy any violations, maintain the properties in Palehua, and charge any costs directly to the homeowners, that there was no need for Palehua to file the present lawsuit. Thus, Kelly concludes, it was an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to award attorneys' fees for prosecution of an unnecessary lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The necessity of the lawsuit is not at issue on appeal. Kelly does not dispute that the Covenants and HRS \u00a7 421J-10(a) both authorize a grant of attorneys' fees and costs for actions taken in enforcing the Covenants. Kelly does not dispute the reasonableness of the amount of the attorneys' fees and costs. Thus, it could not be an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to grant attorneys' fees and costs incurred for actions taken in enforcing the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As above, Kelly further argues that this issue is preserved on appeal because it constitutes plain error. Because we have addressed the issue on the merits, we need not address the issue of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the (1) Order Granting In Part Plaintiff-Appellee Palehua Community Association's Non-Hearing Motion For Attorneys' Fees, Costs, and Expenses, filed February 1, 2016; and (2) the Final Judgment, filed February 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In her reply brief, Kelly, raised two additional points of error, alleging: (1) that Kelly was deprived of the due process of law when Palehua filed a separate \"non-hearing motion\" for attorneys' fees and costs, rather than the court ordered \"declaration\" of attorneys' fees and costs; and (2) that the circuit court's injunction was unconstitutionally vague because it did not enumerate the specific actions Kelly was required to take to clean her property and because it was filed only four days prior to the deadline for compliance. Inasmuch as Kelly, who was represented by counsel on appeal, failed to raise such arguments in her opening brief, such arguments are deemed waived.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Association of Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows ex rel. its Bd of Directors v.
