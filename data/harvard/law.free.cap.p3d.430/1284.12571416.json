Westover filed this action seeking a declaration that the existence of the Idaho Counties Risk Management Program (ICRMP) violates Idaho law. Westover appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of ICRMP. Westover also appeals the district court's decision to award attorney fees to ICRMP under Idaho Code section 12-121. The district court held that Westover did not have standing to pursue his claim. We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This litigation follows an earlier dispute between Westover and Jase Cundick, the Franklin County Assessor. That dispute came before this Court in\n   <em>\n    Westover v.

There, Westover advanced claims for slander of title and intentional interference with existing or potential economic relations and sought writs of mandate and prohibition.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 935,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315160\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/161/933/\">\n    393 P.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After Westover voluntarily dismissed the slander of title and tortious interference claims, the district court denied his requests for extraordinary writs and dismissed the action.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 936,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315160\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/161/933/\">\n    393 P.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Westover appealed.

In response, Westover moved for an order compelling discovery and opposed ICRMP's motion for summary judgment on the basis that ICRMP had failed to adequately respond to his discovery requests. The district court treated Westover's opposition as a motion under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) to defer decision on the motion for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion because Westover had not complied with the affidavit or declaration requirement of the rule. The district court then granted ICRMP's motion. In a written opinion, the district court held that Westover lacked standing to pursue the action, relying on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Brooksby v. Geico General Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707304\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/153/546/\">\n    153 Idaho 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707304\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/153/546/\">\n    286 P.3d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

The district court denied this request solely because none of the materials in support of ICRMP's motion itemized the claimed expenses as required. ICRMP filed a motion to reconsider the district court's denial of attorney fees. The district court granted the motion to reconsider and subsequently granted the request for attorney fees after the itemization issue was resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Westover timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The district court did not err in ruling on ICRMP's motion for summary judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary issue, Westover argues that the district court erred by not considering his motion to compel that was filed in opposition to ICRMP's motion for summary judgment. The district court treated this motion as made under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). That Rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.R.C.P. 56(d). We recently explained these requirements in\n   <em>\n    Fagen, Inc. v. Lava Beds Wind Park, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/\">\n    159 Idaho 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/\">\n    364 P.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The rule clearly contemplates that such a motion must be supported with an affidavit stating the reasons why the continuance is necessary. The party seeking a continuance has the burden of setting out what further discovery would reveal that is essential to justify their opposition, making clear what information is sought and how it would preclude summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/\">\n    at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/\">\n    364 P.3d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court found no basis for delaying consideration of ICRMP's motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Westover has wholly failed to comply with I.R.C.P. 56(d). He did not file a motion requesting any relief allowed pursuant to I.R.C.P. 56(d).... He did not file an affidavit or declaration setting forth a \"specified reason\" for any of the relief allowed....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Westover does not dispute the district court's description of the procedural posture of his motion. Indeed, his opening brief does not identify the standard of review relating to a motion pursuant to Rule 56(d), I.R.C.P., much less attempt to explain why the district court's decision constituted an abuse of discretion. This is fatal to his contention that the district court erred by entertaining ICRMP's motion for summary judgment without deciding his motion to compel.\n   <em>\n    Mortensen v.

In our view, there is no justiciable controversy because Westover seeks an impermissible advisory opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Westover's theory is that ICRMP insulates its insured from the financial risks associated with litigation created by\n   Idaho Code section 12-117(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus \"undermines the legislature's intent to bring some modicum of reasonableness to local government by requiring the government actors to have skin in the game.\" He claims standing because the Franklin County Assessor took unreasonable positions in the previous action that protracted the litigation, thus increasing the costs for all parties involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first observe that declaratory judgment actions run a particular risk of crossing the \"fine line between purely hypothetical or academic questions and actually justiciable cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhoades\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4415748\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/119/594/#p597\">\n    119 Idaho at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4415748\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/119/594/#p597\">\n    809 P.2d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, the fact remains that the previous litigation did not result in an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-117, either before the trial court or on appeal. There is no indication that Westover is currently or prospectively involved in litigation to which Idaho Code section 12-117 may apply. Thus, Westover's declaratory judgment action is completely hypothetical; any interpretation of Idaho Code section 12-117 by this Court would have no direct practical effect on Westover, perhaps apart from a sense of vindication. As such, we hold that the district court properly dismissed Westover's request for a non-justiciable advisory opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

We are unwilling to draw the same comparison. Instead, Westover should have relied upon the body of Idaho law interpreting Idaho Code section 12-121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Review of the district court's analysis of the required factors under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(3) shows no error. While it may seem anomalous that we are affirming the district court's award of attorney fees while declining to award them on the same grounds, this highlights the deference shown under the abuse of discretion standard of review.

Westover has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in granting ICRMP's motion to reconsider.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Westover also argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting ICRMP's motion to reconsider its initial decision to deny ICRMP's request for attorney fees. Westover contends that this Court should review that decision for \"correctness.\" However, as we have made clear, the standard of review for a decision to grant or deny a motion for consideration is more nuanced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   On a motion for reconsideration, the court must consider any new admissible evidence or authority bearing on the correctness of an interlocutory order. However, a motion for reconsideration need not be supported by any new evidence or authority. When deciding the motion for reconsideration, the district court must apply the same standard of review that the court applied when deciding the original order that is being reconsidered. In other words, if the original order was a matter within the trial court's discretion, then so is the decision to grant or deny the motion for reconsideration. If the original order was governed by a different standard, then that standard applies to the motion for reconsideration. Likewise, when reviewing a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration, this Court utilizes the same standard of review used by the lower court in deciding the motion for reconsideration. If the decision was within the trial court's discretion, we apply an abuse of discretion standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Fragnella v.

As we have repeatedly noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   when a party \"does not contend that the district court failed to perceive the issue as one of discretion, that the district court failed to act within the boundaries of this discretion and consistent with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it[,] or that the district court did not reach its decision by an exercise of reason,\" such a conclusory argument is \"fatally deficient\" to the party's case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Estate of Ekic\n   </em>\n   , 163 Idaho at 899,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568746\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1101/#p1105\">\n    422 P.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court performed the process correctly. It recognized the issue as one of discretion and acted within the outer bounds.

ICRMP asks that it be awarded attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-121 because Westover's appeal was \"brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\" We are not persuaded that Westover's appeal has been frivolously pursued.
