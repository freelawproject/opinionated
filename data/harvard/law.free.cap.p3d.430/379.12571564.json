The trial court suspended the imposition of sentence and placed him on three years' probation. On appeal, Trujillo argues the court erred by ordering him to register as a sex offender pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3821(A)(3) because there was no jury determination of the victim's age. He also contends the court erred in precluding impeachment evidence about a state witness.

In April 2015, fifteen-year-old M.A.C. left his home in Honduras to seek asylum in the United States. When he walked across the United States-Mexico border into McAllen, Texas, United States Border Patrol agents took him to an immigration office in Texas, where he stayed for three days before being transferred to a refugee facility in Tucson called Southwest Key. A social worker told M.A.C. he would stay there until his father \"had all the necessary paperwork in order\" and then M.A.C. could go live with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 One morning, M.A.C. was lying on his bed when Trujillo, a youth-care worker at Southwest Key, entered the room. According to Trujillo's supervisor, workers at Southwest Key are not allowed to enter the children's bedrooms \"for any reason unless it's [an] emergency,\" and then \"they are to request a witness as they're going into the room so they're not alone.\" When M.A.C. asked if it was time to get up, Trujillo said, \"No.... I'm going to tickle you,\" and proceeded to touch M.A.C.'s chest and stomach over his clothing. Trujillo left, and M.A.C. stayed in bed awaiting instructions to get up. A few minutes later, Trujillo returned and \"tickl[ed]\" M.A.C.'s penis over his clothing. Trujillo left, and M.A.C. remained in bed. Shortly thereafter, Trujillo returned a third\n   time and again touched M.A.C.'s penis over his clothing. Trujillo tried to \"lift\" M.A.C.'s underwear, but M.A.C. told him to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Trujillo then responded that \"he thought [M.A.C.] wanted him to do that.\" Trujillo told M.A.C. not to tell anyone because \"[Trujillo] would get into trouble\" and be \"suspended from his job.\" Although M.A.C. agreed, he later that day asked to speak with a counselor and reported the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 A grand jury indicted Trujillo for one count of sexual abuse. While testifying at trial, Trujillo denied touching M.A.C. in any way and instead explained that he went \"in and out\" of M.A.C.'s room that morning to \"give him hair gel and toothpaste.\" Trujillo was convicted as charged and placed on probation as described above. At sentencing, the trial court ordered him to register as a sex offender pursuant to \u00a7 13-3821(A)(3). Trujillo objected, arguing the statute did not apply because there was no jury finding of M.A.C.'s age. The court disagreed that a jury finding was necessary but stated it would modify its order if convinced the ruling was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The next day, Trujillo filed a \"Motion for Modification of Sentence,\" requesting that the trial court \"remove the registration requirement imposed.\" He maintained, \"The Sixth Amendment reserves to juries the determination of any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, that increases a criminal defendant's maximum potential sentence.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.
