Unlike other traffic statutes, RCW 46.61.670 affords no room for error. Even a minor, momentary violation meets the terms of the statute and can provide a basis for a traffic stop and imposition of an infraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Erica Alvarez was stopped by a Washington State Patrol trooper after her car wheels briefly traveled over a fog line and onto an area not designated as a roadway. The district and superior courts in Benton County held that this minor intrusion did not justify a traffic stop. Because we disagree, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Washington State Patrol Trooper Jarryd Bivens was patrolling Interstate 82 in Benton County, Washington, when he saw a car briefly cross over the right fog line and onto rumble strips. Both right side tires were across the fog line by at least one tire width. Trooper Bivens initiated a traffic stop. At the time, he did not suspect the driver was impaired. Once he contacted the driver, he noticed a number of indicators consistent with impairment. He then arrested the driver, Erica Alvarez, for driving under the influence (DUI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State charged Ms. Alvarez with DUI. She filed a motion to suppress, arguing her arrest was unlawful because the trooper lacked reasonable suspicion that she had committed the infraction of wheels off roadway under RCW 46.61.670. Ms. Alvarez claimed the wheels off roadway statute must be harmonized with RCW 46.61.140, which provides that a driver must operate his or her vehicle \"as nearly as practicable\" within a single lane of travel. She argued that if these two statutes are harmonized, a brief incursion across the fog line would not result in a violation of RCW 46.61.670. The State\n   responded that one drives with wheels off roadway by driving on the shoulder of the roadway and that Ms. Alvarez drove on the shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The district court agreed with Ms. Alvarez and held that both statutes applied and therefore must be harmonized. Citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Prado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738216\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/145/646/\">\n    145 Wash.App. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20P.3d%201186\">\n    186 P.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), it concluded that Ms. Alvarez's brief incursion across the fog line did not violate the wheels off roadway statute. The district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and granted Ms. Alvarez's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The State appealed to superior court, which affirmed. We granted the State's request for discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 The sole issue on appeal is whether Trooper Bivens had reasonable suspicion to stop Ms. Alvarez for violating the wheels off roadway statute, RCW 46.61.670.

As pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   , this language encompasses \"brief, momentary and minor deviations of lane lines.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738216\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/145/646/\">\n    145 Wash.App. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20P.3d%201186\">\n    186 P.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ms. Alvarez may be correct that Trooper Bivens could not have relied on RCW 46.61.140(1) as a basis for his traffic stop. But that does not mean he was barred from considering other statutes. RCW 46.61.670 is separate from RCW 46.61.140(1). The former statute governs the unique situation of a vehicle's wheels departing a designated roadway, not the more general scenario of movement into another lane of travel. Unlike RCW 46.61.140(1), RCW 46.61.670 does not contain language indicating a vehicle must be driven \"as nearly as practicable\" with wheels on the roadway. Instead, RCW 46.61.670 affords no exceptions. Even a minor deviation violates the plain terms of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Kocher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452490\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/199/336/#p344\">\n    199 Wash.App. at 344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20P.3d%20328\">\n    400 P.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 The fact that RCW 46.61.140(1) is inapplicable here does not render the statute a nullity. RCW 46.61.140(1) applies in circumstances where a vehicle momentarily crosses from one lane of traffic into a neighboring lane traveling the same direction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such minor lane deviations are different from the circumstance here where a vehicle's wheels momentarily leave the designated roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 Whether the legislature\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   allow some room for minor deviations of a vehicle from the roadway under RCW 46.61.670 is a matter for the legislature, not this court.\n   <em>\n    Kocher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452490\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/199/336/#p344\">\n    199 Wash.App. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20P.3d%20328\">\n    400 P.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A traffic stop was therefore justified under RCW 46.61.670.

We recently held that RCW 46.61.100(1) makes it unlawful to even briefly drive across the center line.\n   <em>\n    State v.

That statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic the following rules in addition to all others consistent herewith shall apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) A vehicle shall be driven\n   <em>\n    as nearly as practicable\n   </em>\n   entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   such lane until the driver has ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 The\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The phrase \"as nearly as practicable\" has not yet been interpreted by a Washington court.

To the contrary, RCW 46.61.140(1) applies to the movement \"from\" a lane of travel. RCW 46.61.140(1). Here, Ms. Alvarez was driving on a multilane road and moved from a lane of travel across the fog line. RCW 46.61.140(1) thus applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 There is tension between RCW 46.61.670 and RCW 46.61.140(1). As construed by the majority, RCW 46.61.670 does not permit even a brief incursion across the fog line. As construed by the\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   court, RCW 46.61.140(1) does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 When the plain meaning of two statutes is in conflict, the specific statute will govern over the general statute.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Wash. v.

The preface of RCW 46.61.140 directs that its subsections \"shall apply\" to all other rules consistent herewith. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   , subsection (1) of RCW 46.61.140 makes minor lane violations an insufficient basis for an investigatory stop. Construing RCW 46.61.140(1) and RCW 46.61.670 (wheels off roadway) as consistent with each other, a brief incursion across the fog line is not an infraction. Similarly, RCW 46.61.140(1) and RCW 46.61.100 (drive on right side of road) can be construed together so that a brief incursion across the center line is not an infraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24 It is clear that law enforcement can conduct an investigatory stop for traffic infractions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Routinely, sober drivers briefly cross a fog line or a center line. The sheer number of potential investigatory stops of sober drivers might be reason alone for our Supreme Court to reinstate the policy expressed in\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   , that minor traffic lane violations form an insufficient basis for a traffic stop. The potential for uneven enforcement might be an additional reason.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The area to the right of the fog line may be designated for vehicular traffic when authorized by state or local authorities and accompanied by appropriate signage.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RCW 46.61.428.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
