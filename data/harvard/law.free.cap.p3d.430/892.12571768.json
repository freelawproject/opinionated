In the Complaint, the Malabes asserted that the \"AOAO was not authorized or entitled to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure or power of sale under Part I and the sale that occurred was unlawful and constituted a wrongful foreclosure.\" On appeal, the Malabes contend that HRS \u00a7 667-5 may be used only when a power of sale is contained in a mortgage or other governing document, and that because such a power of sale was not present in this case, the foreclosure was not permitted by Hawai'i law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Hawai'i Supreme Court has held that \"[p]rior to its repeal in 2012, HRS \u00a7 667-5 authorized the non-judicial foreclosure of mortgaged property\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   '[w]hen a power of sale is contained in a mortgage.' \"\n   <em>\n    Santiago v.

Instead, the AOAO asserts that the plain text of HRS \u00a7 514B-146 (2006)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   authorizes the AOAO to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure on the Apartment under HRS \u00a7 667-5, without regard to a power of sale provision. HRS \u00a7 514B-146 provides an apartment owners' association with a priority lien over a unit in the case of any unpaid share of common expenses chargeable to that unit, which \"may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in chapter 667 ... in like manner as a mortgage of real property.\" HRS \u00a7 514B-146(a) (amended 2012). The AOAO asserts that this constitutes a legislative grant of authority for it to use the nonjudicial foreclosure procedures in HRS \u00a7 667-5 and that a power of sale arises from this legislative authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We reject this argument as it disregards the plain language and legislative intent of both HRS \u00a7 667-5 and \u00a7 514B-146(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sakal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=143%20Haw.%20219\">\n    143 Hawai'i at 225-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570087\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/443/#p449\">\n    426 P.3d at 449-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we have previously stated, the phrase \"in like manner as a mortgage of real property\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was intended to clarify that associations could avail themselves of less burdensome procedures, but was not a grant of heretofore non-existent statutory powers of sale.\n   <em>\n    Sakal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=143%20Haw.%20219\">\n    143 Hawai'i at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570087\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/443/#p449\">\n    426 P.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing the correlative and identical provision to HRS \u00a7 514B-146(a), prior to the 2012 amendments).

In response, the AOAO argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Malabes' UDAP claim is time-barred under HRS \u00a7 480-24 (2008).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HRS \u00a7 480-24(a) provides that \"[a]ny action to enforce a cause of action arising under this chapter shall be barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues.\" We have previously recognized and adopted federal court rulings that \"a cause of action for unlawful business practices accrues upon\n   <em>\n    occurrence\n   </em>\n   of alleged violation, rather than when plaintiff discovers the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Reves v.

As alleged in the Complaint, the AOAO \"published notice that they would sell the Apartment at a public sale\n   <em>\n    pursuant to Section 667-5\n   </em>\n   .\" The Malabes cite no authority for the proposition that reliance on a statutory authority, even if that reliance later proves to be wrong, constitutes fraudulent concealment, and we find none. The Complaint contains no allegations that the AOAO concealed or misrepresented its use of HRS \u00a7 667-5. We decline to characterize the Malabes' later-developed, but cognizable and ultimately successful, legal theory as stating a claim for fraudulent concealment by the AOAO at the time the AOAO relied on HRS \u00a7 667-5. Therefore, we conclude that the Malabes failed to allege fraudulent concealment sufficient to state a claim to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations on their UDAP claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing Count II of the Malabes' Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In accordance with the above, the Circuit Court's February 17, 2017 Judgment is vacated in part, with respect to the dismissal of Count I of the Complaint, and affirmed in part, with respect to the dismissal of Count II of the Complaint.
