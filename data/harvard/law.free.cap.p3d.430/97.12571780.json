We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Tahnia Santiago and Davey McMillan are the parents of the deceased, Jennifer Boushee. On July 12, 2015, when Ms. Boushee was nineteen years old, she illegally purchased alcohol from a Holiday gas station and attended a house party where she consumed alcohol. That evening, Ms. Boushee drove under the influence of alcohol and died shortly after her vehicle was involved in a highspeed accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 Ms. Boushee died intestate. Santiago, without objection from McMillan, was appointed personal representative of Ms. Boushee's estate on October 5, 2015. In her capacity as personal representative, Santiago pursued wrongful death and survival claims against Holiday Stationstores and the owners of the home where the party was located.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The claims against Holiday Stationstores were settled preceding litigation for $325,000 without allocating specific amounts to wrongful death or survival damages. The District Court approved the settlement, without objection from McMillan. After attorney's fees, costs, and expenses, $204,866.39 remained for distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On August 2, 2017, Santiago filed a motion requesting the District Court to allocate and distribute the remainder of the settlement proceeds. After a hearing, the District Court allocated $194,136.43 to the survival action and the remaining $10,729.96 to wrongful death damages. The District Court held that McMillan could not inherit any portion of the survival damages and awarded him $7.51 in wrongful death damages. The District Court also denied McMillan's motion to remove Santiago as personal representative, finding that she had not breached her fiduciary duty as McMillan claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review a district court's conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Pilgeram v.

The District Court noted Ms. Boushee's age at the time of her death and heard testimony contemplating Ms. Boushee's future earning capacity. Mr. Winter, counsel to Santiago in her capacity as personal representative, testified to the economic analysis prepared before settlement negotiations and discussed that Ms. Boushee's economic damages may have ranged from $800,000 to $1,700,000. While the original demand on Holiday Stationstores was $1,400,000, the claims were settled for $325,000. Funeral and medical expenses were not a part of the demand. The District Court was aware that the claim fell under Montana's Dram Shop Act, which limited the non-economic damages to $250,000. Section 27-1-710(7), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 To reach the $194,136.43 figure, the District Court estimated the economic damages constituted approximately 85% of the $1,400,000 demand. Accordingly, the District Court took 85% of the remaining $204,866.39 to reach its apportionment of $174,136.43 toward economic damages. The District Court then allocated $20,000 toward noneconomic damages, based on the District Court's experience with relatively low noneconomic damages, especially when a jury could find the decedent was somehow at fault. Here, the District Court felt that a jury would find Ms. Boushee at fault for driving under the influence at speeds of approximately ninety miles per hour. The District Court's analysis left $194,136.43 allocated toward survival damages, with the remaining $10,729.96 going to wrongful death damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 The record demonstrates that the District Court's allocation was supported by sufficient evidence. The District Court took judicial notice of relevant facts and law, considered witness testimony, and applied its experience with similar damage awards. The District Court's conclusion did not amount to clear error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 McMillan asserts the District Court erred when it precluded him from inheriting any survival damages. Because Ms. Boushee was unmarried and did not have children, the intestacy statutes dictate that her estate shall pass equally to her surviving parents. Section 72-2-113(1)(b), MCA. However, before a parent can inherit from their child, Montana requires that the parent \"openly treated the child as the parent's and has not refused to support the child.\" Section 72-2-124(3), MCA. McMillan argues that the vehicle he gave Ms. Boushee on her birthday amounted to the statutorily required support. We agree with the District Court that McMillan's birthday present to Ms. Boushee was a gift that does not qualify as support. During Ms. Boushee's lifetime, McMillan never voluntarily provided support. Even when ordered to pay child support, he failed to make a single payment until after Ms. Boushee's death. The District Court was correct in its application of \u00a7 72-2-124(3), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 McMillan also challenges the District Court's formula for allocation of wrongful death damages between himself and Santiago. When the death of one person is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, the personal representative of the decedent's estate may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death. Section 27-1-513, MCA. Wrongful death damages are awarded for grief, loss, sorrow, and loss of consortium, etc. Unlike survival actions, wrongful death actions are personal to the survivors; they are not a part of the intestate estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Bennett,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. In Montana, wrongful death damages \"may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just,\" making Montana's statute a \"general loss\" statute. Section 27-1-323, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Bennett\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. In addition to general damages, parents of an adult child may also seek damages for loss of consortium. Recovery under this theory requires heightened proof of an \"extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship\" between the parents and the adult child.\n   <em>\n    Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ill.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8428732\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/347/\">\n    2005 MT 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8428732\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/347/\">\n    329 Mont. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8428732\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/347/\">\n    125 P.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Bennett\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. In the event of a recovery for wrongful death, the district court may allocate the amount of recovery in a proper pro rata share among the surviving heirs.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Carroll v. Dist. Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2447843\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/139/367/#p372\">\n    139 Mont. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2447843\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/139/367/#p372\">\n    364 P.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (1961). The District Court may allocate \"just\" damages based on substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Farnum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2610397\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/304/#p312\">\n    224 Mont. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2610397\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/304/#p312\">\n    730 P.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396 (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 McMillan claimed both general wrongful death damages and loss of consortium. The District Court concluded that although McMillan was entitled to general wrongful death damages, he was not entitled to loss of consortium damages considering he and Ms. Boushee lacked a sufficiently close and interdependent relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 The District Court believed that McMillan suffered from grief and mental anguish. Consequently, the District Court awarded him $7.51 in general damages. The District Court reached this figure by calculating that McMillan had only been in Ms. Boushee's life for a total of five days of the approximately 6,935 days she lived, or about 0.07%-when multiplied by the $10,729.96 allocated for wrongful death damages, this amounts to approximately $7.51. This result is supported by substantial evidence. McMillan only spent five days with Ms. Boushee throughout her lifetime. Alternatively, Santiago raised and maintained a consistent relationship with Ms. Boushee. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Santiago was entitled to the bulk of the wrongful death damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 The District Court's decision to deny McMillan loss of consortium damages is further supported by substantial evidence. The District Court noted that McMillan \"had the most minimal contact with a child this Court has ever seen.\" McMillan rarely spoke to or saw Ms. Boushee throughout her nineteen years. McMillan did not even attend Ms. Boushee's funeral. The relationship between McMillan and Ms. Boushee was virtually nonexistent, not extraordinarily close and interdependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 The District Court did not err when it found that Santiago fulfilled her fiduciary duties as personal representative. In Montana, personal representatives have a fiduciary duty to use their authority to pursue the best interests of successors to the estate, this includes the duty to pursue wrongful death actions on behalf of those eligible to recover such damages. Section 72-3-610, MCA. A person with an interest in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time. Section 72-3-526(1), MCA. Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the best interests of the estate, or the personal representative has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office. Section 72-3-526(2)(a), (b), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 McMillan claims that Santiago should have been removed as personal representative because she sought remuneration for her own benefit and not McMillan's. According to McMillan, this amounted to a breach of her fiduciary duty. Santiago's motivations for pursuing the settlement are irrelevant. Santiago appropriately sought both wrongful death damages on behalf of successors and survival damages on behalf of the estate-effectively executing her fiduciary duties. Furthermore, once the proceeds of the settlement were recovered, it was up to the District Court to allocate the damages. Thus, Santiago had no control over how the District Court would divide the proceeds between herself and McMillan. Santiago adequately discharged her fiduciary duties and the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied McMillan's motion to remove Santiago as personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 21 McMillan further asserts that he was denied due process because Santiago did not bring claims on his behalf and he cannot bring a loss of consortium suit on his own. Because Santiago pursued claims on McMillan's behalf, there is no evidence to support his assertion that his due process rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 McMillan also claims that Mr. Winter's testimony was improper. McMillan argues that the District Court permitted Mr. Winter to testify to damages without first being qualified as an expert witness. Mr. Winter did not testify as an expert witness. Rather, he testified to the facts of the underlying settlement with Holiday Stationstores. At no point did Mr. Winter offer an opinion as to how the settlement should be allocated. In fact, he readily acknowledged that allocation was for \"the court to determine.\" Next, McMillan argues that Mr. Winter's references to the earning capacity analysis violated the rules against hearsay. The District Court asked Mr. Winter: \"In your economic workup that you did on the case, what was your assertion of the loss of earning capacity?\" Winter responded that his demand ranged from $800,000 to $1,700,000, depending on whether Ms. Boushee obtained a college degree. This response does not fall under the hearsay rule because it was not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. M. R. Evid. 801(c). Mr. Winter simply testified to what the original demand was in the underlying settlement negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, McMillan asserts that he was unfairly prejudiced by the District Court's questioning of the witnesses, which, he argues, amounted to advocacy in favor of Santiago. It is well settled that the presiding judge may, in his or her discretion, direct pertinent questions to elicit the truth, clear up any obscurity in the testimony, or to facilitate the progress of the trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. McConville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4775782\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/64/302/#p308\">\n    64 Mont. 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4775782\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/64/302/#p308\">\n    209 P. 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 989 (1922). The District Court posed neutral questions such as, \"Were there any other economic-related damages that you were claiming?\" and \"Did you have any liens that you needed to satisfy out of the settlement proceeds?\" These questions were within the province of the District Court and did not amount to advocacy in favor of Santiago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 24 The District Court's conclusions of law were correct, and its findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. The allocation and distribution of the settlement proceeds are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 25 We have determined to decide this case pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 3(c) of our Internal Operating Rules, which provides for memorandum opinions.
