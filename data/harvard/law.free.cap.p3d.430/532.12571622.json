Even if such a belief would provide a good-faith basis to reject the tender, the record contains no evidence indicating why the tender was rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nev.

Additionally, although respondent contends that (1) the tender was ineffective because it imposed conditions, (2) U.S. Bank's predecessor needed to record evidence of the tender, and (3) respondent is protected as a bona fide purchaser, we recently rejected similar arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bank of America,\n   </em>\n   134 Nev., Adv.

Additionally, the HOA's account ledger demonstrates that the HOA had not imposed any maintenance or nuisance abatement charges such that U.S. Bank's predecessor should have been required to pay those charges as part of its superpriority tender.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Respondent has not identified any condition that U.S. Bank's predecessor was not legally entitled to impose. We are not persuaded by respondent's argument that the letter accompanying the check contained conditions purporting to absolve the deed of trust beneficiary of any future liability that it may have to the HOA. The letter refers to \"the facts stated herein,\" which can only be reasonably construed as contemplating the underlying foreclosure proceeding and not a future scenario in which the deed of trust beneficiary might again need to cure a default to avoid foreclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </history>\n</casebody>\n"
