The appellants (collectively, \"Taxpayers\") argue their properties qualify for classification as agricultural lands. The Washakie County Board of Equalization (county board) agreed with Taxpayers and reversed the Assessor's valuations. However, the Wyoming State Board of Equalization (state board) reversed the county board's decision, and the district court affirmed the state board's decision.

As had been done since Taxpayers purchased their properties, the assessments classified the Glunz, Matuschka, and Mueller parcels as \"residential vacant\" and the Chicago Properties parcel as \"residential\". Taxpayers appealed their respective assessments to the county board, arguing each property should be classified as agricultural land. Along with their notices of appeal, Taxpayers submitted signed affidavits to verify their properties met the four statutory requirements for classification as agricultural land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-103\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-13-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(x)(B)(I)-(IV) (LexisNexis 2013). In response, the Assessor wrote to Taxpayers requesting financial records to support the affidavits and allow the Assessor to review the reclassification requests prior to the county board's hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers did not\n   respond to the request and, instead, waited to provide documentation in their prehearing disclosures. Consequently, the Assessor did not reclassify the properties and the parties proceeded to hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Taxpayers called two witnesses at the hearing. First, Mr. Bryan O'Donnell testified that he leased and grazed cattle on Chicago Properties' parcel. Mr. O'Donnell's lease was new, however, and did not take effect until after the notice of assessment. Taxpayers next called Mr. Mike Reilly, the president of the board of directors of the Otter Creek Grazing Association (Otter Creek). Otter Creek leased the four parcels for grazing prior to and through the assessment period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The leases required Otter Creek to pay $8 per acre per year and to maintain fencing (a total of $1,280 per year for each 160-acre parcel). Mr. Reilly testified, however, that Otter Creek paid $14 per acre per year, and in turn Taxpayers paid Otter Creek around $6 per acre for fence maintenance. He emphasized that Otter Creek paid Taxpayers by the acre, not by AUM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] Regarding Otter Creek's revenue and activities, Mr. Reilly testified that the association generated more than $1,000 in annual revenue from selling bulls and from selling forage to its members and to non-members. He stated that Otter Creek generally earned more than $1,000 in annual revenue from each of Taxpayers' properties, but he did not provide any details supporting this statement. Mr. Reilly stated the association used \"common sense\" in determining the number of cattle to graze on Taxpayers' properties and did not overuse the properties each year so it could graze the properties again the following year. He testified that Taxpayers' properties were \"well utilized\" and Otter Creek generally used each property to the extent of its productive capacity. Mr. Reilly did not provide any details about Otter Creek's specific use of each property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] The Assessor also testified at the county board's hearing, stating that once Taxpayers provided her with their grazing leases, she considered whether Taxpayers' properties qualified as agricultural land by relying on a method applied in the state board decision,\n   <em>\n    In re Richard &amp; Glenda Hlavnicka from a Valuation Decision of the Fremont County Assessor 2005 Property Valuation\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 2006-87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203327972\">\n    2006 WL 3327972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. Bd. of Equalization Sept. 7, 2006). Based on her understanding of that case, the Assessor evaluated Taxpayers' properties through a hypothetical calculation by supposing the lands were agricultural, applying the required agricultural valuation procedures under the Department of Revenue's (Department) rules and 2014 Agricultural Land Valuation Study, and then comparing the results of those calculations to Taxpayers' grazing lease revenue. She offered into evidence the worksheets she prepared for each property and testified that, in each case, Taxpayers' revenues were far below the properties' expected production values under the Department's study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that she had applied the same method when considering similar requests to reclassify properties as agricultural land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] Taxpayers challenged the Assessor's calculations and proposed their own, slightly\n   different, comparison in a demonstrative exhibit. Taxpayers did not enter that exhibit into evidence or present a witness to testify about Taxpayers' method and calculations. Instead, Taxpayers' attorney used the demonstrative exhibit in his arguments to the board and when cross-examining the Assessor. In response to the questioning, the Assessor asserted the calculations in the exhibit were incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] Following the hearing, the county board reversed the Assessor's valuations, concluding Taxpayers had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that their properties met the four requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-103\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-13-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(x)(B) to be taxed as agricultural land. The Assessor timely appealed to the state board. The state board affirmed the county board's conclusions on the first three statutory requirements, but it reversed the county board's order due to a lack of substantial evidence to support the county board's determination that Taxpayers met their burden on the fourth requirement. Taxpayers appealed to the district court, which affirmed the state board. Taxpayers then timely appealed the district court's order to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] This appeal arises from a challenge to the county board's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order regarding Taxpayers' March 2014 notices of assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review administrative decisions, such as the county board's order, under the guidance of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-3-114\">\n    Wyo.

He testified that Otter Creek generated more than $1,000 in total annual revenue from selling cattle and forage, and that Otter Creek generally earned more than $1,000 in annual revenue from each of Taxpayers' properties. But he did not testify to actual use tied to each specific property consistent with its size, location, and capability to produce as defined by Department rules and the mapping and agricultural manual published by the Department. Regarding Otter Creek's grazing practices, Mr. Reilly broadly stated that Taxpayers' properties were \"well utilized\" and grazed to the extent of their productive capacities, and that Otter Creek used \"common sense\" in determining how heavily to graze the properties and it did not overgraze them. However, he did not testify, for example, about the number of cattle and length of time Otter Creek grazed on each property relative to that property's size, location, or productive capability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b615] Despite the lack of specific evidence on the actual use of each parcel and how that use satisfied the statutory requirement, the county board concluded Taxpayers \"demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the properties' use is consistent with the land size, location, and particularly its capability to produce as an agricultural operation in realizing the rental income it does as grazing land.\" We review whether this conclusion correctly states the law and is supported by substantial evidence. The state board stated in its order, \"We can discern from the record only that Otter Creek sold an undefined number of cattle that were fed on one or more of Taxpayers' parcels during 2013.\" Our review of the record results in the same conclusion. Mr. Reilly's broad statements might speak to one or more of the other three statutory requirements for agricultural lands, but Taxpayers failed to offer evidence establishing that Otter Creek grazed each parcel consistent with its capability to produce. Whether the Assessor failed to present evidence that the properties were not fully utilized is immaterial because the burden is on Taxpayers to overcome the presumption in favor of the Assessor.

The county board compared each Taxpayer's lease revenue from Otter Creek, on a per-acre basis, with what the properties would generate if Taxpayers charged $17.43 per AUM-the rate the Department of Revenue's agricultural land valuation study used to calculate assessments. The county board stated in its order, \"Taxpayers have demonstrated that using the multiplier of yield per acre (AUM's per acre) times income ($17.43) the presumed or putative total annual income is far less than that which is actually received from their lessee, Otter Creek Grazing Association.\" The county board calculated that: 1) the Chicago Properties parcel had a putative total annual lease income of $523.42, but actually earned $1,288.28; 2) the Matuschka parcel's putative income was $468.32, but its actual income was $1,288.28; 3) the Glunz parcel had a putative income of $505.78, but actually earned $1,280; and 4) the Mueller parcel's putative income was $442.81, but its actual income was $1,280.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b617] Taxpayers assert the county board's comparison of actual lease income to putative lease income is appropriate under the Department's regulations and standards and\n   shows Taxpayers' properties are used to their full productive capabilities. They also allege the county board's comparison is superior to the Assessor's methodology, which compared each property's actual lease revenue with the property's minimum agricultural production revenue according to the benchmarks in the Department's study. Although the Assessor testified about the comparison method affirmed by the state board in its decision,\n   <em>\n    In re Hlavnicka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203327972\">\n    2006 WL 3327972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we note neither the Assessor nor the board applied the exact methodology from\n   <em>\n    Hlavnicka\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the Fremont county assessor took a property's reported revenue from marketing agricultural products and compared it to the expected production revenue based on the Department's study for that year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, \u00b6 25, and *11, \u00b6 52. The approach in that case compared the property's actual production revenue with its expected production revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the county board and the Assessor based their comparisons on the actual lease revenue from each of Taxpayers' properties, rather than each parcel's production revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b618] Regardless whether the county board's comparison is better than the Assessor's methodology as Taxpayers suggest, Taxpayers cannot prevail because the board's comparison is not based on evidence in the record. The board's calculations correspond to Taxpayers' demonstrative exhibit, which Taxpayers' attorney argued from during the hearing and then attached to Taxpayers' supplemented proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, no witness testified in support of the demonstrative exhibit and it was not admitted as evidence. The only sworn testimony related to the demonstrative exhibit was that of the Assessor, who testified during cross-examination that the demonstrative exhibit was incorrect. The county board further based its calculations on the unsupported assumption that the Taxpayers' lease revenue evidenced the extent to which Otter Creek used and produced agricultural revenue from each property. The Assessor testified that a landowner could lease a property for grazing without having the land necessarily generate any agricultural product. Taxpayers presented no evidence to support the county board's assumption that each parcel's lease revenue directly corresponded to and evidenced the extent of its agricultural production. For these reasons, the county board's calculations cannot support its conclusion that Taxpayers satisfied the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-103\">\n    Wyo.

Taxpayers chose to go straight to hearing before the county board without providing the Assessor the supporting financial documents she requested in response to the affidavits she received with Taxpayers' appeals. Taxpayers assumed, but failed to meet, their burden to overcome the presumption in favor of the Assessor's 2014 assessments. The record speaks for itself. Taxpayers cannot rely on the county board's unsupported comparison of each property's actual lease income with its expected lease income under the Department of Revenue's agricultural valuation study; nor can Taxpayers meet their burden by baldly attacking the Assessor's comparison methodology. The district court and the state board properly concluded the county board's decision reversing the Assessor was unsupported by substantial evidence.
