In 2015, the Montana Legislature passed Senate\n   Bill 411, which required MDC to close in June 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Mont.%20Laws%202077\">\n    2015 Mont. Laws 2077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In 2007, MDC promoted Alexander to shift manager, a position responsible for all aspects of management for one or more residential treatment units at MDC during assigned shifts. Alexander's duties as a shift manager included supervising psychiatric aides, implementing and monitoring client care and programming, and managing living units and classrooms. When necessary, MDC required shift managers like Alexander to physically restrain clients, which sometimes led to physical confrontations. Between 2007 and 2014, Alexander reported fifteen incidents in which he was attacked or injured by a client while on duty. After one such incident, Alexander underwent shoulder surgery. He returned to work in November 2014, but his treating physician, Dr. DiGiovine, restricted him from physical contact with clients. MDC accommodated Alexander's medical restrictions during his recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 In July 2015, Dr. DiGiovine found Alexander's shoulder could not recover further. He informed Alexander and MDC that Alexander's medical restriction against restraining clients was permanent. Derrek Shepherd (Shepherd), the Americans with Disabilities Act Coordinator and the Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity Specialist for the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, then discussed possible accommodations with Alexander such as a shoulder brace that would allow him to safely restrain clients again. Alexander spoke with Dr. DiGiovine about it, but Dr. DiGiovine concluded a shoulder brace or other support offered Alexander no significant\n   protection from reinjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In September 2015, Alexander proposed an alternative accommodation to MDC that would allow him to remain as shift manager: Alexander asked MDC to staff at least two direct support professionals with him at all times to ensure he would not need to engage in physical confrontations with clients. Shepherd and Donna Gilmer (Gilmer), MDC's Human Resources Manager, discussed Alexander's proposed accommodation, but they found it unworkable. They expressed concerns that even if they could staff Alexander's unit as he had requested-which they found difficult to achieve because of staffing issues confronting MDC due to its impending closure-the additional direct support professionals could not ensure Alexander would not need to restrain clients. Shepherd therefore informed Alexander that Alexander's solution was unfeasible, but he also told Alexander to let him know if there were other accommodations that would allow Alexander to restrain clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Both Shepherd and Gilmer then began discussing alternative positions with Alexander that he could be reassigned to. Shepherd offered to research and identify vacant positions Alexander qualified for once Alexander informed Shepherd of his qualifications, education, and training. Shepherd also advised Alexander to check positions that MDC posted internally through weekly bulletins and publicly through the State of Montana website. Gilmer identified specific vacant positions for Alexander, including a maintenance position and a data control technician position. Alexander expressed to Gilmer he was unqualified for the data control technician position, and he did not follow up with Gilmer or Shepherd regarding other available vacant positions. Likewise, Alexander did not inform Shepherd of his qualifications, education, and training. Alexander did not propose any additional accommodations that would allow him to continue his employment as a shift supervisor. Because MDC and Alexander could not identify an accommodation that would allow Alexander to safely restrain clients-an essential function of the shift supervisor position-and because Alexander did not work with MDC further to identify a vacant position he was qualified to fill, MDC terminated his employment in November 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 After exhausting his administrative remedies, Alexander filed a lawsuit against MDC in the District Court claiming MDC discriminated against him due to his physical disability in violation of the Montana Human\n   Rights Act (MHRA). Both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court ruled in favor of MDC and dismissed Alexander's claim, holding that no genuine issues of\n   material fact existed as to whether MDC engaged in an interactive process with Alexander or provided him with a reasonable accommodation and that MDC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 \"We review a district court's grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria of M.

Alexander also argues that if any open position he may have qualified for was available to MDC, it should be held liable for failing to reassign him. However, when MDC identified vacant positions and requested further qualification information from Alexander these actions were only one part of a greater interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation for Alexander-one that required\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties' interaction. Even if there were open positions available to MDC that Alexander may have qualified for, MDC simply could not determine whether Alexander was qualified or interested in them without his input. Alexander himself hampered the interactive process and prevented MDC from reasonably accommodating him through a reassignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 MDC met its obligations to involve Alexander in an interactive process, even if the process was incomplete: Alexander, Shepherd, and Gilmer all discussed and explored potential accommodations; Shepherd and Gilmer considered Alexander's proposed accommodation; and, after finding Alexander's proposed accommodation unworkable, Shepherd and Gilmer offered to work with Alexander to search for a\n   vacant position for reassignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    UPS Supply Chain Solutions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782254\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/1103/#p1110\">\n    620 F.3d at 1110-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although MDC ultimately did not reassign Alexander, the undisputed facts show MDC made a good faith effort to engage in an interactive process with Alexander to identify potential reasonable accommodations. The subsequent breakdown in the interactive process is solely attributable to Alexander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 Under the MHRA, we will not hold an employer liable for a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee where the facts and circumstances indicate that the employer made a good faith effort to engage in an interactive process to reasonably accommodate the employee and, through the fault of the employee, the interactive process broke down, preventing the employer from realizing the information needed to proceed. The undisputed facts show MDC made a good faith effort to engage in the interactive process, while Alexander did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's decision to grant MDC's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   DIRK M.
