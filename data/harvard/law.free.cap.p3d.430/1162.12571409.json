The Department found Ms. Anderson eligible for the benefits but suspended her eligibility as a penalty for her transfer of assets at below fair market value. Ms. Anderson appealed the length of the penalty period and lost that challenge. Her sons thereafter paid the attorney fees and costs she incurred in her appeal, and she applied to have that payment treated as a return of assets, which would shorten the penalty period. The Department denied the application and, following an evidentiary hearing, its denial was upheld by the Department's director and the district court.

On March 12, 2015, Ms. Anderson was admitted to the Laramie Care Center, and on April 10, 2015, she transferred to Spring Wind, an assisted living facility in Laramie. On October\n   22, 2015, she applied for Medicaid benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] In her Medicaid application, which she submitted through her attorney, Ms. Anderson acknowledged that she had transferred assets in the sixty-month period preceding her application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She identified cash and real property that she had transferred to her sons and their wives between the dates of May 28, 2015 and October 19, 2015, including a modular home in Laramie and a 472-acre ranch in Colorado, which she reported were both sold to her son Philip and his wife for fair market value. Of the assets transferred during the look-back period, Ms. Anderson reported $83,476 as uncompensated transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] On January 27, 2016, the Department notified Ms. Anderson that because she had transferred resources at less than fair market value in the sixty-month period preceding her application, she was not eligible to receive Medicaid benefits until January 12, 2020. In making that determination, the Department rejected Ms. Anderson's reported value of her uncompensated transfers and instead found she had transferred $441,382.60 in assets without fair compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] Ms. Anderson appealed the Department's calculation, with the primary dispute being over the fair market value of the Colorado ranch. An evidentiary hearing was held before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), and the OAH issued proposed findings and conclusions of law recommending that the Department's director uphold the Department's determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department's director accepted the proposed decision and entered a final order, which Ms. Anderson appealed and the district court upheld. Ms. Anderson did not appeal the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] On March 27, 2017, Ms. Anderson, through her attorney, informed the Department that her sons had paid her attorneys $23,818.63, which was the amount of fees and costs she incurred in her appeal of the Department's penalty period determination. Ms. Anderson requested that the Department treat the payment of those fees as a partial return of the cash and assets she gave her sons during the look-back period and reduce the penalty period to account for the return of assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] On April 6, 2017, the Department denied Ms. Anderson's request. By letter, the Department stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Department of Health has reviewed your request to reduce the transfer penalty period for payment of attorney's fees and costs your client incurred as a result of her (or her Power of Attorney's) decision to appeal the Division's calculation of the transfer penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Department of Health Medicaid Rules for Administrative Hearings, Chapter 4, Section 20 states attorney fees are the responsibility of the contestant. Regardless of the source of funds used to pay your attorney's fees and costs, the contestant is responsible for such payment, and therefore it may not be considered a gift back to reduce the transfer penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] On May 4, 2017, Ms. Anderson appealed the denial of her request, and the matter was referred to the OAH for a contested case hearing. Following an evidentiary hearing, the OAH issued proposed findings and conclusions of law recommending that the Department's director reverse the Department's denial. The Department filed exceptions to\n   the OAH-proposed decision and proposed its own findings and conclusions of law. On July 28, 2017, the Department issued an Order Entering Final Decision, which upheld the Department's denial of Ms. Anderson's requested penalty period reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] On August 25, 2017, Ms. Anderson filed a petition for review of the Department's decision, and on January 24, 2018, the district court issued an order affirming it. Ms. Anderson then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b611] \"We review an appeal from a district court's review of an administrative agency's decision as if the case came directly from the agency and give no deference to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The Department does not dispute that it has revised its arguments but contends this is proper because the Court may affirm the administrative decision on any basis supported by the record. We agree with Ms. Anderson that the Department's new argument on appeal is not properly before this Court. We will first address our reasons for that conclusion, and then we will turn to the question of whether the Department's attorney fees rule precluded the payment of Ms. Anderson's attorney fees from qualifying as a return of assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     New Arguments on Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b613] The Department's evolving position in this case centers on its proffered interpretations of the statute governing Medicaid transfer-of-asset penalties and the bases for reducing or waiving those penalties.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-2-402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b614] The Department's original denial of Ms. Anderson's application for a reduction of her penalty period was based solely on its rule requiring a Medicaid contestant to pay her own attorney fees and costs and its view that \"[r]egardless of the source of funds used to pay your attorney's fees and costs, the contestant is responsible for such payment, and therefore it may not be considered a gift back to reduce the transfer penalty.\" During the contested proceeding, however, the Department offered two additional statutory arguments: 1) the Department is not\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to apply one of the section\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-2-402\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-2-402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) grounds for waiving or reducing a penalty period and instead has sole discretion whether to do so; and 2) the Department may deny a reduction in the penalty period if it determines the asset was returned exclusively for the purpose of qualifying for Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b615] The Department's director accepted the Department's argument based on its attorney fee rule. He did not, however, address either of the Department's statutory arguments. He instead provided two alternative bases for upholding the Department's denial.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   51. ... Wyoming Statute \u00a7 42-2-402(e)(iii) (LexisNexis) states that an institutionalized individual is not rendered ineligible for long-term care services due to an asset transfer for less than fair market value within the look back period if the Department determines to the extent assets were transferred for less than fair market value, that the assets or their fair market equivalent have been returned to the individual. Here, Anderson's sons paid Cook and Associates for legal services for Anderson. Payment for legal services does not constitute the assets or their fair market equivalent. Therefore, the Department's determination that Anderson's sons did not return the assets or their fair market equivalent to Anderson was in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   52. Even if payment for legal services was considered the assets or their fair market equivalent, Wyoming Statute \u00a7 42-2-402(e)(iii) (LexisNexis) does not mandate the Department provide credit for partial returns. Indeed, it does not mandate the Department provide credit for anything other than a full return of the assets or their fair market equivalent. ... Here, Anderson's sons paid the sum of $23,818.63 to Cook and Associates for legal services. Payment for those services does not constitute the full return of the assets or their fair market equivalent - nearly $450,000 - to Anderson. Therefore, the Department properly determined that Anderson's sons did not return the assets or their fair market equivalent to Anderson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b616] In its briefing to the district court, in response to Ms. Anderson's petition for review, the Department further revised its position. The Department did not reassert its original statutory arguments, and nor did it argue in support of the alternative bases cited in the Director's final decision. It instead adhered to its original argument that its attorney fees rule precluded the payment of fees from being considered a return of assets, and it offered two new statutory arguments. First, it argued that because Ms. Anderson's sons had commingled the originally gifted assets with their own assets, Ms. Anderson could not and did not prove that the assets returned were the precise assets given. Second, it argued that the plain meaning of the term \"returned\" required that any returned assets be given directly to Ms. Anderson, not to a third-party provider such as her attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b617] The district court rejected the Department's argument that the asset returned had to be the precise asset originally transferred, but it agreed with the Department that because the fee payment was made to Ms. Anderson's attorneys rather than directly to her, it did not qualify as a return of assets. Having affirmed the Department on that basis, the court did not address application of the Department's attorney fees rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b618] In the Department's briefing to this Court, it has omitted any discussion of its attorney fees rule and has framed its position as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The district court did not reach the issue regarding payment of attorney's fees under\n   the Medicaid Rules, finding that the analysis ended with the fact that the assets were not returned to Anderson. The Department similarly limits its analysis to the return of the assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b619] Ms. Anderson argues that because this revised basis for denying Ms. Anderson's penalty reduction was not included in the Department's original decision, we should not consider it. The Department argues that this Court may affirm an agency decision on any ground supported by the record and that its revised basis is therefore properly before the Court. In support, it points to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Powder River Basin Res. Council v. Wyo. Dep't of Envtl.

Dep't of Health, Medicaid Rules, Ch. 4, \u00a7 5 (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b624] The Department's written notice to Ms. Anderson cited only one basis for denying her application, and that was the Chapter 4, Section 20 requirement that a contestant be responsible for her own attorney fees. That the cited rule was the sole basis for the denial was confirmed by the testimony of Dana Pepmeier, the Department's Eligibility &amp; Education Program Manager who considered Ms. Anderson's application and issued the Department's written notice. She testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. So let me be clear. The reason you restricted it is because legal fees are Mrs. Anderson's responsibility to pay; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. So the request was not denied because the sons paid directly for the legal fees?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b625] The record is thus clear that Ms. Anderson had no notice of the Department's revised basis for its decision before she went to hearing. Importantly, under the circumstances of this case, that lack of notice deprived Ms. Anderson not only of an opportunity to present additional evidence, it also deprived her of the opportunity to simply correct the problem. In that regard, Ms. Pepmeier provided testimony showing that Ms. Anderson's sons could have placed the money they paid to her attorneys directly into her checking account and made the payments from that account.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Ms. Pepmeier, you heard Mr. Anderson talk about the $2,000 a month, --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. -- the income that an individual can have in their bank account at the time, you know - on any given month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Yeah. And I think he was referring to resources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. Okay. So could you explain your understanding of how that works with this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Okay. If money comes in to the account during the month, that money has to be spent by the end of the month or it counts as a resource of the first of the following month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. Okay. But there's no restriction of money coming in and out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. No, not as long as that is spent within the same month that it's received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b626] Thus, had Ms. Anderson been on notice, her sons could have re-structured the asset return and thereby avoided the Department's revised basis for its denial. Specifically, Ms. Anderson's attorneys could have returned the funds to her sons, and her sons could have then paid the funds directly to her, with her then paying the attorneys from those funds. Ms. Pepmeier's testimony confirms that the asset return could have been corrected in that manner, and if it had been, the only remaining impediment would have been the Department's application of its attorney fees rule.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. Okay. So in this case if it were determined that the only mistake or incorrect process that was followed was that Mrs. Anderson's sons paid the bills directly, could that be remedied by Cook &amp; Associates returning that money and they paying the money then to Mrs. Anderson's account, and she in turn paying a check from her account for those legal services?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. I think that would - The way I interpret Chapter 4, Section 20, we would still be restricted to allow that as a deduction for transfer penalty because she's paying attorney fees that she's responsible for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b627] Under these circumstances, we find\n   <em>\n    Powder River\n   </em>\n   inapplicable.
