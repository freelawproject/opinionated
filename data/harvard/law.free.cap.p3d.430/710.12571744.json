At the time of her crimes, she was 15 years old. She was sentenced to 614 months (51.2 years) of confinement. After serving 20 years of confinement, she petitioned the ISRB for early release pursuant to RCW 9.94A.730, a 2014 statute governing review of juvenile sentences. Following a hearing on the matter, the ISRB found that she was not releasable. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On May 11, 1996, 15 year old Gail Brashear stopped an adult male in his pickup truck and asked him for a ride. She then got into his passenger seat and shot him twice. Her two male companions then joined her and attempted to move the victim out of the truck. Noticing that the three of them appeared to be having trouble with the truck, two people stopped to offer help. Brashear and her companions asked them where the nearest hospital was. After they left, Brashear fatally stabbed the victim in the neck several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Brashear pleaded guilty to first degree murder, first degree assault, and first degree burglary, with a special finding for use of a deadly weapon on all counts. On May 7, 1997, she was sentenced to a total of 614 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the 20 years between Brashear's sentencing and petition for release, the United States Supreme Court has held that a mandatory life sentence without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crime violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

At the hearing, both Brashear and DOC Classification Counselor (CC) Jessica Poston testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to this testimony, the ISRB considered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [I]nformation provided by the sentencing court/prosecutor; the most recent DOC facility plan; information regarding institutional behavior and programming; any letters of support and/or concerns sent to the Board; the Pre-Sentence Investigation report; and the Psychological Evaluation dated September 21, 2016 [sic] by Deborah Wentworth, Ph.D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 CC Poston stated that Brashear has been a model inmate since making a turnaround in 2008, when she had her last serious infraction. Before making that turnaround, she stated that Brashear's infractions were so significant that she was sent to a program in another state better equipped to handle her \"extreme acting out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Brashear provided the ISRB with a \"disclosure of her index offense\" and context for what was happening in her life at the time of her offenses. She described having a \"shift in her thinking\" in 2008, and stated that since that time she has taken advantage of programming opportunities. The ISRB noted that Brashear \"became quite emotional at times and did appear to be remorseful for her actions.\" It also noted that Brashear appeared to have \"somewhat limited insight into her thinking or emotions at the time of the murder and other violent assault beyond the connection to her codefendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 In its reasoning, the ISRB first discussed the psychological evaluation Dr. Wentworth conducted for the DOC. The ISRB acknowledged Brashear's description of her offense to Dr. Wentworth, the mental health therapy Brashear has received, and Dr. Wentworth's evaluation of Brashear's stability and risk to reoffend. Dr. Wentworth stated that Brashear \"openly and transparently describe[d] the instant offense with no distortions or denials about her role in killing the victim.\" She further stated that Brashear has previously benefitted from mental health treatment \"to address her history of others abusing her and her criminogenic behaviors and thoughts,\" and that she \"has been stable and not required mental health treatment since September 2013.\" Dr. Wentworth concluded that \"[o]verall, the results of this evaluation suggest that Ms. Brashear is at a low risk to reoffend.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She found that Brashear would benefit from continued therapy \"for stress and anger issues, especially concerning those that may stem from possible reintegration into the community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The ISRB next stated that since her behavior escalated in 2007 and 2008,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brashear \"appears to have made a complete shift in her behavior and subsequent programming.\" It found that she acknowledges her role in her crimes and has participated in programs to assist her in understanding her behavior. It continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   However, Ms. Brashear has committed horrible crimes that have left lasting impacts to many of the survivors of her victims. The Board believes it is also important to note that Ms. Brashear has served a relatively small portion of what the minimum sentence is on all counts as well as the SRA [ (Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, ch. 9.94A RCW) ] minimum/maximum. Additionally, the Board has received a strong recommendation from the Snohomish [County] Prosecutor that requests the Board to not release Ms. Brashear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Snohomish County Prosecutor Mark Roe stated in his letter that \"[t]he 20 years [Brashear] has served is simply nowhere near adequate punishment\" for the crime she committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 The ISRB denied Brashear's petition for release. It acknowledged Brashear's \"good work\" since 2008, stating that it would like to see her \"continue to demonstrate that her past behaviors are truly in her past\" and continue to participate in programming \"that will prepare her for a future step down to lower levels of custody and eventually release to the community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 Brashear filed this personal restraint petition (PRP), alleging that the ISRB abused its discretion when it denied her parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Early Release Under RCW 9.94A.730\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 Brashear argues that the ISRB abused its discretion by citing a reason other than recidivism as the only support for its denial of her release.

It acknowledged Dr. Wentworth's finding that Brashear is at a low risk to reoffend. It also acknowledged that Brashear appeared to struggle during her first 10 to 11 years in prison, but then made \"a complete shift in her behavior.\" But, the ISRB did not rely on any direct evidence of Brashear's likelihood to reoffend. It did not cite evidence refuting Dr. Wentworth's\n   finding that Brashear is at a low risk to reoffend or its own acknowledgment that Brashear made a complete shift in her behavior. Instead, it cited Brashear's role in the crimes she committed, the lasting impacts those crimes had on others, the \"relatively small portion\" of the minimum sentence she has served on each count, and Prosecutor Roe's letter opposing her release. The ISRB also failed to discuss any conditions associated with her release and why, despite appropriate conditions, she would be likely to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Early release under RCW 9.94A.730(3) is presumptive unless the ISRB determines that, despite conditions, it is more likely than not that a person will reoffend. The ISRB stated that during her testimony, Brashear appeared to have \"somewhat limited insight into her thinking or emotions at the time of the murder.\" But, Brashear's testimony before the ISRB is not in the record before us. It later stated that she \"acknowledges her role in her crimes.\" And, Dr. Wentworth observed that Brashear \"openly and transparently describe[d] the instant offense with no distortions or denials about her role in killing the victim.\" The ISRB also recognized Brashear's \"complete shift\" in behavior after struggling her first 10 to 11 years in prison. It made note of CC Poston's testimony that Brashear has been a \"model inmate\" since 2008. This dramatic shift in behavior is probative of change and is particularly relevant to the purpose of the statute, consideration of whether a juvenile offender has changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Rather than focusing on the statutory presumption of release, her awareness of her crimes, her changed behavior, her assessed low risk to reoffend, and appropriate release conditions, the ISRB relied on Brashear's underlying crimes, the impact of those crimes, and the small portion of her sentence served in denying her petition. These are not factors that guide the ISRB's decision under RCW 9.94A.730(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 RCW 9.94A.730(4) provides victims and survivors of victims the opportunity to present statements to the ISRB. These statements shall be made in accordance with RCW 7.69.032. RCW 9.94A.730(4). Under RCW 7.69.032, it is the legislature's intent \"to ensure that victims, survivors of victims, and witnesses of crimes are afforded the opportunity to make a statement that will be considered prior to the granting of postsentence release from confinement.\" But, the impact on victims and survivors of victims was a consideration at the time of sentencing in setting the length of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.94A.500(1). The inclusion of the opportunity for such statements here is for a different purpose, and its availability does not change the statutory standard to be applied by the ISRB. The ISRB must order a person released unless it finds that, despite conditions, he or she is more likely than not to reoffend. RCW 9.94A.730(3). Therefore, the statements received pursuant to RCW 9.94A.730(4) are properly considered as to only what community release conditions are appropriate or whether the offender is likely to reoffend. The ISRB did not consider any conditions in reaching its decision. The letters opposing Brashear's release are not probative of her likelihood to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 RCW 9.94A.730 applies only where the crimes of the juvenile were very serious and resulted in very long sentences. Of course Brashear's crimes were heinous. But, Brashear's crime was not one of a limited number of crimes for which the legislature declared that no presumption of release is available. RCW 9.94A.730(1). The statute expressly contemplates that the offender will not serve more than 20 years of their sentence\n   <em>\n    unless they are likely to reoffend\n   </em>\n   . RCW 9.94A.730(3). The ISRB's reliance on Brashear's underlying crimes, their impact, and the portion of her sentence served conflicts with its statutory mandate to consider whether she is more likely than not to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 Brashear's behavioral turn around compared to her first 10 to 11 years in prison is probative of the maturation of a juvenile offender that the statute intended to identify, not probative that Brashear is likely to reoffend. The other direct evidence in the record that assesses Brashear's likelihood to reoffend is Dr. Wentworth's psychological evaluation. It suggests her likelihood to reoffend is low or very low. The ISRB abused its discretion\n   by denying Brashear's release and not determining appropriate release conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Remedy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 At oral argument, the State argued that if this court finds that the ISRB abused its discretion, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case back to the ISRB for it to consider what this court felt it ignored.

We see no reason that a different standard should apply to evaluation of the ISRB in the context of juveniles petitioning under RCW 9.94A.730. But, here, the ISRB was not exercising its very broad discretion in setting a prisoner's minimum term. An abuse of discretion in that context will usually require remand for another opportunity to exercise that discretion. In the context of an early release determination pursuant to RCW 9.94A.730, where the record does not establish a likelihood to reoffend, the statute requires a release on appropriate conditions, not a second bite at the apple.
