Location is also the thing that matters the most in this case. The National Bank Act authorizes a national bank to perform certain fiduciary functions if the law of the state where the national bank is located permits competing entities to engage in those activities. In 2013, a majority of this Court opined that the word \"located\" was unambiguous. With the benefit of more focused briefing we conclude that, as used in the Act, located lends itself to at least two plausible meanings. Because we find Congress's use of the word ambiguous, we must defer to the \"not unreasonable\" interpretation the Comptroller of the Currency has assigned to the word located. Applying that definition, we overturn the decision we reached when this case was before us on interlocutory review. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Loraine Sundquist purchased a home in Utah. At the time of the purchase, she executed a deed of trust, in Utah, naming Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as beneficiary. The deed of trust named an attorney as trustee. ReconTrust Company, N.A. (ReconTrust) later replaced the attorney as trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Sundquist fell behind on her payments. ReconTrust elected to sell the property. The beneficial interests were then assigned to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). ReconTrust, acting as the trustee on the deed, auctioned the property. Bank of America, which later acquired FNMA's interest\n   in the property, asserts that ReconTrust was located in Texas while it acted as the trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   FNMA won the auction and ReconTrust conveyed the property to FNMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 After the sale, Sundquist refused to leave. FNMA brought this action, seeking an order forcing Sundquist from her home. FNMA also asked for damages allegedly arising out of her decision to stay in the property after it had been sold. The district court entered an eviction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Sundquist petitioned for interlocutory review. We granted the petition, which we resolved in\n   <em>\n    Federal National Mortgage Ass'n v. Sundquist (Sundquist I )\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970959\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1004/\">\n    2013 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970959\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1004/\">\n    311 P.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, Sundquist asserted that the sale was invalid because Utah law does not permit a bank to act as a trustee on a trust deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. FNMA countered that Texas law permitted ReconTrust to serve as the trustee and that under the National Bank Act, Texas law applied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The outcome of the case rose and fell on the question of whether Utah law applied. Under Utah law, only certain people and entities can serve as a trustee of a trust deed-for example, active attorneys and title insurance companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 57-1-21, - 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A bank, like ReconTrust, may not. In contrast, ReconTrust argued that Texas law would have permitted ReconTrust to be the trustee and oversee the property's sale.\n   <em>\n    Sundquist I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970959\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1004/\">\n    2013 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970959\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1004/\">\n    311 P.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The relevant portion of the National Bank Act reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (a) Authority of Comptroller of the Currency\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Comptroller of the Currency shall be authorized and empowered to grant by special permit to national banks applying therefor, when not in contravention of State or local law, the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, receiver, or in any other fiduciary capacity in which State banks, trust companies,\n   <em>\n    or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) Grant and exercise of powers deemed not in contravention of State or local law\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Whenever the laws of such State authorize or permit the exercise of any or all of the foregoing powers by State banks, trust companies, or other corporations which compete with national banks, the granting to and the exercise of such powers by national banks shall not be deemed to be in contravention of State or local law within the meaning of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 92a(a) - (b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 8 The central inquiry became, therefore, whether corporations were permitted to serve as trustees of trust deeds \"under the laws of the State in which [ReconTrust] [was] located.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970959\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1004/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 92a(a).

In relevant part, the regulation provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   For each fiduciary relationship, the state referred to in section 92a is the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for that relationship. A national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in the state in which it accepts the fiduciary appointment, executes the documents that create the fiduciary relationship, and makes discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We nevertheless examined the Comptroller's interpretation of the statute and decided that the regulation was unreasonable. We reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]here is nothing in the statute itself that ascribes any particular significance of these three particular acts, while rendering other acts undertaken by the bank irrelevant. Moreover, the three activities identified in the regulation could theoretically be performed in any location without regard to the location of the trust property, thereby allowing national banks to dictate the applicable law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 Ultimately, we concluded that \"[a] state bank which seeks to foreclose on real property in Utah must comply with Utah law.

In other words, Congress clearly stated that it intended to alter the traditional federal-state balance by dictating that a certain set of laws would apply to national banks. And it does not matter which reading we give to the word located.

Sundquist argues that the drafters of this regulation might not have had a trustee of a deed of trust in mind. Sundquist also argues that the regulation is unreasonable because, in the context of a trustee sale of real property, the sale itself is the most important activity. Bank of America\n   responds that Sundquist \"improperly looks only at trust relationships involving real property. But ... section 92a enumerates a variety of fiduciary roles for national banks, and it was manifestly reasonable for the Comptroller to define where a national bank is located by referring to activities that apply to all of these roles, rather than only some.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Furthermore, Bank of America raises a concern that under Sundquist's interpretation a bank might have to be located in different states for different trust functions while performing activities for the same trustor. According to Bank of America, this dynamic makes it reasonable for the Comptroller to base its regulation on a more general set of fiduciary responsibilities that results in a national bank applying the same state's laws to all of those responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 50 We can understand Sundquist's desire for a test that would, when determining where a bank is located for the purpose of serving as a trustee on a deed of trust, be more narrowly focused to that context. But we cannot say it was unreasonable for the Comptroller to employ a general framework for all scenarios the statute governs rather than employ a situation by situation approach. Such an approach could lead to national banks operating under different sets of laws in the same state depending on the type of transaction.

Sundquist distinguishes a trustee under a deed of trust from a trustee of a fiduciary trust, arguing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The former [type of trust] is not a trust in the traditional sense, but merely a device used in some states as a substitute for a traditional mortgage on real property for purposes of debt collection. Under a deed of trust, a \"trustee\" nominally holds legal title to a property to secure a loan and conveys title to the owner upon repayment or, in the event of default, commences foreclosure proceedings, either judicially or, where authorized, through a non-judicial trustee's sale to collect the debt owed. The property is no more held in trust than is a property subject to a traditional mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 54 In response, Bank of America argues that the Comptroller \"has ... long interpreted section 92a(a) to encompass trustees on deeds of trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 55 Section 92a(a) applies to \"the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, receiver, or in any other fiduciary capacity.\" And the Comptroller has determined that the statute covers a fiduciary of a deed of trust.

These trustees might be included in either the term \"trustee\" or the catch-all \"in any other fiduciary capacity.\" As noted above, Sundquist plausibly argues why we might treat these trustees differently. But Bank of America also provides a compelling interpretation: \"[Congress's] use of the phrase 'trustee ... or ... any other fiduciary capacity' strongly suggests that Congress regarded any 'trustee' as a 'fiduciary capacity.' \" (Omissions in original) (Quoting\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%20143993\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The statute, on its face, is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 57 And the Comptroller's interpretation-that the term \"trustee\" includes trustees of a deed of trust-is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Michael Patriarca, OCC Interpretive Letter,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%20143993\">\n    1986 WL 143993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (June 13, 1986). It is perfectly logical to read \"trustee\" to include all trustees rather than only traditional ones.

We Remand to Permit the District Court to Evaluate Where ReconTrust Is Located Under the Correct Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 59 We conclude that section 92a(a) applies and that ReconTrust is located where \"the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for that relationship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%209.7\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). We are bound to interpret \"located\" in harmony with the Comptroller's instruction that a \"national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in the state in which it accepts the fiduciary appointment, executes the documents that create the fiduciary relationship, and makes discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 60 ReconTrust asserts that under that definition, it is located in Texas. Sundquist argues that under the Comptroller's test, ReconTrust is not located in Texas. Specifically, Sundquist argues that a bank is \"appointed trustee of a trust deed does not 'execute' any documents creating a fiduciary relationship, nor does it 'accept' a fiduciary appointment in any location distinct from that where the deed is filed; and a trust deed trustee makes no 'discretionary decisions regarding the investment of fiduciary assets.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 61 Bank of America disputes this, arguing that the record shows that ReconTrust performed all three of these actions in Texas. Because the district court, following our lead from\n   <em>\n    Sundquist I\n   </em>\n   , applied Utah law to the dispute, it has not considered Sundquist's argument on this point. Because the district court has not had the opportunity to address this issue and because of the potential need for factual findings, we remand for the district court to consider this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 62 What Congress meant by the term \"located\" in the National Bank Act cannot be determined from the statute's plain language. Because this is a federal statute accompanied by an agency's interpretation of the ambiguous language,\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   requires us to defer to the \"not unreasonable\" interpretation the agency has provided. Because the Comptroller's interpretation of where a bank is \"located\" is reasonable, we reverse and remand.
