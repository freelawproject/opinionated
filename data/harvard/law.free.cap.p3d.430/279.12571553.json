In exchange for a fee, Yishmael provided members with advice on adverse possession law, lists of houses in foreclosure, forms to use to make claims of abandonment\n   by the owners, and other services. A jury convicted him of the unlawful practice of law. Affirming the conviction, we conclude the statute defining the crime is not void for vagueness, the instruction defining the practice of law was appropriately taken from a court rule, the practice of law by a nonlawyer is a strict liability offense, and the evidence was sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Before the real estate crash of the late 2000s, Yishmael worked as a realtor. After the downturn, he founded an association and recruited members by offering free seminars with PowerPoint presentations focusing on the legal doctrine of adverse possession. He encouraged members to believe that they could legally enter vacant homes, claim them as their own, and secure legal title after 7 to 10 years of occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Yishmael charged $7,000 to $8,000 for membership in his association. Members were entitled to receive his advice on adverse possession, including statutes and case law; listings of homes that were apparently abandoned or that had \"foreclosure\" issues; and legal forms to aid them in making claims of adverse possession. Yishmael promised to stand by and offer guidance if any legal difficulties should arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Yishmael was not a lawyer. The advice he provided to association members was largely erroneous, and the legal documents were effectively meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Yishmael was arrested in April 2016. The State charged him with one count of unlawful practice of law and several counts of theft, attempted theft, conspiracy to commit theft, and offering false instruments for filing or record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 During the course of Yishmael's five-day trial, the State presented the testimony of three former members of his association. When these individuals met Yishmael, they were struggling to pay their monthly rent. Swayed by Yishmael's explanation of adverse possession, they agreed to join his association. They worked out installment plans with Yishmael and began paying membership dues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The three testified similarly about using a list provided by Yishmael to identify vacant homes they were interested in owning. Yishmael in some cases arranged to have a locksmith change the locks on the selected homes. The members moved into the homes they had decided to possess. On Yishmael's advice, they posted \"no trespassing\" signs, filed documents with the recorder's office, and paid for landscaping, repairs, and new appliances. All three testified that they were visited by police officers. Two were arrested. One of them had been offered $1,000 to move out; Yishmael offered to draft a counter-offer for $3,000. Yishmael also advised him on how to deal with the criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Yishmael's defense focused on challenging the theft charges. The facts supporting the charge of unlawful practice went largely uncontested. The jury convicted Yishmael of the unlawful practice of law and acquitted him on the other charges. He was given a sentence of 364 days in jail, suspended on condition that he spend five days in jail and report for 30 days of a community work program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Vagueness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After the defense rested, Yishmael moved to dismiss the charge of unlawful practice of law on the grounds that the statute defining the crime is void for vagueness. Yishmael contends the trial court erred by denying this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Whether a former, shorter version of RCW 2.48.180 was void for vagueness was considered in\n   <em>\n    State v.

A single violation is a gross misdemeanor. RCW 2.48.180(3)(a). RCW 2.48.180(2) has five subsections defining various ways in which the crime may be committed. The State charged Yishmael under the first subsection, which states that the unlawful practice of law occurs when a \"nonlawyer practices law, or holds himself or herself out as entitled to practice law.\" RCW 2.48.180(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The statute does not define the \"practice of law.\" Yishmael argues that without a statutory definition of what it means to practice law, an average person cannot understand what conduct the statute proscribes and penalizes.

At the State's suggestion, and over Yishmael's objection, the trial court used GR 24 to formulate jury instruction 20:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The \"practice of law\" means the application of legal principles and judgment with regard to the circumstances or objectives of another entity or person(s) which requires the knowledge and skill of a person trained in law.

In this case, a single violation is a gross misdemeanor. It is true that subsequent violations are punishable as Class C felonies under RCW 2.48.180(3)(b), but if there are subsequent violations, the offender has already learned from the first prosecution that the unauthorized practice of law is a criminal offense. This fourth factor weighs in favor of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 34 The fifth factor looks at the seriousness of harm to the public. The potential harm of the unlawful practice of law is significant. The drafters' comments to GR 24 state that the \"public has no recourse for poor, illegal, or negligent performance\" of legal services by a nonlawyer. 2 TEGLAND ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 105. Yishmael's \"clients\" were in some cases arrested, all were exposed to potential felony charges as a result of following his advice, and the rightful owners of properties selected for the scheme experienced property losses and criminal trespass. This factor weighs in favor of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 35 The sixth factor is the ease or difficulty of the defendant ascertaining the true facts. GR 24 is a publicly available court rule defining the practice of law. It would not have been difficult for Yishmael to read it and learn that the services he was offering constituted the practice of law. This factor weighs in favor of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 36 Yishmael testified that he did read RCW 2.48.180 before beginning his adverse possession program and concluded that what he planned to do would not violate the statute. He said he understood that practicing law was \"assisting someone with court documents and representing them in court.\" He now argues that the State should be required to prove he knew his services constituted the practice of law. This argument illustrates the significance of the seventh factor, which considers the difficulty of proving intent. In the face of Yishmael's testimony that he subjectively interpreted the statute as not being a bar to his conduct, it would have been difficult for the State to prove that he practiced law knowingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The seventh factor weighs in favor of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 37 The final factor looks at the number of prosecutions. There are few appellate opinions on the criminal prosecution of unlawful practice of law. It is reasonable to infer that criminal prosecutions for this offense are rare.

Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370291\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/192/#p201\">\n    119 Wash.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20P.2d%201068\">\n    829 P.2d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 41 Yishmael was charged under the first subsection of the relevant statute, which states that the unlawful practice of law occurs in two circumstances: when a nonlawyer practices law, or when a nonlawyer holds himself or herself out as entitled to practice law. RCW 2.48.180(2)(a). Yishmael emphasizes that he did not hold himself out to be an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 42 Although the information originally charged Yishmael both with practicing law and with holding himself out as a lawyer, the trial court granted Yishmael's motion to dismiss the holding out charge. The court did not include it in the jury instructions and ordered the parties not to argue about whether Yishmael held himself out as a lawyer. Thus, Yishmael was convicted only for practicing law as a nonlawyer. The evidence was sufficient to support that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 43 In a statement of additional grounds, Yishmael argues that RCW 2.48.180(1) 's definition of nonlawyer is confusing. The statute defines nonlawyer as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"Nonlawyer\" means a person to whom the Washington supreme court has granted a limited authorization to practice law but who practices law outside that authorization,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a person who is not an active member in good standing of the state bar, including persons who are disbarred or suspended from membership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   RCW 2.48.180(1)(b) (emphasis added). Yishmael claims the emphasized \"and\" is a qualifier to the overall definition, not a separate definition. This argument is inconsistent with this court's previous holding that the definition specifies two categories of nonlawyers, not one.\n   <em>\n    State v.
