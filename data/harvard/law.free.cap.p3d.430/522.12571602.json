Stevenson (Stevenson) contracted with Big Sky RV in Billings, Montana, to buy a new Jayco 2014 Eagle Premier 375BHFS (fifth-wheel) for $72,595.00. After trade-in and a down payment, she financed the balance through Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally). Big Sky RV assigned the contract to Ally. The contract required Stevenson to pay Ally 180 monthly payments of $378.74. Big Sky RV delivered the fifth-wheel to Stevenson in Fort Benton, Montana, at the end of August 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 On October 3, 2014, Stevenson took the fifth-wheel to RV City, a Jayco Dealership in Huachuca City, Arizona, after experiencing two tire blowouts while driving at highway speeds. Less than two months after Big Sky RV delivered the fifth-wheel to Stevenson, the fifth-wheel required repairs that took more than seven months. RV City's customer work order detailed forty-one separate mechanical, structural, and aesthetic defects wrong with the fifth-wheel, including that its tires were not highway worthy. RV City completed the repairs on May 13, 2015, and returned the fifth-wheel to Stevenson in Fort\n   Benton, Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Following numerous exchanges between the parties, Stevenson stopped making payments to Ally in April 2015. On November 9, 2015, Ally filed a complaint in District Court seeking possession of the fifth-wheel based on Stevenson's default under the terms of the contract. Stevenson answered Ally's complaint, and filed counterclaims against Ally and third-party claims against Big Sky RV and its officer Donavon Frederickson. Specifically, Stevenson claimed: (1) breach of contract and violation of duty of good faith and fair dealing, (2) negligence, (3) violation of the Montana Consumer Protection Act, and sought punitive damages against Big Sky RV. Stevenson then incorporated these claims against Ally as Big Sky RV's principal. Ally filed a cross-claim against Big Sky RV for indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 On February 29, 2016, Big Sky RV moved for judgment on the pleadings. On February 16, 2017, almost one year later, the District Court denied the motion. On March 9, 2017, Big Sky RV filed an interlocutory appeal contesting the District Court's rulings on venue and subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ally Fin., Inc. v. Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435633\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/388/246/\">\n    2017 MT 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435633\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/388/246/\">\n    388 Mont. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12435633\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/388/246/\">\n    399 P.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On April 13, 2017, while Big Sky RV's interlocutory appeal was still pending, Ally moved for summary judgment. Stevenson and Big Sky RV both opposed. By May 19, 2017, Ally's motion was fully briefed and awaiting the District Court's ruling. On August 8, 2017, this Court affirmed the District Court's rulings on venue and subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ally Fin., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On February 7, 2018, co-counsel for Stevenson filed an appearance. On February 15, 2018, before the District Court ruled on Ally's motion for summary judgment, Stevenson moved to amend her pleading. Her motion was within the September 11, 2018 deadline for filing pre-trial motions set by the scheduling order. Specifically, Stevenson sought to: (1) remove Donovan Frederickson as a third-party defendant, (2) clarify her general allegations of fact common to all counts, (3) dismiss all claims against Ally, except breach of contract, and (4) add a fifth claim against Big Sky RV for misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 On March 9, 2018, eleven months after Ally moved for summary judgment, the District Court issued an order denying Stevenson's motion to amend her pleadings and an order partially granting Ally's motion for summary judgment. Left undecided was Ally's claim for indemnification against Big Sky RV. The District Court reasoned that amendment would unduly prejudice Ally and Big Sky RV and that Stevenson's misrepresentation claim was futile because \"Stevenson [had] not provided any information, other than the allegations recited in her initial complaint that the RV required extensive repairs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Big Sky RV never filed a motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, on March 20, 2018, Big Sky RV and Donavon Frederickson moved for entry of judgment on Stevenson's third-party claims based on the District Court's partial summary judgment order in favor of Ally. On March 23, 2018, Stevenson filed a brief in response to the motion. On April 2, 2018, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Big Sky RV and Donavon Frederickson. Stevenson appeals the District Court's entry of judgment in favor of Big Sky RV and the order denying her motion to amend. Stevenson is not appealing the summary judgment order in favor of Ally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 A district court has discretion to grant or deny a motion to amend a pleading.

Stevenson's complaint alleged that Big Sky RV gave her a tour of the showroom version of the fifth-wheel at issue, that Big Sky RV represented it would sell her the same fifth-wheel but \"brand new,\" and that Big Sky RV sold her a fifth-wheel that was not \"brand new.\" Stevenson attached the work order from RV City, Inc. to support her claims. It detailed forty-one repairs required by the fifth-wheel just two months after purchase. She further alleged that the fifth-wheel's tires were not highway worthy, resulting in two tire blowouts at highway speeds. While these facts supported her original claims against Big Sky RV, they sufficiently support her claims for misrepresentation as well. Because Stevenson's amended third-party complaint does not differ substantially from the claims in her original complaint, allowing amendment would not cause Big Sky RV to waste the money and\n   effort it has spent at this stage in the proceeding. Similarly, Big Sky RV had notice, as misrepresentation is conceptually enshrined within the allegations of Stevenson's breach of contract and Montana Consumer Protection Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 The District Court determined that amendment unduly prejudiced Big Sky RV because more than two years had passed since Stevenson's original pleading. However, this Court has ruled that prolonged delay alone does not warrant denial, especially when the delay is not undue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rolan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. The delay in this litigation is not attributable to Stevenson. Rather, Big Sky RV filed an interlocutory appeal contesting venue and subject matter jurisdiction. Further, the District Court took eleven months to grant Ally's motion for summary judgment. Big Sky RV is not prejudiced simply because the proceeding has taken over two years. The motion was filed prior to the deadline given by the District Court for pre-trial motions. The issue is whether amendment would have caused Big Sky RV to waste the resources it spent over that delay to its prejudice. We conclude it would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Moreover, Big Sky RV is not prejudiced because Stevenson moved to amend after Ally filed a motion for summary judgment. Undue prejudice toward Ally is not at issue. Ally does not appeal, nor does Stevenson appeal the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Ally. Significantly, Big Sky RV never moved for summary judgment. In fact, Big Sky RV opposed Ally's motion for summary judgment. Big Sky RV cannot claim prejudice when it did not file a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Big Sky RV further contends that Stevenson's only justification in amending her complaint is that her new counsel noticed claims overlooked by her previous counsel. However, we conclude that Stevenson's motion to amend is reasonably justified. The amendment would simplify and clarify the facts, claims, and parties before the District Court. In addition to adding the misrepresentation claim against Big Sky RV, Stevenson's amended pleading dismissed three claims against Ally and removed Donovan Frederickson as a third-party defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 In addition to undue prejudice, courts properly deny leave to amend for futility or legal insufficiency to support the requested relief.\n   <em>\n    Hobble-Diamond Cattle Co. v.
