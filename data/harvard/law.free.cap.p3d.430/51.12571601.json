Quinn, of Kansas City, Kansas. Respondent was admitted to practice law in the state of Kansas on May 15, 1981. Her license to practice law was temporarily suspended on October 5, 2011, due to felony convictions on tax-related charges in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 18, 2014, the Disciplinary Administrator's office filed a formal complaint against respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). Respondent initially failed to answer the formal complaint, but before a scheduled panel hearing she successfully moved to have her license transferred from temporary suspension to disability inactive status. These proceedings were stayed indefinitely. On April 11, 2017, respondent's license status changed back to temporary suspension because she had not obtained an ordered independent mental health evaluation. The disciplinary proceedings resumed, and the respondent answered the allegations of misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys held a hearing on November 28, 2017. Respondent appeared pro se. The hearing panel determined she violated KRPC 8.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before this court, the Disciplinary Administrator's office asked for an indefinite period of suspension made retroactive such that respondent would be eligible to apply for reinstatement immediately upon the filing of the court's decision, which also would trigger a required reinstatement hearing. Respondent expressed a preference not to be required to undergo a reinstatement hearing, so that she may immediately resume practicing law. We quote the report's pertinent parts below.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"3. For years, the respondent engaged in the private practice of law in Kansas City, Kansas. The respondent was the sole proprietor of her law office. The respondent employed others at her law office. For an extended period of time, the respondent withheld federal employment taxes from her employees' paychecks, but did not pay over the withheld funds to the Internal Revenue Service (hereinafter 'the IRS'). In total, the respondent withheld but failed to forward more than $238,000 in federal taxes to the IRS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"4. In 2002 and 2003, while the respondent filed individual federal income tax returns, the respondent failed to pay her individual federal income taxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"5. On June 17, 2009, a federal grand jury, convened in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, returned a nine count indictment against the\n   respondent including seven counts of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207202\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (willful failure to pay employment taxes) and two counts of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207203\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (willful failure to pay income taxes).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"6. After she was charged, the respondent paid the IRS the previously withheld but unpaid federal employment taxes. After the respondent paid the employment taxes, the grand jury returned a second indictment which reflected that the employment taxes were no longer owing. The criminal case proceeded to trial. On March 15, 2011, a jury convicted the respondent as charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"7. On June 21, 2011, the respondent self-reported the convictions. On October 5, 2011, the Kansas Supreme Court issued an order under Rule 203(c), temporarily suspending the respondent's license to practice law, due to her felony convictions. The respondent filed a motion to vacate the order of temporary suspension. On October 12, 2011, the Court denied the respondent's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"8. On November 18, 2011, the federal court sentenced the respondent to a controlling sentence of 36 months in prison, 36 months post-release supervision, and restitution in the amount of $70,118.34, for the interest which previously accumulated on the unpaid employment taxes, for the individual federal income taxes, and for the interest on the individual federal income taxes. On May 7, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the respondent's convictions and sentence. Following prison, the respondent went to a half-way house. After being released from the half-way house, the respondent returned home on post-release supervision. On August 5, 2017, the respondent was released from post-release supervision. While the respondent has been released from post-release supervision, she continues to owe and pay restitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"9. ...

Walczak, deputy disciplinary administrator, filed a formal complaint in the instant disciplinary case, alleging that the respondent violated [KRPC] 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). That same day, Mr. Walczak filed a notice of hearing, confirming that a hearing on the formal complaint was scheduled for November 18, 2014. The respondent failed to file a timely answer to the formal complaint. On October 8, 2014, Mr. Walczak filed a supplement to the formal complaint, alleging that the respondent violated Rule 211(b) by failing to file an answer to the formal complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"11. On October 28, 2014, Mr. Walczak filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , seeking an order prohibiting the respondent from attempting to impeach her criminal convictions by reopening or retrying the facts of her convictions, presenting evidence on her motives, and arguing a lack of fairness of procedural or evidentiary standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"12.

The respondent attached a letter from her treating psychiatrist, dated November 6, 2014, as well as an evaluation from her treating psychiatrist, dated December 23, 2010. On November 10, 2014, the hearing panel filed a petition with the Court under Rule 220(b) seeking to have the respondent's license immediately transferred to disability inactive status. That same day, the hearing panel indefinitely continued the hearing on the formal complaint. On November 13, 2014, because of the sensitive nature of the contents of the motion and attachments, Mr. Walczak filed a motion seeking an order sealing the motion and attachments. Also, on November 13, 2014, Mr. Walczak filed a motion seeking an order for an independent mental health evaluation of the respondent to determine whether the respondent's license should remain transferred to disability inactive status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"13. On November 20, 2014, the Court issued an order transferring the respondent's license to disability inactive status.

Finally, the Court ordered that the respondent's motion and attachments be maintained under seal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"14. On January 20, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to rescind the order for an independent mental health evaluation or, in the alternative, a motion allowing the respondent to select the evaluator.

On January 26, 2017, the Court issued an order to the respondent to appear on March 15, 2017, and show cause why she had not complied with the April 29, 2015, order to undergo an independent mental health evaluation. On March 15, 2017, Ms. Hughes and the respondent appeared before the Court. Thereafter, on April 11, 2017, the Court issued an order, concluding that the respondent failed to comply with the Court's previous orders dated November 18, 2014, and April 29, 2015.

Additionally, the respondent was convicted of two misdemeanors for failing to pay her individual federal income taxes. The hearing panel concludes that convictions for willfully failing to pay employment taxes and willfully failing to pay individual income taxes are criminal acts that reflect adversely on the respondent's trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer in other respects.

The hearing panel further recommends that the suspension be made retroactive to the date of the respondent's temporary suspension, October 5, 2011. The hearing panel recognizes that based on the history of this case, if the Court adopts the hearing panel's recommendation, the respondent would be eligible for reinstatement without further proceedings at the time the Court's opinion is released. The hearing panel concludes that this is an appropriate discipline to be imposed because, even excluding the time the respondent's license was on disability inactive status, the respondent's license has already been suspended for more than four years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"35.

The hearing panel unanimously recommended respondent's license be suspended for a three-year fixed period. The hearing panel further recommended the suspension be made retroactive to the date of the respondent's temporary suspension, October 5, 2011. Before this court, the Disciplinary Administrator's office recommended respondent's license be indefinitely suspended and that the suspension be made retroactive to three years prior to the final hearing report, which would require the respondent to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264) before returning to the practice of law. As a practical matter, the necessity for a reinstatement hearing is the only difference between the two recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The hearing panel's recommendations are advisory only and do not prevent us from imposing greater or lesser sanctions.

The majority sets this effective date with the understanding respondent will be eligible to apply for reinstatement under Rule 219 as of the date of this decision, which will require a reinstatement hearing. A minority of the court would disbar respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In entering this order of discipline, the court notes respondent has not been authorized to practice law since October 2011. Accordingly, before reinstatement will be ordered, respondent must complete a bar exam review course approved by the court for that purpose, as well as complete additional continuing legal education as follows: 10 hours of law practice management and 10 hours of ethics. Respondent may fulfill the bar exam review and other continuing legal education requirements while her application for reinstatement is pending, but they must be completed before reinstatement will be ordered by this court. Respondent is not required to retake the bar exam, but only a review course typically used in preparation in advance of the examination. Additional conditions for reinstatement may be explored by the Disciplinary Administrator's office, a reinstatement panel, or the court during the reinstatement process. Those issues may include whether respondent is currently in compliance with this court's prior orders, including submitting to an independent mental health evaluation.
