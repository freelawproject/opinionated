The girls first met Brettell in November 2013. Initially, Brettell offered them jobs at his campground and paid them in cash, alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes. Later, he began inviting L.K. to drink, smoke marijuana, and have sex. Usually, L.K. was unconscious from marijuana or alcohol intoxication when Brettell had sex with her. She does remember one episode of sexual intercourse when she was sober. In April or May of 2014 Brettell began having sex with T.U. T.U. reported one incident when she was intoxicated and Brettell had sex with her in his truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In June 2014, L.K. reported Brettell to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Its investigation revealed, among other things, explicit text messages sent by Brettell to the victims and images of a naked girl on his phone. A search of his computer disclosed several Internet searches for images of rape and sexual assault and more than 100 sexually explicit images of children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Brettell was arrested on February 15, 2015. On October 28, 2015, he pleaded guilty to two counts of rape of a child in the third degree and a single count of commercial sexual abuse of a minor. His plea agreement stated that the State's affidavit of probable cause established the factual basis for his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On February 22, 2016, the court sentenced Brettell to 72 months of confinement followed by 36 months of community custody. It imposed 27 community custody conditions. Brettell did not appeal his sentence. Brettell now challenges his sentence with this personal restraint petition (PRP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 To receive collateral relief by a PRP, a petitioner must show either a constitutional error that resulted in actual and substantial prejudice or a nonconstitutional error that resulted in a fundamental defect that caused a complete miscarriage of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 This court reviews a community custody condition for abuse of discretion and will reverse a manifestly unreasonable condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The imposition of an unconstitutional condition is always manifestly unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   An appellate court does not presume that a community custody condition is constitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Brettell challenges six community custody conditions the sentencing court imposed. He claims that two conditions are unconstitutionally vague and all six exceed the court's statutory authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State concedes that the condition prohibiting Brettell from frequenting \"areas where minor children are known to congregate\" is unconstitutionally vague. We accept the State's concession and reject Brettell's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Unconstitutionally Vague Challenge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Constitutional due process requires fair warning of proscribed behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A community custody condition that does not provide this warning is unconstitutionally vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, a community custody condition must (1) \"define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is proscribed\" and (2) \"provide ascertainable standards of guilt to protect against arbitrary enforcement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a condition implicates First Amendment rights, like the right of assembly, it also must be particularly clear so as not to \"cause a chilling effect\" on the implicated rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 If a person of ordinary intelligence can understand what behavior a condition forbids, given the context in which its terms are used, the community custody condition is valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And a sufficiently clear condition can survive a vagueness challenge \" 'notwithstanding some possible areas of disagreement.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The condition does not need to provide \"complete certainty as to the exact point at which [the convicted person's] actions would be classified as prohibited conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Prohibition on Brettell Frequenting where Minor Children Are Known To Congregate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Brettell contends that the condition prohibiting him from \"frequent[ing] areas where minor children are known to congregate, as defined by the supervising Community Corrections Officer\" (CCO) is unconstitutionally vague. Brettell does not show actual and substantial prejudice caused by this condition. But the State agrees that it is impermissibly vague and should be rewritten. So we do not analyze the merits of Brettell's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Prohibition on Brettell Associating with Known Users or Sellers of Illegal Drugs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 Brettell also claims that the condition barring him from \"associat[ing]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   with known users or sellers of illegal drugs\" is unconstitutionally vague. He contends that the condition does not make dear who must have the knowledge required by the \"known\" term. And he claims that \"users or sellers of illegal drugs\" does not sufficiently define the group of people he must avoid. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 Brettell correctly notes that restrictions on association implicate the First Amendment. When a condition involves a constitutionally protected right, its language must be clear and necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a court may restrict a convicted offender's association rights if \" 'reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the state and public order.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And RCW 9.94A.703(3)(b) gives a sentencing court clear statutory authority to restrict an offender's contact with a specified class of people.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   A community custody condition restricting association is not vague if an ordinary person can understand the people to be avoided and it provides standards sufficient to protect against arbitrary enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 Brettell claims that the word \"known\" makes the condition vague because it does not state who must \"know\" that a particular person used or sold illegal drugs before he must avoid that person. Brettell does not cite any cases where \"known,\" when used in a community custody condition, refers to the knowledge of anyone other than the offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Ninth Circuit rejected a vagueness challenge to a condition for supervised release that stated \"defendant shall not associate with any member of any criminal street gang.\" Consistent with what the court described as \"well-established jurisprudence,\" it presumed that the condition prohibited the defendant's knowing misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   court noted that while constitutional, the condition would be clearer if it included the term \"known.\" This would have limited the condition's reach to people known by the defendant to be gang members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brettell does not present legal authority contrary to\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   or otherwise show how the term \"known\" itself makes the condition vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Brettell also asserts that the condition is unclear because the terms \"users and sellers\" might refer to people's actions in the distant past and/or those they are no longer engaged in. A court interprets an undefined term in a community custody condition based on its plain meaning, which includes the dictionary definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The definition of \"user\" is \"one that uses; specif[ically]: a person who uses alcoholic beverages or narcotics.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The definition of \"use\" is \"the act or practice of using something.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The definition of \"seller\" is \"one that offers for sale.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the terms \"users or sellers\" refer to ongoing current activity. Like the terms \"using, possessing, or dealing\" found constitutional in\n   <em>\n    State v. Llamas-Villa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   they effectively notify a person of ordinary intelligence what behavior is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Brettell also contends that the term \"illegal drugs\" reinforces the vagueness of \"known.\" With some states' decriminalization of \"recreational marijuana, it does not provide fair notice to write conditions in terms of 'illegal drugs.' \" Washington no\n   longer criminalizes the use and possession of limited quantities of marijuana\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this conduct remains a federal offense, governed by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CSA preempts state law, even for marijuana wholly grown and distributed intrastate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complication of different state and federal drug enforcement policies does not excuse a person from knowing that for marijuana, it is still \"illegal.\" The mere fact that only the federal government prohibits recreational marijuana use and possession does not make the term \"illegal drugs\" vague as applied to marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Finally, Brettell asks this court to consider dicta from its unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an aside, the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   court indicated approval of the trial court's rejection of a condition, recommended during sentencing, forbidding Brown from associating with \"known drug users.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 We are not bound by unpublished decisions, let alone dicta in them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the condition in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is not the same as the condition at issue here. The challenged condition prohibits Brettell from associating with \"known users and sellers of illegal drugs.\" In contrast, the condition in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   prohibited association with \"known drug users\" and did not limit the restriction to \"illegal\" users.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that this condition is not impermissibly vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Statutory Authority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Brettell next claims the court exceeded its statutory authority by imposing conditions involving controlled substances and treatment because they are not sufficiently crime related. He also claims the court exceeded its statutory authority by imposing a condition requiring plethysmograph testing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 RCW 9.94A.703 describes the conditions a court can impose when sentencing a person to a term of community custody. It identifies four categories of conditions: mandatory, waivable, discretionary, and special.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute defines \"waivable conditions\" as those that \"the court shall order\" unless \"waived by the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute defines \"discretionary conditions\" as those that the court may order and lists six conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   These include a requirement that the offender \"[c]omply with any crime-related prohibitions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Crime-related\" means \"conduct that directly relates to the circumstances of the crime for which the offender has been convicted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   A sentencing court can also require that an offender perform \"affirmative acts necessary to monitor compliance\" with the community custody conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    A. Waivable Conditions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Brettell asserts that the condition requiring that he \"not possess or consume\n   controlled substances unless [he has] a legally issued prescription\" is not crime related. But RCW 9.94A.703(2)(c) defines this as a waivable and not a discretionary condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   So the court had authority to impose it without it being related to Brettell's underlying crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    B. Discretionary Conditions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 Brettell claims that the sentencing court exceeded its authority by imposing these four conditions: condition 12: \"Do not associate with known users or sellers of illegal drugs\"; condition 13: \"Do not possess drug paraphernalia\"; condition 22: \"Participate in urinalysis, Breathalyzer, and polygraph examinations as directed by the supervising Community Corrections Officer, to monitor compliance with conditions of community custody\"; and condition 23: \"Submit to plethysmograph testing, as directed by a certified sexual deviancy treatment provider.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25 Brettell does not identify sufficient evidence to show that the challenged conditions unlawfully restrain him. Even if he had provided more than just conclusory assertions, the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by imposing these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Drug and alcohol-related conditions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 Brettell challenges as not sufficiently crime related the condition restricting his association with \"known users or sellers of illegal drugs,\" the condition restricting his \"possess[ion] of drug paraphernalia,\" and the condition requiring he participate in \"urinalysis [and] Breathalyzer\" testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 A petitioner claiming that a \"crime-related prohibition\" is not reasonably related to the underlying offense must include evidence of the circumstances of the crime to support his argument Here, Brettell provides only bare assertions. So he does not make the required prima facie showing that the court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 Even if Brettell supported his assertion with evidence, the uncontested facts identified by the State in response to his PRP demonstrate that these conditions are sufficiently crime related. Brettell gave his victims alcohol and marijuana before and during the assaults. During many of the assaults, the victims were intoxicated, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness. He also used the promise of drugs and alcohol to entice at least one of his victims, L.K., to him, and thus facilitate the assault. The court did not err in imposing drug and alcohol related conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Plethysmograph Testing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29 Last, Brettell challenges the condition requiring that he \"[s]ubmit to plethysmograph testing as directed by a certified sexual deviancy treatment provider.\" Brettell acknowledges that a court may order plethysmograph testing when it orders crime-related deviancy treatment. He asserts that the sentencing court did not order him to \"participate in sexual deviancy treatment\" because the pertinent condition does not include the express phrase \"participate in sexual deviancy treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 30 Brettell minces words. A community custody condition required that Brettell be evaluated by and follow the recommended course of treatment of a certified sexual deviancy counselor. The court had authority to require plethysmograph testing as a means for assessment and monitoring compliance during the treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31 Brettell also claims the plethysmograph testing is invalid because the court was \"without authority to order plethysmograph testing upon direction of the Community Corrections Officer.\" However, the condition itself does not authorize the CCO to order a plethysmograph test, only a \"certified sexual deviancy treatment provider.\" So this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Timeliness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 32 Brettell notes that the one-year time restriction on collateral attacks may bar his vagueness challenge to condition 12. Because\n   his claim fails on its merits and the State does not challenge the timeliness of the attack, we do not address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 33 Because the State agrees that condition six is unconstitutionally vague, we vacate it and remand to the trial court to address it in a manner consistent with this decision. As Brettell fails to show the invalidity of any other challenged condition, we otherwise deny his request for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Verellen, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Dwyer, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Brettell challenged 10 conditions in his original PRP.
