A.S. argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence found by the vice principal of Meadowdale Middle School when he searched A.S.'s backpack on school grounds. Because the search of A.S.'s backpack was not reasonable under the circumstances, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On April 11, 2016, Meadowdale staff received information about an alleged threat involving then 14-year-old A.S., who was not a Meadowdale student. Meadowdale staff looked up A.S.'s picture using the district's computer system so that they would be able to identify her should she appear on campus. Later that day, Joseph Webster, Meadowdale's vice principal, saw A.S. walk by the school's office. Webster approached A.S., called out her name, and asked her to come with him to the office. Webster later testified that if he were to encounter an individual he thought did not have a reason to be on campus, he ordinarily would ask that person to leave. He did not do so here because he believed A.S. was there for a \"negative reason.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 A.S. complied with Webster's request to accompany him to the school office. Webster brought A.S. to Principal Jennifer Kniseley's office, where Kniseley began asking A.S. questions about why she was on the Meadowdale campus. A.S. was not very cooperative. After about five minutes, Kniseley remarked to Webster that A.S. was not being very cooperative and decided to call the police. A.S. was told that the police were being called. Webster later testified that had A.S. gotten up and decided to leave, she would have been allowed to do so. Webster also testified that because A.S. was not a student at Meadowdale, he and Kniseley did not have any ability to issue any discipline to A.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 At some point while A.S. was in Kniseley's office, Webster noticed an odor that he recognized as marijuana emanating from A.S. Webster then searched A.S.'s backpack, which was sitting next to her, and found suspected marijuana and drug paraphernalia. A.S. did not say or do anything to resist Webster's search of her backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 A police officer responded at 2:29 p.m.-less than half an hour after Webster first observed A.S. on campus-and A.S. was later charged by information with possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance. Prior to trial, A.S. moved to suppress the evidence of the suspected marijuana and drug paraphernalia found in her backpack, arguing that the evidence was the fruit of an unlawful search and seizure. Specifically, A.S. argued that the \"school search exception\" to the warrant requirement did not apply to her because she was not a Meadowdale student when Webster searched her backpack and even if the exception did apply, the search was not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The trial court denied A.S.'s motion and, following a stipulated bench trial, convicted A.S. of both possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance. A.S. appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The facts are not in dispute, and A.S. challenges only the trial court's conclusions of law.

We decline to adopt such a bright-line rule because doing so would reach beyond the facts here: Even assuming that the exception applies to nonstudents, the search conducted by Webster does not pass muster under the\n   <em>\n    McKinnon\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 Specifically, nothing in the record suggests that Webster, who guessed that A.S. was middle school aged, knew anything about A.S.'s history or school record. Indeed, Webster testified that when he looked up A.S. in the district database, he was only interested in her picture. Furthermore, there was no evidence that drug use was a problem at Meadowdale. Rather, when asked whether Meadowdale had a drug problem, Webster responded, \"I don't believe so.\" He also testified that he did not deal with drugs on a regular basis as a school administrator and that Meadowdale had only \"occasional incidents\" on its campus involving students bringing drugs or drug paraphernalia on campus. Additionally, there was no exigency to conduct the search without delay, given that the police had been called, and A.S.-who had been told that the police were called-gave no indication that she was trying to leave the principal's office. And finally, the odor of marijuana alone did not create an exigent circumstance, particularly where Webster had no other reason to believe that A.S. used marijuana or that her backpack would contain marijuana. For these same reasons, the search of A.S.'s backpack was not justified at its inception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State argues that the search of A.S.'s backpack was reasonable because courts have generally \" 'recognized students have a lower expectation of privacy because of the nature o[f] the school environment.' \" Br. of Resp't at 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    York v.

Here, Webster searched the backpack of A.S., a 14-year-old nonstudent he had no ability to discipline. He based his search solely on an odor of marijuana emanating from A.S. as she sat in the principal's office waiting for a police officer to arrive. A.S. gave no indication that she planned to leave, and her backpack was merely sitting next to her.

Indeed, Webster testified that he did not do any investigation into the alleged threat involving A.S. and that when he looked up A.S. in the district computer system, he was only interested in her picture. Furthermore, there is no evidence that drug use was a serious, ongoing problem at Meadowdale. Rather, Webster testified that he did not believe that Meadowdale had a drug problem and that Meadowdale had only \"occasional incidents\" involving students bringing drugs on campus. Additionally, no exigency was present because unlike\n   <em>\n    Slattery\n   </em>\n   , there was no car involved. At the time of the search, A.S. was sitting in the principal's office, waiting for the police to arrive. The State argues that A.S. could have walked away and then school officials would have had no control over her, but this argument is not persuasive given that A.S. never indicated that she wanted to leave and given that she had been told that the police were being called.
