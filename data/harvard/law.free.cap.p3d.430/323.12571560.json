Pursuant to a plea agreement, Appellant entered an unconditional \"no contest\" plea to one felony count of inference with a peace officer. Wyo.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 6-5-204(b). The district court imposed a 2 to 4-year sentence. Appellant filed this appeal to challenge the district court's April 24, 2018, \"Judgment and Sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On July 11, 2018, Appellant's court-appointed appellate counsel filed a \"Motion to Withdraw as Counsel,\" pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

This Court subsequently permitted Appellant to \"file with this Court a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues she would like the Court to consider in this appeal.\" Appellant filed her\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief pursuant to that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Now, following a careful review of the record, the \"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief\" submitted by appellate counsel, and the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief filed by Appellant, this Court finds that appellate counsel's motion to withdraw should be granted and the district court's \"Judgment and Sentence\" should be affirmed. With respect to the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel made in the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief, this Court concludes those claims cannot be sustained on the record extant.
