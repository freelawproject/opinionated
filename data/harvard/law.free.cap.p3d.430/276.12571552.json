C.A.C. contends that the designated mental health professional who recommended his initial detention did not fulfill the requirement of a statute that required a designated mental health professional to \"consult with any examining emergency room physician regarding the physician's observations and opinions relating to the person's condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On June 20, 2017, Jennifer Palmer, a designated mental health professional (DMHP), received a referral regarding C.A.C. while C.A.C. was staying in his father's home. When Palmer arrived, she found that C.A.C. had barricaded himself in the home and refused to leave, leading Palmer to request police assistance. After police arrived, Palmer evaluated C.A.C. in the home without a physician present. Palmer directed that C.A.C. be placed in emergency custody for no more than 72 hours pursuant to former RCW 71.05.153 (2015). C.A.C. was taken to Fairfax Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Within the 72 hour-period, Sonja Kottke, a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner at Fairfax Hospital, filed a petition in superior court, requesting a 14-day commitment for involuntary treatment. C.A.C. moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the DMHP had violated former RCW 71.05.154 (2013)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by not consulting with an emergency room physician before recommending detention. The trial court heard arguments on this motion and denied it, reasoning that former RCW 71.05.154 did not \"create[ ] an affirmative obligation [for a DMHP] to seek out an emergency room physician where the ... investigation ... is happening in the field.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 After denying C.A.C.'s motion, the trial court held a probable cause hearing as to the 14-day involuntary treatment petition pursuant to RCW 71.05.240. The trial court ordered the commitment. C.A.C. appeals from that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 C.A.C. avers that Palmer violated former RCW 71.05.154 by not consulting with an emergency room physician before making the decision to detain him. He contends that this failure amounted to a total disregard of the requirements of the involuntary treatment act (ITA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, thus, that his detention was unlawful.

In holding that K.R.'s detention was improper, Division Two rejected an interpretation of former RCW 71.05.154 that would not require DMHPs to consult with physicians where none were available.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At oral argument, the State argued that because RCW 71.05.153 allows a person to be taken to places other than a hospital, a DMHP is not actually required to consult with an examining physician. The State's argument ignores the explicit requirement in RCW 71.05.154 that a DMHP \"\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consult with any examining emergency room physician\" and that the DMHP \"\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   document the consultation with an examining emergency room physician, including the physician's observations or opinions regarding whether detention of the person is appropriate.\" RCW 71.05.154 (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    K.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454258\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/195/843/#p846\">\n    195 Wash.

C.A.C. relies on\n   <em>\n    K.R.\n   </em>\n   and its strict interpretation of former RCW 71.05.154 to contend that his initial detention was improper. However, such an interpretation could render detentions made outside of hospital emergency room settings onerous or even impossible. Pursuant to the interpretation adopted by the\n   <em>\n    K.R.\n   </em>\n   court, a DMHP would be unable to make the decision to detain a person without first transporting that person to a hospital emergency room and waiting until a physician became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 Confronted with this issue, the trial court herein interpreted former RCW 71.05.154 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I have ruled before and would rule again today that it's really the word \"any\" in the first sentence of [ RCW 71.05.154 ] that drives the court's analysis that this is not a statute that creates an affirmative obligation to seek out an emergency room physician where the interaction, investigation, and decision is happening in the field, rather it places an affirmative responsibility on the DMHP to seek out, consult with, and consider the input of an emergency room physician who, given the circumstances of a particular case, is engaged in the evaluation and care of the patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 We agree with the trial court that the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   examining emergency room physician\" indicates that the legislature contemplated situations in which a detention would have to be commenced outside the presence of an examining physician. The term \"any\" indicates one of an existing set of physicians, \"indicat[ing] a positive but undetermined number or amount.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 97 (2002). When there is no \"positive ... number or amount\" of physicians available, it follows that there is not \"any\" one physician with whom to consult. Thus, given that no examining emergency room physician had observed the respondent, the physician consultation requirement of subsection .154 did not apply to the DMHP's determination. This interpretation is consistent with RCW 71.05.153(1), which both anticipated DMHPs making decisions to detain outside of a hospital setting and the transportation of respondents to places other than hospital emergency rooms. It is also consistent with the legislative intent of the ITA \"[t]o provide prompt evaluation and timely and appropriate treatment of persons with serious mental disorders.\" Former RCW 71.05.010(1)(c) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Given that there was not \"any examining emergency room physician\" at C.A.C.'s father's house when the decision to detain was made, the DMHP herein acted lawfully in evaluating C.A.C. and directing his detention. The trial court did not err by denying C.A.C.'s motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Former RCW 71.05.154 (2013)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Former RCW 71.05.154 was amended effective April 1, 2018, removing the language \"must consult with any examining emergency room physician regarding the physician's observations and opinions relating to the person's condition, and whether, in the view of the physician, detention is appropriate\" at issue herein.
