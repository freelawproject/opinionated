The provision for \"family bible, pictures and school books\" suggest[s] articles of deeply personal value, whose value is rooted in the memories associated with the property. Artwork, while it may have sentimental value, is not like a family bible nor is it like pictures of family or life events. It is different in kind, more like a luxury good purchased at a high price. To allow judgment debtors to keep luxury goods through the \"pictures\" exemption would be inconsistent with the other exemptions [which] are based on basic necessities, such as keeping wearing apparel, tools of the trade, and necessary household goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b67] Following entry of the order, Mr. Crow filed a motion seeking a temporary stay of a scheduled sheriff's sale of the assets. The motion was denied. On the same day that the order denying stay was signed, Mr. Crow filed a petition for bankruptcy seeking protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. He subsequently filed a notice of the bankruptcy filing with the district court and the district court entered an order staying the state court proceedings, which had the effect of postponing the sheriff's sale. In bankruptcy court, Mr. Crow moved to modify the automatic stay to pursue an appeal of the district court's order concerning the exemptions. The motion was granted, and Mr. Crow filed a notice of appeal, bringing the matter before us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b68] Mr. Crow contends his paintings are \"pictures\" that qualify for the exemption set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-20-106\">\n    Wyo.

It is in the nature of a finding by the Legislature that the exemption of a less sum than $50, out of the earnings of the debtor for 60 days, would not accomplish\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the purpose of the statute to preserve the family of the debtor from want\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Lafferty v.

Radiance asserts that, consistent with this purpose, the statutory exemptions apply only to such items as are necessary to preserve a basic standard of living. That, Radiance contends, does not include a collection of valuable paintings. Radiance further asserts that the statute could be read such that the adjective \"family\" modifies bible, pictures, and school books, so that the statutory exemption applies only to the family bible, family pictures, and family school books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Crow's assertion that the word \"pictures\" should be given its ordinary dictionary definition presents a plausible interpretation of the statute. Common dictionary definitions of the word \"picture\" include a \"visual representation or image drawn, photographed, or otherwise rendered on a flat surface,\" American Heritage College Dictionary 1053 (4th ed. 2004), and \"a design or\n   representation made by various means (as painting, drawing, or photography).\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 890 (1991). Under those definitions, the paintings at issue would qualify as \"pictures.\" However, we cannot view the statutory provision in isolation. When the other applicable statutory provisions are considered, it is clear that Mr. Crow's paintings do not fall within the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b614] We have often explained that we read\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   each statutory provision\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   , giving effect to every word, clause, and sentence according to their arrangement and connection. To ascertain the meaning of a given law, we also consider all statutes relating to the same subject or having the same general purpose and strive to interpret them harmoniously.

Included in this first type of assets are the family bible, school books, and cemetery lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b615] The second type includes items with relatively higher monetary value, but which are nevertheless necessary, as we said in\n   <em>\n    Lafferty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8515829\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/11/360/#p365\">\n    11 Wyo. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8515829\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/11/360/#p365\">\n    72 P. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"to preserve the family of the debtor from want.\" Included in this second type of assets are furniture, bedding, and other household articles; the value in a motor vehicle; tools and implements or stock in trade needed to carry on a trade or business; and the library, instruments, and implements of a professional person. A companion statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-20-105\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-20-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(i) and (ii). This makes sense because, as mentioned previously, these items tend to have little monetary value to creditors. In contrast, the statute sets monetary limits on all exempted items of the second type. The limit on exempted furniture, bedding, and other household articles is four thousand dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1-20-106(a)(iii). The limit on the exempted value of a motor vehicle is five thousand dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1-20-106(a)(iv). The limit on exempted tools, implements, or stock in trade is four thousand dollars, and the same limit applies to the library, instruments, and implements of a professional.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1-20-106(b). The limit on wearing apparel is two thousand dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1-20-105. These limits also make sense because they strike a balance between, on the one side, allowing debtors to retain items needed to preserve the family from want and, on the other, allowing creditors to execute on assets of potentially significant monetary value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b617] The statute places no limit on the value of exempted \"pictures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 1-20-106(a)(i). This strongly indicates that the \"pictures\" the legislature intended to exempt from execution are assets of the first type-those of high utility or sentimental value to the debtor and his family, but of relatively low monetary value to creditors. Pictures of family members or important events in the family's life would be included as this type of asset. If the legislature had intended the word \"pictures\" to include paintings of potentially significant monetary value without any personal connection to the debtor or the debtor's family, as Mr. Crow contends, then it would most likely have placed a limit on the exemption for \"pictures,\" as it did for other relatively high-value assets. The fact that the legislature instead included \"pictures\" among the other exempt assets of the first type-between \"family bible\" and \"school books\"-leads us to reject Mr. Crow's interpretation of the statutory exemption because it is contrary to the legislature's intent as indicated by the structure of the statute as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b618] Our conclusion is in harmony with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Zubrod v.

Consistent with the determination in\n   <em>\n    Zubrod\n   </em>\n   that the legislature intended statutory exemptions to be limited, we conclude that the term \"pictures\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-20-106\">\n    Wyo.
