Zapata-Grimaldo appeals his jury trial conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, he claims multiple errors by the trial court, as follows: the evidence was insufficient to convict him of attempted voluntary manslaughter; the exclusion of evidence was error; the jury instruction on attempted voluntary manslaughter was given in error; it was error not to instruct the jury on reckless aggravated battery; there was prosecutor error; and all of the errors combined created cumulative error. We disagree with Zapata-Grimaldo-the evidence was sufficient and none of the errors were sufficient to require a new trial. Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State charged Zapata-Grimaldo with rape, criminal damage to property, criminal restraint, and attempted second-degree murder, with an alternative count of aggravated battery. In its proposed jury instructions, the State added attempted voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense for attempted second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Maria Labrada, Zapata-Grimaldo's wife; law enforcement; several witnesses; and Zapata-Grimaldo testified at trial. In 2015 Labrada attended a party at a friend's house for dinner and drinks, and Zapata-Grimaldo agreed to stay home with their children. Throughout the night, Zapata-Grimaldo called and sent text messages to Labrada. Ultimately he went to the party to bring Labrada home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At first Labrada did not want to leave and she hid behind several of her friends. Zapata-Grimaldo spoke with one of the men there and Labrada agreed to return home with Zapata-Grimaldo. Another friend at the party, Saunders Souvannaraj, followed the couple home. Shortly after that, he and Zapata-Grimaldo spoke by phone. Souvannaraj testified Zapata-Grimaldo was upset about the others at the house party. Souvannaraj tried to comfort Zapata-Grimaldo to make sure he was not mad. Then, two men from the party arrived at Zapata-Grimaldo's house, interrupted the phone call, and confronted Zapata-Grimaldo. Souvannaraj and Zapata-Grimaldo spoke by phone again after the confrontation. Souvannaraj testified Zapata-Grimaldo was still upset and mad. Souvannaraj's text messages and his cell phone call log were reviewed. Law enforcement testified Souvannaraj's last phone call with Zapata-Grimaldo was at 1:20 a.m. Souvannaraj reportedly believed Zapata-Grimaldo was calm because he invited Souvannaraj over for a drink.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Zapata-Grimaldo testified about the confrontation in his home. According to him, one of the two men confessed to flirting with Labrada at the party and tried to kiss her. While Zapata-Grimaldo was holding his baby, the first man pulled out a pair of brass knuckles and the second repeatedly threatened him. Zapata-Grimaldo testified he was angry because of the confession and threats. Zapata-Grimaldo also testified Percy Billingsly arrived a bit later, told the two men to leave, and they did. Next, Labrada's phone rang, Zapata-Grimaldo answered it, realized it was one of the men calling for Labrada, cursed at the man, and hung up the phone. Zapata-Grimaldo told the jury \"[t]hat pissed me off again, made me upset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Billingsly testified when he and the other two men left, Zapata-Grimaldo was angry. According to Billingsly, Zapata-Grimaldo spoke with him by phone twice after the confrontation. In the first call, Zapata-Grimaldo told Billingsly everything was fine and he did not seem upset. In the next call, Zapata-Grimaldo woke Billingsly up and \"seemed upset.\" Zapata-Grimaldo told Billingsly he needed a ride because his son was sick, so Billingsly met Zapata-Grimaldo and drove him to Topeka. Billingsly admitted he lied to law enforcement and first reported he took Zapata-Grimaldo to Wichita.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to law enforcement, Billingsly reported he left Zapata-Grimaldo's house at about 2 or 2:15 a.m. after the confrontation. He called Zapata-Grimaldo at 3:18 a.m. and Zapata-Grimaldo told him everything was okay. Law enforcement also testified Billingsly told Zapata-Grimaldo 25 seconds is not worth 25 to life. According to Billingsly, he told this to Zapata-Grimaldo in case the two men returned. Zapata-Grimaldo called Billingsly at 3:53 a.m. and Zapata-Grimaldo's neighbor called 911 at 3:54 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The charges against Zapata-Grimaldo are based on acts alleged to have occurred between the phone calls with Billingsly. Labrada went to bed before the two men showed up at her home. Sometime after they left, Zapata-Grimaldo accused Labrada of having an extramarital affair. According to Labrada, he woke her up in their bedroom and then confronted her in their living room. Labrada testified Zapata-Grimaldo grew \"more and more angry\" every time she denied the accusations. Labrada testified Zapata-Grimaldo then searched through her cell phone messages and social media account, asking about every male friend. Labrada believed this lasted for 20 to 25 minutes. According to Labrada, as she began to leave, Zapata-Grimaldo grabbed her by her hair and threw her to the ground. He then punched and slapped her face. Labrada testified he screamed at her, she grew scared, and she urinated. According to Labrada, Zapata-Grimaldo removed her pants and raped her. Afterwards, he continued to yell at her, accused her of cheating, and hit her again. As Labrada was crying, Zapata-Grimaldo leaned down, told her to be quiet, and then began choking her with both hands. He then straddled her, pushed her to the ground, and sat on her. Labrada testified she violently kicked her legs, but he put all of his weight on her neck as he choked her. According to her, Zapata-Grimaldo was red faced, crying, yelling, and \"[h]e was so angry.\" She could not breathe, felt her face throbbing, and lost consciousness. After regaining consciousness, she fled to a neighbor's home and the neighbor called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Zapata-Grimaldo's testimony contradicted Labrada's version of the events. According to him, the couple had sexual intercourse the day before the incident. He testified the night of the incident, Labrada was drunk at her friend's party so he went to bring her home. After the confrontation with the other men, Zapata-Grimaldo claims Labrada left the bedroom to get a glass of water and then laid on the floor. From there, she urinated, he helped her change, and she fell asleep. He then woke her, confronted her about cheating, and showed her messages on her phone from one of the men at the party. According to Zapata-Grimaldo, he was not yelling but asking her questions rapidly. She tried to push him away then he slapped her in the face. Zapata-Grimaldo admitted he then punched Labrada several times. He also admitted to being upset and angry. According to Zapata-Grimaldo he stopped, gave Labrada a change of clothes, and she told him that she would ruin his life. He testified she choked herself. He claims he then went to check on his son and Labrada fled the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A jury convicted Zapata-Grimaldo of attempted voluntary manslaughter, aggravated battery, criminal damage to property, and criminal restraint. The district court sentenced Zapata-Grimaldo to a term of imprisonment of 136 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The evidence was sufficient.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Zapata-Grimaldo alleges there is insufficient evidence for a jury to convict him of attempted voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \" 'When sufficiency of the evidence is challenged in a criminal case, the standard of review is whether, after reviewing all the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court is convinced a rational factfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

The evidence reflects a heated argument between Labrada and Zapata-Grimaldo while he was going through her phone and getting upset. He was becoming more and more upset and when she started to leave the room, he pulled her by her hair to the ground. He then started to hit her in the face and, according to Labrada, he raped her and continued to hit her. Zapata-Grimaldo was on top of her as he hit her, and she was trying to kick him to get him off. Zapata-Grimaldo's face became red, he was crying and yelling; \"he was so angry.\" She could not breathe and passed out. Upon regaining consciousness, she fled to a neighbor's home and the neighbor called 911. Given the totality of these facts, we are convinced a reasonable fact-finder could find Zapata-Grimaldo acted in the \"heat of passion,\" thus the evidence was sufficient to convict him of attempted voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    All relevant evidence is admissible.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An appellate court assesses a district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence using a three-step analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Zapata-Grimaldo argued at trial Labrada choked herself. Outside the presence of the jury, Zapata-Grimaldo testified that two weeks before the incident Labrada jokingly suggested he should beat her if they ended their relationship so she could apply for a U-Visa. Labrada admitted she applied for the U-Visa as a result of the incident with Zapata-Grimaldo. She applied to support her children, obtained a work permit, and was awaiting residency. Labrada testified she applied for a U-Visa after speaking to law enforcement. As a U-Visa applicant, Labrada had the burden to show she \"has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful\" to the certifying agency as it investigates or prosecutes Zapata-Grimaldo for his acts against her.

Evidence of her U-Visa application is material because, if a jury believed Zapata-Grimaldo, the evidence provides an alternate and innocent explanation for the strangulation. This evidence is also probative because it contributes toward proof of the conflicting testimony about whether Zapata-Grimaldo choked Labrada or she choked herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The district court erred when it excluded evidence of Labrada's U-Visa application.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the next step, the appellate court must determine what rules of evidence or other legal principles apply.

The mother of the victim filed a U-Visa application based on her earlier incident of domestic violence with Perez-Aguilera. Her application was pending when the State charged Perez-Aguilera for crimes against the minor. The mother's supplemental documents referred to the sexual allegations.

He became so angry with her, so consumed with anger and jealousy that she says he knocked her to the floor, kicked her, she's bleeding.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In context, it is clear the State argued Zapata-Grimaldo corroborated Labrada's story about the aggravated battery, not rape or attempted murder. We cannot take the State's argument out of context. See\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , 307 Kan. at 865. The evidence supports the State's argument. Labrada testified Zapata-Grimaldo struck her several times, and he corroborated her claim when he testified to punching and slapping her. The State did not commit any prosecutorial error with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Next, Zapata-Grimaldo claims the State committed prosecutorial error when it stated \"[r]ape's not a crime of sexual pleasure. Rape's a crime of control.\" He likens this comment to those in\n   <em>\n    State v. Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417016\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/592/\">\n    298 Kan. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417016\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/592/\">\n    315 P.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   , the Kansas Supreme Court found the State committed prosecutorial error in its closing statement when it repeatedly claimed, without evidence, Akins groomed his victim for sexual abuse.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417016\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/592/\">\n    298 Kan. at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court found the State's repeated use of grooming was \"in the same context it would have been used had the State sought to introduce the psychological concept through an expert witness.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417016\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/592/\">\n    298 Kan. at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   . Here, the prosecutor only once claimed \"[r]ape's a crime of control.\" This isolated statement falls within the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to conduct the State's case and attempt to obtain a conviction in a manner that does not offend the defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial. See\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , 305 Kan. at 109. Even if the State committed prosecutorial error with its statement about rape, the error is harmless because the comments did not affect the outcome of Zapata-Grimaldo's trial. See\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , 305 Kan. at 109. The jury found Zapata-Grimaldo not guilty of rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    There is no cumulative error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Zapata-Grimaldo claims cumulative error. To determine whether cumulative error exists, the appellate court examines the errors in the context of the entire record, considering how the trial judge dealt with the errors as they arose; the nature and number of errors and their interrelationship, if any; and the overall strength of the evidence. In doing so it determines whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant was substantially prejudiced by cumulative errors and was denied a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.
