These convictions arose out of St. Clair's driving while intoxicated and striking and killing a pedestrian, Jane O'Brien, on February 23, 2002. At trial, St. Clair admitted that he had consumed at least twelve beers before the accident, and the State showed that his blood alcohol content was .211 grams per one hundred milliliters of blood immediately following the accident. As relevant to this appeal, St. Clair was sentenced to a twenty year term of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this appeal, St. Clair challenges the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition and Order Denying Reconsideration, which had denied St. Clair's petition filed under Hawai'i Rule of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (Petition). St. Clair's Petition challenged the Hawai'i Paroling Authority's (HPA) order, following a hearing in April of 2014, determining that St. Clair merited a Level III punishment classification and that his minimum term of imprisonment (MTI) should be thirteen years (2014 MTI Order). After St. Clair filed his Petition but before the Circuit Court denied his Motion for Reconsideration, the HPA entered a new order following a new MTI hearing in May of 2015 which affirmed St. Clair's Level III classification and an MTI of thirteen years (2015 MTI Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   St. Clair raises four points of error. In Point One, St. Clair argues that the decision by the HPA to base its MTI decision in the 2015 MTI Order on the sole factor of \"Nature of Offense\" resulted in an illegal sentence because the finding that he acted \"callously\" implicates an intent or knowing state of mind but he was convicted for acting recklessly. In Point Two, St. Clair argues that the Circuit Court erred in finding that his claims were moot. In Point Three, St. Clair argues the Circuit Court erred in not finding that his claims, if moot, qualified for an exception to the mootness doctrine and they should be decided. Finally, in Point Four, St. Clair argues the Circuit Court erred in finding his request for findings of fact and conclusions of law were moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve St. Clair's points of error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) This court does not have jurisdiction to consider the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition as the Notice of Appeal was untimely filed.

In St. Clair's case, the HPA in its 2015 MTI Order based its Level III classification decision on the sole significant criterion of \"Nature of Offense.\" One factor in support of Level III classification, and the only one applicable to the facts of St. Clair's manslaughter conviction, is whether \"[t]he offense was against a person(s) and the offender displayed a callous and/or cruel disregard for the safety and welfare of others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2013, this court specifically held that there was sufficient evidence to support the HPA's finding that the \"Nature of Offense\" criterion was satisfied in St. Clair's case in that the evidence supported that he displayed a callous disregard for the safety and welfare of others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Clair v.

The term \"callous\" is defined to include: \"insensitive; indifferent; unsympathetic.\" Callous Definition, Dictionary.com, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/callous (last visited Dec. 17, 2013). Evidence in the record shows that St. Clair drank large quantities of alcohol, resulting in his blood alcohol exceeding twice the legal limit, drove recklessly in the middle of the day, struck and killed the victim and almost struck the victim's sister, all after he had previously been convicted several times for drunk driving and had been specifically warned just prior to the incident that he should not drive because he was drunk. There was sufficient evidence to show that in committing the manslaughter offense, St. Clair displayed an insensitive, indifferent, or unsympathetic disregard for the safety and welfare of others.

In Points Two and Three on appeal, St. Clair argues that the Circuit Court's decision that his claims are moot was in error. In his argument in Points Two and Three on appeal, it appears St. Clair wants this court to find that the claims raised in his Petition are not moot. He argues, \"[t]he claims brought before the [Circuit Court] are just as valid today as they were on September 12, 2014 with the filing of the Petition.\" St. Clair repeatedly references the Petition in his argument against a finding that his claims are moot, However, insofar as his claims on appeal relate solely to the Order Denying Petition, as explained above, we do not have jurisdiction to consider that Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Order Denying Reconsideration also found that St. Clair's claims in his Motion for Reconsideration were moot as St. Clair's MTI term expired on or about August 1, 2015, meaning that St. Clair is now eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding the mootness doctrine, the Hawai'i Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   This court has long held that jurisdiction is the base requirement for any court resolving a dispute because, without jurisdiction, the court has no authority to consider the case. Further, the duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it. Courts will not consume time deciding abstract propositions of law or moot cases, and have no jurisdiction to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Lathrop v.

We also agree that St. Clair's claims are moot because any decision this court would make regarding the 2015 MTI Order and the procedures through which the HPA established the MTI would be meaningless as St. Clair's MTI no longer has an effect on whether he is eligible for parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas H.

Although St. Clair claims in his briefing that the HPA has not started his parole process with the expiration of his MTI, that issue is not before this court as the Order Denying Reconsideration, the order over which we have jurisdiction, only pertained to St. Clair's Petition contesting his MTI. Whether St. Clair should be granted parole now that his MTI has expired was not before the Circuit Court and is not an issue properly addressed now by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   St. Clair argues that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable and necessitates a decision on the merits in his case.

With respect to whether the issue is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" our courts have stated that it means \"a court will not dismiss a case on the grounds of mootness where a challenged governmental action would evade full review because the passage of time would prevent any single plaintiff from remaining subject to the restriction complained of for the period necessary to complete the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 315, 141 P.3d at 488 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carl Corp. v.

St. Clair's claims involve his own MTI sentencing by the HPA, which is a fact-specific determination. We do not find any issues raised by St. Clair for which authoritative guidance is necessary. In addition, none of the claims raised by St. Clair would in the future evade full review, as evidenced by the multiple claims and instances of litigation in St. Clair's own case and the relief afforded him with respect thereto. We find the public interest exception is not applicable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We find that Points Two and Three have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In summary, we have found that the 2015 MTI Order setting St. Clair's MTI at thirteen years complied with HPA Guidelines and did not offend due process. No other challenge has been made by St. Clair on appeal with respect to the substantive merits of that order. In addition, the HPA was not required to provide a more detailed explanation regarding St. Clair's punishment classification and MTI. Finally, prior to the Circuit Court's Order Denying Reconsideration, St. Clair's MTI expired. We find that any further decisions with regard to St. Clair's MTI would be moot as there is no effective relief the court could provide and we find no exception to the mootness doctrine applicable to St. Clair's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that St. Clair's appeal from the Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody; Habeas Corpus, filed on April 27, 2015 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction and the Order Denying \"Motion for Reconsideration of Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody; Habeas Corpus,\" filed on December 31, 2015 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Honorable Melvin H.
