He appeals from his judgment and sentence, alleging that the district court committed plain error by permitting expert medical testimony opining on his guilt and credibility and by allowing improper cross-examination of his sole medical expert.

Has Mr. Nielsen demonstrated plain error in testimony elicited from medical experts concerning a diagnosis that has a distinct legal meaning?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Has Mr. Nielsen demonstrated plain error in testimony elicited from medical experts concerning inconsistencies between Mr. Nielsen's proposed mechanism of injury and their observations of CF's injuries?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Has Mr. Nielsen demonstrated plain error in the State's cross-examination of Dr. Young?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] Mr. Nielsen moved in with Crystal Hudson and her two young children shortly after they began dating in September 2015. The four of them lived together at Ms. Hudson's apartment until they were evicted in early August 2016. Three days after they moved into a new trailer home in Gillette, Wyoming, Ms. Hudson woke up at around 10 in the morning and checked on her children. She brought both her daughter, two-year-old SW, and her son, three-year-old CF, into the room she and Mr. Nielsen shared and asked him if they could get doughnuts for breakfast. They decided that Ms. Hudson would go get the doughnuts. As she was leaving, CF attempted to follow her out of the trailer home and became upset when Mr. Nielsen brought him back inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] Ms. Hudson was about to check out at the grocery store when Mr. Nielsen called her and told her CF had fallen while trying to jump off the coffee table. Ms. Hudson heard \"weird, ... heavy breathing\" in the background and told Mr. Nielsen to call 911. Mr. Nielsen called 911, and Officer Jeremy Traverse was dispatched to the trailer home. When Officer Traverse arrived, he saw CF lying on the couch. CF had a pulse, but his eyes were not reactive, he had urinated on himself, his breathing sounded like \"snoring or gurgling,\" and he was \"posturing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Traverse adjusted CF on the couch and held him in a \"C-Spine\" position, which involves straightening the spine and holding the head to prevent further injury. As he was holding the C-Spine position, Officer Traverse noticed a bruise on CF's sternum, \"a bruise on the inside of his left arm, and other small bruises on his abdomen,\" \"marks and bruises\" on his face, and blood inside his mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] After paramedics arrived and began caring for CF, Officer Traverse spoke with Mr. Nielsen. Mr. Nielsen told him that he had been down the hallway near the bathroom when he saw CF standing on the coffee table. Mr. Nielsen told CF \"no\" and \"[CF] then jumped and landed on [a] dollhouse, fell over it, and then the dollhouse fell on top of him.\" Mr. Nielsen believed CF had hit his chest on the dollhouse and that CF had gone \"headfirst onto the carpet\" before the dollhouse fell on him. When Mr. Nielsen moved the dollhouse, he saw that CF was \"not acting normally,\" \"breathing differently,\" and \"making weird movements.\" Mr. Nielsen said he had carried CF to the couch and splashed cold water on CF's cheek, but he did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] When CF arrived at the hospital, the paramedics told hospital staff that CF had reportedly jumped off a coffee table, flipped over a dollhouse, and hit his head on the ground. Emergency-room physician Dr. Theodore Lawson observed that CF was unconscious, non-responsive to stimulation, and that one of his pupils was larger than the other, indicating that brain-swelling was putting pressure on his optic nerve. Dr. Lawson ordered an immediate CT scan, which he testified showed that CF had a skull fracture,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a subdural hematoma, and several rib fractures\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in various stages of healing. Dr. Joseph John Lawrence, the radiologist who\n   interpreted CF's CT scan, testified that subdural hematomas\"are unquestionably always the result of trauma\" usually caused by motor vehicle accidents and \"physical trauma, sometimes.\" Dr. Lawson testified similarly that subdural hematomas normally occur in \"automobile wrecks where people are ejected and hit the ground ... at highway speeds.\" He further testified that a subdural hematoma is \"a terrible prognosis\" and that he did not believe CF would survive. When asked if he found anything suspicious about CF's injuries, Dr. Lawson said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [H]e had an abrasion on his head, and he apparently landed on a carpeted floor, which didn't make too much sense to me. He also had some other contusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The fact that he had jumped off of a coffee table and supposedly hit a dollhouse just didn't conform to the amount of trauma that it would take to produce a skull fracture and a subdural hematoma [.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Lawson asked the Gillette police department to investigate the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b67] Dr. Lawson determined that CF's injuries were \"not something [they could] deal with in the ER.\" An air ambulance service transported CF to Children's Hospital Colorado, where several doctors, including Dr. Denis Bensard, took over CF's care. When asked what his assessment of CF's condition was, Dr. Bensard responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   My assessment was that he was a young child that had suffered serious injuries. On his physical examination ... we also saw scattered bruising of the face and the chest. ... And with the history we were provided, [ ] the constellations of findings made us suspicious that this was nonaccidental trauma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State asked Dr. Bensard to define \"nonaccidental trauma,\" to which he responded: \"It's inflicted injury.\" Finally, the State inquired about potential mechanisms of injury for subdural hematomas. Dr. Bensard responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   We've studied this area and we've written on this area. Subdural hematoma is the most common pattern of injury we see for abusive head trauma. There are additional studies that indicate that it is very difficult from this height to sustain these types, this severe of an injury. And the bruising that he -- the pattern of bruising he had is very suspicious for abusive trauma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b68] Dr. Gina DeMasellis was the supervising physician in the pediatric intensive care unit of Children's Hospital Colorado when CF arrived there. She testified that she had been told that the mechanism of CF's injury was \"a fall from a table.\" She was \"not told the height of a table or any other further details.\" According to Dr. DeMasellis, the mechanism of injury affects her initial evaluation of a patient and is critical to the process of treatment. In her initial examination of CF, she noticed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a significant amount of bruising on his forehead and the sides of his head, including his right ear, his cheeks, ... below his chin, and around his clavicles, ... his right shoulder, the sides of his chest, as well as the sides of his abdomen, ... and then bruising down his legs as well. He at this point was not sedated, but his pupils were fixed and dilated, meaning they're not responsive to light.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. DeMasellis testified that the fixed and dilated pupils made her \"very concerned\" because it indicates that \"pressure that is applied to the brain stem may be irreversible. And that this is where we would lose all ability as humans to sense oxygen and carbon dioxide in our bloodstream, so your ability to breathe.\" She summarized his condition as \"a young man who had a severe traumatic brain injury with significant concern for his ability to improve from it[.]\" When asked about typical mechanisms of injury producing subdural hematomas, she testified that CF's injuries were \"very consistent with motor vehicle collisions, as well as patients who downhill ski, who have an accident with a tree, maybe a pedestrian or someone who is on a bicycle being struck by a vehicle.\" She was concerned about the possibility of non-accidental trauma because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [a]nytime a young child comes in with the severity of his brain injury, we would be questioning that as a possibility, just by the subdural and the swelling of the brain as well as the herniation findings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   But in [CF's] case, when I was told the proposed mechanism, knowing the severity of injuries that we found on exam, that heightened my concern, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I would say that his subdural is definitely consistent with a very high speed with an abrupt stop injury. I would venture to say that I would find it hard to see enough of a high speed to develop from a 28-inch fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b69] The State also asked the hospital's pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Brent O'Neill, about typical mechanisms of injury resulting in subdural hematomas. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   With a very large subdural hematoma of the size [CF] had, it is usually a very high speed impact like a high speed motor vehicle crash, a fall from a two- or three-story building, a very high speed impact in sports, skiing. Very rarely in football, but on rare occasions we've seen those from football injuries. And then abusive head injury is a common source in our younger patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   He was concerned about the reported cause of injury because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   things were most consistent with an abusive head injury. Sort of all the other ways to get that degree of brain injury... would be from a very high speed, high velocity mechanism. ... a fall from a several story building or a high speed motor vehicle accident. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   But injuries to the extent that [CF had] are really never seen with a low height fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b610] Four days after he arrived at the hospital, Dr. Carleen Zebuhr declared CF dead. She concluded that his death was \"a result of his severe brain injury, part of which was subdural hematoma, and the resultant ... swelling that the brain had, as demonstrated by the increased pressure in the brain.\" Dr. Zebuhr testified that \"[i]n pediatric patients, the most common mechanism [for subdural hematomas ] would be trauma, so something like a car accident or that type of thing.\" She was concerned the mechanism of injury was not as reported and that \"anytime ... that we have concerns for either nonaccidental trauma, or even if there are things that don't really make sense about the history and we have a concern for potential abuse, we consult [the hospital's Child Protection Team].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b611] The State called pediatric nurse practitioner Denise Abdoo, who was a member of the hospital's Child Protection Team when CF was admitted. Nurse Abdoo spoke with CF's mother about his medical history and learned that CF had allegedly jumped off a coffee table and injured himself. She also performed a physical examination of CF. The State asked her a series of questions about her diagnosis and how she arrived at it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. And you had indicated as part of your job with the Child Protection Team, you make diagnoses of patients; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. And in making those diagnoses, you take into account the history as provided?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. You take into account radiology?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. And any labs that are done?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Generally speaking, you collaborate; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. So we work collaboratively, and then I ultimately make my personal diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. And did you make a diagnosis for [CF]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. Okay. And what was that diagnosis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. My diagnosis was that [CF] had multiple bruising, or bruises in multiple planes of his body. He had brain swelling, also called cerebral edema, as well as subdural hemorrhage, which is bleeding around the brain. He had a fracture of his right mandible, or the jaw, as well as two rib fractures, one was acute, or new, and one was healing. And that that constellation of injuries was consistent with child physical abuse, or non-accidental trauma, which are synonymous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. So if we hear \"non-accidental trauma\" that's synonymous with \"child physical abuse\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. So in your opinion, [CF's] injuries were consistent with child abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Okay. And you had sort of listed the injuries that went into that. Was, other than the injuries that you've just listed, was there another reason for that opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. So when we make a medical diagnosis, we look at how that history and that mechanism of injury matches with the injuries that we're seeing. In the history of a short fall off of a coffee table, and then as well as the history that a dollhouse had also fallen on him ... that didn't make sense in terms of the old and new injury, or the acute and chronic injury, as well as the severity of his injury, or injuries[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. Okay. [Later on,] were you able to do a little more physical evaluation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. Yes, sir. On the following day ... I was able to ... roll him so I could look at his back[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. Okay. And on his back left torso were you able to view anything of note?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. He had three circular brown contusions or bruises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Okay. What, if anything, did that say to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. That those injuries were ... additional injuries that aided in my diagnosis of child physical abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. In the course of your working with [CF], did you become aware of an ophthalmological survey of him that was done?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Yes. That's a standard ... when you have kids who have significant brain injuries [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. And why is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Because [in part] as we put together this puzzle of history, physical exam, and ancillary consults, [it] helps us determine whether or not we think the injuries are accidental or non-accidental or child physical abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. And were [CF's] eyes such that it helped aid your opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. And what, if anything, did the finding on the eyes say to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. That aided in my ability to say that this is child physical abuse as opposed to accidental injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b612] After Dr. Zebuhr declared CF dead, surgeons performed organ donation surgery, and forensic pathologist Dr. Stephen Cina performed an autopsy. Dr. Cina testified that when he does autopsies, he typically receives a preliminary investigative report that provides the circumstances of death. He stated that this report can be important to his examination because \"[k]nowing the circumstances of death will often lead you to the correct manner of death.\" Dr. Cina had learned \"that [CF] had jumped off [a coffee table], hit a plastic dollhouse, then rolled over, then had seizures.\" In describing CF's injuries, Dr. Cina testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   When we cut into the dura, we saw subdural blood, ... several tablespoons that were distributed over the left side of the top of the brain. Subdural blood is caused when you have little veins that run between the sac, the dura and the surface of the brain. When the brain is rapidly accelerated and decelerated, these little veins tear and you get bleeding over the brain but under the dura. So it's a marker for an acceleration/deceleration injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   When the brain has this kind of violent sheer injury, it responds by swelling up. Eventually, that's what led to brain death in this case, and led to the child becoming an organ donor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The next portion of the head exam was whenever I see brain swelling and subdural hemorrhage I'm thinking of a closed head injury. And a closed head injury in a child is very often due to what's called the shaken baby syndrome or shaken impact syndrome.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   These head injuries are often associated with injuries to the eyes, so we remove the eyes .... I saw hemorrhage around the optic nerves, which is another finding you see in these kind of deceleration injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The other technique you do when you're dealing with a potential shaken impact baby is ... [to remove] the whole cervical spinal column .... I noticed there was hemorrhage around one of the dorsal nerve roots microscopically, which is another finding you see in these whiplash kind of deceleration injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   ... So, with the findings of subdural hematoma, brain swelling, sheering injuries to the inside of the brain, optic nerve hemorrhage and injuries to the cervical spinal cord, it all pointed toward abusive closed head injuries as the cause of death in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b613] After Dr. Cina described CF's external injuries, the State asked what his \"diagnosis of the cause of death of [CF]\" was. He replied: \"This child died of closed head injuries due to a physical assault.\" His opinion as to the mechanism of injury was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [T]here was a kind of shaking episode where the head was violently whacked against a firm surface causing a rapid acceleration and deceleration. We have evidence of the impact, we have subdural hemorrhage indicating a sheering, tearing, and we have injury to the deep structures of the brain. So to me, this would be a so-called shaken impact case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   When asked whether his findings were consistent with a jump off a coffee table, Dr. Cina answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   No. We're talking about a very significant impact and a very rapid acceleration/deceleration. So the story that was relayed to me of jumping off a coffee table onto a flimsy plastic structure and going over that, to me that's not enough to get this kind of severe impact and acceleration/deceleration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b614] Finally, the State called Dr. Douglas Miller, a neuropathologist who examined CF's brain after Dr. Cina's autopsy. After he described the process he used to examine CF's brain and the injuries he observed, Dr. Miller testified that his \"opinion as to the nature of the trauma that CF suffered\" was that \"[t]his is severe nonaccidental head trauma, blunt head trauma.\" He testified that, based on\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   33 plus years of doing this, plus knowing the literature ..., my training and so forth, I know that these kinds of injuries are associated with abusive head trauma, or with severe witnessed accidents, such as a child in a car accident unrestrained who's thrown from the car/vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   But absent those kinds of circumstances, this is produced by abusive head trauma. It is not produced by any natural disease, and it is not produced by minor accidents such as a child falling down, or from the circumstances suggested in the initial investigator report that Dr. Cina talked about .... There's no way that the description of standing on the table, jumping off, hitting the dollhouse and all of that could account for these injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   When asked to clarify his opinion about the reported mechanism of injury on redirect, Dr. Miller testified: \"It's not possible. The height of the dollhouse is such that from falling over the top of that to the floor is not going to give sufficient force to cause these injuries.\" Following Dr. Miller's testimony, the State rested its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Nielsen testified on his own behalf and called one expert witness, Dr. Thomas Young. Dr. Young testified that he is a certified forensic pathologist who \"makes [his] services available to\" people who have \"a question or an issue that they want to have an expert [in the field of forensic pathology] look at[.]\" Regarding CF's case, he described the science on acceleration and deceleration injuries and subdural hematomas as \"a hypothesis\" or \" a hunch\" that is subject to \"a lot of controversy.\" To support that assertion, Dr. Young referred to a 2001 article by Dr. John Plunkett that appeared in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology. The study examined 18 cases in which children fell short distances and sustained lethal injuries. Dr. Young also discussed a study, \"Biomechanics of Short Falls in Children,\" which indicated \"there can be accelerations that reach the lethal head injury threshold with as little as a two-foot fall on the head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   [\u00b616] Dr. Young testified that Mr. Nielsen's account of what happened to CF was consistent with CF's injuries. In particular, he believed CF's subdural hematoma was consistent with Mr. Nielsen's account because \"[w]ith a very, very short impact like this, you can develop a lot of acceleration.\" He believed that a fall like the one Mr. Nielsen described could result in \"an energetic blow to the top of [CF's] head sufficient to damage and injure the head[.]\" When asked \"whether [CF's] injuries would require the kind of force from a 30 to 60 mile an hour vehicular accident,\" Dr. Young responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   That doesn't fit at all ... [because] looking at [CF] you don't see any kind of visible damage like you would see in a sudden stop at 30 or 60 miles an hour. You see a child that is behaving in an abnormal fashion, but his outer surface is intact. It doesn't look like a kid that's hit either the inside of a vehicle or even a wall at 30 to 60 miles an hour. It doesn't fit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   [\u00b617] On cross-examination, Dr. Young testified that he had not performed an autopsy since 2011, that between 2006 and 2011 he had performed about 50 autopsies for clients, and that he had not performed an autopsy on a three-year-old child since before 2007. He also testified that he did not review any microscopic slides of CF's eyes or brain, that he did not prepare a written report of his findings, and that he did not consult a neuropathologist about CF's case. The State questioned Dr. Young about the Plunkett study he had referenced. Dr. Young admitted that the study was controversial and acknowledged that the cases cited in the study were different from CF's case in some ways. He also acknowledged the study's limitations, including: 1) six of the 18 falls it examined were not witnessed; 2) the exact height of the falls could only be determined in ten cases; 3) a minimum impact velocity sufficient to cause fatal brain injury could not be inferred from the study; and 4) the study could not state the probability that an individual fall would have a fatal outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   [\u00b618] Dr. Young also testified on cross-examination that he had opened a forensic pathologist consulting business in 2006. The State asked him if he was \"a professional witness in criminal cases,\" and Dr. Young responded: \"If called on to testify, I'll do that. I'm not somebody who's going to doctor my testimony in order to please a client, if this is what you're inferring.\" However, Dr. Young agreed when asked whether \"your profession[,] how you get by and how you make money [is by] testifying and providing consultation?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [\u00b619] The State asked him how many times he had testified as a defense expert in cases involving infant deaths and identified some of those cases. During this line of questioning, the State asked whether Dr. Young had testified as an expert in\n   <em>\n    State of Kansas v. Jessica Dawn Harber\n   </em>\n   .

She tells you [this is] child physical abuse. Synonymous, same thing. So those doctors that say nonaccidental trauma, this is what they're saying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   [\u00b622] The jury found Mr. Nielsen guilty of murder in the first degree. Specifically, it found Mr. Nielsen had \"intentionally inflict[ed] physical injury\" on CF; \"recklessly inflict[ed] physical injury\" on CF; and committed \"the underlying crime of child abuse.\" The district court sentenced Mr. Nielsen to life imprisonment according to law.

It presented numerous photographs of CF's injuries and photographs from his autopsy and brain exam. It presented evidence that CF had injuries in various stages of healing throughout his body. It showed that Mr. Nielsen was the only adult with CF when his fatal injuries occurred. Multiple medical experts testified as to their first-hand observations of CF's injuries and opined that Mr. Nielsen's account was not consistent with what they saw. They gave examples of typical mechanisms of injury that would cause such severe brain injuries, none of which matched Mr. Nielsen's proposed mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   [\u00b644] In response, Mr. Nielsen presented two witnesses: himself and Dr. Young. Mr. Nielsen gave the same account of CF's fall that the State's experts had unequivocally\n   rejected. On cross-examination, the State attacked Dr. Young's credibility vigorously notwithstanding the questions about the two Kansas cases. It also revealed that Dr. Young did not review any microscopic slides of CF's eyes or brain, prepare a written report of his findings, or consult a neuropathologist about CF's case. It discredited the study Dr. Young relied on by highlighting its limitations and its differences from CF's case. Given all that, we cannot conclude that there was a reasonable probability the outcome would have been more favorable to Mr. Nielsen had the State not asked the two challenged questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   [\u00b645] The State's medical experts did not offer improper testimony as to Mr. Nielsen's guilt or credibility, nor has Mr. Nielsen demonstrated a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been more favorable to him had the State not asked Dr. Young the challenged questions.
