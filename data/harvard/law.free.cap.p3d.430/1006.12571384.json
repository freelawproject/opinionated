We affirm and consider the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court commit plain error regarding the procedural safeguards in \u00a7 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA, necessitating appellate review?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 B.H. suffers from bipolar disorder. In late 2016 and early 2017, he suffered a severe manic episode during which he acted in ways his wife confirmed were uncharacteristic. She called police, who took B.H. to the emergency room and then to Hope House, a mental health facility in Bozeman. B.H. was uncooperative at Hope House, refusing treatment and stating he just needed a vacation. B.H. left Hope House against medical advice and was thereafter placed at Hays Morris House, a mental health facility in Butte, because Hope House had reached capacity. B.H. was likewise uncooperative at Hays Morris House, where he refused medication, threatened others, got into arguments, repeatedly removed his clothes, and tore baseboards from his room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Adrian Utsch, a professional person employed by the Gallatin Mental Health Center, conducted a mental health evaluation of B.H. Based on her findings, Utsch sought initiation of a proceeding to involuntarily commit B.H. to the Montana State Hospital. The commitment petition, filed by the Gallatin County Attorney's Office, alleged that B.H. had threatened to kill his father and himself, he suffered from a mental disorder, he was substantially unable to provide for his own basic needs, and he was an imminent threat of injuring himself and others. The State's petition included a list of B.H.'s constitutional and statutory rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The District Court, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-122, MCA, determined probable cause existed that B.H. suffered from a mental disorder requiring commitment, appointed counsel for B.H., and scheduled an initial hearing on the State's petition for January 9, 2017. B.H. attended his initial hearing via video from Hays Morris House in Butte. B.H.'s counsel was present in the courtroom, as was counsel for the state. At the outset of the hearing, B.H. acknowledged that he had seen the State's petition. After a discussion concerning whether B.H. needed an interpreter, because he kept answering the court in Spanish, B.H. asked whether the court could appoint Eduardo Garcia as his friend. The court agreed to do so, and at that point, B.H. interrupted, whereupon the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   B.H.: I can have Amanda speak for me. She's right here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court: Okay, well, Mr.-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   B.H.: I will remove myself from the situation right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   B.H.: Will that speed things up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court: Well, [B.H.], you don't have to because I, let me tell you what's going to happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   B.H.: He's not listening. I'm going to go out (indecipherable).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court: All right. So, let the record show that [B.H.] has decided to step out of the hearing room. He has the right to do that....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court: Showing that [B.H.] did appear for this hearing by video until he left the room; that I did not have a chance to advise him of his rights but Mr. Rutzke [counsel for B.H.], were you able to do that to a limited extent or?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Rutzke: I was not, Your Honor. I was not. I will make-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Female Voice: Do you want him to get a copy of his rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court: Yeah, he will-there's a copy of his rights attached to the Petition, ma'am, but also, I mean-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Female Voice: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court: -that really what-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Female Voice: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court: -his most important right is he has a right to remain silent and he has a right to the hearing and I'm granting him the hearing-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Female Voice: Um hum (yes).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court: -so the fact that his rights have not been affected in any way. I mean I'm protecting his rights basically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Female Voice: Um hum (yes).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 5 Later, B.H. re-entered the hearing room. The court informed B.H. that a mental health evaluation would be performed by a professional person prior to the commitment hearing, and asked whether B.H. would like a second opinion. The court then scheduled a contested hearing for two days later, on January 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 6 At the January 11 hearing, the State presented three witnesses, including two certified professional persons and B.H.'s wife. When B.H. interjected during testimony, the court advised him, \"before you say anything to me you need to clear it with ... Mr. Rutzke[,]\" because \"Mr. Rutzke is here to protect you.\" B.H. then consulted with Mr. Rutzke and took the stand to offer testimony. After all the evidence had been presented, the District Court noted for the record that \"the Court finds and concludes that [B.H.], throughout this proceeding, has received the benefit of all applicable statutes and Constitutional rights to which he is entitled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 7 After testimony concluded, the District Court orally summarized its findings of fact and conclusions of law and committed B.H. to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed 90 days. Neither Mr. Rutzke nor B.H. objected at any time during the proceedings that the court had failed to properly advise B.H. of his rights or that B.H.'s rights had been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 8 B.H. appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 9 We review a district court's civil commitment order \"to determine whether the court's findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262198\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/293/\">\n    2015 MT 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262198\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/293/\">\n    379 Mont. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262198\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/293/\">\n    350 P.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). \"Issues of due process in an involuntary commitment proceeding are subject to plenary review.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 10 As an initial matter, we observe that B.H.'s appeal of his involuntary commitment is not moot despite the expiration of his 90-day commitment period, because the time period is too short to allow litigation of the appeal, and there is a reasonable possibility that he could be subject to the same action again.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. Appeals from involuntary commitments thus fall into an exception to the mootness doctrine for issues that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11 (citations and internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 11\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court commit plain error regarding the procedural safeguards in \u00a7 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA, necessitating appellate review?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 12 B.H. argues that the District Court erred by failing to advise him of his\n   constitutional and statutory rights during his initial appearance, as required in civil commitment proceedings under \u00a7 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA. Beyond the advisory requirement, B.H. does not argue that any of his rights were violated. The State acknowledges that the advisory of rights was not provided to B.H. as required by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 13 B.H. made no objection regarding a rights advisory before the District Court. On appeal, he specifically disclaims he is seeking plain error review of his claim, and instead cites two older commitment cases that state \"an exception exist[s]\" to the \"general rule that issues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.... where, as in the case of a civil commitment, the substantial rights of an individual were involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of R.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4551765\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/270/40/#p45\">\n    270 Mont. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4551765\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/270/40/#p45\">\n    889 P.2d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1204-05 (1995) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re N.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557182\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/319/#p323\">\n    190 Mont. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557182\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/319/#p323\">\n    620 P.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (1980) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mental Health of A.S.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638489\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/169/\">\n    2008 MT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638489\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/169/\">\n    342 Mont. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638489\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/342/169/\">\n    180 P.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 53-21-122, MCA, requires, in relevant part, the district court to determine whether probable cause exists to support an involuntary commitment. Section 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA. Upon a finding of probable cause, the court must appoint counsel for the respondent and hold an initial hearing during which the respondent is advised of his or her constitutional rights, statutory rights, and the effect of the petition supporting involuntary commitment. Section 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA. The court must also appoint a professional person and set a date and time for the hearing on the petition for involuntary commitment. Section 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 19 Here, the District Court found that probable cause existed, appointed counsel for B.H., and held an initial hearing on January 9, 2017. During that hearing, the court attempted to advise B.H. of his rights and the effect of the petition. However, B.H. interrupted the court several times and left the hearing room, stating that a woman he referred to as \"Amanda\" could speak for him. The court encouraged B.H. to stay, saying it would inform B.H. of what would happen, but B.H. replied, \"[h]e's not listening,\" and left the room. The court then noted that B.H. had a right to leave, and asked counsel if he had advised B.H. of his rights. Counsel said no, and upon interjection by \"Amanda,\" the court discussed B.H.'s rights and stated that his rights would be protected. Upon B.H.'s return to the hearing room, the court set the date and time for a hearing and appointed a professional person, as well as a friend, at B.H.'s request. No objections or further questions were offered by either B.H. or his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 20 We have declined to reverse for lack of strict compliance with Montana's involuntary commitment statutes where we concluded the asserted error did not impact the respondent's rights in a way that \"would leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, compromise the integrity of the judicial process, or create a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. In\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , M.K.S. would not speak with the appointed professional person during her evaluation, so the professional person advised M.K.S. that his recommendation to the court, if she refused to speak with him, would need to be based upon her most recent history.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. M.K.S. continued her refusal to cooperate with the evaluation, and the professional person did not file a written report of his findings and recommendations\n   with the court as required by \u00a7 53-21-123, MCA.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. M.K.S. did not object to the absence of a written report and proceeded with the hearing, after which the court committed her to the Montana State Hospital.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9. On appeal, M.K.S. asserted a due process violation because of the lack of a professional person's report as required by \u00a7 53-21-123, MCA, and sought reversal of her commitment.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9, 15. She argued that \"the written report was essential to her ability to defend against the State's petition, and to the District Court's ability to be adequately informed about why [the psychologist] believed it appropriate to recommend commitment to [Montana State Hospital] when, in the past, commitment to a community program had been sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 21 We concluded based on a review of the record that \"the failure to file a written report with the court did not prejudice M.K.S.'s ability to defend against allegations contained in the petition or presented by [the psychologist's] testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. M.K.S.'s counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine the psychologist and did so without any objection to the absence of a written report.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. We concluded that \"[i]f M.K.S.'s counsel believed the failure to file a written report inhibited her defense or preparation, counsel could have objected to the lack of a report and the defect could have been remedied.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. Thus, we reasoned that M.K.S. had \"failed to meet her burden to demonstrate\" the second prong of the test, and declined \"to reverse the judgment of commitment based on the plain error doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 22 A similar reasoning applies here. The record demonstrates the District Court's concern over the protection of B.H.'s rights, including that he be properly advised of his rights, and that it cautioned him in relation to his rights to silence and counsel during the commitment hearing. While district courts must proactively ensure that a respondent's rights are protected-even where a respondent's actions make it challenging, as here-a simple objection or even suggestion by counsel that a statutory requirement had not been satisfied would have alerted the District Court to the problem, which it then could have easily remedied, perhaps during the commitment hearing. \"Failure to make contemporaneous objection deprives the court from opportunity to correct the error, if any....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569707\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/1277/\">\n    2018 MT 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569707\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/1277/\">\n    392 Mont. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569707\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/1277/\">\n    425 P.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 23 B.H. noted his review of the commitment petition, to which a written statement of his rights was attached. Like the resistance encountered in\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , the District Court attempted to comply with Montana's civil commitment statutes, though faced with resistance by B.H. The District Court attempted to advise B.H. of his rights but was interrupted by B.H.'s actions, after which the court discussed B.H.'s rights during the initial hearing, and stated that B.H.'s rights would be protected. During the commitment hearing, the District Court admonished B.H. consistent with his rights. While the District Court did not provide a complete advisory of rights to B.H., we conclude B.H. has not established that the error resulted in \"a manifest miscarriage of justice,\" left \"unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings,\" or \"compromise[d] the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13 (internal quotations and citations omitted). There is little \"risk\" that B.H.'s liberty interest was in any way deprived by the manner in which this proceeding was conducted, and the error did not result in substantial prejudice.\n   <em>\n    In re M.K.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18.

SANDEFUR, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 25 I respectfully dissent from the Court's holding. The Court frames the issue as whether the District Court committed plain error regarding procedural safeguards. The\n   procedural safeguards at issue are the mandatory advisement of constitutional rights, statutory rights, and the substantive effect of the petition, as well as an advisement of the process involving the professional person who would be making a recommendation to the Court as to the degree to which B.H.'s liberty would be restricted. There is no dispute that this advisement was not given by the Court, nor did B.H.'s counsel advise him of these rights. Based on the record before us, B.H. went into a process that ultimately resulted in his involuntary commitment to Montana State Hospital (MSH) blind as to what his rights in this process were. Irrespective of the District Court's efforts to ensure his rights were protected at the evidentiary hearing, I cannot conclude that the failure to advise B.H. of his rights at the inception of the process may not have resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, left unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromised the integrity of the judicial process. Thus, I would exercise plain error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 26 Section 53-21-122(2)(a), MCA, mandates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The respondent must be advised of the respondent's constitutional rights, the respondent's rights under this part, and the substantive effect of the petition.

Although he was advised that a professional person would be conducting an evaluation, he was not advised that she would be making a recommendation to the Court about whether he should be involuntarily committed or diverted to short-term inpatient treatment or an assisted living facility. The evaluation then proceeded prior to the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 27 Trial courts have a duty to \"safeguard the due process rights of the individual involved at\n   <em>\n    every stage of the proceeding\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re L.K.-S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746399\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/191/\">\n    2011 MT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746399\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/191/\">\n    359 Mont. 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746399\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/191/\">\n    247 P.3d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re L.C.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2719115\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/253/1/#p7\">\n    253 Mont. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2719115\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/253/1/#p7\">\n    830 P.2d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (1992) ) (emphasis added). That certainly would include the very inception of the proceeding, when a respondent is to be advised of the process that lies ahead and what his rights are in the impending process.
