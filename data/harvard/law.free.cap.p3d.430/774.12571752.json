In June 2016, Mr. Lewis; his manager, Ryan Garza; and their DJ, Justin Mungia drove from San Antonio to Seattle for a concert where Mr. Lewis was scheduled to perform. Mr. Garza rented a car in San Antonio to drive the three to Seattle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] As they prepared to return to San Antonio, Mr. Lewis told Mr. Garza that he had been given five pounds of marijuana by someone he had met in Seattle which he had put in their rental car. Mr. Lewis wanted to take it to San Antonio, but Mr. Garza initially refused. After Mr. Lewis promised Mr. Garza half the marijuana, Mr. Garza allowed him to bring it back to San Antonio in the rental car. Before leaving Washington, Mr. Garza stopped in Spokane to buy marijuana, which he and Mr. Mungia shared while Mr. Lewis slept. In Sheridan, Wyoming, Mr. Lewis took over driving. About 30 minutes later, just outside Buffalo, Trooper Richard Burridge stopped Mr. Lewis for speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] When Trooper Burridge approached the car, he could smell \"fresh marijuana.\" Trooper Burridge had Mr. Lewis get out of the car first and then go to the rear of the car. When Trooper Burridge asked Mr. Lewis\n   whether they had any marijuana in the car, Mr. Lewis stated, \"Ain't got no weed,\" but he admitted that they had smoked some marijuana back in Spokane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] Trooper Burridge then questioned Mr. Garza, who admitted that the small amount of marijuana he purchased in Spokane belonged to him. After Trooper Burridge told Mr. Garza that he was going to search the car, Mr. Garza confessed to the five pounds of marijuana in the trunk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Trooper Burridge and his partner searched the car, they found a black trash bag with \"five individual pounds of marijuana[.]\" Trooper Burridge testified that \"[i]t was obvious that it was marijuana to me.\" Agent Louey Williams with the Division of Criminal Investigation sent the drugs to Cheyenne for analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] At trial, the State called Dr. Ella Kubicz, a state crime lab chemistry unit supervisor, to testify about the analysis of the five pounds of marijuana. Dr. Kubicz supervised Courtney Vito, an analyst in the crime lab, who analyzed the drugs. Dr. Kubicz testified that Ms. Vito's report, Exhibit 500, showed that the substance Agent Williams had sent to Cheyenne contained THC and weighed more than three ounces. The district court admitted Exhibit 500 over Mr. Lewis' attorney's objection that it was cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b68] The district court also admitted Exhibit 502, Dr. Kubicz's supervisor report. Dr. Kubicz testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ... State's Exhibit 502, it looks like a checklist, but my work is much more detailed than putting the checkmarks on it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I reviewed every note, collected with analysis, every spectra acquired by the instrumental analysis, and by reviewing that, I reached the forensic conclusion, and I cross-check with what Ms. Vito, the analyst in this case also came up as a conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When these two conclusions meet, I approve the issuance of this report. And I concluded all the items analyzed by Ms. Vito contain[ ] [THC].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   She also testified that the lab scale printout attached to Ms. Vito's report established that the marijuana weighed more than three ounces. Dr. Kubicz signed her report, Exhibit 502, but only Ms. Vito's signature appears on Exhibit 500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] The jury convicted Mr. Lewis of one count of felony possession of marijuana. The district court sentenced Mr. Lewis to three to five years in prison, suspended except for 270 days in jail with credit for 218 days for time served, with five years of probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b610] Mr. Lewis argues that the State's admission of Exhibit 500, the lab report containing Ms. Vito's conclusions, violated his right to confrontation because Dr. Kubicz testified in place of Ms. Vito. We find it unnecessary to address the confrontation issues because we conclude that, even if such a sequence of events violates the confrontation clause, Mr. Lewis was not prejudiced by its admission. There was sufficient evidence, without Exhibit 500, that the substance was marijuana and that it exceeded the felony threshold of three ounces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b611] When the State introduced Exhibit 500 and Dr. Kubicz testified, Mr. Lewis did not argue that it violated his right to confrontation.

In\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming\n   </em>\n   , the Court reaffirmed that forensic reports \"created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding\" are testimonial and that \"surrogate testimony\" cannot be a substitute for the analyst who performed the testing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    564 U.S. at 651-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 2709-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
