They argue the court erred by failing to order the Estate of their late client Susan Chalker-with her son David Chalker acting as Personal Representative (\"Respondent\")-to pay statutorily-mandated interest on that award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Initial 1994 Divorce Proceeding and the Subsequent State and Federal Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Petitioners represented Susan Chalker in her divorce proceeding from Robert Catz, filed in November 1994. At the time the divorce was filed, Robert Catz held investment accounts at various financial institutions, but the following month, he re-titled three accounts with Fidelity Investments (the \"Fidelity Accounts\") in the names of his two sons, Shawn and Jason Catz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The superior court entered a default decree of dissolution of marriage in March 1995. The decree awarded Chalker all right, title, and interest in the Fidelity Accounts. Subsequently, Robert, Shawn, and Jason Catz proceeded to file three separate lawsuits in the federal courts in Ohio and Tennessee against Petitioners, Chalker, Fidelity, and others attacking the validity of the Arizona decree. That litigation, and multiple iterations thereof, would oscillate through federal and state courts for almost two decades. Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the Catzes' claims against Petitioners in 2009\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and against Chalker and Fidelity in 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 14, 2013, the Arizona district court dismissed the last vestiges of these cases with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Petitioners' Agreements with Chalker Throughout the Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Petitioners began jointly representing Chalker in the divorce action in 1994. Petitioners contend that, by mid-1999, Chalker owed them approximately $273,000 in fees and costs. In February 1999, at Chalker's suggestion, the parties entered into a new fee agreement calling for 50 percent of the Fidelity Accounts to be paid to Petitioners once the Accounts were recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Petitioner Karp and Chalker signed the new fee arrangement (\"Retainer/Fee Agreement\"), which provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. Client agrees to pay to [Petitioners] FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of all sums and/or assets recovered by, or upon [Chalker]'s behalf, arising out of the determination of ownership interest in and to the following accounts:\n   <strong>\n    Fidelity Latin American Fund, Fidelity Southeast Asia Fund, Fidelity U.S. Government Reserves; and/or any other accounts held by Fidelity Trust and/or any of its related entities.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   10. Client further acknowledges and agrees that in the event no recovery is obtained in this matter, the Attorneys fees\n   incurred on behalf of Client in all matters other than that referenced in \u00b6 4 above shall remain due and owing in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Chalker's Death and Petitioners' Claim on her Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 Susan Chalker died in July 2005. In August 2005, an informal probate was opened in an Arizona superior court. A notice to creditors was mailed to Petitioners on August 4, 2005, stating: \"All persons having claims against the estate are required to present their claims within four months after the date of the first publication of this Notice or the claims will be forever barred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 7 Petitioners timely filed their claim against the Estate (\"Claim\"), asserting the Estate was indebted to them in \"an amount equal to 50% of all sums and/or assets recovered by the Estate of Susan Ruth Chalker, or upon the Estate's behalf arising out of the determination of ownership interest in and to any of the Fidelity accounts,\" \"an amount equal to 50% of any attorney's fees awarded to and recovered by the Estate\" in the related actions, costs of $46,406.94, and any additional costs they had incurred on Chalker's behalf since May 1999, as yet undetermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 8 David Sobel, the attorney for the Estate, informed Petitioners that the Estate was prepared to file an objection to their Claim, but instead proposed entering an agreement tolling the time for filing their objection pending the outcome of Robert Catz's federal litigation. The Petitioners signed, and the superior court approved, a Tolling Agreement in January 2006, stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. The time for original presentation of claims expires on December 4, 2005.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4. The personal representative has sixty (60) days from December 4, 2005 to file a notice of allowance or disallowance of claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   5. The parties agree to extend the personal representative's deadline to file a notice of allowance or disallowance of the Everlove and Karp claim until the following case has been resolved in the United States Federal District Court for the District of Arizona, Case No. CV-03-91-TUC-FRZ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 After the Arizona district court finally dismissed the Catzes' case on November 14, 2013, the Estate filed its notice of disallowance of Petitioners' Claim on November 27, 2013. Petitioners filed their petition for allowance of their Claim on January 15, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 10 In March 2014, the Estate filed a petition to finally recover the Fidelity Accounts. In July 2014, the superior court issued an order determining that the Fidelity Accounts \"are the sole and separate property of The Chalker Estate and that Shawn Catz and Jason Catz have no ownership interest in the Fidelity Accounts.\" In August 2014, the Fidelity Accounts were transferred to the Estate and liquidated, yielding a total value of over $1.2 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 The superior court held a bench trial in January 2016. The court determined that Petitioners were not entitled to 50 percent of the Fidelity Accounts under the terms of the 1999 fee agreement. Rather, the court held the Petitioners were each entitled to an award in quantum meruit for services rendered, but that they were not entitled to receive interest on those awards. The superior court ultimately awarded $94,463.00 in attorney fees to Karp, $101,608.00 in attorney fees to Everlove, and $42,438.59 in total costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 Petitioners argue the superior court erred by failing to add interest to their award in quantum meruit, claiming the probate code mandates interest on all allowed creditor claims.

Once a claimant has timely filed a petition for allowance, the probate court may then allow the claim in whole or in part. A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3806(C). Generally, \"\n   <strong>\n    allowed claims bear interest at the legal rate for the period commencing sixty days after the time for original presentation of the claim has\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    expired\n   </strong>\n   ,\" unless the claim is based on a contract that makes a provision for interest. A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3806(E) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 Section 14-3810(A) further provides that, \"[i]f a ...\n   <strong>\n    contingent or unliquidated claim\n   </strong>\n   becomes due or certain before the distribution of the estate, and if the claim\n   <strong>\n    has been allowed or established by a proceeding\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    it is paid in the same manner\n   </strong>\n   as presently due and absolute claims of the same class.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Petitioners argue that, according to the above statutory framework, they timely presented their unliquidated Claim for attorney fees; Respondent disallowed that Claim; and Petitioners timely commenced a proceeding to allow their Claim in probate court. Because the court ultimately awarded Petitioners fees in quantum meruit-i.e., establishing their Claim for attorney fees through that proceeding-they argue their Claim must be \"paid in the same manner as presently due and absolute claims of the same class,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3810(A), by \"bear[ing] interest at the legal rate\" beginning sixty days after the deadline for the original presentation of claims, A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3806(E). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 The language of A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3806(E) states plainly that \"allowed claims bear interest at the legal rate\"; it does not differentiate between liquidated or unliquidated claims or make any other qualification applicable here. Section 14-3810(A) further highlights the lack of differentiation between liquidated and unliquidated claims, stating that even unliquidated claims that become due or certain before the distribution of the estate and have been allowed or established by the court are to be paid \"in the same manner\" as presently due and absolute claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Personal Representative argues that interest is not allowable under the theory of quantum meruit. In support, they cite\n   <em>\n    Schwartz v. Schwerin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    85 Ariz. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    336 P.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). The case supports the Estate's position.\" The superior court therefore ordered that Petitioners were not entitled to an award of interest on the quantum meruit awards, but did rule that \"Petitioners are entitled to interest at the statutory rate on the costs advanced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 In\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   -in which an attorney brought an action against his clients to recover attorney fees in quantum meruit-the Arizona Supreme Court held that, if a \"claim is unliquidated and is in dispute,\" interest is only allowed from the date of judgment \"upon the theory that the person liable does not know the sum he owes and therefore can be in no default for not paying.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    85 Ariz. at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    336 P.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Am.

The supreme court, however, also noted that at the time, unlike some states,\n   \"we have no statute governing the allowance of interest in such a situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    85 Ariz. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646723\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/85/242/\">\n    336 P.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Schwartz\n   </em>\n   , Arizona has enacted provisions of the Uniform Probate Code rather than following the common-law principle in matters of probate. While we acknowledge that awarding prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims is inconsistent with Arizona's general rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metzler v.

Such a holding would be inconsistent with the purposes of our probate code, which should be construed liberally to \"promote a speedy and efficient system for liquidating the estate of the decedent and making distribution to his successors.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 14-1102(A), (B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 Here, the Estate notified Petitioners of the opening for the presentation of claims on August 4, 2005, and stated in the notice that the date of expiration for the presentation of claims was December 4, 2005-a date the parties agreed on, as evidenced by their Tolling Agreement,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b68. Because interest on all allowed claims begins to accrue sixty (60) days after the time for the original presentation of the claim expires, A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3806(E), Petitioners' claim for attorney fees began bearing interest as of February 2, 2006.
