The superior court imposed a life sentence without the possibility of parole. In 2016, under RCW 10.95.030 (the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and RCW 10.95.035, the superior court held an evidentiary hearing and entered an order imposing a minimum term of 48 years with a maximum term of life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Delbosque challenges his judgment and sentence, arguing that the superior court's findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence and that the superior court failed to adequately consider the diminished culpability of youth as required by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute when setting the minimum term. We hold that the superior court's findings regarding Delbosque having an attitude towards others reflective of the underlying crime, and of Delbosque's permanent incorrigibility and irretrievable depravity are not supported by substantial evidence. We further hold that the superior court failed to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute when setting Delbosque's minimum term. Thus, Delbosque's restraint is unlawful. Accordingly, we grant his Personal Restraint Petition (PRP), reverse the judgment and sentence, and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 1994, Delbosque was convicted of aggravated first degree murder for the murder of a young woman. Delbosque was sentenced to a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Delbosque was 17 years old when he committed the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In June 2016, the superior court conducted an evidentiary hearing to set a minimum term of confinement under the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute and RCW 10.95.035(1). During this hearing, the superior court heard extensive testimony from Delbosque's friends and relatives regarding his difficult and troubled childhood. The State presented testimony from the officer who investigated the murder and victim impact testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State also presented evidence from Robert Schreiber, the unit supervisor of the prison where Delbosque was incarcerated. Schreiber testified that Delbosque was currently classified as medium security and would qualify for minimum security except for the term of his sentence and an immigration detainer. Schreiber testified that between 1995 and 2008, Delbosque had 10 prison infractions, and that Delbosque's last infraction was in 2010. The 2010 infraction asserted that Delbosque used his leadership position in a gang to attempt to arrange an assault on another inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Delbosque presented the testimony of two experts. Dr. Manuel Saint Martin evaluated Delbosque for past and current mental health issues. Dr. Saint Martin diagnosed Delbosque with borderline intellectual functioning and alcohol dependence at the time he committed the crime. Dr. Saint Martin also testified that he believed the murder likely involved \"some sort of psychotic episode due to alcohol.\" III Verbatim Report of Proceeding (VRP) at 423. In Dr. Saint Martin's opinion, Delbosque's dependence on alcohol played a significant role in the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Dr. Sarah Heavin testified specifically regarding whether youth was a factor in Delbosque's case. Dr. Heavin testified that the major area in which youthfulness affects behavior is executive functioning because of the youth's underdeveloped frontal lobe. Generally, this results in juveniles being more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior and more susceptible to peer pressure or peer approval. Dr. Heavin opined that Delbosque was even more likely to exhibit these behaviors because of his lower intellectual functioning and traumatic upbringing. Specifically, Dr. Heavin testified that \"youthfulness, combined with trauma, made him less likely to monitor his own behavior responsibly, inhibit aggressive behavior.\" III VRP at 513. In summary, Dr. Heavin testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Well, I'm not suggesting that Mr. Delbosque's homicide be excused. I'm suggesting that the [c]ourt respectfully consider the effect that his early childhood had on\n   his brain development. It's my opinion that his relative risk taking was greater than a typically developing youth without those same risk factors, which placed him in the apartment drinking alcohol excessively with a gun. And once essentially this string of crimes that were committed that night started, he had more difficulty than the average teen behaving in a reasonable way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III VRP at 537-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 After the hearing, the superior court entered the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Childhood and Life Experiences.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Delbosque endured a very difficult childhood up until the time of the murder, including a life with little nurturing, limited nutrition, and much chaos. Many risk factors are associated with the upbringing and development of Mr. Delbosque, including utero exposure to alcohol, his mother's death at an early age, a life of impoverishment, and both sexual and physical abuse as a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Degree of Responsibility.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Delbosque is entirely responsible for the murder. No other person assisted him in the design or implementation of the murder. Alcohol dependence was not a predominate factor in the murder. Anger and a desire to conceal guilt were the predominate factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Mr. [Delbosque]'s chances of becoming rehabilitated and the reflection of transient immaturity.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Delbosque committed an extraordinarily brutal and vicious murder of a minor victim. Mr. Delbosque does not suffer from any diagnosable mental illness, but has been diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Mr. Delbosque continues to exhibit an ongoing attitude to others that is reflective of Mr. Delbosque's underlying murder where he is choosing to advance his needs, even resorting to violence, over the well-being of others. This reflects an attitude that a third party's well-being is insignificant and expendable in comparison to his needs. There is no identified program or treatment presented to deal with this negative attribute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 30-31. Based on its findings, the superior court concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The brutal murder that Mr. Delbosque committed in October of 1993 was not symptomatic of transient immaturity, but has proven over time to be a reflection of irreparable corruption, permanent incorrigibility, and irretrievable depravity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CP at 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The superior court set a minimum term of 48 years with a maximum term of life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I. PROPER REVIEW OF DELBOSQUE'S CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 9 Delbosque filed a direct appeal of the superior court's order imposing the new minimum term.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 19 Delbosque argues that the following four findings of fact in the superior court's order are not supported by substantial evidence: (1) alcohol dependence was not a predominant factor in the murder, (2) Delbosque does not suffer from a diagnosable mental illness, (3) Delbosque continues to demonstrate an attitude towards others reflective of the underlying crime, and (4) the murder reflected permanent incorrigibility and irretrievable depravity. The superior court's findings regarding alcohol dependence and mental illness are supported by substantial evidence, but the remaining findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1. Alcohol Dependence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20 The superior court found that \"[a]lcohol dependence was not a predominate factor in the murder.\" CP at 12. Dr. Saint Martin testified that he believed that alcohol induced psychosis explained much of the seemingly bizarre behavior during and after the murder. However, the superior court, in its oral ruling, weighed that opinion against the evidence at the crime scene and determined that the murder was not the result of alcohol induced psychosis. Therefore, to this extent, the superior court's finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2. Mental Illness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 21 The superior court also found that Delbosque does not suffer from diagnosable mental illness but that he has been diagnosed with alcohol dependence. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Dr. Saint Martin did testify that Delbosque had a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and borderline intellectual functions. Dr. Saint Martin testified that Delbosque did not suffer from any personality disorders such as schizophrenia, hallucinations, or sexual deviance. Therefore,\n   this finding, within the context it was made, is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3. Pattern of Behavior\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 22 The superior court also found that \"Delbosque continues to exhibit an ongoing attitude to others that is reflective of Mr. Delbosque's underlying murder.\" CP at 12. The superior court noted in its oral ruling that, while in prison, Delbosque received an infraction in 2010 for his alleged involvement in gang activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 23 Although the superior court found that Delbosque had an ongoing attitude reflective of the murder, the court's only example of this attitude was Delbosque's 2010 infraction for attempting to arrange an assault, which occurred six years prior to the evidentiary hearing. Therefore, to whatever extent Delbosque's infraction history does exhibit a pattern related to the murder he committed, that pattern is not continuing or current. Therefore, the superior court's finding is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   4. Irreparable Corruption\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 24 The superior court also found that Delbosque's crime was a reflection of \"irreparable corruption, permanent incorrigibility, and irretrievable depravity.\" CP at 12. In its oral ruling, the superior court stated that Delbosque's \"predatory view ha[d] extended well into his adult life.\" IV VRP at 660. The court also noted that the murder \"was not symptomatic of transient immaturity, but has proven over time to be a reflection of irreparable corruption, permanent incorrigibility, and irretrievable depravity.\" IV VRP at 661.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 25 As discussed above, the superior court considered that Delbosque received an infraction in 2010. But his infraction does not support the notion that Delbosque continues to exhibit an attitude reflective of the murder. Likewise, Delbosque's infraction is not evidence of irreparable corruption proven over time. Delbosque had been in prison for approximately 15 years before the 2010 infraction, and the infraction took place 6 years before the evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, the superior court's finding is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   C. DIMINISHED CULPABILITY OF YOUTH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 26 Delbosque next argues that the superior court erred in setting the minimum term of his sentence because the court failed to properly consider the sentencing criteria in the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute. We agree. While the superior court clearly understood what it was required to consider, its findings demonstrate that it failed to meaningfully consider the evidence within the proper context of the diminished culpability of youth as required by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute. Accordingly, the superior court failed to comply with the requirements of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute in setting Delbosque's minimum term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the superior court made specific findings regarding Delbosque's age, childhood and life experience, degree of responsibility, and chances of becoming rehabilitated. The superior court did not, however, consider the designated factors \"that account for the diminished culpability of youth,\" as required by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   fix statute.

In making this determination, the Court relied on three gaps between children and adults: children display a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, they are more vulnerable to outside pressures and negative influences, and their traits are less likely to be evidence of irretrievable depravity.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 471,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 28\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   also determined that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes. 567 U.S. at 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the heart of the retribution rationale relates to an offender's blameworthiness, the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as\n   with an adult.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, deciding that a juvenile offender forever will be a danger to society would require making a judgment that the juvenile is incorrigible, but incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 472-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the same reason, rehabilitation cannot justify a sentence of life without parole because it forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal and reflects an irrevocable judgment about a juvenile offender's value and place in society, at odds with a child's capacity for change.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 29 Both the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   holding and Dr. Heavin's testimony clearly establish that the diminished culpability of youth relates to juveniles underdeveloped executive brain functioning, including increased risk taking, failure to appreciate consequences and responsibility, and susceptibility to outside influences. Dr. Heavin also testified that Delbosque's childhood and life experiences and degree of responsibility exacerbated the poor executive functioning characteristic of youth. In this case, the superior court did not address how any of the factors it analyzed related to the poor executive functioning or increased risk taking that Dr. Heavin identified as reflective of Delbosque's diminished culpability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 30 The superior court also failed to address the greater prospects for reform from a crime committed while Delbosque was a child. This failure is shown by our holdings above that Delbosque's infraction history does not exhibit a continuing or current pattern of behavior related to the murder he committed. Nor are his infractions evidence of irreparable corruption proven over time. The court's rationale is also inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's recognition that incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth. 567 U.S. at 472-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 31 In setting Delbosque's minimum term, the superior court failed to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute by failing to specifically consider the \"diminished culpability of youth.\" Because the superior court failed to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -fix statute, Delbosque shows that his restraint is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 32 We hold that the superior court's findings regarding an attitude towards others reflective of the underlying crime, and of permanent incorrigibility and irretrievable depravity are not supported by substantial evidence.
