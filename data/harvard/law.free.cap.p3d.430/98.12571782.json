Put succinctly, defendant engaged in what is commonly known as \"sexting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   293 Or.

In\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , the court affirmed two trial court determinations that sentences imposed under the statute were constitutionally disproportionate and, reviewing its case law, identified three nonexclusive factors for assessing as-applied challenges under Article I, section 16 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"(1) a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime; (2) a comparison of the penalties imposed for other, related crimes; and (3) the criminal history of the defendant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The offense, for purposes of an as-applied proportionality challenge, is not limited to the description of the prohibited conduct in the statute but includes consideration of the range of conduct prohibited by the statute as well as the circumstances of the defendant's specific offense, and then placing the defendant's conduct on the range of prohibited conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"An as-applied proportionality analysis that considers the facts of an individual defendant's specific criminal conduct is particularly significant when the criminal statute at issue covers a broad range of activity, criminalizing a variety of forms and intensity of conduct. In such a case, a harsh penalty might not, on its face, be disproportionate,\n   because of the fact that the statute dealt,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   with some extreme form of that conduct. However, when a defendant is convicted for engaging in only more minor conduct encompassed within the statute, the defendant may plausibly argue that the mandatory sentence, as applied to the particular facts of his or her case, is unconstitutionally disproportionate.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . When assessing the \"range of activity,\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"a court may consider, among other things, the specific circumstances and facts of the defendant's conduct that come within the statutory definition of the offense, as well as other case-specific factors, such as characteristics of the defendant and the victim, the harm to the victim, and the relationship between the defendant and the victim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In applying that factor, the court concluded that the defendants' criminal conduct was \"insufficiently grave to justify the mandatory six-year and three-month sentence\" and \"less severe than the conduct in the vast majority of (and probably in all) other reported first-degree sexual abuse cases since Measure 11 was passed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the second factor announced in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/ Buck\n   </em>\n   , the court compared the imposed penalty to penalties for related offenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying that factor in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that the mandatory minimum sentence for the defendants' conduct-minimal sexual conduct with clothed children-was the same as the mandatory minimum sentence for second-degree sodomy, second-degree rape, and second-degree sexual penetration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, given that the defendant's criminal history \"reflect[ed] a deeply ingrained pattern of predatory behavior\" and \"the seriousness of [the] defendant's repeated sexual misconduct and the danger that it forecasts for others,\" the court concluded that the defendant's true-life sentence did not violate the proportionality requirement of Article I, section 16.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Two other court decisions bear mentioning. In\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   , the court again decided the constitutionality of a sentence imposed under ORS 137.719(1), using the\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   framework for the \"consideration of as-applied challenges to sentences imposed pursuant to ORS 137.719.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    360 Or. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    380 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The convictions triggering ORS 137.719(1) were, like the ones in\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   , for public indecency. Despite the fact that the defendant had \"little control over his behavior or understanding of the socially unacceptable nature of his conduct,\" as well as a history indicating that he was \"highly resistive to reform,\" in concluding that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was disproportionate under Article I, section 16, the court considered significant that the defendant's history of sexual offenses did not include physical contact with victims or specifically targeting victims.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 385, 387,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    380 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , the court returned to the constitutionality of a sentence imposed under ORS 137.700, to address the defendant's argument that the trial court failed\n   to properly account for his intellectual disability-an IQ score equivalent to the mental age of a 10 year old-in its analysis of the defendant's proportionality challenge to a 75-month sentence for a first-degree sexual abuse conviction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414985\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/602/\">\n    361 Or. at 604-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414985\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/602/\">\n    396 P.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court used ORS 161.290(1), which provides that a person tried as an adult is not criminally responsible for conduct occurring when the person was under 12 years of age, as \"objective evidence of a societal standard that eschews treating persons with the attributes of a pre-teen child as if they were normally abled adult offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 624,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414985\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/602/\">\n    396 P.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the court has never addressed the constitutional proportionality of ORS 137.690 -facially or as applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORS 137.690, unlike ORS 137.719(1), does not, at least in this case, operate as a recidivism statute. For that reason, we disagree with the dissent's approach, which depends heavily on the court's consideration of ORS 137.719(1) and other recidivism statutes. Likewise, for the same reason, we reject the state's assertion that the second\n   factor of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   -a comparison of the penalties imposed for related offenses-has little or no relevance in the disproportionality analysis in this case. Second, the court has never analyzed the significance of sentences imposed concurrently with the challenged sentences-that is, it has not examined the aggregate or \"package\" sentence imposed on a defendant, or a hypothetically imposed sentence, to assess a sentencing challenge under Article I, section 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We understand the dissent's approach to be based on an understanding of the trial court's sentencing determination in this case that is contradicted by the record of what the court actually considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   293 Or. App. at 677, 430 P.3d at 135 (Garrett, J., dissenting). A fair reading of the court's sentencing determination indicates that it was driven by the 300-month minimum imprisonment sentence required by the convictions at issue here, for using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. The state, in its sentencing recommendation, argued that defendant's \"sentence is largely subject to the provisions of ORS 137.700 and ORS 137.690.\" Furthermore, the state sought to justify that minimum sentence by asserting that defendant's conduct requesting nude images by cell phone is much graver than we determine it to be, 293 Or. App. at 638, 430 P.3d at 114 (concluding that defendant's conduct \"falls toward the less serious range of conduct\" prohibited by ORS 163.670 and ORS 137.690 ). The trial court imposed the sentences in the way that it did within the context of the 25-year minimum sentence for the ORS 163.670 convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The dissent's view presumes that, because the court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have permissibly imposed the same sentence by means of stringing together consecutive sentences on the array of crimes of conviction, or\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   permissibly do so on remand, that the court\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   have done the same or\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   do the same on remand, and consequently it reads our opinion as ignoring the realities of the sentence on review. 293 Or. App. at 688-89, 430 P.3d at 141-42 (Garrett, J., dissenting). Here, the dissent's position considers an alternative scenario in which the arguments to the court would have been, or will be, entirely different. Put differently, had the minimum sentence under ORS 137.690 been a 15-year or a 20-year minimum term of imprisonment, the court may have very well imposed a 15-year or\n   20-year total sentence,\n   or a sentence closer to the 10-year sentence originally proposed by the state and acceptable to the victims during plea negotiations. We cannot tell from this record that the court determined that, had it considered all of defendant's convictions, it would have arrived at the \"package\" it did despite the 25-year required minimum. Moreover, we cannot anticipate with the certainty asserted by the dissent what, on remand, the state will recommend, what arguments or mitigating evidence defendant will present to the court, or what the court will deem appropriate within its permissible discretion allowed under the law. In our view, because the case law has invariably remained concentrated on analyzing the constitutionality of individual sentences, we agree with the state's express position on appeal that the \"proper focus for purposes of a proportionality analysis is on each\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   crime that the defendant committed and on the corresponding sentence imposed for that crime.\" (Emphasis in the state's brief.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, we reject the approach advanced by the dissent that the proportionality analysis in this case must necessarily consider defendant's \"total\" or \"package\" sentence. That is because the Supreme Court's proportionality analysis under Article I, section 16, has been, for good reason, in every case, an analysis of the individual sentence challenged by a defendant. Article I, section 16, mandates that \"all penalties shall be proportioned to\n   <em>\n    the offense\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, in Article I, section 16, challenges on either a facial or as-applied basis, the court has resolved the constitutionality of the statutorily-prescribed sentence. Given that we must look \"to the legislative enactment of the particular penalties at issue as an external source of law to assist in determining whether those penalties would shock the moral sense of reasonable people,\" how could it be otherwise? That is, fundamental to the proportionality analysis is a probing of the legislative justification for a statutorily prescribed sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The dissent drastically departs from that approach when it says that defendant's \"total\" sentence is the appropriate sentence to gauge its effect on the moral sense of reasonable people. That approach focuses on the sentencing court's discretion-in this case, the sentencing court's\n   hypothetical exercise of discretion-rather than on the legislative justification for the imposition of 25 years of prison for the violations of ORS 163.670 that triggered ORS 137.690.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   293 Or. App. at 688-89, 430 P.3d at 141-42 (Garrett, J., dissenting). We also conclude that when ORS 137.690 and its intent are properly considered, the framework supplied by\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   is adequate to analyze the constitutional proportionality of defendant's challenged 25-year prison sentences. We proceed to explain further that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, the Supreme Court considers ORS 137.719 a recidivism statute: A true-life sentence is triggered under ORS 137.719\"if the defendant has been sentenced for sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the current sentence,\" and, consequently, the court has described it as a \"recidivism statute for felony sex offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    343 Or. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    175 P.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    175 P.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" ORS 137.719(1) is a recidivism statute that applies to defendant only because he has two prior felony convictions for sex crimes.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That purpose of ORS 137.719(1) acutely informs the reasoning of the court's jurisprudence, which is that relatively innocuous conduct may merit a true-life prison sentence if the defendant has been proven incorrigible and thus constitutes a threat to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    343 Or. at 676-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    175 P.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the legislature is permitted \"to impose enhanced sentences on recidivists even if those sentences would be disproportionate when applied to a defendant without prior convictions\");\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166097\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/668/\">\n    359 Or. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166097\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/668/\">\n    375 P.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]efendant, over a 30-year period, has been convicted of sexual abuse and sodomy of his own and other\n   people's children, as well as public indecency.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, ORS 137.690 has a different aim. Whereas ORS 137.719 concerns the recidivist's third conviction for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   sex crime (as included in ORS 163A.005,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ORS 137.719(4) ), ORS 137.690 concerns the imposition of a 25-year sentence for persons who have been convicted of the gravest sex crimes more than once. That is, it applies to \"major felony sex crimes\"-first-degree rape, sodomy and sexual penetration (sex crimes inflicted by forcible compulsion or upon victims younger than 12) and using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct-and does not require any conviction prior to the current sentencing to be triggered. ORS 137.690 applies when a defendant has more than one major felony sex crime conviction, but yet allows a previous conviction to be the predicate conviction even if it is imposed in the same sentencing proceeding. ORS 137.690 (\" 'Previous conviction' includes a conviction for the statutory counterpart of a major felony sex crime in any jurisdiction, and includes a conviction in the same sentencing proceeding if the conviction is for a separate criminal episode as defined in ORS 131.505.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the statute allows the \"previous\" major felony sex crime conviction to be sentenced in the same proceeding, it is less concerned with the goal of protecting the public from recidivist sex criminals, and more concerned with the protection of the public from those persons who have committed the very worst sex crimes more than once.\n   <em>\n    See Multnomah County Ballot Guide\n   </em>\n   76, November 2010 (\"These are the worst of the sexual predators. We need to keep them behind bars to protect the public.\"). Indeed, the arguments in favor of Measure 73 in the Voters' Pamphlet nowhere evince an intent to address the problem of recidivism of violent sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See Multnomah County Ballot Guide\n   </em>\n   76 (arguments in favor of the measure explaining that it is meant to \"protect its citizens from harm\" and \"provide justice to victims of crime\" by incarcerating the \"worst of * * * repeat,\" but not recidivist, offenders). Rather, ORS 137.690 appears to be justified by a belief that the second-time offender of a \"major felony sex crime,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the most heinous violent sex crimes, requires punishment in excess of what is available under Measure 11. That is, ORS 137.690 imposes an enhanced sentence on persons who commit a second-time first-degree rape, sodomy, and unlawful sexual penetration (generally, penetration or sexual contact by forcible compulsion or of a child 11 years old or younger) or use a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct (generally understood as creating child pornography or live sex shows), persons who were described in the Voters' Pamphlet as the \"worst repeat violent sex offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    See Multnomah County Ballot Guide\n   </em>\n   76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a result, we view with skepticism the dissent's view that the Supreme Court's case law compels an approach that reduces the proportionality analysis in this case to \"a broadly contextual one in which the characteristics of the defendant and his conduct, not just the narrow underlying offense, matter,\" 293 Or. App. at 685, 430 P.3d at 140 (Garrett, J., dissenting), and that, consequently, includes all of the criminal conduct for which defendant was sentenced in the same sentencing proceeding, even if none of the conduct, as we explain below, constitutes the most heinous of sexual crimes. To begin with, the dissent's \"contextual\" approach amplifies the characteristics of defendant and his overall conduct while it ignores other contextual factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   . That is, in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court instructed that courts may also consider \"case-specific factors, such as characteristics of the defendant\n   <em>\n    and the victim,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the harm to the victim, and the relationship between the defendant and the victim.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). When those other factors are considered, as we do below, 293 Or. App. at 641-42, 430 P.3d at 116 (considering that defendant was in his late-adolescence, that defendant and the sexting victims were in the same peer group, and that defendant's lack of previous convictions of any kind or other evidence does not indicate incorrigibility), the first factor in the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   test is fairly applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the justification the court has developed in facial and as-applied challenges under ORS 137.719(1) in\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   depends on the principle that the legislature is entitled to provide enhanced sentences when a defendant has been proven highly resistant to reform\n   because the person has reoffended after the state has previously punished him or her. The court's analysis under that statute-and other recidivist statutes-has focused on that justification, and we cannot discern a reason for the application of that justification to the statute at issue here. Likewise, we reject the state's position that ORS 137.690 is \"analogous\" to ORS 137.719 and that, therefore, because of defendant's multiple convictions, the second\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   factor (comparison of penalties imposed for other related crimes) has little relevance to the proportionality analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because ORS 137.690 does not operate as a recidivist statute in this case-given that defendant's convictions were imposed under the same sentencing proceeding and he had been neither convicted nor sanctioned for any criminal offenses before that sentencing proceeding-we apply the test set out in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, when considering the gravity of the offense compared to the severity of the penalty, we necessarily recognize that the 25-year sentences imposed under ORS 137.690 in this case were for multiple offenses involving using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. Engaging in that properly-framed review, we conclude, as explained below, that the actual conduct in which defendant engaged falls short-far short-of conduct that could be considered by a reasonable person to be the most reprehensible of sex crimes, which is the legislative justification for the sentences he received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II. DEFENDANT'S CONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the jury found defendant guilty of the relevant charges, we view the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the state.\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    360 Or. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    380 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The crimes forming the basis of defendant's convictions occurred during a period beginning when defendant was 16 and ending when he was 18, when he pursued, often successfully, sexual activity with eight girls who were between two and four years younger than he was. The investigation of defendant began on November 7, 2012, when the mother of 13-year-old CB discovered and reported to police a text message thread on a cell phone involving discussions of sexual activity between defendant and CB, which included defendant telling CB that he loved her and asking her to perform\n   oral sex on him as well as asking for \"pictures.\" CB testified at trial that she was \"pretty sure\" that she had sent pictures of herself holding her naked breasts because defendant had asked her to. CB's mother believed that defendant had sexually penetrated CB; CB provided inconsistent accounts to investigators of the sexual contact between her and defendant. For his conduct with CB, defendant was convicted of inducing a child to engage in a display of sexually explicit conduct and first-degree sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the first-degree sexual abuse conviction, defendant received a 70-month sentence and, for the child-display conviction, he received a 75-month sentence as required by ORS 137.700 (Ballot Measure 11), which serves as the predicate conviction for the remaining 10 child-display convictions for which defendant was sentenced under ORS 137.690 (Ballot Measure 73).\n   In May 2013, 16-year-old PG reported a domestic violence incident involving defendant, who was then 18 years old. At the time, PG shared an apartment with defendant and their two-month-old son. PG and defendant were arguing about finances, and PG was angry because she had discovered on defendant's cell phone nude pictures of other girls. The argument escalated, and defendant pushed PG down about 10 times and, at one point, held her down and punched her in the head. PG testified that when she was 15 or 16, she took nude photos-of her breasts and vagina, and of herself masturbating-and sent them to defendant. According to PG, defendant never asked for the pictures-she sent them unsolicited-but he did \"express that he liked\" them. At trial, PG testified that she still loved defendant and that she was unhappy that he was being prosecuted and that she had been called to testify against him. Concerning defendant's conduct as to PG, defendant was convicted of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, ORS 163.670 ; fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence; and second-degree encouraging child abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the child-display conviction, he received a 25-year sentence; for the fourth-degree assault conviction, a 25-month sentence;\n   and, for second-degree encouraging child abuse, a 15-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   During the course of the domestic violence investigation concerning PG, police obtained a warrant to search and analyze defendant's cell phone. Upon doing so, they discovered images of naked breasts and partially clothed girls that had been sent to defendant by PG and six other girls. Police used the information associated with the images to contact the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant began sexually penetrating BB and subjecting her to other sexual activity when she was 14. He also asked that she send him pictures of her breasts and buttocks, and complimented her when she did. For his conduct with BB, he was convicted of two counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, ORS 163.670, and third-degree rape and sodomy, ORS 163.355, ORS 163.385. Defendant received a 25-year sentence for each child-display conviction and 25-month sentences for the third-degree rape and sodomy convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   LA was 14 and 15 years old when she sent defendant nude pictures of herself, sometimes because he asked for them and sometimes spontaneously. He did not pressure her, but encouraged and complimented her when she did so. Defendant was not specific about the kinds of pictures he had in mind, except that one time he specifically asked for nude pictures. KH was 14 years old when she took a top-less picture of herself and text messaged it to defendant, after he had asked her to do so. DM was about two years younger than defendant when he asked for, and DM sent, a picture in which her breasts and her vagina were exposed. Defendant responded to the picture by asking for more. PH was 15 when she sent nude and clothed pictures of herself to defendant via text. She sent the \"sexually suggestive\" pictures sometimes because defendant requested them and sometimes without him asking so that she could \"get his attention.\" For his conduct with these victims, with whom defendant was not charged with having had physical sexual contact, defendant was convicted of seven counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct; for each conviction he received a 25-year sentence under ORS 137.690.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The pictures that JB sent to defendant were not of nudes, but when police contacted her, she stated that defendant had sexually penetrated her beginning when she was 12 years old and continuing until she was 14. For that conduct, defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.408, for which he received Measure 11 sentences of 75 months each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The state recommended to the sentencing court that defendant serve a total of 25 years imprisonment. Defendant argued that the state's recommended 25-year sentence for 10\n   of the ORS 163.670 convictions was constitutionally disproportionate under\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court agreed to sentence defendant according to the state's recommendation, finding significant that there was not one specific incident but a \"huge totality of circumstances that included taking pictures and then acting upon them and using the self-esteem of these victims and crashing their self-esteem and using the sex acts in addition.\" What struck the court as significant was that the eight victims were \"particularly vulnerable\" and \"desperate\" for defendant's \"attention, approval, and love\" and that is why they sent him images of themselves and allowed defendant to subject them to sexual acts. The sentencing court appears not to have engaged with the constitutional proportionality of the 25-year sentences for the child-display convictions, stating that it was \"going to leave a lot of those legal arguments to a higher court to determine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, defendant was convicted of 11 counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct; one count of first-degree sexual abuse; one count of fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence; one count of second-degree child abuse; one count of third-degree rape; one count of third-degree sodomy; and two counts of second-degree sexual penetration. Because the sentencing court ordered that all of the sentences be served concurrently, defendant was sentenced to a total of 25 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III.

Although the 25-year sentences in these cases are not as severe as the true-life sentences imposed on the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   (and those held constitutionally disproportionate in\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ), they are four times as long as the 75-month sentences held by the Supreme Court to be constitutionally disproportionate for the conduct constituting first-degree sexual abuse in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   . The 25-year sentence is also equivalent to the sentence imposed for murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 137.700 (providing for 300 months (25 years) of imprisonment for murder under ORS 163.115 (intentionally committing criminal homicide) ).\n   <em>\n    A 25-year imprisonment sentence is an extremely severe penalty\n   </em>\n   . We proceed to compare that penalty to the gravity of the offense, recognizing that the challenged penalties arise not just from a single offense of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct but from 11 convictions and also from the fact that defendant was convicted of other offenses in the same sentencing proceeding. In making the comparison, we look at the range of conduct prohibited by ORS 163.670 and consider defendant's specific conduct-using case-specific factors such as characteristics of defendant and the victims, the relationship between defendant and the victims, and the harm to the victims-to determine where on the range of prohibited conduct defendant's conduct falls.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 62, 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ORS 163.670 prohibits using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, which occurs \"if the person employs, authorizes, permits, compels or induces a child to participate or engage in sexually explicit conduct for any person to observe or to record in a visual recording.\" We have characterized ORS 163.670 as describing the most serious of a group of related offenses that concern the visual recording and observation of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct that also include encouraging child sexual abuse, ORS 163.684 ; ORS 163.686 ; ORS 163.687, possession\n   of materials, ORS 163.688 ; ORS 163.689, and failure to report child pornography, ORS 163.693.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition to ORS 163.670, a \"major felony sex crime\" for purposes of ORS 137.690 includes first-degree rape, ORS 163.375, first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, and first-degree sexual penetration, ORS 163.411. Thus, ORS 137.690 is triggered by a range of criminal conduct, as serious as sexual penetration and deviate sexual intercourse (defined as \"sexual conduct consisting of contact between the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another,\" ORS 163.305(1) ) by means of forcible compulsion or with a child under the age of 12, and as minor as the crime at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The state posits that when voters approved ORS 137.690 in November 2010 by Ballot Measure 73, they intended the measure to encompass defendant's conduct.

It is also true, however, that the argument in favor of Measure 73 was that the measure was meant to send the \"worst of the sexual predators\" to prison for at least 25 years,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , put \"the worst violent sex offenders behind bars for a long time.\"\n   <em>\n    Multnomah County Ballot Guide\n   </em>\n   76, November 2010.

Here, to be sure, perhaps the most innocuous conduct that would implicate ORS 163.670 and ORS 137.690 would be a 17-year-old who twice asks for and receives from another 17-year-old nude images by cell phone (or in person- ORS 163.670 prohibits inducing the live observation of a child's sexual or other intimate parts). We recognize that defendant's conduct does not fall at that very outer edge of prohibited contact. Nevertheless, when compared to other conduct prohibited by ORS 163.670 or that triggers ORS 137.690, defendant's conduct falls toward the less serious range of conduct implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Penalties for Related Offenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We next turn to comparing the penalty at issue-25-year sentences-to the penalties\n   for other related crimes. \"If the penalties for more 'serious' crimes than the crime at issue result in less severe sentences, that is an indication that the challenged penalty may be disproportionate.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this factor, defendant groups the victims into two categories: (1) those who were 14, 15, and 16 years old and were less than three years younger than defendant when he committed the offenses (PG, KH, DM, and PH) and (2) those who were 14 years old and more than three years younger than defendant (BB and LA). For the first group, ORS 163.345 provides a defense to second-and third-degree rape, second- and third-degree sodomy, first- through third-degree sexual abuse; and contributing to a minor's sexual delinquency if the victim's incapacity to consent is solely because they are younger than a certain age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, second-degree rape is committed when a\n   person sexually penetrates another person who is under 14 years of age, but a defense to prosecution is available if, for example, the accused is less than three years older than the underage person. For the second group, defendant points out that he was convicted of third-degree rape and sodomy for engaging in sexual intercourse and oral sex with BB because of her legal incapacity to consent as someone under the age of 16, and that he was sentenced to 25 months imprisonment for each of those crimes, which are neither Measure 11 crimes nor considered \"major felony sex crimes\" for the purpose of Measure 73. Hence, the 25-year imprisonment penalties he received for soliciting a nude picture more than once were significantly greater-12-fold-than the penalty for those convictions involving physical sexual offenses, or possible similar convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For its part, the state concedes that age-related sex offenses are related to the child-display convictions, but contends that such a comparison is not helpful or significant in instances when the criminal conduct being sentenced is not \"innocuous\" or when there are multiple victims and crimes. We reject that argument. The crimes in both\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/ Buck\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   were decidedly not \"innocuous.\" In\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , the court was careful to clarify that it did not mean to suggest that the \"defendants' conduct caused no harm to their victims,\" recognizing that sexual abuse potentially causes psychological and physical harm.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   70 n. 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   , the court likewise recognized that the defendant's repeated instances of public masturbation \"will continue to cause upset and possible harm to people who observe him exposing himself and masturbating.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    360 Or. at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186414\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/370/\">\n    380 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we discussed above, the conduct of asking the victims to send pictures of themselves naked-to \"sext\" him-is toward the \"outer edge,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of what constitutes using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. We cannot conclude that such conduct warrants such a grave penalty when actual physical contact between defendant and the victims would not be prosecutable. As for the second group of victims, we similarly cannot\n   conclude that the harm of defendant's conduct in requesting sexually explicit images is of a magnitude so much greater than the harm of engaging in physical sexual activity that it deserves sentences far greater than could be imposed for rape and sodomy by reason of the victims' incapacity to consent. The comparisons here indicate that the Measure 73 sentences imposed on defendant are disproportionate to his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Criminal History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   factor is an assessment of defendant's criminal history.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In light of the factors set out by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , the 25-year sentences imposed under ORS 137.690 are disproportionate under Article I, section 16, as applied to defendant. There are likely other circumstances where imposing such a sentence for multiple convictions for using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, a violation of ORS 163.670, would be constitutional. However, our conclusion applies to the particular combination of circumstances presented here: defendant, when he was 16, 17 and 18 years old, persuaded several girls who were between two to four years younger to take and send to him by cell phone nude self-portraits, and the record lacked evidence that defendant had any interactions with law enforcement or the criminal justice system\n   that would suggest that efforts at reform had failed. Defendant's conduct, although criminal and harmful, does not constitutionally warrant 25 years of imprisonment, which constitutes one of Oregon's most severe punishments for any crime.\n   In Case Nos.

I write separately, however, to discuss the history behind the statutes at issue in this case and how that history requires that we approach this case in a slightly different manner than previous proportionality challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As I will discuss, an examination of the historical evolution of the statutes at issue in this case evidences that the legislature has never set about, deliberately, to criminalize the behavior that underlies defendant's convictions under ORS 163.670. Further, the voters of Oregon were repeatedly assured that the 25-year penalty created by Measure 73, codified in ORS 137.690, would not be applied to sexting and that insinuations to the contrary were a \"phantom issue.\" What is more, the proponents of Measure 73 indicated that the imposition of such a penalty, to acts such as defendant's, would violate constitutional proportionality. Thus, as I explain below, this case presents the rare occurrence where the normal and entirely appropriate judicial hesitancy to wade into proportionality and supplant a presumed legislative judgment that a particular penalty is proportioned to an offense is nonexistent. Far from the norm, the voters who approved ORS 137.690 understood (wrongly or rightly) that the courts, through application of the proportionality clause of Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution, would operate as a safety valve, preventing the application of the sentencing statute to acts such as defendant's. Given that, I conclude that the imposition of a 25-year sentence for teenage sexting is constitutionally disproportionate. I, therefore, respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   I.

Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000489\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/128/515/\">\n    128 Or. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000489\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/128/515/\">\n    273 P. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1929) (\"The power to declare what punishment may be assessed against those convicted of crime is not a judicial, but a legislative, power, controlled only by the provisions of the Constitution.\"). However, Article I, section 16, which provides, in part, that \"all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense,\" imposes on the legislature the constitutional obligation to proportion the sentences it enacts. Thus, although the legislature sets criminal penalties, it cannot do so arbitrarily. Rather, Article I, section 16, requires that it consciously and deliberately engage in a proportioning-investing each legislatively enacted sentence with a rational basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   If the legislature fails in this constitutional obligation, either by (a) failing to engage in its obligation to proportion at the outset, or by (b) enacting a sentence beyond the limits of what Article I, section 16, permits, only then does a court step in. For it is the role of the courts to interpret, and give effect to, constitutional provisions. \"The requirement that we give effect to the words of an enactment is doubly applicable when the law in question is a constitutional [provision].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Northwest Natural Gas Co. v.

For this case, that includes two statutes. ORS 163.670, enacted by the legislature, creates the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. ORS 137.690, passed by the voters as part of Measure 73, imposes a mandatory 300-month sentence for \"[a]ny person who is convicted of a major felony sex crime, who has one (or more) previous conviction of a major felony crime.\" Among the offenses classified by that statute as a \"major felony\n   sex crime\" is using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. ORS 137.690(b). Because our ultimate aim is to assess proportionality by comparing the legislative purpose motivating the sentence to the circumstances of this defendant, before discussing legislative history it is helpful to first define the conduct at the heart of this defendant's prosecution under ORS 163.670 : sexting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Sexting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Merriam-Webster Dictionary added the word \"selfie\" to its print and online dictionaries in 2014, along with the words \"hashtag,\" \"unfriend,\" \"social networking,\" \"catfish,\" and \"big data.\" Peter Sokolowski, Editor-at-Large, for Merriam-Webster, characterized the new words of 2014 as showing \"the impact of online connectivity to our lives and livelihoods\" and \"the growing influence technology is having on human endeavor * * * * * [particularly,] illustrating how technology is being used to understand and motivate behavior.\" Press Release, Peter Sokolowski, Editor-at-Large,\n   Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary Updated for 2014 (May 19, 2014), http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1926343 (accessed Aug. 29, 2018).

To take a selfie is to document a fleeting moment of one's public, or private, life. Turning the lens on ourselves is not a novel concept, however, technology has created new categories, new opportunities, and new modes of self-expression, including the selfie. And not all selfies are created equal. Many researchers and teen magazine readers alike agree that there are vast subcategories of selfies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the selfie taker strikes a pose with an exaggerated lip pout, it is referred to as a \"duck face selfie.\" Also popular is when the selfie taker directs the lens towards their feet to show the viewers that the selfie taker is traveling or visiting an exotic locale; this selfie is sometimes referred to as a \"beach feet brag selfie.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is also the \"bathroom selfie,\" the \"bedroom selfie,\" the \"I eat, therefore I am selfie,\" and the \"gym selfie\"-all modes of self-portrait meant to show viewers where the selfie taker is or what the selfie taker is doing. Yet, selfies are also used to express self-portraiture in a quasi-autobiographical, quasi-self-publicity fashion according to researchers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Selfies of this nature include the \"abs selfie\" and the \"booty selfie.\" Needless to say, this is far\n   from an exhaustive list of the ever-evolving world of selfie subcategories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To take a selfie is to capture an image of one's self, and when the selfie taker sends or shares that image with someone else, it is an act of social engagement. \"[T]o send someone a sexually explicit message or image by cell phone\" is \"to engage in sexting\" or to send a \"sext.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster.com\n   </em>\n   , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sext (accessed Aug. 29, 2018). Taking selfies and sending those self-created images through sext is a new, radical form of social interaction and courting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Various research studies place the rates of sexting among teenagers and young adults from 15 percent up to over 30 percent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dake\n   <em>\n    et al\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Prevalence and Correlates of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sexting Behaviour in Adolescents\n   </em>\n   , 7 Am.

First, the picture is not typically taken by someone else, rather it is taken by the individual appearing in the image. It is self-created; aptly called a \"selfie.\" Second, the image generally does not come into the possession of another through nefarious acquisition or capture, but rather through receipt. A person is in receipt of a sexted message because the person depicted in the image voluntarily sent it, either upon their own initiative or in response to a noncoercive request, and intended it to be possessed by a specific person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    ORS 163.670\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Turning now to the first of the two statutes of interest in this case, ORS 163.670 describes the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"(1) A person commits the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct if the person employs, authorizes, permits, compels or induces a child to participate or engage in sexually explicit conduct for any person to observe or to record in a visual recording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \"(2) Using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct is a Class A felony.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The above is the most recent iteration of ORS 163.670 ; however, the prohibition against child pornography, or the crime of using a child in a sexually explicit display, was originally codified in 1985. The legislative history makes clear that the type of modern day conduct, quotidian and habitual among many young people-the act of taking a selfie and sexting it to someone else via cellular phone-was not then, nor in any subsequent revisiting of the law (in 1987, 1991, and 2011), contemplated by lawmakers in Oregon. While sexting now unquestionably falls under the wording of the statute, it is not by deliberate legislative design, but rather through the interplay of broad statutory language and social and technological evolution.

Some children are coerced into these activities at home by their own parents. Unless emancipated by court order (a rare event), children must legally remain at home until age 18. Thus, 16- and 17-year olds can constitute a 'captive population' unless and until abuse is detected and the child is removed from the home. Other children are abused at home in other ways, physical, sexual or emotional, and develop so little self-esteem that when at age 16 or 17 they leave home as runaways or are forced out as throwaways, they are very easily led to sell their bodies as a way to survive on the streets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   \"Arresting and punishing the persons who use or promote children in sexual performances is one method of reducing these activities and protecting these children.

Senate Bill 364 was introduced on May 13, 1987 by cosponsor Senator Jim Simmons during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary. Committee co-counsel Mark Kramer prepared a preliminary analysis of S.B. 364 and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \"Problem addressed.

Proponents of S.B. 364 complained that, according to Kramer, the 1985 law was too difficult to enforce and did not go far enough. Particularly, according to Senator Simmons' prepared materials, the \"of value\" requirement in the 1985 law prevented the prosecution of those people who shared or distributed child pornography to promote \"deviant beliefs\" without receiving anything in return for the materials. Assistant United States Attorney, Jim Collins, testified before the committee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   \"[JIM COLLINS]: The production of child pornography is the abuse of a child.

Bonnie Glover Griswold, a probation officer and member of the Oregon Child Protection Task Force-the entity that requested a second look at child pornography laws in Oregon-explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   \"These photographs are a history of an abuse and evidence of a crime. A picture of this nature cannot be taken without a child being sexually exploited. Offenders use these photographs repeatedly. They recall to the offender the abusive event. It feeds their deviant fantasies and their distorted thinking. This use becomes a further abuse of the victim. The photographs are the grossest example of the offender's thinking and his activity. The child victim is no longer a human being to the offender. They become objects to be used and abused by the offender. I have seen pictures of victims from the ages of a few months to late adolescence, boys as well as girls. The victims may be related to the offender or the victim may know the offender as a family acquaintance, friend, or neighbor. Whatever the circumstances, the offender is able to groom the victim and set up the situation where an offense takes place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   \"Over the past three years I have learned that sex offenders do use sexually explicit material in their offender cycle. Child molesters, especially those who are pedophiles, are very likely to keep photographic histories of the individual victims as well as the individual events of abuse to a victim. Their collection of material will also include commercially made magazines, newspapers and videos. They may also make their own material by combining sexually explicit material with pictures of their victims or pictures of children they know or have cut out of commercial publications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   \"With the passage of this bill, Oregonians will be better able to protect their children.

One of the arguments against this measure is that some of the material may have been produced in a country where sex abuse is legal. This argument is no more persuasive than it would be if a similar argument were asserted with respect to the importation of illegal narcotics that had been legally manufactured in another country. Allowing this material to circulate in the child pornography underground is tacit approval of the sexual exploitation of children. We cannot condone nor support this exploitation, no matter where it occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   \"The people in the criminal justice system that work with pedophiles have substantiated that sexually explicit child pornography is frequently a part of the offenders 'program of arousal.'

This 'program' is a usual precursor to child sexual assaults.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   \"I urge your support of S.B. 364 as a tool to break the horrible chain of child pornography.

These collections often include photos of their victims. Thus, prosecution for possession of child pornography has the dual advantages of sparing the youthful victims the trauma of reliving sexually abusive episodes during public trials and at the same time of focusing on the target group-typically promiscuous and predatory pedophiles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   \"The destructive impact of child sexual abuse is enormous. Victims carry with them a psychological trauma, which places them at tremendous disadvantages in the future.

It defined the crime in terms of simple possession and there was a legal debate about whether accessing child pornography on the internet was to possess it. The Supreme Court ruled that absent the decision to download it, print it, or purchase it, one did not possess child pornography simply by accessing it on the web, leaving Oregon, as far as we know, it's the only state in the country right now where viewing child pornography on the internet is not a crime. The bill would fix that loophole and has three safeguards to make sure that people who did not intentionally access this material are not somehow caught up, if somehow child pornography were downloaded by someone else, or by some kind of spyware on the computer.

Proponents explain that prosecutors would be reluctant to bring charges which would result in 25-year mandatory minimum sentences for 'sexting' by minors in light of the recent Oregon Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   . The Supreme Court found that the imposition of mandatory Measure 11 sentences were unconstitutional in some cases because the penalties were disproportionate to the underlying offenses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   II. APPLICATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The above legislative history reveals two things. First, the Oregon legislature has never identified sexting as a social ill that it set about to deliberately criminalize, or affix a penalty to. To be sure, that behavior unquestionably can fall under the wording of ORS 163.670, but it does so\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   through deliberate legislative choice, but through historical happenstance. ORS 163.670, a law repeatedly enacted to target child pornography perpetrated as abuse against children, now can be read to criminalize voluntary sexting among young people due to the evolution of technology and social norms, not purposeful legislative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Second, ORS 137.690, passed by the voters as part of Measure 73, was designed and marketed to the voting public as a measure targeting a small group of offenders described as \"the worst,\" \"predators,\" \"violent,\" \"serial rapists,\" and \"serial child pornographers.\" Proponents of the measure estimated it would affect a very small group, \"15 to 20, * * * a very small group of the worst sex offenders.\" It was never conceived of as targeting sexting among young people, an activity being engaged in by upwards of 25 percent of teenagers. When questioned about sexting, proponents of Measure 73 repeatedly called it a \"phantom issue\" or \"a rouse\" and insisted that the statute would not be used to punish teen sexting. Finally, when pushed, proponents of Measure 73 indicated that any use of the statute to penalize sexting with a 25-year sentence would force the courts to act, as the Oregon Supreme Court did in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , and declare such as sentence unconstitutionally disproportionate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The history behind ORS 163.670 and ORS 137.690 fundamentally affects this court's approach to a proportionality analysis. As the Oregon Supreme Court has instructed, when this court looks to \"whether the legislature's imposition of a particular penalty (or range of penalties) for an offense had a 'reasonable'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   or 'an arguably rational basis' (\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   ) or a 'rational basis' (\n   <em>\n    Isom\n   </em>\n   )\" this court is \"apply[ing] the\n   <em>\n    Sustar\n   </em>\n   test.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    343 Or. at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    175 P.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, this court \"look[s] to the legislative enactment of the particular penalties at issue as an external source of law to assist in determining\n   whether those penalties would shock the moral sense of reasonable people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 671,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687086\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/652/#p654\">\n    175 P.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   As discussed previously, the legislature can fail in its obligation under Article I, section 16, in two ways, either by (a) failing to engage in its obligation to proportion at the outset, or by (b) enacting a sentence beyond the limits of what Article I, section 16, permits. All of the proportionality cases from this court, as well as the Oregon Supreme Court, have dealt with the latter scenario. In each of those cases, there was a deliberate choice by the legislature or the voters and that choice was evaluated to see whether it went beyond that which was permitted by the constitution. But here, the legislature never engaged in the first step. There was never an attempt to criminalize the behavior, nor to proportion a penalty. When the legislature fails to engage in that essential predicate obligation, it falls to the courts to do so-and, in fact, that was expressly told to the voters. Thus, unlike previous cases in which this court has been appropriately highly cautious to supplant legislative sentencing determinations, here, the court has been\n   <em>\n    invited in\n   </em>\n   . When the proponents of a sentencing statute conceive of constitutional disproportionality as a quasi-safety valve against a sentencing statute's application in certain factual circumstances, the usual, and entirely appropriate, judicial reticence to declare a sentence disproportionate as-applied in those circumstances is at its nadir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Against that backdrop, we then apply the traditional\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   factors. Here, the severity of the penalty is great, one of the harshest in Oregon. In contrast, the gravity of the crime must be viewed, in light of the legislative history, as low. While certainly there may be serious social ills from sexting, the legislature's failure to take up that issue directly counsels against concluding that the gravity matches the child pornography concerns that motivated the passage of ORS 163.670, or any of its subsequent iterations. As the Oregon Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   , when the statutory definition of an offense describes a broad swath of actual conduct, that may be an indication that the application of the statute to a particular defendant's conduct will result in a disproportionate sentence under\n   Article I, section 16.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen a defendant is convicted for engaging in only more minor conduct encompassed within the statute, the defendant may plausibly argue that the mandatory sentence, as applied to the particular facts of his or her case, is unconstitutionally disproportionate.\"). That is especially true when what brings defendant's acts under the ambit of the statute is historical evolution, not legislative purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Similarly, in comparing the penalty here against that which would be imposed for related crimes, we see incongruity. Here, the voluntary sexting of a sexual image among teenagers is punished more harshly than the actual physical sexual contact. In this case, for example, defendant received a greater sentence for having a picture of a breast voluntarily sent to him than if he had physically touched the breast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   If we look to the other crimes set out in ORS 137.690, only three other offenses-rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree, and unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree-are subject to the same mandatory 25-year sentence as defendant's possession of a consensually taken and voluntarily transmitted photograph. Each of those other offenses requires physical contact with the victim and each is the most serious (first) degree of that particular offense. Conduct satisfying the elements of those other offenses typically involves the use of force or a victim who is exceptionally vulnerable due to age, relation to the defendant, or a disability of some sort.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ORS 163.375 (defining rape in the first degree).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Most telling of all, however, is when we consider the one time the legislature\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   enact a bill penalizing activity similar to sexting. In 2013, Representative Jason Conger introduced House Bill 3015, which targeted the dissemination of sexted images without\n   the image creator's consent. That bill did not receive a hearing, but the core idea found its way into House Bill 3194. That bill, among many other things, modified the harassment statute to create a subsection related to the dissemination of images:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   \"(1) A person commits the crime of harassment if the person intentionally:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   \"(a) Harasses or annoys another person by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   \"(C) Distributing a visual recording * * * of the other person engaged in sexually explicit conduct, * * * or in a state of nudity, * * * when the other person is under 18 years of age at the time of the recording.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   ORS 166.065(1)(a)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   That statute does not speak directly to the activity present in this case-requesting a sexted image be sent, then subsequently being in receipt of an image voluntarily sent by the person depicted in the image. Rather, that statute speaks to the potential further distribution of an image-the forwarding of a sexted image to another. And that activity, arguably more egregious, is classified as a Class A misdemeanor. ORS 166.065(4)(b). Thus, the defendant in this case was subject to 25 years in prison for\n   <em>\n    requesting\n   </em>\n   a sexted image and being in\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   of a voluntarily sent image. Yet, if he had then\n   <em>\n    distributed\n   </em>\n   that image to others, he would have been subject to no more than a year in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Finally, we look to the defendant's criminal history. And here, even if we view ORS 137.690 as a recidivist sentencing scheme, thus requiring that we look to the entirety of defendant's other conduct, including other charges and even uncharged conduct, we cannot find the imposition of the sentence in this case proportionate. While defendant perpetrated a number of serious crimes against multiple victims,\n   <em>\n    none of his other conduct falls under ORS 137.690\n   </em>\n   . A 25-year sentence for sexting-an act that the voters did not intend to be subject to that punishment-cannot be boot-strapped into proportionality by justifying it on the backs of other crimes that Measure 73 and the voters expressly\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   think was deserving of that enhanced sentence. In short, none of defendant's other abusive conduct-repeated and heinous as it was-is the type of conduct that any legislative body has purposefully sought to punish with a 25-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   For those reasons, I conclude that the imposition of multiple 25-year sentences, pursuant to ORS 137.690, for defendant's convictions under ORS 163.670 for sexting would\n   shock the conscience of reasonable people and are therefore disproportionate and in violation of Article I, section 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Egan, C. J., DeVore, J., Lagesen, J., DeHoog, J., and Aoyagi, J., join the concurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   The majority views this as a case about \"sexting\" and concludes that a 300-month sentence for that offense is unconstitutional. I have sympathy for the view that a sentence of that length is disproportionate for the offense of sexting as the majority and concurring opinions describe it, viewing such conduct in isolation. The problem is that, in this case, viewing the conduct in isolation is exactly what we are not allowed to do. I write separately not because I believe that the 300-month sentence in this case is appropriate (my views in that regard are irrelevant), but because I believe the majority has misapplied the Oregon Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   My disagreement with the majority concerns the role that defendant's\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   criminal conduct plays in the proportionality analysis under Article I, section 16. That conduct included, apart from sexting, numerous physical sex offenses that Oregon's policymakers (including, via the initiative process, the voters) have deemed very serious. In fact, defendant committed so many offenses against so many victims that the trial court (as defendant conceded below) could have imposed a sentence longer than 300 months without even applying a mandatory sentence for sexting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   As it happened, the trial court did impose a 300-month sentence as required for defendant's multiple sexting offenses, and then imposed all of defendant's other sentences concurrently with it. Because the 300-month sentence was triggered by the sexting offenses, the majority limits its\n   proportionality analysis to whether sexting\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   can justify such a sentence. But the trial court made it clear that it was imposing that sentence as punishment for all of defendant's conduct. And, in this as-applied challenge, that is how\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   must view defendant's sentence-as punishment not only for sexting, but for his other far more serious conduct, which included penetrative sexual acts with girls as young as 12 and 13. When one accounts for that conduct, as the Supreme Court requires us to, I conclude that defendant's 300-month sentence is not unconstitutional as applied to him, even if the same sentence might be unconstitutional in other circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   I begin with certain facts that are peripheral to the majority's analysis but that are essential to mine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Defendant was convicted of 18 counts based on his crimes against eight different victims ranging in age from 12 to 16. The crimes occurred during a span of more than two years, but 14\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the crimes occurred when defendant was 18. The crimes included one count of first-degree sexual abuse against 13-year-old CB when defendant was 17; one count of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration against 12-year-old JB when defendant was 16; a second count of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration against JB when she was 13 and defendant was 18; one count each of third-degree rape and third-degree sodomy (one month apart) against 14-year-old BB when defendant was 18; one count of fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence against 16-year-old PG when defendant was 18; and one count of second-degree encouraging child sexual abuse against 16-year-old PG when defendant was 18. In addition to those seven counts, defendant was convicted of 11 counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, which he committed with each victim except JB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Under Ballot Measure 11, ORS 137.700, defendant was subject to mandatory minimum sentences of 75 months for the count of first-degree sexual abuse against CB and 75 months for each of the two counts of unlawful sexual penetration against JB. Under the sentencing guidelines that\n   apply to his remaining offenses, defendant was also subject to sentences of up to 30 months each for the counts of third-degree rape and third-degree sodomy against BB; 30 months for the count of felony fourth-degree assault against PG; and 16 months for the count of second-degree encouraging sexual abuse against PG. The two convictions as to JB and the two convictions as to PG arose from four distinct criminal episodes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   For his first count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 70 months under Ballot Measure 11. For his second through eleventh counts of that same crime, defendant was subject to mandatory sentences of 300 months as a repeat offender under Ballot Measure 73, ORS 137.690. In his sentencing memorandum, defendant argued that both a 70-month sentence and the 300-month sentence would be disproportionately long for sexting, \"given the nature of the offense and [defendant's] personal circumstances.\" Defendant's main argument was that, compared to other conduct encompassed by the offense of using a child in a display of explicit conduct-such as depictions of young children engaged in sex with adults-defendant's conduct was much less harmful. Defendant also cited his immaturity at the time of his crimes. Defendant acknowledged to the trial court, however, that, even if the court departed downward\n   from either the Measure 11 or the Measure 73 mandatory sentences, \"there is so much time here that you could get back up to 300 months plus without using\" either of those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   The state argued that the mandatory sentences were proportional for several reasons: (1) the evidence supported a finding that defendant collected explicit images from the victims in order to \"groom\" them for sexual contact; (2) his child-display convictions involved numerous victims; and (3) in addition to sexting, defendant was convicted of \"hands on sex offenses\" against those victims. The state also pointed out that defendant had been warned by the police about his conduct (as a result of the report by CB's mother) but continued to engage in criminal sexual activity with young girls. The state requested a total aggregate sentence of 300 months; in doing so, the state observed that a much\n   longer sentence was possible if the trial court chose to sentence defendant consecutively for his various crimes against each of the eight victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the court chose to impose a 300-month sentence and explained its reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   \"The legal arguments I, frankly, am going to leave a lot of those legal arguments up to a higher court to determine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   \"I will say this: As far as the particular facts of this case, what strikes [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], [defendant], is the fact that the eight victims that you victimized were\n   <em>\n    particularly vulnerable\n   </em>\n   in this instance, they were young, obviously and they were so desperate for your attention, approval, and love.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   \"And that is the reason that you chose them. That is the reason why,\n   <em>\n    by your own words, you played them\n   </em>\n   .

And they were, in fact, vulnerable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-308\">\n   \"I remember very distinctly each and every one of them when they testified and how they testified, even [PG], and how she reacted to having to be in this position as a witness, but some of the others too.

I am sympathetic to who you are at this particular point in your life, your family's particular situation, and where you have put them. And I know you will regret it now and every single day going forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    But this was not one specific incident. This was not two incidents of a selfie * * *.

First, the state argued that defendant's sexting was a way of \"grooming\" the victims of his multiple \"hands on\" sex offenses, and the trial court clearly agreed that the sexting was part and parcel of a larger pattern of serious criminal activity. Second, although defendant argued that a 300-month sentence for his\n   <em>\n    sexting\n   </em>\n   offenses was disproportionate, defendant also conceded that the court could disregard that mandatory sentence and still get \"back up to 300 months plus\" in light of the other counts and the mandatory sentences that they carried. Notably, defendant did not argue that a sentence of \"300 months plus\" calculated\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   way would be unconstitutional. Defendant has never made that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   The heart of the proportionality inquiry under Article I, section 16, is \"whether the length of the sentence would shock the moral sense of reasonable people.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The \"gravity of the offense,\" for purposes of the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/ Buck\n   </em>\n   factor, must be assessed in the context of the defendant's overall criminal conduct. That is why the court in\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   essentially considered the gravity of the offense (first factor) and the defendant's criminal history (third factor) as one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Therefore, in this as-applied challenge to the length of defendant's sentence, we must take into account not only the specific facts underlying the sexting offenses, but other relevant context, including the other criminal activity\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for which defendant was prosecuted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   When we do, we see that defendant conjoined his sexting conduct with multiple sex offenses that society has deemed serious enough to warrant mandatory sentences of as long as 75 months. As noted, defendant was subject to mandatory minimum sentences of 75 months for first-degree sexual abuse; 75 months each for two counts of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration; 25 months each for one count of third-degree rape and third-degree sodomy; 25 months for one count of fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence; and 15 months for one count of second-degree encouraging child sexual abuse. Furthermore, because those counts involved distinct criminal episodes and multiple victims, the trial court was entitled to impose those sentences consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   In other words, without even considering the sexting offenses, defendant was exposed to a total possible sentence in excess of 300 months, simply because of the number of other offenses and victims. Defendant conceded as much, and he has never asserted that such an aggregate sentence-if imposed for his crimes other than sexting-would have been unconstitutional. (Nor has the majority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) But, if defendant could constitutionally have been sentenced to greater than 300 months without even accounting for his sexting offenses, then it follows that a sentence of 300 months\n   <em>\n    is not unconstitutional as applied to defendant\n   </em>\n   . The result can hardly\n   be different if one adds the sexting offenses back into the equation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Although the majority acknowledges the seriousness of defendant's other conduct, the majority ultimately omits it\n   from the proportionality analysis. Instead of asking whether a 300-month sentence is disproportionate for a person who committed sexting\n   <em>\n    and the other crimes that defendant committed\n   </em>\n   , the majority narrows the inquiry to whether a 300-month sentence can be imposed for sexting. Thus, in applying the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   factor (gravity of the offense), the majority defines the \"offense\" strictly as defendant's repeated violations of ORS 163.670 -contrary to\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   's direction that the gravity of the offense must be considered in light of related criminal conduct. Having so defined it, the majority then concludes that defendant's conduct was relatively minor compared to other conduct encompassed by that statute and compared to other \"felony sex crimes\" under ORS 137.690. 293 Or. App. at 638-39, 430 P.3d at 114-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   The majority makes two main points in defense of its result. Neither is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   First, the majority goes to great lengths to distinguish Ballot Measure 73 from a true \"recidivist\" statute as was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Althouse.\n   </em>\n   293 Or. App. at 621-26, 430 P.3d at 105-08. According to the majority, the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   \"depends on the principle that the legislature is entitled to provide enhanced sentences when a defendant has been proven highly resistant to reform because the person has reoffended after the state has previously punished him or her.\" 293 Or. App. at 625-26, 430 P.3d at 107-08. As an initial matter, neither\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   nor the court's other decisions have ever said that an offender must be a \"recidivist\" in that specific sense in order for his or her criminal history to be relevant. In fact, the court has repeatedly said that relevant context includes\n   <em>\n    uncharged\n   </em>\n   misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    347 Or. at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/#p58\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court should consider \"evidence of multiple instances of uncharged wrongful conduct\");\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   , 359 Or. at 679,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166097\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/668/\">\n    375 P.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"defendant has raised an as-applied challenge to his sentence, which requires consideration not only of his past convictions but also of his past instances of relevant uncharged misconduct\"). Uncharged conduct, by definition, results in no conviction or attempted rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   More fundamentally, the majority's effort to distinguish Ballot Measure 73 from other \"recidivist\" statutes is simply beside the point, because the majority's analysis is\n   aimed entirely at demonstrating why a 300-month sentence cannot be justified\n   <em>\n    for sexting\n   </em>\n   . As already discussed, that is not the question raised by this as-applied challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   That brings us to the majority's second reason for excluding defendant's other serious sex offenses from the proportionality analysis. According to the majority, it is wrong to review defendant's 300-month sentence as the \"package\" sentence for all of defendant's 18 counts of conviction, even though that is how the trial court saw it. Instead, the majority reads the Supreme Court's cases as compelling us to consider\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the specific offense for which that sentence was imposed. 293 Or. App. at 625, 430 P.3d at 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   The majority cites no language requiring that approach. To be sure, both\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   dealt with sentences that were imposed for a single count of conviction.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez/Buck\n   </em>\n   involved defendants with no criminal histories who committed single, isolated instances of conduct that ranked at the low end of the spectrum of severity encompassed by the defined statutory crimes. Thus, the question in that case was whether a particular sentence was disproportionate for a defendant who committed the underlying crime of conviction and no other offense. In\n   <em>\n    Althouse\n   </em>\n   , the question was whether a particular sentence was disproportionate for a defendant who committed the underlying crime of conviction and who also had past convictions for that and other offenses. In neither case did the Supreme Court have reason to address whether other crimes sentenced in the\n   <em>\n    same proceeding\n   </em>\n   should inform the proportionality analysis. From that fact, the majority apparently concludes that crimes sentenced in the same proceeding\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   inform the proportionality analysis. But that does not logically follow\n   from anything that the Supreme Court has said, and it runs contrary to the court's repeated admonitions that, in an as-applied challenge, we must take full account of a defendant's related criminal activity-even uncharged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Ultimately, the flaw in the majority's reasoning is demonstrated by the fact that nothing will prevent the trial court, on remand, from achieving the same 300-month aggregate sentence by imposing consecutive sentences on\n   the counts other than sexting. Thus, defendant's victory today may be fleeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That mere possibility illustrates the problem with the majority's view. For if Article I, section 16, is meant to account for the moral conscience of the community to ensure that excessive punishments are not imposed, then it is strange to regard a 300-month sentence as permissible if computed as \"30 times ten\" or \"50 times six,\" yet morally shocking if computed as \"300 plus zero.\" Reasonable members of the community would weigh proportionality by considering the length of the total sentence in light of defendant's overall conduct and the number of victims, not by scrutinizing the math.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   The majority's decision today may or may not result in a shorter sentence for defendant. If the court determines that a shorter aggregate sentence is appropriate, that may represent a sound exercise of judicial discretion on the facts of this case. My purpose in writing separately is to emphasize that the trial court did not violate the Oregon Constitution in imposing the sentence required by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Armstrong, J., Hadlock, J., Tookey, J., Shorr, J., and Powers, J., join in the dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-381\">\n    Article I, section 16, equally applies to the voters when they enact sentencing laws through the initiative process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-382\">\n    This is not to be confused with legislative\n    <em>\n     intent\n    </em>\n    as that term might more commonly be used in statutory construction.

Reasonable people consider context. A criminal act that appears one way in a vacuum may take on an entirely different character if it occurs as part of a larger course of conduct. Consider, on one hand, an 18-year-old who engages in innocuous and playful \"sexting\" with a 17-year-old romantic partner, and, on the other hand, an 18-year-old who uses sexting as a grooming tool with girls four or five years younger than him, with whom he then has sex. For their \"sexting,\" both individuals have committed exactly the same statutory offense of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. But they have\n    <em>\n     done\n    </em>\n    very different things. Thus, the concurring opinion's effort to define an abstract concept called \"sexting,\" an activity in which many teenagers engage, is misguided. Even assuming that the concurrence's information is basically accurate, the most we learn is that many teenagers engage in sexting. That tells us nothing about how many 18-year-olds use sexting in the course of committing more serious sex offenses against young children.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-391\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. at 621, 430 P.3d at 105. To be clear, the record, in my view, does not permit any strong inference about what the trial court would have done if it had not been bound by the 300-month sentence under ORS 137.690. And we cannot know what will happen on remand. Neither question is pertinent to the constitutional inquiry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
