Its case title, cause number, and disposition shall be included in this Court's quarterly list of noncitable cases published in the Pacific Reporter and Montana Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Aaron Larson (Aaron) appeals from the May 9, 2018 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Respondent's Motion to Lift Restraining Order (May 2018 Order) of the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Aaron and Marla were previously married and then divorced. Aaron is the subject of a Permanent Order of Protection entered March 24, 2006, that prevents any contact with Marla. Aaron moved the court to lift this restraining order. Following hearing on October 19, 2017, the District Court entered its May 2018 Order denying Aaron's Motion to Lift Restraining Order. Aaron appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure require the appellant to present a concise, cohesive argument which \"contains the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on.\"\n   <em>\n    In re McMahon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"264438\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/311/175/\">\n    2002 MT 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"264438\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/311/175/\">\n    311 Mont. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"264438\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/311/175/\">\n    53 P.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting M.

Aaron has failed to present us with any cogent or articulable argument upon which we could find fault with the District Court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Notwithstanding Aaron's failure to present an argument and the general inadvisability of a permanent order of protection,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we have reviewed the District Court's May 2018 Order and find no reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 We have determined to decide this case pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 3(c) of our Internal Operating Rules, which provides for memorandum opinions.

After litigants finalize their divorce and are no longer dealing with the issues between them, their contentiousness usually decreases significantly and they typically move on with their lives independently without need for a permanent restraining order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
