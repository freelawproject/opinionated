We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Schulz worked for JTL Group, Inc. (known as \"Knife-River\") in various capacities for twenty-nine years. In 2016, Schulz was working as a Project Superintendent. Schulz reported directly to Project Manager Eric Van Hemelryck, and Van Hemelryck reported directly to General Manager J. Halvor Fuglevand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On March 21, 2016, Schulz and two other Knife-River employees were working on a job near Lodge Grass, when Schulz discovered that fuel was siphoned from company equipment left on the job site. On March 23, 2016, Schulz arrived on the job site to find wet and muddy conditions due to recent rain and snow. Schulz and another employee got their vehicles stuck, and Schulz stated he \"needed to get his pickup unstuck with the [company] bulldozer.\" Schulz shut down the job site because of the poor conditions. Schulz and the other employee then noticed some of the heavy equipment had again been vandalized: padlocks and battery cables had been cut and fuel and batteries were stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Schulz traveled about a mile from the job site, where there was cellular service, and called Van Hemelryck to report the vandalism. Van Hemelryck instructed Schulz to: (1) report the vandalism to the Big Horn County Sheriff's Department; (2) take photographs of the damaged equipment; and (3) contact a private landowner to make arrangements to store the heavy equipment on the landowner's property adjacent to the job site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schulz called the landowner, who lived roughly a half-mile up the road, but was unable to reach him. At 8:31 a.m., Schulz called the Big Horn County Sheriff's Department to report the vandalism. Schulz arranged to meet Deputy Mike Colvin at a specific mile marker along the road. While waiting at the designated mile marker, Schulz \"did the incident report ... and took some pictures....\" Schulz claimed he did not travel the half-mile to the landowner's property to attempt to make arrangements because he did not want to miss Deputy Colvin's arrival. It is unclear whether the other employee was still present at the job site, but Schulz did not send any employees to make arrangements with the landowner. At 10:55 a.m., Deputy Colvin arrived. While Schulz conversed with Deputy Colvin, the landowner drove by the job site and stopped to speak briefly with Schulz. Schulz stated that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I told [the landowner] that I needed to get with him to try and make an arrangement to maybe put equipment on his land, but he had to get to town, and I had to get with the sheriff to do that report, so I never actually got to really meet with [the landowner] on that subject.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At 11:11 a.m., Schulz concluded his report with Deputy Colvin. Schulz then returned to Billings, arriving around 1:00 p.m. Schulz reported to Knife-River's West End shop and delivered the photographs of the damaged equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Around 3:30 p.m., Schulz went to Knife-River's administrative offices, also located in Billings. There, Fuglevand and Van Hemelryck questioned Schulz about whether he had secured the heavy equipment. Schulz stated that he had not, and he suggested hiring a night watchman to guard the equipment. Fuglevand and Van Hemelryck rejected that suggestion and instructed Schulz to return to the job site to make an agreement with the landowner and to move the equipment onto the private property. Schulz objected, arguing the ground was \"slop\" and not suitable for moving heavy equipment. Fuglevand disagreed, and stated that it would not be a problem to move \"tracked and all-wheel-drive construction equipment over muddy ground....\" Fuglevand again instructed Schulz to return to the job site and secure the equipment. Schulz responded, \"I can't do that.\" Following this refusal, Fuglevand told Schulz, \"[y]ou're done then.\" Schulz demanded a termination slip, which Fuglevand provided to him. The termination slip stated that Schulz was terminated because he had refused to perform his duty to secure company equipment. That evening, Van Hemelryck went to the job site. Van Hemelryck made a verbal agreement with the landowner that Knife-River would blade the landowner's road in exchange for allowing Knife-River to move the equipment onto the landowner's property. Van Hemelryck and another employee then moved the heavy equipment to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On February 15, 2017, Schulz filed a wrongful discharge suit against Knife-River, alleging Knife-River lacked good cause to terminate his employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 29, 2017, Knife-River moved for summary judgment. On February 14, 2018, the District Court granted Knife-River's Motion. Schulz appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 This Court reviews de novo a district court's grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ.

The District Court determined Knife-River had good cause to terminate Schulz from his employment because he admitted to understanding the instructions of his superiors and failed to carry them out, in violation of employment policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Schulz argues genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Knife-River's directive was reasonable under the circumstances and whether there was the requisite good cause necessary under the WDEA when Knife-River terminated Schulz's employment on March 23, 2016. Thus, Schulz contends the District Court erred in entering summary judgment in Knife-River's favor and in not allowing this matter to proceed to a jury trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 In depositions, Schulz acknowledged that it was reasonable for his supervisors to expect that he would follow instructions, just as it was reasonable for him to expect his supervisees would follow his instructions. Schulz also acknowledged it was reasonable for Knife-River to assign Schulz, as Project Superintendent, the responsibility of protecting Knife-River's equipment. Schulz offers no evidence to contradict Knife-River's claim that Schulz failed to follow his superior's directive to secure company equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 Disobeying an employer directive is not always good cause for termination. Employers are still constrained by the reasonableness of their directives, which must be based on job-related grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 39-2-903(5), MCA. However, in this case, Knife-River's actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mysse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388061\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/253/#p262\">\n    279 Mont. at 262-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388061\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/253/#p262\">\n    926 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   770-71 ;\n   <em>\n    see also Becker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.
