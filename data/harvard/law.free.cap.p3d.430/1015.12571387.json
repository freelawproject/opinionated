Its case title, cause number, and disposition shall be included in this Court's quarterly list of noncitable cases published in the Pacific Reporter and Montana Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Ober E. Spear appeals the Order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, dismissing his appeal of a Billings Municipal Court Judgment finding him guilty of failure to yield the right-of-way at a yield sign, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-342, MCA. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 6, 2016, Spear was cited by the City of Billings (City) for failure to yield the right-of-way at a yield sign. This citation followed a traffic accident involving Spear's car and a motorcycle. On July 1, 2016, following a bench trial, the Municipal Court issued a Judgment finding that the City proved Spear committed the failure-to-yield violation. Spear was ordered to pay a $110 fine and a $10 witness fee. On December 1, 2017, Spear appealed to the District Court, raising three issues: (1) whether the police investigator properly investigated the accident; (2) whether the Municipal Court abused its discretion by not giving him sufficient time at the hearing; and (3) whether the Municipal Court correctly found that there was sufficient evidence to prove the failure-to-yield violation. On February 14, 2018, the District Court dismissed Spear's appeal, concluding that no legal basis existed to support it. Spear, appearing pro se, appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 When a case is appealed from a municipal court to the district court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court, and we review the district court's decision as if the appeal was originally filed in this Court.\n   <em>\n    City of Helena v.

The State argues that Spear waived these issues on appeal by failing to raise them in his initial appeal before the District Court.

In his appeal before this Court, Spear argues that the District Court erred by affirming his violation because the City did not provide testimony from the motorcyclist with whom Spear collided. Though not precisely the same issue, even if we considered the merits of Spear's argument before this Court as a sufficiency of evidence claim, the City presented testimony from the officer who investigated the accident and testimony from an eyewitness to the accident. Thus, even without testimony from the motorcyclist with whom Spear collided, there was sufficient evidence to convict him of failure to yield.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
