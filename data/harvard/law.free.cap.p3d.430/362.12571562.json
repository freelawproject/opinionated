Today we hold, as a matter of law, that environmental damage to public land with religious, cultural, or emotional significance to the plaintiff is not special injury for public nuisance purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The use of reclaimed wastewater for snowmaking on northern Arizona's San Francisco Peaks has been extensively debated and litigated. This case is the latest chapter of that dispute. Over sixteen years ago, the City of Flagstaff contracted to sell reclaimed wastewater to Arizona Snowbowl Resort Limited Partnership (\"Snowbowl\") for artificial snowmaking at its ski area on the Peaks. Because the Peaks are located on federal land, this prompted the United States Forest Service to conduct a lengthy environmental impact inquiry, culminating in that agency's approval. Thereafter, various tribes (including the Hopi Tribe), environmental groups, and other interested parties unsuccessfully challenged the proposed snowmaking under several federal laws, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") of 1993, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb to 2000bb-4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v.

No agreement was reached, however, and the Tribe persistently alleged that no proposed administrative actions \"could mitigate the adverse effects of using reclaimed wastewater for artificial snowmaking at the Snowbowl.\" The City also held public hearings on the matter, at which the Tribe and other interested parties voiced their opposition to the use of reclaimed wastewater on the Peaks. In 2010, the City ultimately voted to proceed with the reclaimed water contract and, after more public comment, denied a motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The Hopi Tribe then filed this action in 2011 against the City on various state law grounds, alleging among other things that the City's \"sale of reclaimed wastewater to make artificial snow\" is a public nuisance that \"will result in unreasonable harm to the environment and the Hopi Tribe.\" As described in the Tribe's complaint, \"[r]eclaimed wastewater is water that has been used and circulated through the City's municipal water sewer system, has passed through a treatment facility, and meets certain standards.\" The Tribe further alleged it \"has special interests in the environment, including the flora and fauna, of the San Francisco Peaks in the immediate vicinity of the Snowbowl Resort Area.\" The Tribe also claimed it \"will suffer specific injury\" from the \"runoff, windblown snow, increased unnatural noise, and elevated air pollution [that] will pervade beyond the Snowbowl Resort Area\" and into areas the Tribe uses \"for ceremonial practices, hunting[,] ... the gathering of natural resources[,] ... and utilitarian purposes.\" For example, \"[n]atural resources that the Hopi collect, as well as shrines, sacred areas, and springs on the Peaks will come into contact with the blown reclaimed wastewater,\" \"negatively impact[ing]\" the Tribe's use of the wilderness and surrounding areas. More broadly, the Tribe alleged that \"the Snowbowl expansion project,\" \"additional traffic,\" and the very \"presence of the Snowbowl Resort\" itself will adversely impact the \"natural environment\" and unduly interfere with the Tribe's cultural use of the public wilderness for religious and ceremonial purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The City filed a third-party indemnification claim against Snowbowl, which then moved to dismiss the Tribe's public nuisance claim under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing the Tribe's alleged damages do not constitute the \"special harm\" needed to maintain that claim. The City later joined in that motion, and the trial court granted it, ruling that the Tribe \"failed to satisfy the [special injury] requirement on the basis of ... religious or cultural practices.\" (In its ruling, entered in August 2016, the trial court noted the uncontested fact that \"Snowbowl has used the reclaimed water since 2012.\") The court also granted Snowbowl and the City's request for attorney fees under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The court of appeals reversed, concluding that \"the Tribe has alleged a special injury sufficient to survive the motion to dismiss\" because \"interference with a place of special importance can cause special injury to those personally affected, even when that place of special importance is upon public land.\"\n   <em>\n    Hopi Tribe v.

In reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Zubia v. Shapiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20412\">\n    243 Ariz. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.3d%201248\">\n    408 P.3d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b641 As to the public nuisance, the material factual allegations can be summarized as follows. Due to an ongoing expansion effort, Snowbowl wants to create artificial snow to accommodate an uptick in skiers. To produce this artificial snow, Snowbowl seeks to use reclaimed wastewater. The term is self-explanatory: water that has been through the municipal sewer system is put to a second use. Water coming from the sewer system carries what one would normally expect in a sewer, as well as myriad components including pharmaceuticals, legal and illicit drugs, veterinary drugs, hormones, and insecticides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b642 When the wastewater reaches the water treatment center, it is subjected to only limited treatment. Some contaminants are removed, but not all, and the process is not designed to remove all contaminants. The water is then discharged from the plant and put to its destined use-here, the creation of snow. The reclaimed wastewater is non-potable (that is, the water is unfit for consumption).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b643 The reclaimed wastewater is treated at the Rio de Flag Treatment Plant. Studies of reclaimed water from this plant found chemicals that interfere with the basic biology of wildlife. The wastewater also has elevated nitrogen levels, which contributes to the growth of invasive plant life, possibly choking out native flora, impairing soil fauna, and otherwise affecting the ecosystem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b644 Snowbowl will use this water to create snow for skiers. Winds will blow this snow over swaths of land and, come the spring melt, the various compounds in the wastewater will percolate into the soil of the San Francisco Peaks. This allegedly endangers several species already facing extinction and mars an ecosystem unique in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b645 That is the harm allegedly suffered by the general public-the baseline against which the Hopi's harm is measured. The majority finds that the Hopi have failed to articulate any harm beyond that suffered by the general public-the harm suffered by the Hopi is qualitatively no different than that experienced by a weekend hiker or concerned environmentalist. The majority fails to appreciate that the wastewater will affect the Hopi's use and enjoyment of ancestral lands that have played a central role in Hopi\n   culture and religion since before the Coconino National Forest was of concern to the broader public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b646 The Hopi refer to the San Francisco Peaks as Nuvatukya'ovi and hold them out as the single most sacred place in Hopi culture. They are so central to Hopi religious beliefs that they mark a cardinal direction in the Hopi universe. Each month, members of the Tribe go to the Peaks to pray, and during some months, members collect water, herbs, and greens for ceremonial use. These pilgrimages play an essential role in Hopi life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b647 The U.S. Forest Service has recognized the Peaks as a Traditional Cultural Property and determined they are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. In making this determination, the Forest Service recognized that the Peaks contain shrines and other ceremonial locations, provide plant and animal resources necessary for ceremonial use, and contain places related to the legends of the very origin of the Hopi. Further, the Forest Service is required to provide access to National Forest System lands to the Hopi for traditional and cultural purposes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203054\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 3054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and upon request from the Hopi, the Secretary of Agriculture may close to public access specifically identified Forest Service land to \"protect the privacy of tribal activities for traditional and cultural purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203054\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 3054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). This is a special, distinct, tangible status recognized by federal law and is not shared by the general public. This point is not answered by observing,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25, that the Hopi are not denied access to the Peaks. Their rights of access recognize but do not define the Hopi's particular interests, rooted in Hopi tradition and culture. Additionally, whether Congress has recognized a private cause of action or judicially enforceable rights in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, is not relevant, as those issues are distinct from whether the Hopi have alleged a special injury for the purposes of a state public nuisance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b648 Before Snowbowl came into existence, the Hopi frequently traveled to and through the area. Now, what the Hopi consider a spiritual birthplace is at the base of ski slopes. Snowbowl seeks to introduce snow created from reclaimed wastewater into this environment. Moreover, prevailing winds will blow the snow well beyond the boundaries of Snowbowl, covering sacred land, shrines, springs, and other natural resources with the reclaimed wastewater, including its traces of drugs, nitrogen, and other components. This allegedly will destroy the purity of objects used by the Hopi for their traditional ceremonial practices. In the spring melt, sacred springs will be tainted with the melting wastewater, turning formerly pure ceremonial locations into a secondary sewer. Moreover, the myriad chemicals in the water will wreak unknown damage on the local ecosystem, further degrading traditional and sacred Hopi resources and locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b649 In sum, the Hopi face the destruction and desecration of some of their most sacred locations and practices. This is the harm that the majority claims is no different than that suffered by the public at large.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. But the general public does not have millennia of religious practice in the area that will be covered in a fine film of reclaimed sewage. Nor does the general public have rights of access and use-rooted in Hopi tradition and cultural practices-recognized by federal statutes. The interference with the Hopi's access to and use of the San Francisco Peaks, as well as surrounding lands affected by windblown or melting snow, is an injury different in kind from that suffered by the public generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b650 In disregarding the Hopi's claims, the majority creates a new rule, without precedent in our jurisprudence.

All that is required, and easily met by the Hopi here, is distinct and tangible harm.

Although the Restatement remarks on the difficulty of line drawing in the public nuisance context, Restatement \u00a7 821C cmt. b., it does not include the limitation on actions the majority announces today. The majority also misapprehends the significance of comment c to Restatement \u00a7 821C, which observes that a plaintiff \"who traverses a road a dozen times a day ... nearly always has some special reason to do so, and that reason will almost invariably be based on some special interest of [their] own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8826197\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/12/190/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. c.

What the Hopi actually argue, however, is that their frequent use is indicative of their special interest-which comports with comment c. That is, that the Hopi so often visit and traverse the San Francisco Peaks is evidence of how strong their connection to the area is, and how deeply they are injured by Snowbowl's use of reclaimed water. That others may also have interests that are harmed by the use of the wastewater does not imply that the Hopi's interest is no different in kind from that suffered by the general public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

The Hopi allegedly will face compounded harm, as their sacred sites, springs, and rituals will be tainted by sewer snow, destroying their religious and cultural use and forcing the Hopi to relocate their practices beyond their traditional homes yet again. The majority observes that the Hopi have challenged Snowbowl's actions in multiple litigation over many years, but that fact does not suggest that their claims here fail, as a matter of law, to state a claim for relief. The Hopi may not be able to prove that the use of the wastewater constitutes a nuisance\n   or that they have suffered the particular injuries alleged; prior litigation may also have some issue preclusive effect here. Thus, holding that the Hopi have stated a claim does not mean they will prevail; if they are to lose, however, it should be on the merits and not by implausibly asserting that they have alleged an injury no different than that suffered by the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b657 Ironically, if the Forest Service allowed the Hopi to sell pine boughs, pinon nuts, or native tobacco collected from the Peaks (it does not), the majority's holding would allow the Hopi to bring a public nuisance claim based on injury to their pecuniary interests. We may live in a material world, but it is a sad comment on our law to suggest that other interests-such as religious traditions and practices manifest through millennia and recognized by federal law-cannot support a claim of special injury for purposes of the public nuisance doctrine.
