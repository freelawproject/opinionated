Its case title, cause number, and disposition shall be included in this Court's quarterly list of noncitable cases published in the Pacific Reporter and Montana Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Lyndsey Lalicker (Mother) appeals the Order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, denying Mother's Notice of Objections and granting Nelson Luke Oyler (Father) visitation rights to L.G.L., their minor child. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On November 1, 2013, Mother and Father were married. On July 9, 2014, the marriage was declared invalid on the grounds that Father lacked the ability to consent to marry due to mental health issues. At the time of the Declaration of Invalidity, Mother was pregnant with L.G.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 5, 2014, Father filed a Petition for Voluntary Relinquishment of his Parental Rights to L.G.L. in the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County. On October 9, 2014, the Broadwater County District Court denied Father's Petition. In November 2014, Mother initiated an administrative action with the Montana Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) to determine Father's child support obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 1, 2015, Father filed a Petition to Establish a Parenting Plan in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. On February 15, 2017, the Standing Master held a hearing on the Petition, during which Mother and Father both presented evidence and testified. Father called Dr. Thomas Heriza, his medical provider, and Gallatin County Father Engagement Specialist Patrick Duganz to provide testimony as to Father's ability to safely parent L.G.L. On June 30, 2017, the Standing Master issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Final Parenting Plan granting Father supervised parenting of L.G.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 On August 29, 2017, Mother, acting pro se after her attorney withdrew following the hearing, filed a Motion for the Court to Grant Relief from Judgment. On October 30, 2017, the Standing Master denied the Motion, determining that Mother failed to establish grounds for relief and that no specific objections to the Final Parenting Plan were filed within the time provided by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 On November 8, 2017, Mother filed her Notice of Objections. On January 11, 2018, the Gallatin County District Court, despite the untimeliness of the Notice of Objections, held a hearing. On February 1, 2018, the Gallatin County District Court denied the Notice of Objections and amended the Standing Master's Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law, and Final Parenting Plan to provide a modified legal analysis. Mother appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 We review de novo a district court's decision to adopt a standing master's report to determine whether it applied the correct standards of review to the standing master's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    Patton v.

Mother raises, for the first time on appeal, that the doctrines of judicial estoppel, judicial admissions, and conclusive presumption preclude the grant of Father's Petition. Mother argues the Standing Master erred when it granted Father's Petition because Father waived his parental rights by previously filing for a voluntary relinquishment. Finally, Mother argues the Standing Master erred by granting Father's Petition because the action was vexatious pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(a), MCA, because Father filed the Petition five days after the parties' CSED hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 Mother's objections concerning judicial estoppel, judicial admissions, and conclusive presumption were not argued before the District Court and are being raised for the first time on appeal. This Court will not address issues that were not raised before the District Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siebken\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    Wheelsmith\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15. Also, Mother's arguments concerning judicial estoppel, judicial admissions, and conclusive presumption are all generally based on Mother's changed theory of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. Consequently, the Court will only address the issues regarding whether the District Court erred in approving the Standing Master's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 The District Court correctly determined Mother failed to demonstrate clear error in the Standing Master's findings, and correctly concluded it would be in the best interests of L.G.L. to have Father be a part of her life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Healy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. Father presented evidence of significant progress on his mental health issues with Dr. Heriza, and his willingness to engage and work with a parenting specialist. Additionally, the District Court correctly concluded Father did not waive his parental rights by previously filing an action to terminate his parental rights. Father remained the natural parent of L.G.L., both for purposes of child support and determining a final parenting plan, because his request to terminate his parental rights was denied by the Broadwater County District Court. The District Court did not err in concluding it is in L.G.L.'s best interest to continue to reside primarily with Mother while also having a relationship with Father as set forth in the Final Parenting Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    In re C.J.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    Woerner\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 The District Court correctly concluded Father rebutted the presumption that the parenting plan filing was vexatious, and no attorney fees should be awarded to Mother, because a parenting plan was not in place at the time of Father's Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(a), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    In re Z.D.L.-B\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 Based on the Standing Master's application of the \u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA factors, and the substantial evidence presented at the hearing, the Standing Master's Findings of Fact were not clearly erroneous, its Conclusions of Law were correct, and the Standing Master did not abuse its discretion in granting Father visitation rights to L.G.L.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.J.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    Guffin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20.
