Vanuka (Robert). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On December 28, 2011, Robert petitioned for the dissolution of his marriage to Kathleen. On May 30, 2017, the Standing Master issued her final decree dissolving the marriage and dividing the marital property. Kathleen objected to the division of property. On April 9, 2018, after holding a hearing, the District Court adopted and affirmed the Standing Master's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final decree of dissolution in full, including her determination that Robert and Kathleen equally divide the equity in the marital home. Kathleen appeals, arguing that the District Court should have awarded her the entire marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 This Court reviews a district court's decision in dissolution and division of marital property proceedings for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re marriage of Rudolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143866\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/226/\">\n    2007 MT 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143866\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/226/\">\n    338 Mont. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143866\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/226/\">\n    164 P.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Crilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429373\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/479/\">\n    2005 MT 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429373\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/479/\">\n    329 Mont. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429373\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/329/479/\">\n    124 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Kathleen specifically argues that equal division was inequitable because she contributed more income to the marital estate during the marriage, she could no longer work due to disability, and Robert had separate inheritance assets, including retirement and investment accounts, while she did not. The Standing Master's detailed findings of fact acknowledged Kathleen's contentions. However, the Standing Master also found that Robert contributed significant amounts of his inheritance to the marital estate during the marriage, Kathleen continued to live in the debt-free home after Robert petitioned for dissolution, Kathleen retained the majority of the items in the home, and Kathleen exclusively collected rent from tenants in the home's lower-level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Standing Master considered the circumstances of Robert and Kathleen's particular marriage, as well as each party's unique contributions. Based on her findings of fact, the Standing Master concluded it was equitable to split the equity in the marital home evenly between Robert and Kathleen. Kathleen failed to establish clear error in the Standing Master's findings of fact. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in affirming and adopting the Standing Master's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 We have determined to decide this case pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 3(c) of our Internal Operating Rules, which provides for memorandum opinions. In the opinion of the Court, the case presents a question controlled by settled law or by the clear application of applicable standards of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DIRK M.
