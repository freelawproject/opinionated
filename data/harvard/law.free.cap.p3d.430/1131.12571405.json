(Aho) appeals from the trial court's dismissal of its Land Use Petition Act, chapter 36.70C RCW (LUPA), action on the ground of failure to exhaust remedies before the Moxee City Council. We must decide how loud, listing, learned, legally lucid, and longwinded a party's presentation of an issue or legal argument must be before an administrative agency in order to exhaust remedies. We hold that Aho sufficiently exhausted its remedies. We reverse the dismissal of Aho's LUPA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Aho Construction submitted applications to the city of Moxee to rezone and subdivide a twenty-two-acre tract of property that Aho purchased on contract. Aho submitted a rezone application to Moxee because the development, to be named Rose's Place, contemplated ninety-one residences inside the city, which number exceeded the density allowed by the property's R-1 single-family zone. Aho sought rezoning to an R-2 single family zone. Aho also submitted to Moxee a preliminary plat for approval. Pursuant to State Environmental Policy Act of 1971, chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA) requirements, Aho additionally filed an environmental checklist with the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Rose's Place subdivision application plat map did not extend an existing city street, Chelan Avenue, through the subdivision. The proposed plat instead depicted Chelan Avenue terminating one-half block inside the subdivision and near the westerly border of the subdivision and recommencing in an easterly direction one-half block before Chelan Avenue would exit the subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The city of Moxee provided public notice of Aho Construction's applications for a rezone and subdivision approval. Numerous city officials and other government entities responded to the applications and environmental checklist. Moxee Police Chief Mike Kisner responded with concerns about the break in Chelan Avenue's continuity. Kisner wrote to Moxee's SEPA official:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   It appears from a logical stand-point that it [Chelan Avenue] should be extended through the plat from Faucher Road [west side of the subdivision] to the proposed stub-out on the east side of the plat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Chelan Avenue is an important local access connection through this side of the city. It starts at Centennial Street and connects to the west side of Faucher Road. This proposal makes the obvious connection on the east side of Faucher Road but does provide a continuous connection to the east. This discontinuance of street connection will reduce our response time to this area and therefore does not promote the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Moxee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 126. Police Chief Kisner requested that Moxee condition any approval of the subdivision plat on the extension of Chelan Avenue through the entire subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 5 Trevor Lenseigne, operations chief of East Valley Fire Department, the city of Moxee's fire service organization, also expressed concern over Chelan Avenue's discontinuance, and he requested the roadway be extended. Lenseigne wrote to Moxee's SEPA official:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In the proposed plat, it would be necessary for our large vehicles to make additional turning movements or drive around entire blocks to access certain locations if Chelan Avenue is not extended easterly. This could delay our response times in an emergency situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We believe it would be in the public's best interest if Chelan Avenue were extended through the plat, as it would provide us with better access to the proposed neighborhood and to future neighborhoods to the east.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CP at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 Benjamin Annen, Moxee's consulting engineer, reviewed the Rose's Place SEPA environmental checklist. Annen wrote to the city SEPA official:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The preliminary plat layout should be revised to extend Chelan Avenue from Faucher Road, continuous through the length of the development to the east property line, with provisions for extending in the future. Continuity within the roadway network is important as it provides consistent roadway connectivity, a reliable block system for various modes of transportation, and improved access for emergency vehicles. Consistent with previous plats and continuity, typical block lengths should range from 250 feet to 700 feet in length. Because the distance between Charron Road and Moxee Avenue is approximately 1,300 feet, it is our recommendation to extend Chelan Avenue through the development as an additional east/west roadway, greatly improving continuity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CP at 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 7 The city of Moxee conducted a review of the preliminary plat application under SEPA and issued a preliminary mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS). The preliminary MDNS required that Aho implement various mitigation measures, including the extension of Chelan Avenue from its intersection with Faucher Road on the west side of the subdivision across the entirety of Rose's Place to its eastern boundary. Moxee issued the preliminary MDNS for purposes of additional comments from the public, government entities, and Aho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 John Manix, Aho Construction's engineer, penned a report to Mel Aho, owner of Aho, which report Aho forwarded to the city of Moxee with a request for relief from the mitigation requirement of extending Chelan Avenue. Aho's engineer disputed the need to extend Chelan Avenue, while writing that Rose's Place would add minimal traffic to the vicinity. Manix also iterated that emergency vehicles would wish to enter Rose's Place subdivision from arterials, such as Moxee Avenue, other than Chelan Avenue. Manix posited that use of Chelan Avenue would increase emergency vehicles' response time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 Steven Madsen, Aho Construction's general counsel, also wrote Moxee officials and complained about the lack of justification for extending Chelan Avenue across the plat. We repeat below a portion of the lengthy argument presented by Madsen in the letter. The file given to each Moxee city council member, when the city council later reviewed Aho's challenge to the Chelan Avenue extension requirement, included the letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Chelan Avenue Extension:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Washington law is very clear that mitigation requirements imposed on land development by municipal jurisdictions must be roughly proportional to the environmental Impacts created by the development:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Where government issues a land use permit on condition that the applicant dedicate land to public use, the government must show an '\n   <em>\n    essential nexus\n   </em>\n   ' between a 'legitimate state interest,' and the condition imposed.

The city calculated a need for extending Chelan Avenue through the subdivision to mitigate the impact caused by dense housing in the subdivision. The city deemed the street extension necessary to afford ingress and egress of residential traffic and emergency vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 11 Under the city of Moxee's municipal code, Aho Construction appealed the city's final SEPA MDNS to a city hearing examiner.

He further contested the Chelan Avenue extension mitigation condition, asserting legal arguments regarding the constitutionality of the extension as an exaction that did not have a nexus to any public problem caused from impacts specific to the proposed subdivision. He also challenged any reliance on speculative future development on neighboring properties as the basis for imposing the mitigation condition requiring preservation of the prevailing grid system of local access streets, particularly in absence of a street plan, [HE p.100-102]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CP at 204-05. The hearing examiner later, in his decision, noted that Aho repeated the arguments in the attorney's letter during the open record hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 16 In his decision, hearing examiner Patrick Spurgin reversed the city's MDNS condition of extension of Chelan Avenue in that the avenue lacked an environmental impact. This ruling gained Aho Construction only a pyrrhic victory because the hearing examiner upheld the condition on other grounds when reviewing the rezone application approval and the preliminary plat application approval. The examiner noted that Rose's Place subdivision would exacerbate the public problems referenced in the city's MDNS. The hearing examiner ultimately determined that Chelan Avenue must be extended easterly to create a continuous corridor\n   throughout the plat, because the city may base a rezone on reasonable mitigation conditions. Also, the city may base a preliminary plat approval on reasonable conditions as long as the condition contains proportionality to its need. In so ruling, the examiner concluded that he lacked authority to declare any city action to be unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Moxee Municipal Code distinguishes between the hearing examiner's examination of the city's SEPA MDNS and the hearing examiner's review of the city's conditional approval of a rezone application and preliminary plat application. The city code deems the examination of the SEPA MDNS as an appeal, and the hearing examiner's decision to be final unless appealed further. MMC 16.15.060(1), 16.15.160(4) and 16.15.190(2)(f). The code deems the consideration of the preliminary plat approval and rezone approval as a review, after which the hearing examiner presents a recommendation to the city council. MMC 16.15.190(2)(f). The city council automatically reviews the recommendation and issues a final decision after a closed record hearing. MMC 16.60.190 declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The city council upon receipt of a recommendation on any preliminary plat shall at its next public meeting set the date for a closed record hearing to consider the matter in accordance with the procedures and standards of Chapter 16 MMC for conducting a closed record hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   MMC 16.15.230 defines a \"closed record appeal:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (1) A closed record appeal shall be the administrative appeal on the record to the city council following a previous open record hearing on the project permit application before the hearing examiner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) A closed record decision shall be a closed record public meeting held by city council prior to the issuance of a final decision, but follows a previous open record hearing on the project permit application before the hearing examiner.

Hordan noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   So the second comment period produced a letter from the proponent's [Aho's] engineer with reasons why he didn't believe Chelan Avenue should be constructed to and through the plat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   And speaking of generalities, before they'll have an opportunity to talk, they mainly indicated that-the engineering-that it did not affect the level of service of these three agencies in the area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The second comment period also produced a letter from the proponent's attorney. And he's indicated that the proponents felt the requested mitigation was a taking of the properties and not warranted. The proponent's attorney also stated in his letter that the proponent has concerns about the development of the intersection of Charron Road and Faucher Road and how that was to be accomplished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   CP at 270.

They're in writing and they speak for themselves anyway, I'll continue with my comments, then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   First of all, generally the reiteration of the facts here are correct, couple of exceptions I take. One is the decision of the SEPA was final, that's not a recommendation. This body has no jurisdiction over that decision. The City had the ability to appeal, the appeal period has passed, that was done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   I would object to the characterization that the hearing examiner ruled that this is not a taking. To the contrary, the hearings examiner was very clear that in oral comments stating his opinion, he did not have jurisdiction to rule on the face of this claim, that-and as I interpret the finding No. 5, that merely found it was within the City's general plan to make that requirement of the throughway of Chelan Avenue, that doesn't mean the City doesn't have to pay for it. In this case, the bill's over $500,000 and we have that uncontroverted here in the record and that's what the bill is going to be in a land use petition act claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   So it's our position that, guess what, the City could require it under its own power of eminent domain, it's going to have to do that to take Chelan Avenue from this subdivision, that's really our only comment here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   We believe that the hearing examiner was not ambiguous in his findings, he simply didn't rule on the issue of whether or not this constituted an unconstitutional taking, that is in conversion of private properties for public use without just compensation, and that remains our position here tonight. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   CP at 272.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 21 The Moxee City Council unanimously voted to approve the hearing examiner's recommendation to require the extension of Chelan Avenue as part of the rezone application approval and the preliminary plat application approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 22 Aho Construction filed suit against the city of Moxee in superior court. The suit combined an RCW 36.70C LUPA claim with a complaint for damages under RCW 64.40 and a suit for damages for an unlawful taking under\n   Washington State Constitution article I, section XVI. As part of its LUPA claim, Aho contended that the city of Moxee adopted a land use decision outside its authority by imposing a condition of approval requiring Aho to extend Chelan Avenue. Moxee also violated its city code by demanding the extension. According to Aho, Moxee breached the takings clause of the state constitution and the language of RCW 82.02.020 by demanding the extension without demonstrating that the exaction was reasonably necessary as a direct result of the proposed development or plat or demonstrating that the exaction was roughly proportional to the alleged impacts of the proposed development. Finally, Aho alleged in its LUPA petition that Moxee's land use decision breached United States Supreme Court decisions demanding an essential nexus between a legitimate state interest and the exaction imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 23 The city of Moxee filed a motion to dismiss and argued that Aho Construction failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in failing to raise its arguments before the Moxee City Council. In response, Aho contended that it raised its issues already during the open record hearing before the hearing examiner and was not required to reiterate those contentions during a closed record review with the Moxee City Council. The superior court granted the motion to dismiss. The court dismissed all three causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 24 We first identify the substantive causes of action pending before us and the questions for us to decide. Aho Construction assigns error to the trial court's dismissal of its LUPA petition for failure to exhaust its administrative remedies. Aho assigns no error to the dismissal of its claim under RCW 64.40 or its state inverse condemnation cause of action. We note that a property owner may combine a claim for compensation with a LUPA petition and that the procedures and standards applied to a LUPA petition do not extend to the claim for damages. RCW 36.70C.030. RCW 64.40.020(1) attaches exhaustion of remedies requirements to an RCW 64.40 claim, but Aho's inverse condemnation action may not have faced any exhaustion requirement. Nevertheless, we deem unchallenged the dismissal of the RCW 64.40 and inverse condemnation causes of action, and we only address whether Aho failed to exhaust its remedies under LUPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 25 Our determination to limit our review to Aho Construction's LUPA claim does not negate Aho's ability to assert, within the context of its LUPA suit, that the city of Moxee's conditional approval of the rezone and preliminary plat constitutes an unconstitutional taking. Under RCW 36.70C.130(1), the superior court grants relief in a LUPA action if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (b) The land use decision is an erroneous interpretation of the law, after allowing for such deference as is due the construction of a law by a local jurisdiction with expertise;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (c) The land use decision is not supported by evidence that is substantial when viewed in light of the whole record before the court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    The land use decision is a clearly erroneous application of the law to the facts;\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (e) The land use decision is outside the authority or jurisdiction of the body or officer making the decision; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (f)\n   <em>\n    The land use decision violates the constitutional rights of the party seeking relief.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 26 LUPA, chapter 36.70C RCW, governs judicial review of land use decisions.

King County, an annexation opponent, contended, before the superior court, that the Board's approval of the annexation violated King County Ordinance 9849. The superior court agreed. Nevertheless, King County never cited the ordinance to the Boundary Review Board or suggested to the Board that approval of the annexation would violate the ordinance. Extensive testimony of county officials and numerous letters from the county, before the Board, omitted any reference to the county ordinance. Therefore, the Supreme Court refused to entertain, on appeal, the county's use of the ordinance.

On appeal to the Supreme Court, the development's proponents argued that the citizens lacked standing to challenge the city's approval because the citizens failed to exhaust administrative remedies before the city council. The Supreme Court disagreed. Before the superior court, the citizens challenged the compatibility of the planned unit development with the underlying zoning.

Law is not a mathematical exercise. Thus, we cannot measure what constitutes more than a hint or greater than a slight reference. Nevertheless, we assemble, from Washington cases, factors germane to determining sufficiency of exhaustion, which include: the number of sentences devoted to an issue in any written brief given to the administrative agency; the amount of language devoted to the argument compared to the amount of language devoted to other arguments; the clarity of the presentation before the administrative agency; citations to statutes and case law and the accuracy of the citations; if the party asserts numerous issues in a brief, whether the issue on appeal was separated in the brief or introduced with a heading; and whether the challenger's presentation to the administrative agency applied facts to the law. We expect further cases will add to these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 43 We glean from the record before the Moxee City Council that Aho Construction repeatedly asserted to the city that the city's demand for an extension of Chelan Avenue lacked proportionality and a nexus to a public interest and constituted a taking of property without just compensation. John Manix, Aho's engineer, penned a report that disputed the need to extend Chelan Avenue because the subdivision would add minimal traffic to the vicinity and increase emergency vehicle response time. Steven Madsen, Aho's general counsel, wrote Moxee officials and complained about the lack of justification for extending Chelan Avenue across the plat. The letter argued that the condition of extending Chelan Avenue lacked a legitimate state interest and constituted a taking of property. The letter accurately cited United States Supreme Court and Washington Supreme Court decisions supporting Aho's legal position and applied the law to the facts. Madsen not only cited the law but expounded on the law. The letter focused on the taking of property without just compensation, without the letter wandering into other topics. Madsen did not bury Aho's lack of a nexus, lack of proportionality, and taking arguments in lengthy briefs containing other arguments. Madsen wrote more than a sentence and more than a paragraph in favor of Aho's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 44 During the hearing before the city of Moxee hearing examiner, both city staff and Aho representatives, including attorney Steven Madsen, noted that the principal dispute for both the SEPA appeal and preliminary\n   plat application concerned the propriety of conditioning approval of the project on the extension of Chelan Avenue. The hearing examiner's written decision listed Madsen's letter as an exhibit before him. The decision noted that Madsen's letter presented constitutional arguments because the extension condition provided no solution to any public problem. The hearing examiner later, in his decision, noted that Aho repeated the arguments from Madsen's letter during the open record hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 45 Presumably, the city of Moxee agrees that Aho took steps, before the hearing examiner, necessary to exhaust remedies and advance its position before the city council. Presumably, Moxee only contends Aho failed to exhaust administrative remedies before the city council. Nevertheless, exhaustion of remedies before the hearing examiner should extend to exhaustion of remedies before the city council since the city council merely reviewed the hearing examiner's record and decision in a closed record meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 46 The hearing examiner's decision affirming the approval of the rezone and the preliminary plat conditioned on the extension of Chelan Avenue underwent automatic review by the Moxee City Council. The city council received the entire record from the hearing examiner, which record included the letter from Steven Madsen, the report prepared by John Manix, and the hearing examiner's decision. All three documents mentioned Aho's complaint about the extension of Chelan Avenue in part on taking grounds. During Moxee consultant Bill Hordan's presentation before the city council, Hordan referenced the letters from Madsen and Manix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 47 If city council members lacked notice of Aho's claim of a taking, the council members failed to read the closed record before it and failed to listen to Steven Madsen. No city council member is on record stating that he or she did not comprehend Aho's arguments because of an inchoate or unintelligible presentation. This court sometimes receives briefs with less definition and less explanation as to a party's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 48 The city of Moxee faults Aho because Steven Madsen, during his short presentation to the Moxee City Council, failed to assert the underlying basis for the takings claim, that being a missing nexus between the public need and the extension of Chelan Avenue and the absence of proportionality between the cost of the extension and the public benefit. Aho thereby criticizes Madsen's presentation to the city council as failing to provide an articulable reason to reverse the hearing examiner's ruling. We recognize the stunted nature of Steven Madsen's presentation to the Moxee City Council. Nevertheless, Moxee cites no law that an oral presentation must sufficiently identify the issues before the administrative agency when written pleadings or letters already identify the issues, particularly when the oral presentation occurs during a closed record review. When a party explains its position in writing, sometimes the best oral argument may be no oral argument. Nevertheless, when he spoke, Madsen emphasized Aho's contention that the city requirement of Chelan Avenue constituted a taking. Madsen asserted that Aho's position remained that the city engaged in \"an unconstitutional taking that is in conversion of private properties for public use without just compensation.\" CP at 272.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 49 The city of Moxee contends that Aho may not rely on papers and arguments presented to the hearing examiner and needed to repeat those arguments before the city council. Such an argument recycles the argument critical of Steven Madsen's oral presentation. Moxee cites no law to support this additional position. The city council received the entire record before the hearing examiner and was tasked in a closed record hearing to either affirm or reverse the hearing examiner's ruling. That mission should have included a thorough reading of the hearing examiner's record. Perusal of the record would enlighten city council members of the issues presented by Aho that became issues before the superior court in the LUPA action. If the city council did not understand that it was reviewing Aho's arguments of a missing nexus, a lack of proportionality, and a taking, one wonders what the city council believed itself to be reviewing. Notice to the city council of those issues by the hearing\n   examiner's record fulfills the purpose of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 50 The city of Moxee characterizes city council members as lay people, who lack expertise in land use law. This argument ignores the fact that city council members had available city staff and a consultant with expertise in land use, with the consultant outlining the issues before the city council. Moxee city council members also had legal counsel available and present by phone during the city council meeting. If council members lacked understanding, the city council could have postponed the meeting or recessed the meeting into a closed session to speak with legal counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 51 The city of Moxee also faults Aho because Steven Madsen's letter failed to cite RCW 82.02.020, a statute prohibiting a city from assessing payments for a property development not in proportion to public needs caused by the development. We note that none of the record before the Moxee City Council cites RCW 82.02.020. Based on Washington case law, we conclude that, if a party fails to cite a statute or ordinance before the administrative agency, the party may not rely on the statute or ordinance in the superior court suit challenging the agency action. Therefore, we rule, based on the exhaustion of remedies doctrine, that Aho may not rely on RCW 82.02.020 on remand as part of its LUPA petition claim. This ruling may assist Moxee none since Aho may still rely on the takings clause of the Washington Constitution and RCW 82.02.020 constitutes a statutory analog to the constitutional clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 52 The parties agree that Aho could not raise its constitutional arguments before the city of Moxee hearing examiner. We do not know if Aho could raise constitutional challenges before the Moxee City Council, but question Aho's ability to do so when the city council merely reviewed the record before the hearing examiner. Assuming Aho could not raise its takings claim before the city council, an additional ground requires reversal on the basis of exhaustion of remedies at least as to the takings argument under the rubric of LUPA. This court may review an issue not adequately raised before the administrative agency if the petitioner lacked an opportunity to raise the issue below.\n   <em>\n    Kitsap Alliance of Property Owners v.
