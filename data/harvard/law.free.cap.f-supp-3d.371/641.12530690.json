No. 94, and one filed by intervenor Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\"), Dkt. No. 105. For the reasons articulated below,\n   the Court DENIES both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 18, 2015, Plaintiffs Koninklijke Philips N.V. and U.S. Philips Corporation (collectively, \"Philips\") originally brought this patent infringement action against Acer in the District of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1. The operative complaint asserts infringement of eleven patents, including the three at issue here: United States Patent No. RE43,564 (\"the '564 patent\"), No. 5,910,797 (\"the '797 patent\"), and No. 7,184,064 (\"the '064 patent\"). Dkt. No. 82 (\"SAC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 23, 2016, Acer moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that the asserted claims in the '564 patent are unenforceable because they were improperly broadened upon reissue, and that the asserted claims in the '797 patent are unenforceable because they were issued in error. Dkt. Nos. 94, 95 (\"Mot.\"). On January 18, 2017, Philips responded. Dkt. No. 108 (\"Opp.\"). Acer replied on February 6, 2017. Dkt. No. 119 (\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 10, 2016, Microsoft filed a complaint in intervention, seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement. Dkt. No. 74. On January 12, 2017, Microsoft moved for partial judgment on the pleadings, contending that the asserted claims of the '064 patent are indefinite. Dkt. Nos. 105, 106 (\"Int. Mot.\"). On February 9, 2017, Philips responded. Dkt. No. 122 (\"Opp. to Int.\"). Microsoft replied on February 16, 2017. Dkt. No. 127 (\"Int. Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 3, 2017, the judge to whom the case was then assigned, the Honorable Gregory M. Sleet, held a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing, and Judge Sleet then issued a claim construction order on July 11, 2017. Dkt.

The Asserted Claims of the '564 Patent Are Not Invalid under Section 251\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Acer contends that Philips improperly broadened the claims of the '564 patent on reissue in violation of Section 251(d) of the Patent Act by changing a claim limitation from a zoom \"substantially centered around the touch\n   <em>\n    screen\n   </em>\n   \" to a zoom \"substantially centered around the touch\n   <em>\n    location.\n   </em>\n   \" Mot. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   a.

Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004570-71. Claim 1 in the original application reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   An information processing apparatus comprising ... a data processing system ... operative to enable the user to select via the touch screen a portion of the image, when displayed at a first scale, for rendering the selected portion on the display at a second scale larger than the first scale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004570-71;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The examiner rejected all eight claims as obvious in light of the prior art, including the Tanimoto reference, which \"teaches a touch panel that when displayed at a first scale, for rendering the selected portion on the display at a second scale larger than the first scale.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004580-84. After a series of subsequent non-final rejections from the examiner and responses from Philips, the examiner issued a final rejection of claims 1-8, explaining that \"it would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to incorporate Tanimoto's touch panel device having zoom-in and zoom-out operation into Hirayama's input device so as to provide a user interface appropriate for conveying the user's intention more directly.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004595-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Philips then filed a preliminary amendment, disclaiming claims 1-8 in their entirety and adding claims 9-14. Claims 9\n   and 14 both recited the same claim limitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   wherein ... the selected portion when rendered at the\n   <strong>\n    second scale\n   </strong>\n   is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the\n   <strong>\n    touch location\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mot. at 4, Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004618-20 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The examiner rejected the new claims as obvious, again citing the Tanimoto reference as teaching that \"the second scale is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the touch location.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004628. Philips traversed the rejection, contending that the examiner \"did not show a teaching, suggestion or incentive for the skilled person to combine the teachings of the references.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004645. Philips also contended that \"combining the references of Hirayama and Tanimoto destroys the intent [of the references].\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004646. Philips therefore submitted \"that the rejection under \u00a7 103 is incorrect\" and requested \"that the rejections be withdrawn.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004647.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the same filing, Philips submitted a proposed amendment to claims 9 and 14, including among others the following amendment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   wherein ... the selected portion when rendered at the\n   <strong>\n    first scale\n   </strong>\n   is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the\n   <strong>\n    touch screen\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Opp. at 4-5 (emphasis added); Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004643-44. Notably, in the exhibit to the amendment (see image below), the markup version of the claims purported to \"show changes made to the claims,\" but did not show any changes to the terms \"first scale\" and \"touch screen\"-even though those terms had been changed in the proposed amendment.

No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004649.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response to Philips' filing, the examiner issued a Notice of Allowability. Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004654-59. After briefly summarizing the Hirayama and Tanimoto references which had been used previously to demonstrate obviousness, the notice of allowability stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   However, both references fail to disclose the claimed limitations such as the system is operative to enable the user to select through a touch location on the touch screen a portion of the image, when displayed at a first scale, for rendering the selected portion on the display at a second scale larger than the first scale, thereby facilitating a selection of a feature; and the selected portion when rendered at the first scale is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the touch screen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004657-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As proposed by the amendment, the claim limitation in claims 9 and 14 (claims 1 and 6, respectively, in the issued '203 patent ) issued as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   wherein ... the selected portion when rendered at the\n   <strong>\n    first scale\n   </strong>\n   is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the\n   <strong>\n    touch screen\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Opp. at 4-5; Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 2 at PHILIPS00004557 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Eight years after the '203 patent issued, Philips filed U.S. Reissue Patent Application 12/980,454. Opp. at 5; Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 3 at PHILIPS00002702. The reissue application sought to amend the claim limitation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   wherein ... the selected portion when\n   rendered at the\n   <strong>\n    first scale\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the\n   <strong>\n    touch location\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 3 at PHILIPS00002705, 2707 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the remarks accompanying the initial reissue application, Philips explained that the change from \"touch screen\" to \"touch location\" was intended \"to more clearly define the subject invention as disclosed in the written description\" because the initial use of \"touch screen\" was \"a typographical error\" made during the prosecution of the '203 patent. Opp. at 5; Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 3 at PHILIPS00002708. The Examiner sent a Notice of Allowability, granting the proposed amendments to claims 1 and 6. Opp. at 6; Dkt.

Acer has Failed to Show by Clear and Convincing Evidence that the Reissued Claims are Broader than the Original Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Acer contends that the reissued claims in the '564 patent are invalid and cannot be enforced because they improperly broaden the scope of the original claims in the '203 patent. Philips contends that a person of ordinary skill in the art would\n   have recognized that the amendment from \"substantially centered around the\n   <em>\n    touch location\n   </em>\n   \" to \"substantially centered around the\n   <em>\n    touch screen\n   </em>\n   \" was a clerical error and thereby conclude that the reissued claims are not broader in scope. Opp. at 12 (emphasis added). The Court finds that Acer has failed to meet its burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the scope of the claims in the '564 reissue patent are broader than the scope of the claims in the original '203 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Acer contends that the prosecution history proves that the reissue claims are broader than the original claims. For support, Acer points out that after multiple rounds of non-final rejections, the examiner allowed the claims only after Philips \"narrowed\" the claims from zooming centered around \"the touch location\" to zooming centered around \"the touch screen.\" Mot. at 4; Reply at 1. Therefore, according to Acer, the reissue claims must be broader because they reinstate language from the claims before they were \"narrowed.\" Reply at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Acer fails to show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent examiner allowed the reissue claims because she viewed the change from \"touch location\" to \"touch screen\" as a narrowing amendment necessary to overcome the prior art. For one, the lack of markings in the amendment exhibit intended to \"show changes made to the claims\" could indicate that the change from \"touch location\" to \"touch screen\" was a mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 4-5; Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004650. Additionally, the prosecution history shows that the examiner could plausibly have been persuaded by Philips' arguments challenging her prior obviousness rejection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 14. The textual amendment and Philips' arguments asking the examiner to withdraw the obviousness rejections were filed in the same pleading-the one that directly preceded the Notice of Allowance. Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at PHILIPS00004647. The Notice of Allowance conceded the following statement about prior art cited in the previous non-final rejections for obviousness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   However, both references fail to disclose the claimed limitations such as the system is operative to enable the user to select through a touch location on the touch screen a portion of the image, when displayed at a first scale, for rendering the selected portion on the display at a second scale larger than the first scale, thereby facilitating a selection of a feature; and the selected portion when rendered at the first scale is a zoomed-in version of part of the image at the first scale substantially centered around the touch screen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at 4657-58. Although the final clause does specify zooming \"substantially centered around the touch screen\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 4), the full quote includes a broad concession that the prior art did not encompass zooming that \"enable[s] the user to select through a touch location on the touch screen a portion of the image ... for rendering the selected portion on the display ... thereby facilitating a selection of a feature.\" Dkt. No. 92, Ex. 1 at 4657-58. This-rather than the textual amendment from \"touch location\" to \"touch screen\"-could plausibly indicate the reason for the allowance. Thus, the Court cannot find as a matter of law that the examiner would not have allowed the amendment without the change from \"touch location\" to \"touch screen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Acer cites\n   <em>\n    Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. v.

Greenspun Declaration, Dkt. No. 109. Under Rule 12(d), \"If, on a motion under 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The Court finds sufficient support within the pleadings to deny Acer's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court therefore excludes the proffered Greenspun Declaration and declines to convert Acer's Rule 12(c) motion into a motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
