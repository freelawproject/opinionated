BRYAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Dkt. 42. The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motion and the file herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from an employment dispute between the Plaintiff Miriam Poe and her former employer. Dkt. 1. The Plaintiff makes claims for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. 12101,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 42 U.S.C. 12101,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Law Against Discrimination (\"WLAD\"), RCW 49.60,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Family Medical Leave Act (\"WFMLA\"), RCW 49.78,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , and for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Dkt. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Defendants now move for summary judgment. Dkt. 42. The Plaintiff opposes the motion for summary judgment, in part, and voluntarily dismisses her claims against Defendant Waste Connections US, Inc. and her claim for wrongful discharge. Dkt. 48. The Plaintiff's claims against Waste Connections US, Inc. and her claim for wrongful discharge should be dismissed with no further analysis. For the reasons provided below, the motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 42) should be granted, in part, and denied, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff began work for Defendant Murrey's Disposal Company, Inc. (\"Murrey's\") in 1989 and worked until 1992. Dkt. 50, at 2. After a break, she returned to Murrey's in 2004, becoming an accounts' receivable clerk in 2006, this time staying until May 4, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiff has suffered severe depression and anxiety most of her adult life. Dkt. 50, at 1. Her symptoms worsened with the death of her husband in 2011, the death of both her brothers in 2015 and 2016, and with the death of her mother in 2017. Dkt. 50, at 2. The Plaintiff asserts that some of the main symptoms of her depression are negativity and unhappiness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Plaintiff's direct manager, Rio Molina, who knew of the Plaintiff's depression, noticed the Plaintiff's negativity and unhappiness. Dkt. 49, at 73-74. Ms. Molina states that the Plaintiff was not pleasant to be around, reporting that the Plaintiff would repeatedly say, \"I hate this place,\" about Murrey's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the fall before the events at issue here occurred, Ms. Molina began to keep notes on the Plaintiff, and only the Plaintiff. Dkt. 49, at 82. Ms. Molina explains that she was \"looking for patterns of behavior\" like \"being difficult to work with,\" being \"combative,\" \"not following direction,\" \"not being a team player\" all of which could \"constitute a write-up at some point.\" Dkt. 49, at 82. Ms. Molina acknowledges that she intended to use this document at some point to attempt to terminate the Plaintiff's employment with Murrey's or at least be grounds for the Plaintiff to leave Ms. Molina's team. Dkt. 49, at 82-85. Another manager, Andrea Ditzler, who was not aware of the Plaintiff's depression, also felt that the Plaintiff was difficult to work with, noting the Plaintiff had a \"negative attitude at work,\" was not \"willing to be a part of a team and to contribute,\" \"always giving an attitude.\" Dkt. 49, at 135. Ms. Ditzler noticed the Plaintiff would roll her eyes, slam papers around, give people a \"nasty attitude if they asked her to do something,\" ignore people, intimidate others, and talk badly about her work, the company and her pay. Dkt. 49, at 140. Ms. Ditzler, Ms. Molina and the District Manager, Mark Gingrich, would meet regarding the difficulty people were having dealing with the Plaintiff and would try to come up with tactics to deal with her. Dkt. 49, at 141-142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiff attempted suicide in February of 2017. Dkt. 50, at 3. As a consequence, she went on medical leave from February 9, 2017 to May 4, 2017. Dkt. 43-1, at 12. While on leave, the Plaintiff received mental health treatment in the form of medication and therapy. Dkt. 50, at 3. Her goal was to \"better [her] mental condition and prepare to return to work.\" Dkt. 50, at 3. The Plaintiff states that it was her \"intention to return to full-time work at Murrey's as soon as [she] was able to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During this time, the Plaintiff applied for, and received, surviving spouse benefits from the Social Security Administration. Dkt. 49, at 26. She did not apply for disability benefits for her mental health condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She did not want to work part-time permanently because she needed health insurance and other benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   All of the FMLA leave that she requested was approved. Dkt. 43-1, at 26. She communicated with Murrey's managers Mr. Gingrich and Ms. Ditzler about her medical leave and return to work because Ms. Molina was on maternity leave. Dkt. 49, at 113 and 138-139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Mr. Gingrich, he and the Plaintiff talked on the phone sometime before April 8, 2017. Dkt. 45, at 1. He asserts that she told him she may possibly resign because she was seeking Social Security benefits; she expressed concern that the Social Security benefits would not be sufficient income, however.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Mr. Gingrich agreed to, and did, contact human resources for her by email regarding possible alternative sources of income and benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also in early April, the Plaintiff and her health care providers began to consider her return to work, starting on a part-time basis. Dkt. 49, at 62, and 181-182. Her doctor, Geoffrey O. McNicoll, M.D., planned to return her to work full time, after seeing how well she tolerated part-time work. Dkt. 49, at 181-182. Her mental health counselor, Cheri Rohlman, states that the Plaintiff wanted to return first to work part time, then go full time, but the Plaintiff felt she was too old to work overtime. Dkt. 49, at 60. Plaintiff's response to the new mental health medication was also a factor in the timeframe for her return to full time work. Dkt. 49, at 34-35. On April 24, 2017, Dr. McNicoll signed a Fitness for Duty Certification form for the Plaintiff, indicating under the \"restrictions\" section that the Plaintiff could return to work on May 2, 2017 for \"[two] days per week.\" Dkt. 49, at 174. While the form asked for the duration of any restrictions, none was provided on the form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Dr. McNicoll, he assumed she would return to work full-time, but they would have had to assess that after she worked part-time for a while. Dkt. 49, at 163.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A few days after Dr. McNicoll signed her Fitness for Duty Certification form, the Plaintiff and Murrey's manager Mr. Gingrich met on April 27, 2017 to discuss her return to work. Dkt. 49, at 28 and 115. No one else was present for the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff asserts that she gave Mr. Gingrich her Fitness for Duty Certification and he asked her how long the two-day-per week restriction would last. Dkt. 49, at 29. The Plaintiff states that she told him that she couldn't give him a specific date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff maintains that at the April 27, 2017 meeting she told Mr. Gingrich that the \"two-day-per week work restriction was temporary, and that the purpose of the restriction was to permit [her] to adjust to [her] medication.\" Dkts. 50, at 3 and 49, at 32-35. She denies ever telling Mr. Gingrich or anyone that her \"two-day-per week work restriction was permanent.\" Dkt. 50, at 3. The Plaintiff states that she did not discuss the fact that her Social Security benefits would be reduced if she returned to work more than two days a week with anyone, including Mr. Gingrich. Dkt. 49, at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Gingrich's view of the conversation is different - he asserts that based on their April 27 conversation, he felt that the Plaintiff did not want to come back to work full time - he alleges that they also discussed several income options and other resources (like COBRA for healthcare) should the Plaintiff choose not to return to work at all. Dkt. 49, at 114-115. He maintains that she told him that if she worked more than two days a week, she would have to pay back some of the Social Security benefits she received (or pay a penalty). Dkt. 45 at 2. He told her to come back on May 4, 2017, despite the fact that her doctor cleared her to begin working again on May 2, 2017. Dkt. 49, at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That afternoon, Murrey's manager Ms. Ditzler exchanged the following text messages with Ms. Molina, who was out on maternity leave:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Molina\n   </strong>\n   : Brandi asked [the Plaintiff] if she was coming back and she said \"no.\" Are we that lucky that she quit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Ditzler\n   </strong>\n   : Mark is working it but supposed to be hush hush as if [sic] now\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Ditzler\n   </strong>\n   : Word sure travels fast.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dkt. 49, at 191-192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, that same day, on April 27, 2017, Mr. Gingrich emailed the Plaintiff which included a paragraph of options for \"other\" income for her including: accessing her 401K early, apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, or applying for Non-Grant Medical Insurance, etc. Dkt. 49, at 199. Mr. Gingrich acknowledges that he cut and pasted the paragraph from an email the human resources department sent him two weeks before the April 27, 2017 meeting. Dkt. 49, at 114 and 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 2, 2017, around 6:30 p.m., Ms. Molina again exchanged text messages with Ms. Ditzler.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Molina\n   </strong>\n   : [The Plaintiff] is calling me. Is she still an employee[?] If she is, I feel like I should call her back. If she isn't, I really don't want to talk to [her] ever again. I don't have the patience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Ditzler\n   </strong>\n   : I don't think I would call her back ... Mark is meeting with her Thursday and trying to get her to resign ... I would say at this point let him handle it ... you are in leave you do not owe her a call!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Ditzler\n   </strong>\n   : Maybe she just wants to meet you for lunch and catch up. LOL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Molina\n   </strong>\n   : I felt bad not answering so I called back. She is going to sign exit ppw on Thursday. She said doctor said she could only work part time and we told her the position is full time only so she will resign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dkt. 49, at 193-196. Ms. Ditzler acknowledges that she did not want the Plaintiff to return to work because of her negativity. Dkt. 49, at 143-144. Mr. Gingrich acknowledged that it was possible he told Ms. Ditzler that he was going to try to get the Plaintiff to resign. Dkt. 49, at 117. He acquired information regarding her vacation and sick leave balances and prepared separation paperwork for the Plaintiff to sign at the May 4, 2017 meeting. Dkt. 49, at 123-125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the May 4, 2017 meeting (which was only attended by the Plaintiff and Mr. Gingrich), the Plaintiff asserts that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Mr. Gingrich] again asked her how long those two days were going to last, and [she] told him, [she] didn't know, [she] [couldn't] tell [him] specifically when [she could] come back to work full time. And he mentioned something about [her] job being full time, and [she] told him, [She understood] that, but right now [she couldn't] work full time. And so he said to [her] that since [she] couldn't give him a definite time that [she] had to resign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dkt. 49, at 31. The Plaintiff concedes that Mr. Gingrich agreed to accommodate a two-day-per week restriction on a temporary basis, \"but at the same time, he was pushing [her] to tell him a date\" she could go back to full time employment and she \"couldn't give him a specific time\" because she needed to see how she would adjust to her mental health medication over the next few months. Dkt. 49, at 32 and 34-35. She states that she felt she had no choice but to resign - that he told her \"that if [she] couldn't come back full time that they could not keep [her] part time for two days, so the next step was letting [her] go.\" Dkt. 49, at 37. The Plaintiff states that Mr. Gingrich pressured her to sign the resignation paperwork. Dkt. 49, at 37. As to that pressure, the Plaintiff does acknowledge that Mr. Gingrich didn't threaten her and she wasn't afraid he would fire her. Dkt. 43-1, at 23. The Plaintiff signed the separation paperwork at the end of the meeting on May 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plaintiff states that her depression worsened after the above events and she\n   lost her insurance. Dkt. 49, at 42-45. She was not able to afford treatment in the form of her medication or therapy. Dkt. 49, at 43. The Plaintiff contends that she was so effected she was unable to work or even look for work. Dkt. 49, at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In June of 2018, the Plaintiff was able to obtain health insurance, restarted her antidepressant medication, and began working part time. Dkt. 49, at 19-20. She states that, although she is over 65 years old, she would rather work full time if she could find a position. Dkt. 49, at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ORGANIZATION OF OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This opinion will first provide the summary judgment standard, and then address the motion for summary judgment on the Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the ADA and WLAD jointly, and lastly, the Plaintiff's FMLA and WFMLA claims jointly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

FMLA covered employees, like the Plaintiff here, are entitled to up to twelve weeks of leave each year and guarantees reinstatement after exercising leave rights.\n   <em>\n    Gambini\n   </em>\n   , at 1097. The FMLA \"creates two interrelated, substantive employee rights: first, the employee has a right to use a certain amount of leave for protected reasons, and second, the employee has a right to return to his or her job or an equivalent job after using protected leave.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754969\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/983/1264/#p1269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"In order to prevail on an FMLA claim, a plaintiff need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [their] taking of FMLA-protected leave constituted a negative factor in the decision to terminate [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Bachelder v.

Murrey's also asserts that the Plaintiff was offered a return to work on the two-day-a week basis that she requested. The Plaintiff points to evidence that that was an illusionary offer.
