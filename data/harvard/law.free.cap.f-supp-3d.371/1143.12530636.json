On February 13, 2017, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\")-the Treasury Department agency that implements and administers the Kingpin Regulations-designated Mr. Lopez as a specially designated narcotics trafficker\n   (\"SDNT\") under the Kingpin Act and Regulations. Notice of this designation was published in the Federal Register on February 17, 2017.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011101\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 11101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01. Mr. Lopez's SDNT designation rendered his property and property interests in the U.S., including the Vessel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 62-1, \"blocked property\" under the Kingpin Act and Regulations. Nautical thus argues that because Plaintiffs have failed to secure a license from the OFAC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims against the Vessel should be dismissed because they are barred by the Kingpin Act and because any Court orders enforcing their alleged maritime liens against the Vessel would be null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that it would be \"improper and unjust\" to dismiss their\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims because: (1) their maritime liens pre-date Mr. Lopez's SDNT designation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 93 at 11 (\"ANDREW's maritime lien attached to the Vessel upon his employment aboard the M/Y WAKU, pursuant to his Crew Agreement and previous to the establishment of any OFAC block.\"); (2) they were \"without knowledge as to the allegations faced by Mr. Lopez or his designation as an SDNT,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) because Nautical cannot \"use the Kingpin Act as a shield\" to prevent the sale of the Vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Plaintiffs also appear to suggest that their\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims should be allowed to proceed because in October of 2018, the OFAC granted a license to the law firm of Archer &amp; Greiner, P.C. (attorneys apparently representing Mr. Lopez in other matters) and Mr. Eric Castillo, former Yacht Manager of the Vessel, to \"pay the expenses, including past due amounts, ordinarily incident to the maintenance and limited operation of [the Vessel.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Were the Court simply adjudicating, in a vacuum, what was fair in this case, then Plaintiffs' arguments would carry significant weight. But the Court cannot disregard the Kingpin Act and Regulations merely because Plaintiffs believe that they lead to an \"improper and unjust\" result here. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Vessel is blocked property under the Kingpin Act and that they have failed to obtain a license from the OFAC to execute against the Vessel. That ends the inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stansell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653607\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/910/#p916\">\n    704 F.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Kingpin Act ... according to its text and accompanying regulations, requires the procurement of a government-issued license before private individuals may execute against assets frozen under the Act.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs offer no authority suggesting that their claims should be permitted to proceed despite their failure to obtain a license from the OFAC. It is irrelevant whether or not Plaintiffs' alleged maritime liens attached prior to Mr. Lopez's SDNT designation. The Kingpin Act and Regulations preclude \"transfers\" after \"the date on which actual or constructive notice of [that] designation is received.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20598.302\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 598.302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs do not dispute that they are charged with constructive notice of Mr. Lopez's SDNT designation at least since February 17, 2017. Even assuming that Plaintiffs' maritime liens all attached prior to that date, what matters is that now, over two years after Mr. Lopez's SDNT designation, Plaintiffs are prohibited from enforcing those liens and \"any judgment, decree, attachment, injunction, execution, or other judicial or administrative process or order\" that the Court issues to enforce those maritime liens will be null and void.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20598.205\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 598.205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The fact that the OFAC has issued a license to Archer &amp; Greiner, P.C. and Mr. Castillo does not alter this conclusion. As Nautical notes, that license \"does not in any way discuss or permit the transfer of title or other ownership interest in the Vessel.\" DE 113 at 3. Simply put, the issue here is not whether Mr. Lopez's representatives are authorized to pay expenses related to the maintenance and operation of the Vessel. The issue is whether, if Mr. Lopez's representatives fail to pay those expenses, Plaintiffs are permitted to enforce their maritime liens against the Vessel. Without a license from the OFAC, they are plainly not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Court Lacks Personal Jurisdiction Over Nautical\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, the Crew Members also assert, in addition to their\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims against the Vessel,\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   claims against Nautical for breaches of maritime employment contracts and breaches of oral agreements. Essentially, they claim that Nautical failed to pay full wages as provided for in written Crew Agreements and failed to pay additional, supplemental wages allegedly orally promised by the Vessel Captain, Captain Joe Williams, after the crew had gone unpaid for over a month. Nautical, a Cayman Islands corporation, asserts that it lacks sufficient contacts with Florida to be subject to\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Crew Members' Intervening Complaints are less than clear as to Nautical's contacts with Florida. The Crew Members generally allege that Nautical \"engaged in and conducted business transactions in the state of Florida,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 26 \u00b6 5, but the only specific allegations of business transacted by Nautical in Florida relate to the maintenance and operation of the Vessel. The Crew Members allege that Nautical: (1) operated the Vessel and other unspecified vessels in Florida; (2) contracted with the Crew Members \"for work performed in the State of Florida;\" (3) breached the agreements with the Crew Members in Florida by failing to pay wages; and (4) \"enter[ed] into contracts and/or transactional agreements for the provision of products and services provided to or related to [the Vessel] with wholesalers, distributors, and even crew within [Florida.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20598.205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20598.205\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court must conduct a two-step inquiry to determine if personal jurisdiction exists over Nautical.\n   <em>\n    United Techs.

Courts have repeatedly explained that \"[t]his provision means that there must exist a duty to perform an act\n   <em>\n    in Florida\n   </em>\n   ; a contractual duty to tender performance to a Florida resident is not in itself sufficient to satisfy the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Posner v.

In other words, the Court does not doubt that a plaintiff could hypothetically satisfy the \"carrying on a business\" long-arm provision as to a defendant that operated a single yacht in Florida if, for instance, the defendant at least occasionally chartered the yacht for profit.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Labbee v.

But Plaintiffs make no such allegation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because the Court concludes that the Crew Members have not established through their allegations that Nautical is subject to personal jurisdiction under Florida's long-arm statute, the Court need not analyze whether personal jurisdiction is\n   consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
