SCHOFIELD, United States District Judge:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This is a trademark infringement case. Plaintiffs, Lifeguard Licensing Corp. (\"Lifeguard\") and its licensee, Popularity Products, LLC (\"Popularity\"), claim that the Defendants, Ann Arbor T-Shirt Company (\"Ann Arbor\") and its owner Jerry Kozak, infringed Lifeguard's \"LIFEGUARD\" trademarks for apparel and other items (the \"Trademarks\" or \"Lifeguard Trademarks\"). The Defendants assert several counterclaims for declaratory relief, including that the Trademarks are generic and should be cancelled. Shortly after the deadline for filing trial materials, Plaintiffs presented Defendants with a covenant not to sue (the \"Covenant\"). Plaintiffs now move to voluntarily dismiss their own claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) and also dismiss Defendants' counterclaims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) on the basis that the Covenant renders the counterclaims moot. Defendants oppose dismissal of their counterclaims and ask the Court to enter summary judgment against Plaintiffs on counterclaims for constructive abandonment, find this case to be exceptional, and award Defendants their attorneys' fees. For the reasons below, I recommend (i) dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice; (ii) dismissing Defendants' counterclaims as moot without prejudice; (iii) denying Defendants' request for summary judgment; and (iv) denying Defendants' request for an award of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties and Their Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Lifeguard owns four federally registered LIFEGUARD trademarks in the apparel category.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trademarks are incontestable as they have been in continuous use since registration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201065\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff Popularity is Lifeguard's exclusive licensee of the Trademarks and sells summer and beachwear displaying the Trademarks, such as sweatshirts, t-shirts, hats, and tank-tops. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Most of Popularity's sales are on a wholesale level to airport souvenir shops, theme park stores, and beach town stores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Ann Arbor, based in Michigan, sells graphic t-shirts and other items.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Kozak is Ann Arbor's founder and co-owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Kozak Decl. \u00b6 3.) Among other items, Ann Arbor has sold t-shirts and tank-tops emblazoned with the word Lifeguard across the chest. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10.) Most all of Ann Arbor's sales have been made through Amazon.com. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6 10.) In 2015, Ann Arbor's merchandise also automatically became available on eBay.com, although sales data indicates that no appreciable sales were made through eBay. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after this dispute arose, Ann Arbor discontinued sales of its Lifeguard apparel. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6 16.) For some time, however, Ann Arbor had been planning on expanding the items it offered imprinted with the word Lifeguard. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6 55.) In that regard, Ann Arbor recently resumed sales of its shirts and now offers additional Lifeguard items, including hats, long-sleeved shirts, and hoodies. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Start of the Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This dispute began on September 25, 2015, when Plaintiffs sent Defendants a cease and desist letter, charging Defendants with \"willful counterfeiting\" of the Trademarks by selling LIFEGUARD branded apparel through Amazon.com.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter threatened litigation if Defendants did not promptly and permanently stop selling the apparel and paid Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' demand letter prompted discussions between the parties' counsel about potential resolution. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-52.) Amidst those discussions, Ann Arbor filed a federal action in Michigan seeking declaratory relief against Lifeguard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heed Decl. \u00b6 44.) Plaintiffs then filed this action in New York and moved to dismiss the Michigan action based on lack of personal jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43.) That motion succeeded. (Dkt. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The complaint in this case asserts five causes of action: (i) trademark infringement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (ii) trademark counterfeiting; (iii) false designation of origin; (iv) common law unfair competition; and (v) violation of New York deceptive practices act. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 36-69.) On June 2, 2016, Defendants filed five counterclaims, all of which seek only declaratory relief. (Dkt. 77.) The counterclaims request declaratory judgment that (i) the Trademarks are generic and therefore cancellable; (ii) Plaintiffs have constructively abandoned the Trademarks due to failure to police and control the marks; (iii) Plaintiffs have constructively abandoned the Trademarks due to naked licensing; (iv) Defendants use of the word \"Lifeguard\" is a fair or descriptive use; and (v) Defendants' use is a permissible functional use. (Dkt. 77 \u00b6\u00b6 163-94.) Defendants' prayer for relief with respect to its counterclaims is entirely declaratory in nature. (Dkt. at p. 29-30, Prayer for Relief B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Parties' Motion Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The case progressed as one might expect, with both parties making motions and cross-motions. Each party obtained only partial success with their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For instance, in November 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. 13.) The Court found the subject matter issue was rendered moot when the Michigan case was dismissed and denied the motion, finding that the complaint made a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. 88 at 1, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In April 2016, the parties filed dueling motions to compel production of documents from each other. (Dkt. 48, 55.) Plaintiffs' motion to compel was denied as moot because Defendants eventually responded to the requests at issue. (Dkt. 74.) Defendants' motion was granted in part and denied in part. (Dkt. 73.) The Magistrate Judge denied Defendants' application for sanctions and costs against Plaintiffs. (Dkt. 73 at 12-13.) As the Court explained, \"the plaintiffs' position, even where I have rejected it, had a substantial justification.\" (Dkt. 73 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Then, in August 2016, Defendants filed a second motion to compel production of documents from Plaintiffs. (Dkt. 95.) Defendants also once again moved for sanctions for Plaintiffs' non-compliance. Again, the motion was granted in part and denied in part. (Dkt. 103.) Although finding one of Plaintiffs' argument frivolous, the Magistrate Judge denied sanctions because of the split outcome. (Dkt. 103 at 11, 14.) Out of the several issues addressed in the decision, Plaintiffs objected to only one. (Dkt. 104.) The District Judge overruled the objection and affirmed. (Dkt. 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants then filed a motion for contempt sanctions, claiming that Plaintiffs had not complied with prior discovery orders. (Dkt. 107.) The Magistrate Judge denied this third request for sanctions as well, finding in part that \"[a]gain, Ann Arbor does not have its facts exactly right.\" (Dkt. 162 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Both parties also filed motions to preclude the testimony of each other's respective trademark survey experts. (Dkt. 134, 152.) The Magistrate Judge denied both motions. (Dkt. 167.) Each party objected to the ruling against them; the District Judge overruled the objections and affirmed. (Dkt. 182.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. 192, 201.) Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims based on the affirmative defenses of fair use, functional use and abandonment. Plaintiffs opposed and, with one exception, cross-moved for summary judgment on all of Defendants' affirmative defenses and counterclaims. The\n   one exception was Defendants' defense and counterclaim that the Trademarks are generic; the Court had instructed the parties not to move on this issue since it was clearly an issue of disputed fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 229 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court denied Defendants' motion seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims. (Dkt. 229 at 21.) The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion in part and denied it in part, striking several affirmative defenses, including unclean hands, prior use and fraud. (Dkt. 229 at 21.) Accordingly, the case headed toward trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having denied in part the motions for summary judgment, the Court issued a scheduling order setting dates for filing of motions in limine, jury materials, and other items, with a trial to take place starting December 3, 2018. (Dkt. 233.) Defendants timely filed the requisite documents. Plaintiffs did not. Rather, Plaintiffs made the decision to forego filing any trial motions or materials (including any opposition to Defendants' materials) and instead issue a covenant not to sue and move to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs first expressed their intent to provide a covenant and move for dismissal during a telephone call with defense counsel on August 29, 2018. (Heed Decl. \u00b6 24.) Plaintiffs did not actually provide the Covenant, however, until after Defendants had prepared and filed their trial materials. On December 1, 2018, the Court adjourned the trial, and, on December 5, 2018, issued an order authorizing Plaintiffs to file their motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 250.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiffs' Covenant Not to Sue and Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs presented Defendants with the Covenant for the first time on January 9, 2019, the same day Plaintiffs moved to dismiss. (Dkt. 257.) The Covenant was executed by both Plaintiffs and dated to be effective as of January 9, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The recitals indicate that Plaintiffs issued the Covenant because they \"recently reached the conclusion\" that Defendants' actions complained of \"no longer infringe or dilute the Trademarks to warrant the substantial time and expense of continued litigation.\" (Grunsfeld Decl., Ex. 2.) In full, the Covenant reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Covenantors for and on behalf of themselves, their parent companies, subsidiaries, related companies, affiliated companies, licensees, as well as any other successors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and distributors; hereby unconditionally and irrevocably covenant to refrain from making or continuing any claim(s) or demand(s), or from continuing, commencing, causing or permitting to be prosecuted any action in law or equity, against Covenantees or their directors, officers, employees, pertaining to a cause of action based on or involving trademark infringement, unfair competition, or dilution, under state or federal law with respect to the LIFEGUARD MARKS, whether such cause of action arose before or after the Effective Date of this Covenant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Grunsfeld Decl., Ex. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On February 1, 2019, Plaintiffs provided sworn affidavits clarifying that the Covenant includes \"any lawsuits against Amazon.com or Ebay.com relating to or pertaining to Defendants' sales of any product bearing the LIFEGUARD MARKS\" and\n   to \"any lawsuits against any of Defendants' customers, relating or pertaining to, the purchase of any of Defendants' products on Amazon.com or Ebay.com, bearing the LIFEGUARD MARKS.\" (Azrak Decl. \u00b6 4; Tebele Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the Covenant, Plaintiffs move to voluntarily dismiss their own claims and dismiss Defendants' counterclaims. Plaintiffs contend that the Covenant removes any case or controversy between the parties and therefore deprives the Court of subject matter jurisdiction, eliminates Defendants' standing to assert their counterclaims, and renders Defendants' counterclaims moot. In opposition, Defendants argue that the Covenant was tendered belatedly in bad faith and is not sufficiently robust to moot their counterclaims. In addition to opposing Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss, Defendants seek summary judgment on their second and third counterclaims, contending that the Covenant is new proof of Plaintiffs' constructive abandonment. Defendants also ask for an award of their attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs May Voluntarily Dismiss Their Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A plaintiff's voluntary motion to dismiss their complaint is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a). When, as here, the motion is made after a defendant has answered the complaint and does not stipulate to dismissal, the \"action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). Plaintiffs filed their motion to dismiss long after Defendants asserted their counterclaims. Accordingly, the existence of Defendants' counterclaims ordinarily could pose an impediment to dismissing the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, have simultaneously moved to dismiss all of Defendants' counterclaims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). As explained below, the Court agrees that all counterclaims should be dismissed because the Covenant eliminates any case or controversy, renders the counterclaims moot, and eliminates the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. As the Second Circuit has explained in similar circumstances where a covenant not to sue served as the basis for a motion to dismiss, \"[w]hen a plaintiff seeks to withdraw its claims pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), but another event independently deprives the district court of an Article III case or controversy involving the defendant's counterclaims, Rule 41(a)(2) is irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike, Inc. v.

That is precisely the case here: Plaintiffs' Covenant is an independent event depriving the court of an actionable case or controversy. Accordingly, Rule 41(a)(2) is \"irrelevant,\" and the counterclaims do not stand in the way of dismissing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiffs' Covenant Renders Defendants' Counterclaims Moot and Deprives the Court of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Accordingly, the basis for the Court's subject matter jurisdiction is the Declaratory Judgment Act, which provides in relevant part: \"In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States ... may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"[T]he phrase 'case of actual controversy' in the Act refers to the type of 'Cases' and 'Controversies' that are justiciable under Article III\" of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v.

But that statement gains no more ground for Defendants than did Already's statement that it \"currently has plans to introduce new shoe lines and make modifications to existing shoe lines.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    568 U.S. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, any such product would be covered by the Covenant because it broadly \"precludes [Plaintiffs] from taking further enforcement against Defendants for any past or future infringement of the LIFEGUARD MARKS.\" (Pl. Reply at 9.) Second, as Plaintiffs emphasize (Pl. Reply at 6, 9), Defendants added the \"Lifeguard\" expansion products prior to the end of this litigation. By doing so, Defendants own actions show that even they recognize that the Covenant encompasses such additional products. Third, while bringing its new products to the Court's attention, Defendants nowhere argue that those products would not be covered by the Covenant. Were it otherwise, by expanding their \"Lifeguard\" product line in the absence of coverage, Defendants would only have been strengthening Plaintiffs' argument for willful infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In short, just as Nike did, Plaintiffs have demonstrated \"that the Covenant encompasses all of its allegedly unlawful conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    568 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Given the covenant's broad language, and given that [Ann Arbor] has asserted no concrete plans to engage in conduct not covered by the covenant, we can conclude the case is moot because the challenged conduct cannot be reasonably expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants nevertheless point to five aspects of the Covenant that differ from the Nike covenant, which, Defendants argue, render the Covenant insufficient to moot the parties' controversy underlying Defendants' counterclaims for declaratory judgment. (Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss (\"Def. Mem.\"), at 18-20.) None of these arguments, however, lead to a different outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   First, Defendants fault the Covenant for not covering Ann Arbor's distributors and customers. If, and to the extent that was a deficiency, however, the issue became moot when Plaintiffs provided sworn declarations clarifying the Covenant in this regard. As those declarations explain, the Covenant did not expressly refer to Ann Arbor's distributors because Plaintiffs had understood that Ann Arbor's sole sales channel was to customers purchasing directly through Amazon.com or eBay.com. (Azrak Decl. \u00b6 3; Tebele Decl. \u00b6 4.) Defendants have confirmed that is correct insofar as sales of all of Ann Arbor's Lifeguard merchandise takes place by customers' purchases on Amazon.com and eBay.com. (Kozak Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-29.) Plaintiffs also explained that \"[i]t seemed unnecessary to refer to 'customers' as we assumed it was taken for granted that [Plaintiffs] would never sue Defendants' customers, all of whom purchase Defendants' Lifeguard products in quantities of one or two units or other similar trivial amounts.\" (Azrak Dec. \u00b6 3; Tebele Decl. \u00b6 4.) To lay the issue to rest, Plaintiffs expressly aver that they will not pursue any enforcement action against Amazon.com or Ebay.com or any of Defendants' customers purchasing through Amazon.com or Ebay.com.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that the Covenant does not cover all causes of action asserted by Plaintiffs. The Covenant explicitly refers to trademark infringement, unfair competition, and dilution. Those are the same three causes of action called out in the Nike covenant; although, Plaintiffs here have not alleged a dilution claim. Plaintiffs' five asserted claims are for trademark infringement, trademark counterfeiting, false designation of origin, common law unfair competition, and deceptive business practices under New York law. Defendants thus express concern that the Covenant does not cover the causes of action for trademark counterfeiting, false designation of origin and deceptive business practices. As Plaintiffs point out, however, all of its claims are grounded in trademark infringement even if dressed in a different formal cause of action. Thus, each claim for relief invokes the Lifeguard Trademarks, and several refer explicitly to the products in question as Infringing Merchandise. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 37-41, 44-47, 50-53, 59-61, 66-67.) And, even though not a model of clarity, the Covenant encompasses any action based on or \"involving\" trademark infringement and unfair competition \"with respect to\" the Trademarks. All five of Plaintiffs' claims in this case\n   involve trademark infringement and/or unfair competition related to the Trademarks and are thereby covered by the Covenant. Plaintiffs will be estopped from offering any narrower interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    568 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[Plaintiffs], having taken the position in court that there is no prospect of such [infringing product not covered by the covenant], would be hard pressed to assert the contrary down the road\") (citing\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    532 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, the Covenant does not refer to \"colorable imitations\" of the trademarks litigated in the suit. While such language can be useful, it is not essential in a case like this one as compared to one like\n   <em>\n    Already\n   </em>\n   . Significantly, the asserted trademark in\n   <em>\n    Already\n   </em>\n   was for the specific design of a shoe, not a word mark. The claimed design elements of the mark included the stitching, the shape of the outer panels, and the ridge designs. A would-be infringer could fairly easily tweak some part of the shoe design, thus creating a \"colorable imitation\" of the registered design. Here, however, the Trademarks include two that have no design limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the registrations are for the basic word mark \"LIFEGUARD\" regardless of font, color or other aspects of design. Accordingly, \"colorable imitations\" are of minimal concern, if any. It is difficult to imagine, for example, that Defendants would market products bearing a word such as \"LITEGUARD\" or some other misspelling, and Defendants certainly have stated no such intention to do so. The absence of the phrase \"or colorable imitations\" from the Covenant therefore is of no consequence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Fourth, Defendants contend that Ann Arbor \"has demonstrated concrete plans to sell goods that go beyond what was sold prior to this suit.\" (Def. Mem. at 19.) The Court has addressed this above in analyzing whether Plaintiffs have met their burden. As explained, by already offering those additional products for sale, Defendants have demonstrated their own comfort in doing so with the Covenant in hand; and, regardless, the question is not whether Defendants plan to sell products not sold prior to suit, but rather, whether those goods would not be covered by the Covenant. As set forth above, they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Defendants make much of the fact that Plaintiffs offered the Covenant just short of trial, whereas the covenants in Nike and other cases were offered at earlier points in time. That may be so, but that fact is not relevant to the question of whether the Covenant is sufficient in scope to moot the parties' case or controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    568 U.S. at 99-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying availability of fee-shifting as a check on abusive litigation practices);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort James Corp. v.

Accordingly, a defendant may be awarded attorneys' fees in a Lanham Act case if: (1) the defendant is the prevailing party and (2) the case is exceptional.

The dismissal of Defendants' counterclaims as moot does not change the calculus because, as a result of the litigation, Defendants will never face an infringement action or claim by Plaintiffs involving the Trademarks at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

The case does not \"stand out\" from others with respect to the strength of Plaintiffs' litigation position or the manner in which it was litigated. On the merits, Plaintiffs' claims were premised on long-standing trademarks that had obtained incontestable status. None of Plaintiffs' claims were dismissed on summary judgment, and the District Judge denied summary judgment to Defendants on their affirmative defenses of fair use and abandonment, meaning that a reasonable juror could find for the Plaintiffs on those defenses. That is also the case for Defendants' assertion that the Lifeguard Trademarks are generic and no longer protectable; indeed, the District Judge directed the parties not to move for summary judgment on that issue because it was a disputed material issue of fact warranting being decided by a jury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 229 at 2.) And whereas Defendants did not succeed on any aspect of its motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs successfully secured dismissal of several of Defendants' more tenuous affirmative defenses. On this record, there is nothing exceptional that makes the case stand out from any other hard-fought trademark infringement case where the facts and legal outcome are hotly disputed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otokoyama Co. Ltd. v. Wine of Japan Import Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"151932\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/7/112/#p115\">\n    7 F.

Campaniello Imports, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478049\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/82/136/#p140\">\n    82 F.Supp.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140, 148-49 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (although jury found bad faith, court declined to award fees because defendant's litigation decisions were \"justifiable,\" and the plaintiffs had not prevailed on every issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Perhaps that is why Defendants train their sights primarily on what they contend is Plaintiffs' unreasonable, bad faith litigation conduct as a basis to find this case exceptional. Here too, however, Defendants' arguments fail. Defendants first chide Plaintiffs for having \"fully litigated\" the case by bringing in individual owners and seeking statutory damages exceeding\n   two million dollars. (Def. Mem. at 23.) This Court is not aware of any case deeming a case exceptional because a party has \"fully\" litigated (as compared to, say, over-litigated). While one of Ann Arbor's two owners was dismissed from the case, the other was not. And the amount of Plaintiffs' demand is not unreasonable nor particularly salient - the amount of the demand does not alter the need to litigate damages, and, in any event, the amount of damages would for the factfinder to determine regardless of Plaintiffs' demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants next take Plaintiffs to task for forcing Defendants to file multiple motions to compel that were largely successful, moving to exclude Defendants' experts, and lodging objections to the Magistrate Judge's orders. (Def. Mem. at 23.) Defendants far distort the record. Defendants' motions to compel were both denied and granted in part. (Dkt. 73, 103.) Meanwhile, the Court denied Defendants' request for sanctions in connection with both motions and denied sanctions yet again when Defendants moved for contempt. (Dkt. 73 at 12-13; 103 at 14; 162 at 9-10.) Although the Court rejected some of Plaintiffs' arguments, the Court nevertheless found them to have \"substantial justification\" (Dkt. 73 at 13), while finding (in one motion) that Defendants did not always \"have its facts exactly right\" (Dkt. 162 at 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the experts, both parties moved to exclude, both parties lost, and both parties objected to the rulings against them. (Dkt. 134, 152, 182.) Meanwhile, Defendants ignore that their motion to dismiss was denied to the extent not rendered moot (Dkt. 88), and Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion was comparatively more successful than was Defendants' motion. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 229 at 14-19) (dismissing several of Defendants' defenses as lacking any support). In short, Plaintiffs' litigation conduct was no less, and perhaps more, reasonable than Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Lastly, Defendants charge Plaintiffs with bad faith for their \"more recent conduct.\" (Def. Mem. at 23.) Although Defendants set forth five such instances, they boil down to two, both of which concern the Covenant not to sue: (1) regarding content, Plaintiffs changed the wording of the Nike covenant to water it down, yet represented to the Court that Plaintiffs' Covenant was \"largely identical\" to Nike's, and (2) regarding timing, Plaintiffs waited to provide the Covenant until after Defendants had already incurred the expense of preparing for trial, while defaulting on Plaintiffs' own obligations to file trial materials. (Def. Mem. at 23-24.) None of these allegations amount to bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court already has addressed the content differences above in finding the Covenant sufficient to moot the counterclaims. Despite the different wording, the two covenants are largely identical in effect. Moreover, Exhibits 1 and 2 to counsel's declaration in support of Plaintiffs' motion are the Lifeguard Covenant and the Nike covenant respectively. Plaintiffs did not hide anything from the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As for the timing, the Court agrees that it might have been handled better. While Plaintiffs sought an expedited conference with the Court to discuss the Covenant and their impending motion to dismiss, they still contributed to a scenario in which Defendants expended resources on completing pretrial filings and Plaintiffs did not. In an optimal setting, Plaintiffs might have found a way to more efficiently address the matter with Defendants to see if they would join in holding off on trial preparation pending filing and determination of Plaintiffs' motion. That said, however, Defendants have offered nothing that suggests the timing was motivated by bad faith. Plaintiffs took a huge risk in deciding not to prepare and file trial materials. If their motion failed, they could well have been left facing trial, without the benefit of any opposition to Defendants' motions in limine, having waived objections to Defendants' exhibits and deposition designations, and the like. Plaintiffs chose where to concentrate their resources. While not providing Defendants that same opportunity, Plaintiffs' conduct hardly rises to the level of misconduct that would make for an exceptional case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted earlier, the Court is aware that Plaintiffs did not provide the Covenant until the case was at the precipice of trial. In\n   <em>\n    Nike v. Already\n   </em>\n   , both the District Court and Second Circuit denied awarding attorneys' fees to the defendant, and in finding the case not to be exceptional, both courts noted that the plaintiff's voluntary dismissal came early in the litigation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881358\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/89/#p94\">\n    663 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20310321\">\n    2011 WL 310321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. The Supreme Court did not address attorneys' fees in\n   <em>\n    Already v. Nike\n   </em>\n   , but it did note that the Lanham Act's fee-shifting provision for exceptional cases was a \"check on abusive litigation practices.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    568 U.S. at 99-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One could reasonably suggest that a fee award would be appropriate where a \"repentant\" party gives a covenant to sue but delays in doing so to force the other party to expend further resources on the litigation while the covenantor does not. The fee award could be limited to fees incurred during the delay period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such an award would further the \"exceptional case\" factors of compensating the party who expended resources and deterring bad actors who gratuitously run up their adversary's legal costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But, as noted, the record here does not support a finding that Plaintiffs' conduct was abusive or motivated to inflict unnecessary cost on Defendants. Defendants emphasize that Plaintiffs \"knew that they were going to present a covenant not to sue at least as early as August 29, 2018\" but did not request a pre-motion conference until almost two months later. (Def. Mem. at 20.) Defendants overlook that as of August 29, 2018, they too \"knew that [Plaintiffs] were going to present a covenant not to sue;\" indeed, Defendants' counsel admits that Plaintiffs' counsel informed them of that fact on August 29 during a phone conversation. (Heed Decl. \u00b6 24.) Had Defendants been concerned about proceeding with trial preparations while waiting for the forthcoming covenant, Defendants could have conferred with Plaintiffs or made a motion to the Court to address the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In short, this case is not exceptional and does not warrant exercise of the Court's discretion to award attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I recommend (i) dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice pursuant to Fed.
