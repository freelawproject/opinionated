(\"Impulse\"), and Insperity PEO Services, L.P. (\"Insperity\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") raising a single claim of retaliation in violation of the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (\"Mot.\") (Doc. 9), to which Plaintiff has filed an Opposition (\"Opp'n\") (Doc. 11) and Defendants have filed a Reply (Doc. 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case concerns reports of alleged irregularities during clinical testing of the Optimizer, an investigational medical device used to treat chronic heart failure. Impulse, the Optimizer's developer, remains in the final stages of the FDA approval process. (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8.) Insperity is Impulse's human resources provider. (\u00b6 4.) Clinical testing of the Optimizer in the United States began in 2005, with the FIX-HF-5 study. (\u00b6 9.) When FIX-HF-5 failed to reach its primary efficacy endpoint, Impulse designed and sponsored a second study, FIX-HF-5C, to prospectively confirm its results. (\u00b6\u00b6 9-12.) FIX-HF-5C's development included the submission of protocols to the FDA. (\u00b6 13.) The FDA approved, and Impulse affirmed that it would conduct the trial in accordance with those protocols. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Among other things, the protocols prohibited Impulse employees from directly recruiting or administering testing to study participants. (\u00b6 14.) The protocols also included a metric, known as the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (\"MLHFQ\"), used to measure the Optimizer's effect on quality of life. (\u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 1, 2016, Plaintiff began working for Defendants as a Senior Field Clinical Engineer. (\u00b6 20.) One of Plaintiff's duties included the removal of barriers impeding site enrollments for FIX-HF-5C. (\u00b6 21.) This involved advocating for potential subject recruitment at clinical sites and helping to increase randomization of subjects for trial participation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff trained site investigators and coordinators on the study protocols, provided case support for site surgeons and staff during implants, and followed up with subjects. (\u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's retaliation claim concerns an incident at a clinical site in Mesa, Arizona. On August 9, Plaintiff witnessed another clinical engineer, Jason Kindler, verbally administer the MLHFQ to a subject and record the subject's responses. (\u00b6 26.) The protocols provided that a clinical site coordinator would administer the test, with the subject writing his or her answers on the questionnaire. (\u00b6 27.) Concerned that administration of the MLHFQ by an Impulse employee might skew test results, Plaintiff reported it to her supervisor, Anthony Caforio, who had also witnessed the incident. (\u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) After Plaintiff said this \"was not right,\" Kindler observed, \"You do what you have to do to get patients randomized.\" (\u00b6 29.) Caforio did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff later learned that a site coordinator had also complained to Angela Stagg, Implulse's Clinical Manager, about Kindler. (\u00b6 30.) The site coordinator claimed that Kindler had pressured her to rush subjects through testing to get subjects randomized more quickly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff believes she was subject to increased scrutiny and criticism for reasons unrelated to her job performance after she reported Kindler. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-44.) On September 28, Caforio sent an email to Plaintiff placing her on a 30-day disciplinary notice period stating that failure to improve would lead to further disciplinary action or termination. (\u00b6 40.) The notice cited Plaintiff for insubordination related to expense reports, failure to split a $ 1,500 client dinner bill with Kindler, and unprofessional comments and behavior during that dinner. (\u00b6 40.) Copying members of upper management, Plaintiff responded with an email to Cafario disputing the underlying allegations. (\u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then elevated her concerns to upper management at Impulse. On September 29, Plaintiff called Vice President of Human Resources Nitsan Mor. She reported that Caforio and Kindler had failed to follow applicable protocols at the Mesa site and that Caforio had since retaliated against her for reporting the issue. (\u00b6 45.) They also discussed the details of the 30-day warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She raised the same issues in a discussion with Vice President of Clinical Operations Norbert Clemens on October 4. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Clemens told Plaintiff they would discuss the issue further in person. (\u00b6 47.) On October 12, Plaintiff sent another email to Clemens, Mor, and Chief Executive Officer Simos Kedikoglou describing her concerns about Kindler and Caforio's protocol violations and reiterating her belief that Caforio was retaliating against her for reporting them. (\u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) Plaintiff reported these concerns because she believed Impulse would submit unreliable data to the FDA for approval of the Optimizer. (\u00b6 50.) Clemens responded on October 19, stating that Impulse took her complaints seriously and would handle them with care. (\u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Insperity Human Resources Specialist Erin Lau followed up with Plaintiff on November 9. In a phone call, Plaintiff and Lau discussed the conduct witnessed August 9, her immediate complaint to Caforio, her concerns about the impact of Kindler's conduct, and the alleged retaliation she experienced thereafter. (\u00b6 52.) The following day, Plaintiff met with Clemens and an outside auditor hired by Impulse to ensure all FDA-required paperwork was complete. (\u00b6 54.) During their conversation, Clemens suggested that Plaintiff's concerns were \"made up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Clemens also concluded that the allegations underlying Caforio's 30-day warning were unfounded. (\u00b6 56.) Plaintiff is unaware of the extent of the auditor's investigation, though she questions its sufficiency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff was terminated on December 9. In a phone call, Caforio and Mor told Plaintiff she was being terminated in part\n   for reporting false accusations about Caforio and Kindler. (\u00b6 63.) A termination letter dated December 12 and signed by Lau reiterated that a reason for termination included \"[f]alse reporting of serious accusations\" against Caforio and Kindler. (\u00b6 64.) On February 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed this matter alleging that Defendants violated the FCA's anti-retaliation provision. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Defendants now seek dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants' motion focuses on a single issue-namely, whether Plaintiff's reports about protocol violations constitute protected activity under the FCA. Defendants think not. Defendants argue that (1) to the extent Plaintiff alleges Defendants' protocol violations run afoul of FDA regulations, Plaintiff's failure to specify a regulation is fatal to her claim; and (2) more fundamentally, Plaintiff has not shown that her complaints relate to conduct one might reasonably consider an FCA violation. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard for Rule 12(b)(6) Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

Should Defendants rely on that data to obtain FDA approval and become eligible for government funds, subsequent claims for reimbursement\n   would plausibly be considered false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n    at 904, 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That FDA approval was then and remains pending bears little significance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in \u00a7 3730(h) requires a completed false claim before protected activity may occur. In fact, the statute's protection of \"efforts to stop\" FCA violations suggests Congress aimed to protect efforts not merely to expose existing fraud, but to prevent future violations as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1).

Worse still, it would merely encourage the swift termination of potential whistleblowers. Were an employee's investigation only to reveal a still-developing scheme to defraud the government, an employer would be free to terminate the employee without fear of liability while simultaneously allowing the scheme's development to proceed unabated. Absent statutory language or case law allowing for such a perverse incentive, the Court declines to so limit \u00a7 3730(h) here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants correctly note that reports of regulatory violations alone are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n    862 F.3d at 899, 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as the Ninth Circuit reiterated in\n   <em>\n    Campie\n   </em>\n   , the \"fatal defect\" in such cases is not the presence of a regulatory violation, but the absence of a connection between that violation and a false claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n    at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). Plaintiff's retaliation claim suffers no such defect. She alleges that she reported protocol violations which, if left uncorrected, she believed would lead to the submission of false data to the FDA, whose approval is essential to federal funding and reimbursement programs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67-73.) Taking those allegations as true, the Court finds that an adequate nexus exists between those violations and the submission, albeit in the future, of a false claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants' attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Campie\n   </em>\n   are unavailing. They argue that the plaintiffs there, who alleged FCA violations based on false statements made to\n   secure FDA approval, \"alleged far more\" than Plaintiff does here. (Mot. at 10.) This is true.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants are correct: the FCA is not an all-purpose whistleblower protection statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hopper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047518\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1261/#p1269\">\n    91 F.3d at 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The submission of a false statement or claim signifies fraud's end, not its beginning. When an employee reports what she in good faith believes-and reasonably appears-to be the onset of fraud, then, her conduct is no less protected than that of the employee who witnesses that scheme come to fruition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p907\">\n    862 F.3d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
