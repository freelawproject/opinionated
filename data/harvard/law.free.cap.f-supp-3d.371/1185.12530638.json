[Doc. 21]. After consideration of both motions, the Parties' respective responses and replies, all matters of record and the Parties' oral arguments before this Court on February 13, 2019, the Court enters the following ORDER.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of the case, which are taken from the Administrative Record (AR), are undisputed. On April 13, 2016, Dormekeal Lann (Decedent), husband of Plaintiff, died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. [AR45-46]. At the time of his death, the Decedent was an employee of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (\"I.E.\") [AR92] and a participant in I.E.'s Health and Welfare Benefits Plan (the Plan) [AR19], which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Plan was funded by Group Policy No. 158248-1-G issued by Defendant to I.E. [AR377-477].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Decedent enrolled in basic life insurance, supplemental life insurance, and AD &amp; D insurance coverage. [AR19]. Plaintiff, the Decedent's surviving spouse and beneficiary, submitted claims for basic life, supplemental life, and AD &amp; D benefits under the Plan. [AR43-109]. Defendant approved and paid Plaintiff's claim for basic life benefits, but denied her claims for supplemental life and AD &amp; D benefits because, among other reasons, the Gwinnett County Medical Examiner determined,\n   after an autopsy, that the Decedent committed suicide. Plaintiff disputed these findings and submitted an administrative appeal of the denial. [AR12-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The official death certificate was completed by Carol A. Terry, MD, ME, Gwinnett County Medical Examiner, who confirmed the Decedent's date of death as April 13, 2016, and the \"immediate cause of death\" as \"contact gunshot wound of head, delayed effects.\" [AR45]. Under the heading \"describe how injury occurred,\" Dr. Terry stated: \"shot self with handgun,\" and under \"accident, suicide, homicide, undetermined (specify)\" Dr. Terry wrote: \"suicide.\" [Id.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Medical Examiner's Report contained an Investigative Report completed by the Medical Examiner's Investigator, Robert Bumgardner, and an autopsy report completed by Dr. Terry. [AR51-59]. Mr. Bumgardner's report stated that he interviewed Plaintiff via telephone on April 14, 2016, and recorded the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mrs. Lann said the decedent was cleaning his gun the evening of April 13, 2016, at the kitchen table. Mrs Lann said that the decedent inserted the ammunition clip in the gun several times while walking to the bathroom down a hallway of the residence. Mrs. Lann said she heard the gunshot go off and found the decedent partially in the bathroom and partially in the hallway. Mrs. Lann stated that the projectile struck the bathroom wall and was a few inches shorter than the height of the decedent. Mrs. Lann said there were no domestic problems in the marriage. Mrs. Lann said there had been no fighting the night of the incident. Mrs. Lann stated that the decedent had consumed an alcoholic beverage before the incident. Mrs. Lann said that the decedent was in the Air Force in the past and was somewhat familiar with handguns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Mr. Bumgardner opined that \"the decedent died as a result of a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head,\" but deferred to the Medical Examiner for determination of the \"cause and manner of death.\" [AR53].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Terry's autopsy report noted a \"[c]ontact-range entrance wound of [the] right temple with associated soot deposition,\" and that the \"[w]ound path is right-to-left and minimally front-to-back, perforating [the] head.\" [AR58]. Dr. Terry identified the \"cause of death\" as \"contact gunshot wound of head, delayed effects,\" and the \"manner of death\" as \"suicide.\" [AR59]. She also rendered the following opinion based on the autopsy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This 39-year-old black male, Dormekeal Kormel Lann, died as a result of a gunshot wound of the head. The range of fire was contact. Since the firearm was pressed against the subject's head at the time that it was discharged, this action is considered to be innately self destructive, therefore, the manner of death is certified as 'suicide.' [Id.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff disputes the finding of suicide and characterizes the Decedent's death as an accident. [AR 43]. Plaintiff hired an expert witness, Kris Sperry, MD, who opined that the Decedent's \"act of putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger was stupid, a mistake, or a combination of both but was not an intentional act to end his life.\" [AR65]. According to Dr. Sperry, the Decedent's \"plans involving meeting with friends in two days, making plans to remodel a portion of the house and purchasing a new car, asking his wife to warm his dinner in the oven, and numerous other details including a new job which he loved, a raise in income, and a wife and daughter who were the loves of his life, - collectively, leads to the conclusion that\" the Decedent's death was accidental. [Id.]. Dr. Sperry also criticized Dr. Terry's conclusions\n   based on her autopsy as \"a form of cognitive bias,\" and declared that Dr. Terry \"did not interview anyone, including Felicia Lann.\" [AR63-64].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff also submitted affidavits from Plaintiff, the Decedent's mother, and two friends of the Decedent in further support of Plaintiff's claim that Decedent's death was an accident. In her affidavit, Plaintiff discussed the Decedent's demeanor and conduct on the night of his death, stating \"[t]here was nothing in [the Decedent's] demeanor, speech, or attitude on that night that was anything but normal. He was happy. We were making plans to go on vacation. We were making plans to finish, the basement .... He had a conference call with two of his best friends on the way home, and they were making plans to get together on that Friday night. He was in a good mood, and he told me he was hungry and to keep dinner warm until he put his gun away.\" [AR 95]. Plaintiff stated the Decedent \"went through basic training\" in the Air Force, but claimed \"he did not have any knowledge or experience with firearms.\" [AR93]. Plaintiff declared that it was \"absolutely impossible that [the Decedent] intentionally shot himself,\" and speculated that \"the only rational explanation is that maybe [the Decedent] was about to pose in front of the mirror and this tragic accident was the result of his forgetting or not realizing that he had chambered a bullet or he tripped and fell on his way to putting the gun in the bedroom closet.\" [AR96].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Decedent's friends, Tony Robinson and Tyrone Boone, discussed their \"conference call\" with the Decedent the afternoon of his death, both saying he sounded \"normal and happy\" and that they made plans to meet in a few days. [AR99; AR102]. Both also declared that they met the Decedent in the Air Force, and he had \"no pistol training in the Air Force.\" [AR98; AR103]. The Decedent's mother, Martha Woodward, stated that the Decedent was \"raised in the church,\" and \"had never been around guns growing up and had no experience with them, as far as [she knew].\" [AR105-106].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant considered the material submitted by Plaintiff and determined that basic life insurance benefits were payable. [AR12-13]. Defendant paid Plaintiff $ 60,124.05, including $ 56,000 in basic life benefits and $ 4,124.05 in interest. [AR01; AR375]. By letter dated December 23, 2016, Defendant informed Plaintiff that Plaintiff's claims for supplemental life and AD &amp; D benefits were denied because the Decedent committed suicide, within two years of the effective date of coverage. [AR112-113]. Defendant informed Plaintiff of the right to appeal, and emphasized that it would \"reconsider the claim\" if Plaintiff provided \"an amended Death Certificate and Autopsy Report showing the manner of death as an accident.\" [Id.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Plaintiff appealed Defendant's determinations, arguing that (1) the death certificate was not \"admissible in court,\" (2) the federal common law presumption against suicide precluded Defendant's benefit denials, and (3) the Decedent's subjective intent to commit suicide was key to determining his cause of death. [AR114-120]. Plaintiff also stated that she attempted to have Dr. Terry amend the death certificate and autopsy report, but Dr. Terry would not consider any \"non-scientific\" information. [Id.]. Plaintiff further asserts that Dr. Terry's office indicated that an investigation into the state of mind or intent of the deceased is unnecessary when determining whether a death by gun is accident or suicide. [Id.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff provided a second affidavit of Dr. Sperry, who opined that the Decedent's \"intent\" was necessary to determine the cause of death, and that the \"affidavits\n   of family and close friends\" showed \"there was no intent\" to commit suicide. [AR133]. Also enclosed was a copy of the\n   <em>\n    Medical Examiners' and Coroners' Handbook On Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting\n   </em>\n   (2003), indicating that a determination of suicide may include an assessment of whether the decedent \"intended to kill [him]self or wished to die.\" [AR116]. Defendant states that this additional material was considered, but determined it was insufficient to overturn its benefit determinations. [AR329].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By letter dated June 22, 2017, Defendant informed Plaintiff that its determinations were upheld, emphasizing that its reliance on the Medical Examiner's determination of suicide was not arbitrary and capricious. [AR332-334]. Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to consider all of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff indicating that the Decedent's death was an accident and was therefore arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 7, 2017, having exhausted her administrative remedies, Plaintiff filed suit pursuant to ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 502(a)(3) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), seeking payment of the policies. [Doc.1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Applicable Terms of the Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Basic life insurance, supplemental life insurance, and AD &amp; D benefits under the Plan were funded by Group Policy No. 158248-01-G (\"the Group Policy\"), issued by Defendant, MetLife to I.E. [Ex. 1, Affidavit of Pati Casey; Ex. 2, administrative record, AR377-477.] The Plan grants MetLife \"discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Any interpretation or determination made pursuant to such discretionary authority shall be given full force and effect, unless it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious.\" [Ex. 2 at AR474.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the heading \"Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance,\" the Plan provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If You or a Dependent sustain an accidental injury that is the Direct and Sole Cause of a Covered Loss described in the SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS, Proof of the accidental injury and Covered Loss must be sent to [MetLife]. When [MetLife] receive[s] such Proof [MetLife] will review the claim and, if [MetLife] approve[s] it, will pay the insurance in effect on the date of the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Direct and Sole\n   </strong>\n   Cause means that the Covered Loss occurs within 12 months of the date of the accidental injury and was a direct result of the accidental injury, independent of other causes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [Ex. 2 at AR455]. The Plan makes clear that MetLife \"will not pay [AD &amp; D] benefits ... for any loss caused or contributed to by ... suicide or attempted suicide [or] intentionally self-inflicted injury ....\" [Id.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Regarding life insurance benefits, the Plan provides: \"When We receive [a] claim form and Proof, We will review the claim and, if We approve it, We will pay benefits subject to the terms and provisions of this certificate and the Group Policy.\" [AR464]. Under the heading \"Suicide,\" the Plan states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    For Supplemental Life\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    If You commit suicide\n   </strong>\n   within 2 years from the date Life Insurance for You takes effect, [MetLife] will not pay such insurance and [its] liability will be limited as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 any premium paid by You will be returned to the Beneficiary; and\n   \u2022 any premium paid by the Policyholder will be returned to the Policyholder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [AR467].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Proof\" is defined by the Plan as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Written evidence satisfactory to [MetLife] that a person has satisfied the conditions and requirements for any benefit described in this certificate. When a claim is made for any benefit described in this certificate, Proof must establish:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 the nature and extent of the loss and condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 [MetLife's] obligation to pay the claim; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 the claimant's right to receive payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Proof must be provided at the claimant's expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [AR 422].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
