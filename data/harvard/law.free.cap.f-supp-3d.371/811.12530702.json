Under that provision, HCC's executive officers and directors, HCC's volunteer workers, and HCC's employees are also insureds. [Policy at 19.] HCRA and KCC are separate organizations that do not meet any definition of an additional insured under the Policy. Even if HCC has members, the Underlying Complaint does not allege, and there has been no evidence presented that either HCRA or KCC is a member of HCC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Member Endorsement does not apply. Further, because there is no evidence of a written contract or agreement between either HCC and KCC or HCC and HCRA, the Contract/Agreement Endorsement does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Based on the foregoing, there are no genuine issues of material fact, and it\n   would be impossible for the Underlying Plaintiffs to prevail on a claim that is covered by the Policy because neither HCRA nor KCC is an insured under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dairy Rd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263587\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/92/398/#p411\">\n    92 Hawai'i at 107-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, as a matter of law, Great Divide does not have a duty to defend either HCRA or KCC.

[Gallagher Decl., Exh. A (Underlying Complaint) at \u00b6 8.] In the course of the Underlying Action, Stevens admitted that he was hired by Catherine Bellafiore (\"Bellafiore\"). [Motion CSOF at \u00b6 30; Countermotion CSOF at pg. 3 (admitting that Great Divide's \u00b6 30 accurately refers to Stevens' answers to interrogatories); Gallagher Decl., Exh. C (Stevens's response to the Underlying Plaintiffs' 3/6/18 request for answers to interrogatories, dated 5/1/18 by Stevens's counsel).] There is no evidence in the record that Bellafiore was an employee, servant, or agent of HCC.

To the extent the Underlying Complaint alleges Stevens was an employee, servant, or agent of HCC, acting within the scope of his employment, he would be an insured under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy at 19, \u00a7 II.2.a. However, in that instance, the Watercraft Exclusion would apply because Kalei-Imaizumi's claims in the Underlying Action would allege \" 'bodily injury' ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy at 14, \u00a7 2.g.

Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, the absence of a duty to defend also means Great Divide does not have a duty to indemnify Stevens.

The Club Defendants first argue the Events Exclusion does not preclude coverage because, based on the allegations of the Underlying Complaint, there is a possibility that the Events Exclusion is inapplicable to the claims in the Underlying Action because the 2016 Pailolo Challenge was not \"managed, operated or sponsored by\" HCC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Club Defendants admit that the Underlying Complaint alleges the 2016 Pailolo Challenge was the tenth time HCC had \"hosted, organized and/or staged\" the Challenge. [Motion CSOF at \u00b6 4; Countermotion CSOF at pg. 2; Underlying Complaint at \u00b6 14.] They also admit that the Underlying Complaint alleges HCC: \"provided substantial labor and materials necessary to host, organize and stage the 2016 Pailolo Challenge\"; and \"had substantial control over and involvement in the staging of the race,\" including personnel decision, as well as the determination and enforcement of race rules and regulations. [Motion CSOF at \u00b6 6; Countermotion CSOF at pg. 2; Underlying Complaint at\n   \u00b6 17.] However, the Club Defendants emphasize that the 2016 Pailolo Challenge's marine ocean water event permit identifies HCRA as the Challenge's sponsor. Further, the Underlying Plaintiffs allege: \"HCRA was an event sponsor, host and/or an organizer of the 2016 Pailolo Challenge\"; [Underlying Complaint at \u00b6 6;] and KCC or its affiliate retained Stevens's services for the Challenge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Even resolving all doubts in favor of HCC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sentinel Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260744\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/76/277/#p291\">\n    76 Hawai'i at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260744\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/76/277/#p291\">\n    875 P.2d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Underlying Complaint's allegations merely suggest that: HCRA was the sponsor of the 2016 Pailolo Challenge; KCC hired Stevens for the Challenge; although not the sponsor, HCC was the host of the Challenge; and, as the host, HCC had significant responsibilities. The fact that HCC was not the sponsor of the 2016 Pailolo Challenge does not render the Events Exclusion inapplicable because the exclusion only requires that the activity be one that the insured \"manage[s], operate[s],\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   sponsor[s].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy at 45 (emphasis added). The Events Exclusion applies if the insured does any one of the three things. The terms \"manage\" and \"operate\" are interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meanings because the Policy does not indicate that different meanings were intended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dairy Rd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263587\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/92/398/#p411\">\n    92 Hawai'i at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263587\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/92/398/#p411\">\n    992 P.2d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Underlying Complaint's description of HCC's duties in hosting the 2016 Pailolo Challenge fall within the plain and ordinary meaning of \"manage\" and \"operate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 1103-04 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"manage\" as: \"1. To exercise executive, administrative, and supervisory powers. 2. To conduct, control, carry on, or supervise. 3. To regulate or administer a use or expenditure.\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1580-81 (2002) (defining \"operate\" as including: \"to perform a work or labor: expert power or influence: produce an effect\"; and \"to cause to occur: bring about by or as if by the exertion of positive effort or influence\"). Thus, there is no question that the factual allegations of the Underlying Complaint support Great Divide's position that the 2016 Pailolo Challenge was an activity that HCC managed or operated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Club Defendants make much of paragraph 102 of the Underlying Complaint, which alleges: \"HCRA, HCC and/or KCC had a duty to exercise reasonable care in sponsoring, hosting, organizing, planning, staging and/\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   managing the 2016 Pailolo Challenge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Underlying Complaint at pg. 24 (emphasis added).] The Club Defendants argue the use of \"or\" in paragraph 102 can be interpreted to mean that HCC did not do any of those things, and therefore it is possible that the Events Exclusion does not apply. [Countermotion at 12-13.] The Club Defendants' argument is misplaced. The term \"or\" is used in the context of \"HCRA, HCC and/or KCC\n   <strong>\n    had a duty\n   </strong>\n   ,\" [Underlying Complaint at \u00b6 102 (emphasis added),] which may mean that HCC did not have a duty. The allegation that HCC did not have a duty is a conclusory assertion of\n   law that is contrary to the factual allegations of the Underlying Complaint regarding HCC's duties related to HCC's hosting of the 2016 Pailolo Challenge. The conclusory assertion that HCC did not have a duty is not enough to negate the factual allegations which support Great Divide's position that the 2016 Pailolo Challenge was an activity that HCC managed or operated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

In the instant case, when Kalei-Imaizumi was injured, the race had already started, although the crew she was a part of was still in the staging area. Further, she swam out to the Ohana and boarded it as part of her duties as a switch crew member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Complaint at \u00b6 23. Before the Ohana began escorting its designated canoe, Kalei-Imaizumi was injured while attempting to reboard the Ohana after reentering the water to retrieve Stevens's hat. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.] The instant case is similar to\n   <em>\n    MAMGA\n   </em>\n   because the act the injured party was engaged in when the injury occurred (Tyer helping other participants dismount float and Kalei-Imaizumi reboarding the canoe) happened outside of the injured party's participation in the event (Tyer's parade was over and Kalei-Imaizumi's switch crew had not left the staging area). Nevertheless, the act was inextricably related to the injured party's participation in the event. In order for Tyer and other participants to ride atop a float during the parade, they had to dismount at some point; and, after Kalei-Imaizumi reentered the water, in order for her to participate in the Challenge, she had to reboard the Ohana and rejoin the switch crew. The reason why she reentered the water is irrelevant to the analysis of whether the Events Exclusion applies. Based on the\n   <em>\n    MAMGA\n   </em>\n   analysis, the claims arising from Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries are not covered, based on \"the clear, unambiguous language of the Events Exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204269184\">\n    2010 WL 4269184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The result is the same under the\n   <em>\n    Westville Riding\n   </em>\n   four-part analysis.

However, the result would be the same, even if the supreme court applied the\n   <em>\n    Oahu Transit\n   </em>\n   automobile exclusion analysis, as modified to reflect the fact that the instant case involves an event exclusion and not an\n   automobile exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260860\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/231/\">\n    107 Hawai'i at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260860\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/231/\">\n    112 P.3d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   First, the 2016 Pailolo Challenge was an active accessory in causing Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries because the Ohana was hired to be an escort vessel for the race team that Kalei-Imaizumi was a part of, and Kalei-Imaizumi had to be aboard the Ohana as part of her duties with her team's switch crew. Second, there was no independent act breaking the causal link between the event and Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries. Stevens's hat blowing into the water and Kalei-Imaizumi reentering the water to retrieve the hat did not break this causal link because, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in the\n   <em>\n    MAMGA\n   </em>\n   analysis, the reason why Kalei-Imaizumi reentered the water is irrelevant because Kalei-Imaizumi needed to reboard the Ohana in order to compete in the 2016 Pailolo Challenge. Even if this Court is required to consider the reason why Kalei-Imaizumi reentered the water, her decision to retrieve the hat did not break the causal link because it was foreseeable. In an open ocean canoe race utilizing escort boats, it is foreseeable that: an item in a vessel may fall off into the water; someone on the vessel may enter the water to retrieve the item; and the person would have to reboard the vessel after retrieving the item. Third, Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries resulted from the event's intended purpose. The Ohana was a race escort vessel and one of its duties was to transport the Kalei-Imaizumi's switch crew. In order to be transported by the Ohana, Kalei-Imaizumi had to get in and out of the vessel.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oahu Transit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260860\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/231/\">\n    107 Hawai'i at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260860\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/231/\">\n    112 P.3d at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Applying the\n   <em>\n    Oahu Transit\n   </em>\n   factors, Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries arose out of the 2016 Pailolo Challenge, which this Court has previously found was an event managed or operated by HCC. Therefore, even if the Hawai'i Supreme Court held that the\n   <em>\n    Oahu Transit\n   </em>\n   analysis applies to insurance provisions like the Events Exclusion in this case, the Events Exclusion would still preclude coverage for the claims against HCC arising from Kalei-Imaizumi's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Ruling\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   There are no genuine issues of material fact, and it is impossible for the Underlying Plaintiffs to prevail on a claim against HCC that is covered by the Policy because either the Watercraft Exclusion or the Events Exclusion applies. Therefore, as a matter of law, Great Divide does not have a duty to defend HCC. Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, the absence of a duty to defend also means Great Divide does not have a duty to indemnify HCC. Summary judgment is granted to Great Divide as to these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, Great Divide's Motion for Summary Judgment, filed November 8, 2018, is HEREBY GRANTED and this Court CONCLUDES that Great Divide does not have a duty to defend, nor a duty to indemnify, Defendants.
