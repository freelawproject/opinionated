Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Commodities Exchange Act (\"CEA\") and the Sherman Act by unlawfully manipulating the price of Cotton No. 2 futures contracts via unreasonable and uneconomical delivery demands and other manipulative practices. Plaintiffs argue they suffered losses in liquidating their positions in May and July 2011 Cotton No. 2 futures contracts as a result of Defendants' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Amended Complaint on September 12, 2012.

The SCAC alleged Defendants fraudulently and uneconomically manipulated Cotton Futures prices, contracts, and deliveries relating to a May 2011 Contract and a July 2011 Contract, resulting in the \"largest ever cotton squeeze\" in market history. SCAC p. 10. The relevant time period for the May 2011 Contract consists of March 30, 2011 through May 6, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The relevant window for the July Contract spans from June 7, 2011 through July 7, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the SCAC, Allen and Satullo were the named Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCAC. Between June 7, 2011 and July 7, 2011, Satullo was the only named Plaintiff who claimed to have personally transacted in the July Contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Defendants moved to dismiss the SCAC on December 20, 2013. ECF No. 80. In partially denying Defendants Motion to Dismiss, this Court held that the facts, as alleged in the SCAC, were sufficient to state a CEA manipulation claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The remainder of 2013, the entirety of 2014 and 2015, and a good portion of 2016 were occupied by discovery, the facts of which are irrelevant to the instant motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ECF. However, on October 30, 2016, Satullo moved to withdraw from the action. ECF No. 361. The Court granted Satullo's request on November 3, 2016. ECF No. 370. Plaintiffs identified Brian Ledwith (\"Ledwith\") as a suitable replacement for Satullo, and Judge Fox granted\n   Plaintiffs leave to file a motion to amend the SCAC. ECF No. 425;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 484 (\"TAC\"). On February 28, 2018, Judge Fox granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend the SCAC to add Ledwith as a named plaintiff. ECF No. 474 (hereinafter, the \"Order\"). In granting Plaintiff's Motion, Judge Fox determined that Ledwith \"allege[d] ongoing manipulation through a series of uneconomic acts and, thus, can be said to have alleged actual damages, adequately, to establish standing under the CEA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the instant Motion, Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiff's claims regarding the July 2011 Contract arguing that Ledwith has failed to satisfy the CEA pleading standard, thus rendering Plaintiffs without a proper class Plaintiff for the July 2011 Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"When deciding Rule 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings, a court employs the standard that applies to motions to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).
