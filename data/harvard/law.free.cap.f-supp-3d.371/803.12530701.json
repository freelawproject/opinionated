Kobayashi, United States District Judge\n   On October 18, 2018, Defendants Four Seasons Hotels Ltd., Four Seasons Holdings, Inc., Hualalai Investors, LLC, Hualalai Residential LLC, and Hualalai Rental Management, LLC (\"Defendants\"), filed their Motion to Dismiss and for Partial Summary Judgment as to First Claim for Relief (Condominium Property Act) in Class Plaintiffs' Second Amended Class Action Complaint for Damages, Declaratory, and Injunctive Relief Filed April 30, 2018 (\"Motion\"). [Dkt. no. 118.] Plaintiffs Christopher Zyda (\"Zyda\") and Carol Meyer (\"Meyer\" and collectively \"Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated (all collectively \"Class\"), filed their memorandum in opposition on November 1, 2018, and Defendants filed their reply on December 3, 2018. [Dkt. nos. 125, 131.] Intervenors Bradley Chipps, Donna Chipps, J. Orin Edson, David Keyes, Doreen Keyes, Ann Marie Mahoney, James R. Mahoney, Kevin Reedy, H.

[Dkt. no. 127.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds this matter suitable for disposition without a hearing pursuant to Rule LR7.2(d) of the Local Rules of Practice for the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii (\"Local Rules\"). On February 15, 2019, this Court issued an entering order ruling on the Motion. [Dkt. no. 144.] The instant Order supersedes that entering order. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Motion is denied as to their request to dismiss Count I and granted insofar as Defendants are granted summary judgment as to Count I. Further, in light of this Court's ruling, the Class is hereby decertified as to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The instant case arises from the fees and charges for unaccompanied guests that were announced at the Hualalai Resort (\"Resort\") in 2015. The operative pleading in this case is Plaintiffs' Second Amended Class Action Complaint for Damages, Declaratory, and Injunctive Relief (\"Second Amended Complaint\"), filed on April 30, 2018. [Dkt. no. 89.] Zyda filed the first two versions of the complaint in\n   state court, and the state court certified the Class.

[Notice of Removal at \u00b6 16.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint alleges the following claims: violation of the Condominium Property Act, Haw. Rev. Stat.

Chapter 484 (\"ULSPA\" and \"Count II\"); unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20480-2\">\n    Haw.

[Second Amended Complaint at \u00b6 28.] The primary misrepresentation that Plaintiffs base all of their claims upon is the alleged promise that the Class members, their families, and their guests (including renters) would be able to enjoy the Resort's facilities without paying additional fees.

At this stage of the case, the Court concludes that the issues presented in the Motion should be addressed under the summary judgment\n   standard, rather than the dismissal standard.

Further, in considering whether the short limitation period precludes\n    \u00a7 514B-94(b) from being a statute of repose, this Court must also consider the fact that the remedy allowed by \u00a7 514B-94(b) is the drastic remedy of rescission.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Wilkins v.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 514B-87(e) (\"This section [- titled 'Rescission after sales contract becomes binding' -] shall not preclude a purchaser from exercising any rescission rights pursuant to a contract for the sale of a unit or any applicable common law remedies.\"). Even if Meyer's Chapter 514B claim is barred by the statute of repose, her equitable claims, tort claims, and other statutory claims remain in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, this Court predicts that the Hawai'i Supreme Court would hold that the two-year period in \u00a7 514B-94(b) is a statute of repose. Because Meyer failed to bring her Chapter 514B claim within two years after the date she purchased her condominium, and because statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling, Meyer's claim is time-barred. There are no genuine issues of material fact and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Meyer's claim in Count I.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ.

The deadline to add parties and amend pleadings in this case passed on February 1, 2019. [Rule 16 Scheduling Order, filed 4/11/18 (dkt. no. 84), at \u00b6 5.] The Rule 16 Scheduling Order \"may be modified ... for good cause,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4), but this Court's ruling on the instant Motion does not constitute good cause. The instant case has been pending in this district court since November 1, 2016, and adding a new Class representative for Count I at this advanced stage would unduly delay the resolution of the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 16 Scheduling Order at \u00b6 1 (September 4, 2019 trial date), \u00b6 7 (April 3, 2019 dispositive motions deadline).

[Mem. in opp. to Motion to Dismiss, filed 6/4/18 (dkt. no. 96), at 6-7.] This argument shows that, by June 4, 2018, Plaintiffs took the position that \u00a7 514B-94(b) was: 1) a statute of limitations instead of a statute of repose; and 2) subject to the discovery rule. Thus, Plaintiffs knew by that time that Meyer's Chapter 514B claim would be timely only if this Court accepted both of those positions. Plaintiffs could have moved for leave to add another Class representative whose Chapter 514B claim would be timely if this Court interpreted \u00a7 514B-94(b) as a statute of repose. In June 2018, Plaintiffs'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    motion for leave would not have required a good cause showing; only the liberal amendment standard would have applied.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

Plaintiffs, however, did not seek leave to add another Class representative as to Count I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Thus, Plaintiffs will not be allowed to identify a new Class representative for Count I because good cause does not exist to amend the Rule 16 Scheduling Order.
