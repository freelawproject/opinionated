At 4:00 a.m. on April 27, 2016, as Plaintiff Monet Oliveras lay sleeping, unnamed officers of the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") prepared to execute a search warrant at an apartment on the first floor of her building. As Ms. Oliveras approached the window of her basement apartment in response to noises outside, a flash and explosion suddenly transformed the scene, knocking her backwards. A second explosion filled her room with smoke and left her eyes stinging. And when Plaintiff tried to leave her apartment, armed officers informed her that she could not. The incident left her with physical and emotional injuries that persist to this day. As a result, Ms. Oliveras brought suit against the United States (the \"Government\") and the unnamed DHS officers. The Government, the only party to appear to date, moves to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court understands that the use by law enforcement officers in civilian neighborhoods of devices designed for the battlefield may pose risks, but the weighing of such risks against the necessity of using such weaponry is a choice that is firmly within the province of governmental decision-makers. It is the precise type of choice that is protected by the discretionary function exception (the \"DFE\") to the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 1402(b), 2401(b), 2671 - 80 (the \"FTCA\").

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a U.S. citizen who, at the time of the incident, resided in a basement apartment in the Bronx. (TAC \u00b6 7). She brings claims against the Government, of which DHS is a component. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). She also brings claims against unnamed DHS Officers, John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Building\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's basement apartment is a unit in a building with four stories above street level and one below. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). Plaintiff's apartment is accessed through a door on the side of the building that is below street level, separate from the main access\n   door for the rest of the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31). To enter her apartment, Plaintiff takes a stairway down from the street to an outdoor areaway below street level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Raid\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff was asleep on the morning of April 27, 2016, when she was roused by a noise outside her apartment. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). As she went to shut her window, she saw a flash and heard an explosion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). The explosion knocked her backwards, and she hit her back and head against the wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). A second explosion shattered her windows. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-20). Vapor and fumes filled her apartment, stinging her eyes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Attempting to escape, Plaintiff went to the front door of her apartment and observed the two DHS officers in full tactical gear with their weapons drawn. (TAC \u00b6 24). The two officers told her she could not leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). Plaintiff alleges that the officers were using \"flash bangs\" in service of executing a search warrant on the first floor of her building. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The devices were placed in the areaway outside the windows of her apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). The two officers refused to engage with Plaintiff and provided her no explanation of the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). When Plaintiff was finally allowed to leave her apartment, the officers refused to assist her, despite her requests for medical attention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff eventually called herself an ambulance, and she consulted with a cardiologist regarding chest pains that she was experiencing. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). Plaintiff was unable to return home for three weeks due to damage to her apartment, and the raid left her with ongoing irritation in her eyes, chest pains, migraines, and psychological injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 13, 2016, Plaintiff filed this suit, which was initially brought against New York City and several unknown police officers. (Dkt. # 1). On December 29, 2017, after gaining further information regarding the raid, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the United States, DHS, and unnamed DHS officers. (Dkt. # 25). On March 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, dropping the claims against DHS. (Dkt. # 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 13, 2018, Plaintiff proposed, and the Court accepted, Plaintiff's third amended complaint (\"TAC\"), which is the operative complaint. (Dkt. # 41-42). The TAC brings claims against the two DHS officers under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.

(TAC \u00b6\u00b6 46-56). The TAC also brings FTCA claims against the Government for false imprisonment, battery, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 18, 2018, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the FTCA claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt. # 48-49). Plaintiff\n   filed her opposition to the motion on June 15, 2018. (Dkt. # 50). The Government replied to Plaintiff's opposition submission on June 22, 2018. (Dkt. # 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Notably, Plaintiff accepts that the decision to use flash bangs was itself discretionary. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Opp. 6-7). The Court agrees with the Government and Plaintiff: the use of flash bangs is a choice protected by the DFE. The Government notes as well that Plaintiff has not cited to any statute or regulation that determines in what instances the Government may use flash bangs in executing a warrant. (Def. Reply 1). The Second Circuit, for its part, has stated that officers must look into the particular circumstances of a raid when determining whether to use flash bangs, suggesting that law enforcement officers not only do, but must, retain some discretion in determining the usage of such devices.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terebesi v.

The Court agrees with the Government, the Eleventh Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit that the weighing of risks and dangers from the use of different procedures and devices for arrests and warrant executions involves questions of public policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 7-8). In\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

(Pl. Opp. 6 (\"Plaintiff's claims under the FTCA are not concerned with the decision to use flash bombs while executing the search warrant, but are with the reckless and negligent way in which Defendants deployed the flash bombs.\") ). This argument runs into immediate difficulties,\n   as the Second Circuit has stated that \"where ... the Government is performing a discretionary function, the fact that discretion is exercised in a negligent manner does not make the discretionary function exception inapplicable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Agent Orange Prod.

The law is clear that even if, in hindsight, the Government's choice might have been excessively risky or unwise, the DFE protects it so long as it was a policy choice. Plaintiff does not address this case, but instead attempts to analogize to cases where the Government's actions were determined to be the result of negligent behavior rather than policy choices. As detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , these cases do not involve analogous conduct, and cannot help Plaintiff's claims survive the DFE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In arguing that the manner in which the Government deployed flash bangs creates liability under the FTCA, even if the choice to use them does not, Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing Co. v.

While the Government invoked the DFE in an attempt to avoid liability, the Supreme Court rejected this argument and held that the Government's decision to build a lighthouse might be protected from tort, but the manner in which it operated said lighthouse was not.\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/#p69\">\n    350 U.S. at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/#p69\">\n    76 S.Ct. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Coast Guard need not undertake the lighthouse service.

Opp. 7). In that case, the Ninth Circuit analyzed whether the Government's failure to supervise a logging operation by a private timber company allowed a claim against the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") under the FTCA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142105\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/1208/#p1215\">\n    241 F.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that granting the logging contract was a protected discretionary choice, but rejected the argument that the failure to supervise the timber operation, which the contract required, could be considered a policy choice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/1208/#p1215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/1208/#p1215\">\n    at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if the BIA did have discretion in its monitoring of the [logging] operation, its actions in carrying out its responsibilities were not protected policy judgments and therefore fail to satisfy the second prong of the discretionary function analysis.\"). In both of these cases, significant to the courts' decisions was the fact that the Government had agreed to take on certain duties to the public and then failed to perform those duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Government argues that the cases are distinguishable on this basis: Both involved the Government agreeing to take on certain actions and then creating risks by failing to do so, rather than the Government deciding to take an action that by its very nature created a potential safety risk. (Def. Reply 4-5). The Court agrees that the cases on which Plaintiff relies provide a fundamentally different situation than the one at issue here, as there is no allegation here that the Government affirmatively took on a duty and then ignored it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As an additional distinguishing factor,\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   , which involved a Coast Guard-operated lighthouse, and\n   <em>\n    Marlys Bear Medicine\n   </em>\n   , which involved government contracting, were situations where the Government stepped into the role of a\n   market participant performing ordinary commercial functions. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   noted that the FTCA was designed to \"compensate the victims of negligence in the conduct of governmental activities in circumstances like unto those in which a private person would be liable[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/#p69\">\n    350 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/#p69\">\n    76 S.Ct. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case involves the Government's unique role as the wielder of force to ensure public safety; indeed, the monopoly on the legitimate use of force is, in one conception, what makes a government. There is no \"circumstance[ ] ... in which a private person\" would be permitted to deploy flash bangs as part of a tactical raid to capture a criminal suspect in an apartment building. As noted above, \"judicial second-guessing\" of decisions made in this context would create a greater risk to the public, and is thus more appropriately protected from tort lawsuits, than decisions made in the realm of Government contracting or building maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff also relies heavily on a non-precedential decision that found possible FTCA liability in the context of law enforcement choices, but the underlying facts are nothing like those here. In\n   <em>\n    Andrade v.

Tex. 1999) (\"\n   <em>\n    Andrade I\n   </em>\n   \"), the court examined FTCA claims against the Government in the aftermath of the raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. The court dismissed most of the claims against federal law enforcement as barred by the DFE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561106\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/65/431/\">\n    65 F.Supp.2d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiffs' ... claims relating to the planning of the raid, stand-off, or final assault ... are ... barred by the discretionary function exception because they involve the permissible exercise of law enforcement policy judgment.\"). However, the court allowed to proceed the plaintiffs' allegations that law enforcement fired into the compound indiscriminately, carelessly blocked the Davidians from safely exiting the compound as it filled with tear gas, and recklessly started a fire by knocking over lanterns with its tanks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561106\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/65/431/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Those claims do not resemble the choice to use flash bangs; rather, they were particularized allegations that government agents behaved with utter disregard for the dangers of their conduct and acted outside the scope of any permissible policy choice. The surviving claims were premised on law enforcement firing indiscriminately into a building and officers blocking exits during a fire, actions that would be nearly impossible to justify under any circumstances. The surviving claims were not, as the claims here are, that the Government's aggressive tactics created unnecessary risks through flawed analyses of the situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff provides no support for an argument that DHS acted in a manner that was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   inappropriate. Rather, she objects to the use of flash bangs in the specific circumstances at issue and in the specific manner of their deployment, while acknowledging that the choice to use them can be a valid one. Plaintiff's claim does not resemble the claims that were permitted to go forward in\n   <em>\n    Andrade I\n   </em>\n   . Instead, it\n   resembles the claim against the Government for the use of tear gas, which was foreclosed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrade I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11561106\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/65/431/\">\n    65 F.Supp.2d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( [\"[T]he FBI's decision to use tear gas ... [is] clearly the type [of activity] that the [DFE] was designed to protect.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff attempts to compensate for the inadequacies in her pleading through speculation in her opposition that the Government's use of the flash bangs was not actually a deliberate choice. (Pl. Opp. 9-10). Such speculation, however, does not provide the particularized facts necessary to meet her pleading burden. Plaintiff speculates that the flash bangs may have been used by accident or in the wrong place, because her apartment has a separate entrance from the main building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As noted in\n   <em>\n    Andrade II\n   </em>\n   , even if the DHS officers ignored the conditions of the building, this would not suffice to demonstrate that the placement of the devices was not protected by the DFE. As for the speculation that the agents may have set the devices off by accident, Plaintiff provides nothing to support this allegation. For her claims to survive, Plaintiff must plead some facts suggesting that the officers did not make a policy choice, and she has not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enigwe v. Zenk\n   </em>\n   , No. 03 Civ. 854 (CBA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202713849\">\n    2007 WL 2713849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2007) (dismissing claim under FTCA as insufficiently pleaded, even as it acknowledged that the FTCA did not protect choices \"borne out of laziness, hastiness, or inattentiveness\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff's pleading acknowledges at times that she objects primarily to the Government's risk-reward calculus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp 8 (\"Given that there is no direct access to the main building from the basement apartment, and that the steps down to the areaway could easily have been secured from the street, there was absolutely no justification for Defendants to throw flash bombs outside of the basement apartment.\") ). This argument as to the proper placement of the flash bangs is ultimately one that questions the choices of the Government. Plaintiff is arguing that by placing the devices where they did, the officers created risks that outweighed the benefits of use. In so doing, Plaintiff offers her own assessment of the situation in place of the officers' assessments. Plaintiff has offered alternative ways that the officers could have conducted the raid; she has not offered a well-pleaded allegation that the agents did not make a discretionary choice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court finds that the choice to use flash bangs is covered by the DFE, and, thus, that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
