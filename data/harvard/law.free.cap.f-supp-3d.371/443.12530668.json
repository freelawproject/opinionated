TRAUGER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On August 28, 2017, the court granted summary judgment in favor of PSC Metals, Inc. (\"PSC\") for breach of contract and denied summary judgment on counterclaims brought by Southern Recycling, LLC (\"Southern\"). (Docket No. 143.) The only outstanding issue in this case is the amount of damages, if any, to which PSC is entitled. During a telephone conference on January 4, 2019, the parties agreed that the forward progress of the case requires resolution of whether, as a matter of law, PSC may recover expectancy damages for Southern's breach of the parties' \"Non-Binding Letter of Intent\" (\"LOI\"). The court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue. (Docket No. 153.) On January 23, 2019, PSC filed its Brief supporting its entitlement to such damages. (Docket No. 155.) Southern filed a Response on February 6, 2019, (Docket No. 159), to which PSC filed a Reply on February 15, 2019 (Docket No. 162). For the reasons set forth herein, the court finds that PSC may not recover expectancy damages for Southern's breach of the LOI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   PSC and Southern are scrap metal recycling companies. On December 9, 2015, they entered into a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"NDA\") as part of discussions regarding PSC's potential purchase of Southern's Nashville assets and business operations. (Docket No. 9-1.) The discussions continued through 2016 and, on January 20, 2017, the parties signed the LOI. (Docket No. 9-2.) Although non-binding with regard to the terms and structure of the potential acquisition, the LOI included a binding exclusivity provision that granted PSC exclusive negotiating rights with Southern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 7, 2017, Southern's president, John Fellonneau, received an inquiry regarding Southern's Nashville assets and business operations from an interested third party, Ferrous Processing and Trading (\"FPT\"). Like Southern and PSC, FPT is a scrap metal recycling company in the Nashville area. The inquiry came via telephone from William Sulak, FPT's Southeast Regional Director. Sometime following the March 7 call, Sulak arranged a meeting for himself, Fellonneau, and FPT's president, Dave Dobronos, to take place during an April industry convention in New Orleans. Meanwhile, negotiations between Southern and PSC continued pursuant to the terms of the LOI. On April 20, 2017, PSC provided a draft Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\") to Southern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One week later, on April 27, 2017, the men met in the cocktail lounge of an unidentified New Orleans restaurant. Dobronos raised the possibility of Southern's selling its Nashville assets to FPT. Fellonneau\n   responded that Southern was not for sale unless someone was willing to pay $ 30 million. The matter was not discussed further at the meeting. On May 10, 2017, Southern provided PSC with a response to its April 20 draft APA and requested a draft from PSC of other deal-related documents. On May 21, 2017, the exclusivity period expired. Two days later, Sulak phoned Fellonneau to again express FPT's interest in Southern's Nashville assets. [redacted] The following day, Fellonneau notified Southern's Board of Managers of FTP's inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Southern subsequently denied a request from PSC for an extension of the exclusivity period. But Southern continued to engage in negotiations with PSC, including a face-to-face meeting on May 30, 2017, followed by other discussions. (Docket No. 29-1 (First Declaration of Kevin Lewis).) On June 9, 2017, Southern contacted FPT to discuss due diligence requirements for a proposed asset purchase. Later that month, Southern provided FPT with high level terms for a potential deal. On July 7, 2017, Southern suspended discussions with PSC via email. The email stated that Southern had \"received an indication of interest in our Nashville assets from another party indicating a superior price as well as more favorable terms.\" (Docket No. 75-6.) Ultimately, no deal was reached with FPT, and Southern decided not to sell its Nashville assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 26, 2017, PSC filed suit for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. On April 5, 2018, Southern filed its Answer and Counterclaim against PSC (Docket No. 91), alleging that PSC breached the NDA and LOI prior to Southern's alleged breach of the LOI. On April 13, 2018, PSC filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, seeking judgment that Southern breached the LOI in the April 27, 2017 meeting with FPT. (Docket No. 94). On July 25, 2018, PSC moved for summary judgment on Southern's counterclaim. (Docket No. 132.) The court granted PSC's motions on August 27, 2018, finding that Southern breached the LOI's exclusivity provision and waived its right to assert a first material breach by PSC. (Docket No. 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PSC now seeks approximately $ 90,000 in reliance damages and approximately $ 21.6 million in expectancy damages. (Docket No. 151-1 at 2-5.) Its alleged expectancy damages are based in part on a calculation of the value of Southern's Nashville business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Southern asserts that only reliance damages are available as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Whether PSC may recover expectancy damages for Southern's breach of the exclusivity provision presents a novel issue of law. \"Courts and scholars have quibbled about the appropriate measure of damages when a contract to negotiate has been breached. In the opinion of some, damages should be limited to the sums spent in reliance on the broken promise. In the opinion of others, expectancy damages may be available.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

However, no Tennessee court has weighed in on the availability\n   of expectancy damages for beach of a preliminary agreement. \"When resolving an issue of state law,\" a federal court must \"look to the final decisions of that state's highest court, and if there is no decision directly on point, then [it] must make an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine how that court, if presented with the issue, would resolve it.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Fair Fin.

The facts of\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   are analogous to this case: a property owner agreed to sell property to the plaintiff but, despite entering into a letter of intent that contained an exclusivity provision, negotiated a better deal and sold the property to a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1257. The Oregon Supreme Court repeatedly emphasized that\n   the parties' agreement was, like the LOI in this case, specifically non-binding as to its substantive terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties clearly intended, and clearly had the right to expect, that that disclaimer would shield them from any liability for failing to carry through with the sale that then was being contemplated ....[T]he parties were at pains in their letter of intent to identify what they were not agreeing to do: Defendant was not agreeing to sell, or even to negotiate in good faith toward selling, and plaintiff was not agreeing to buy, or even to negotiate in good faith toward buying, the property in question.... [B]ecause defendant never agreed to sell or even to negotiate in good faith toward the sale of the property to plaintiff (and, in fact, explicitly disclaimed any such agreement when it signed the letter of intent), plaintiff cannot, under this contract, charge defendant with losses that flowed from her inability to finally purchase it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1262-63. The court finds the Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning persuasive. Because Southern did not agree in any legal sense to the LOI's substantive terms, it could not reasonably have foreseen that it might be liable for expectancy damages based on those terms by breaching the exclusivity provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The cases upon which PSC relies are inapposite.

The difficulty, which may well be insuperable, is that since by hypothesis the parties had not agreed on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the terms of their contract, it may be impossible to determine what those terms would have been and hence what profit the victim of bad faith would have had. But this goes to the practicality of the remedy, not the principle of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649368,7649370\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/96/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649368,7649370\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/96/275/\">\n    at 278-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Posner, J.) (bolded emphasis added, italics in original). The court agrees that it is hypothetically possible for breach of a preliminary agreement to foreseeably give rise to expectancy damages. However, as explained above, given the LOI's categorical disclaimers, this is not that case. Moreover, as the court noted in its previous Order, the LOI includes no duty to negotiate, in good faith or otherwise. (Docket No. 63 at 4.) That distinguishes this case from those cited by PSC. There is good reason to treat breach of an exclusivity provision, standing alone, differently from breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith: provisions mandating good faith negotiations are tailored to facilitate successful completion of a deal, while exclusivity provisions protect the parties' investments made in furtherance of negotiation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687712\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/339/\">\n    343 Or. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687712\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/343/339/\">\n    169 P.3d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"[D]efendant's nonsolicitation promise was directed to the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   of the negotiations and not to their\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   , and the damages that may be deemed to have arisen from defendant's breach of that promise are similarly limited.\" (emphasis in original).

The court cannot conclude that the Tennessee Supreme Court would open contracting parties to such a risk.

But the record indicates that expected benefits are not what PSC had in mind when it insisted on the LOI's exclusivity provision. In its Complaint, PSC states explicitly that it sought and secured the exclusivity provision in order to protect its outlays expended in furtherance of the parties' negotiation:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    18. As part of evaluating the potential acquisition of Southern's assets and conducting due diligence, PSC would be required to spend substantial amounts of time and money.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    19.

To that end, PSC negotiated for and obtained a binding exclusivity commitment from Southern....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    (Docket No. 9 at 3.) PSC's CEO, Ron Kline, confirms this motivation in his Declaration:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    10. PSC incurred substantial internal and third-party costs in connection with its pursuit of Southern's Nashville operations, including environmental due diligence costs and outside counsel costs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    11.

The proposition that PSC insisted on the exclusivity provision because it worried it might lose out on the value of the potential deal is seemingly belied by PSC's own words. Nonetheless, the court determines the parties' intent from the words as written in the contract. The LOI leaves no doubt that the parties did not intend to expose themselves to expectancy damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
