Rec. Doc. 2 at 1. Plaintiff alleges that defendant discriminated against charging party Jason Gunderson when he was discharged because he was perceived to be disabled and a safety threat to himself and to others because of his situational depression. Id. Additionally, plaintiff avers that defendant unlawfully discriminated against Mr. Gunderson when he was forced to obtain a medical release before he could return to work because he requested a referral to the Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\"), as this is a prohibited medical inquiry/exam under the ADA.

Rec. Doc. 49. Plaintiff filed a response in opposition arguing that summary judgment should not be granted because plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the burden-shifting framework of the ADA, defendant's actions were a pretext for disability discrimination, and forcing Mr. Gunderson to obtain medical clearance was a prohibited medical inquiry/exam under the ADA.

Rec. Doc. 55. Plaintiff asserts it can establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that Mr. Gunderson was \"regarded as\" disabled, without having to provide evidence to show he was actually disabled.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff states that Mr. Gunderson did not fail to do his duties and was cleared to work without any restrictions, yet defendant still perceived him to have mental and emotional issues affecting his job performance due to bias and stereotypes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff avers that it is not enough for defendant to simply state that it did not perceive Mr. Gunderson to be disabled when seeking summary judgement, and that defendant's behavior towards Gunderson demonstrates he was\n   perceived to be a threat and unable to work because of his situational depression.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff further asserts that defendant cannot demonstrate with objective evidence that Mr. Gunderson's impairment was both transitory and minor because situational depression, or adjustment disorder, can be a recurrent continuous condition that lasts longer than six months depending on the triggering situation, which is the case for Mr. Gunderson.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, plaintiff asserts that even if defendant alleges the condition was transitory, it cannot assert that Mr. Gunderson's condition was minor if defendant determined that his continued presence at the job site was a safety concern and precluded his ability to work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Additionally, plaintiff asserts that defendant cannot show that it made any efforts to determine whether this condition was transitory and minor as it did not seek assistance from Ann Ledet or Dr. McGraw to determine the extent of Mr. Gunderson's condition and failed to obtain objective evidence or documentation to support this defense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff asserts that whether Mr. Gunderson was qualified to perform the essential function of his job is a material fact in dispute as defendant's supporting evidence contains documents that were created after Mr. Gunderson's last day of work and not while he was employed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff avers that defendant's supporting documents do not contain evidence of Mr. Gunderson's failure to perform his duties but rather reflect that the Captains were concerned because he was emotional, and their unfounded fears led to his termination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, plaintiff asserts that defendant cannot establish a direct threat defense because under the ADA the defendant is required to make an individualized assessment to determine Mr. Gunderson poses a significant risk to the health and safety of himself and others which cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Defendant did not make an independent assessment to make a fact intensive determination, and furthermore failed to make any effort to accommodate Mr. Gunderson.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the Court finds that defendant met its burden of proving a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Mr. Gunderson's discharge, plaintiff asserts that it has provided evidence to show that defendant's actions were a pretext to terminate Mr. Gunderson on the basis of his disability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff asserts that Mr. Gunderson was not given his official termination papers until two weeks after he was actually terminated in order to allow defendant to secure the documents it submitted in support of its reason for discharging Mr. Gunderson.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, plaintiff asserts the two additional documents defendant submitted that appear to support its direct threat defense were not received during the investigation and were drafted three years after the termination and a month after the EEOC issued its LOD.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Finally, plaintiff asserts that forcing Mr. Gunderson to obtain a medical clearance after he asked for an EAP referral is a prohibited medical inquiry/exam under the ADA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rec. Doc. 55 at 14. Plaintiff states that although situational depression can be transitory because it can be a short-term condition that generally lasts six months or less, it can also be a recurrent or continuous condition lasting longer than six months. Rec. Doc. 55 at 17-18. Nurse practitioner Ann Ledet, who gave Mr. Gunderson the \"situational depression\" diagnosis, known in the DSM-5 as adjustment disorder, stated in her deposition that situational depression can continue for six months or stop before then, depending on the triggering event. Rec. Doc. 55-2 at 9-10. Plaintiff also states that DSM-5 classifies adjustment disorder as a \"stress-related, short-term nonpsychotic disturbance ... [that] can last from three to six months. The condition may persist longer when the stressor condition itself is prolonged.\" Rec. Doc. 55 at 6, n.3. Defendant responds that plaintiff is only speculating that the impairment could last longer than six months but does not provide evidence that it lasted longer than six months in Mr. Gunderson's case. Rec. Doc. 61 at 3. However, the statute states that a transitory impairment is one with an \"actual\n   <em>\n    or expected\n   </em>\n   duration of 6 months or less.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Therefore, while it is true that the actual duration of Mr. Gunderson's impairment was not six months at the time of his discharge, we find based on the DSM-5 description of adjustment disorder, cited in plaintiff's response, the determining factor as to whether the condition would be expected to last longer than six months is the stressor condition that caused it. Rec. Doc. 55 at 6, n.3. The adjustment disorder could be expected to last longer than six months if the stressor condition is prolonged. Nurse Ledet's notes do not identify what the stressor condition for Mr. Gunderson's adjustment disorder is - the fact of his wife leaving in March 2013, or the separation from his wife itself. While the former may mean that the impairment is not expected to last longer than six months because it is a discrete incident, there is support that the latter is a prolonged stressor condition with a longer duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This is a material factual dispute that could determine whether plaintiff can establish that Mr. Gunderson was regarded as having a disability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012012\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(C) and therefore cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    There is a genuine dispute as to whether plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because there is a genuine dispute as to whether the alleged impairment is transitory and minor, the Court will proceed with the burden-shifting analysis described above. There is a genuine dispute as to whether plaintiff can establish all the necessary elements to make a prima facie case of discrimination. To make a prima facie case of discrimination plaintiff must show that Mr. Gunderson: 1) has a disability or was regarded as disabled; (2) was qualified for the job; and (3) was subject to an adverse employment decision on account of his disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. LHC Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315912\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/688/#p697\">\n    773 F.3d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (5th Cir.2014). Plaintiff's complaint alleges Mr. Gunderson was \"regarded as\" having a physical or mental impairment, so it is not necessary to consider defendant's arguments that Mr. Gunderson did not have an \"actual\" disability, or \"record of\" a disability. Rec. Doc. 49-1 at 4. It is also not necessary for this Court to consider whether Mr. Gunderson's alleged disability limited, or was perceived to limit, a major life activity. The ADAAA states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (A) An individual meets the requirement of \"being regarded as having such an impairment\" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). Therefore, defendant regarded Mr. Gunderson as having a disability if he was discharged because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment. Defendant asserts that Mr. Gunderson was discharged because he allowed his personal problems to interfere with his work upon his return, which led to an overall decline in the quality of his work including failing to perform an engine check. Rec. Doc. 49-1 at 6. Defendant provides deposition testimony of Captains deBouchel and Bourque, and an employee discipline report describing these issues that was filed on June 10, 2013 in support of this argument. Rec. Docs. 49-10, 49-11, 49-12. Plaintiff asserts that Mr. Gunderson was perceived as disabled because of his situational depression diagnosis. Rec. Doc. 55 at 15. Plaintiff argues that Mr. Gunderson did not fail to do his duties, but rather it was his display of emotional behavior in adjusting to his marital problems that led defendant to perceive him as unable to work and a safety concern.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff points to the temporal proximity of defendant's action in discharging Mr. Gunderson within two weeks of his return to work after seeking counseling as evidence that defendant regarded Mr. Gunderson as disabled.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    Id. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, Mr. Gunderson was cleared to return to work by Nurse Ledet on May 20, 2013 after his EAP referral but did not have any more work assigned to him after June 5, 2013 and was discharged on June 21, 2013. Rec. Doc. 55 at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, given the precedent in this circuit regarding temporal proximity, it appears that the two-week gap between Mr. Gunderson's return from EAP on May 20, 2013 and his last day of work on June 5, 2013 are \"very close in time\". A reasonable reviewer could then conclude that prima facie evidence of temporal proximity shows Mr. Gunderson was subject to an adverse employment decision because of his perceived impairment and therefore regarded as disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff must also show that Mr. Gunderson was qualified for the job to make a prima facie showing of discrimination. To be a qualified employee, plaintiff must be able to show that Mr. Gunderson could either: (1) perform the essential functions of the job in spite of his disability, or (2) that a reasonable accommodation of his disability would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nall v.

Rec. Doc. 49-1 at 6. In its response, plaintiff interprets this to mean that Mr. Gunderson was not qualified to perform the functions of his job due to his situational depression. Rec. Doc. 55 at 19. There is a genuine factual dispute as to whether Mr. Gunderson could perform the essential functions of his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant has provided evidence from Mr. Gunderson's supervisors that he could not perform certain job duties because the issues in his personal life were interfering with his work. However, plaintiff has provided evidence that Mr. Gunderson was medically cleared to resume his duties by Nurse Ledet who diagnosed him with situational disorder. Rec. Docs. 49-10, 49-11, 49-12, 55-5 at 38. Mr. Gunderson denies pertinent allegations against him by supervisors. At this stage the Court cannot weigh the parties' evidence in order to determine whether Mr. Gunderson was able to perform his duties. Therefore, summary judgment is improper at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While defendant does not explicitly address the direct threat defense in its motion, it did plead it in its answer.

However, plaintiff correctly points out that in order to plead a direct threat defense, the defendant must also show that the risk cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation, and in this case defendant has not provided any evidence to show that it considered any reasonable accommodations for Mr. Gunderson.

Doc. 61 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that the relevant question is not whether Mr. Gunderson performed his duties or not, but rather whether management personnel, who do not have personal knowledge of Mr. Gunderson's performance, reasonably relied on objective evidence in concluding that Mr. Gunderson was not performing his duties and thereafter terminating him.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277241\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/237/#p242\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   However, defendant does not provide any facts to contradict plaintiff's assertion that Mr. Gunderson's actual last day of work was June 5, 2013. In fact, the Termination Report and Separation Notice both list June 5, 2013 as Mr. Gunderson's last day of work and his termination date as June 21, 2013. Rec. Doc. 49-14 at 1, Rec. Doc. 55-11 at 1. The documents provided by defendant in support of its reason for discharging Mr. Gunderson are dated after his last day of work - June 5, 2013. Specifically, the email from Captain deBouchel is dated June 11, 2013 and the employee disciplinary report is dated June 10, 2013, Rec. Docs. 49-12 at 1; 49-13 at 1. Therefore, plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence at this stage to demonstrate that there is a factual dispute as to whether defendant's proffered reason for discharging Mr. Gunderson was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At this stage the Court is not weighing plaintiff's evidence to determine whether plaintiff has adequately shown that defendant's reason actually is pretextual. However, a reasonable jury could find that plaintiff has shown that defendant's articulated reason is pretextual and therefore summary judgment is not proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    There is a genuine dispute as to whether the return to work examination defendant requested of Mr. Gunderson was proper\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   42 U.S.C.\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) of the ADA states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether\n   such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant asserts that the Coast Guard places significant weight on compliance with safety standards and the return to work examinations are completed in accordance with Coast Guard regulations. Rec. Doc. 49-1 at 9. Defendant states that the examination is narrow in scope, limited to a reasonable inquiry, and limited to the job functions. Id. at 10. Moreover, defendant argues that the deckhand position is a safety sensitive position and therefore it was necessary to ensure that Mr. Gunderson was able to operate on the boat safely. Rec. Doc. 61 at 5. Plaintiff, however, asserts that a blanket requirement that all employees who seek an EAP referral or see a personal physician must obtain a return to work examination is a prohibited medical inquiry. Rec. Doc. 55 at 26. Additionally, plaintiff states that defendant has not presented evidence that the examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity since Mr. Gunderson was a deckhand who did not need any certification or license to perform his duties. Id. at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There is very little precedent in the Fifth Circuit interpreting \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit most recently considered the provision in\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. City of Shreveport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333297\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/276/\">\n    798 F.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir.2015), but analyzed it in relation to the Rehabilitation Act, which the Court noted is distinct from Title I of the ADA and \"as a result, a medical inquiry that violates Title I will not necessarily violate the Rehabilitation Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 798 F.3d at 285 (5th Cir.2015). Therefore, with no binding precedent regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) in this Circuit, the Court looks to how other circuits have interpreted the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Second Circuit has stated that an employer can conduct a medical examination or inquiry to determine whether an employee can perform job-related duties when \"the employer can identify legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons to doubt the employee's capacity to perform his or her duties (such as frequent absences or a known disability that had previously affected the employee's work) ...\"\n   <em>\n    Conroy v. New York State Dep't of Corr. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p98\">\n    333 F.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 (2d Cir. 2003). The Ninth Circuit has held that the business necessity standard \"may be met even before an employee's work performance declines if the employer is faced with significant evidence that could cause a reasonable person to inquire as to whether an employee is still capable of performing his job.\"\n   <em>\n    Brownfield v. City of Yakima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700647\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/1140/#p1146\">\n    612 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (9th Cir. 2010). Similarly, the Seventh Circuit\n   has held that \"an employer [must] provide significant evidence that could cause a reasonable person to inquire as to whether an employee is still capable of performing his job.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Illinois Dep't of Children &amp; Family Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331759\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/513/#p523\">\n    798 F.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (7th Cir. 2015). \"That an employee's behavior could be described as \"annoying or inefficient [does not] justify an examination; rather, there must be genuine reason to doubt whether that employee can perform job-related functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331759\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/513/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Therefore, to determine whether defendant's medical examination of Mr. Gunderson was \"job-related and consistent with business necessity\" as required by the ADA, the Court will consider whether defendant had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason prior to the examination by Nurse Ledet to doubt that Mr. Gunderson could perform his duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff states that defendant required Mr. Gunderson to get the medical examination solely because he had an EAP referral and there was no evidence that he had failed to perform the essential functions of his job at the time he requested the referral. Rec. Doc. 55 at 27. However, defendant states that it only requested the medical examinations after it was determined that Mr. Gunderson was having trouble focusing due to his marital problems and that he had requested EAP assistance. Rec. Doc. 61 at 4. In his deposition, Captain Bourque stated that he noticed Mr. Gunderson's marital issues causing a decline in his work performance prior to his EAP referral, including a lack of focus, crying, and lack of sleep. Rec. Doc. 55-8 at 6-13. Therefore, there is a genuine factual dispute in the record as to whether defendant had a legitimate reason to doubt Mr. Gunderson's capacity to perform his duties upon his return after his EAP referral. A reasonable person could find Captain Bourque's testimony credible and therefore believe that Mr. Gunderson's behavior prior to his EAP referral gave defendant a genuine reason to doubt Mr. Gunderson's ability to do his job after he returned. While the Court does not weigh evidence or make any credibility determinations at this stage, this existence of a genuine factual dispute precludes summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Therefore, because there are genuine factual disputes as to multiple issues in this case, including whether Mr. Gunderson's impairment is transitory and minor, whether plaintiff can make a prima facie case of discrimination, whether defendant's articulated reason for discharging Mr. Gunderson is pretextual, and whether the medical examination defendant required of Mr. Gunderson was proper, summary judgment is not proper.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(4)(A) has only been cited by the Fifth Circuit four times, and the Fifth Circuit has not issued interpretations of the statute in those cases that would offer precedent in this case.\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.
