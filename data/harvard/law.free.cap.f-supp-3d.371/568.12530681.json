(\"Mahube\") terminated her employment in violation of the Minnesota Whistleblower Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20181.931\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 181.931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.935. To summarize, Mahube operates a Head Start program, among other services. Mahube hired Martinson to manage enrollment for this program. Martinson alleges that her supervisor instructed her to enroll applicants in the program who Martinson believed were ineligible under federal law. Martinson claims she then reported \"violations or perceived violations\" of a federal regulation governing the Head Start program to Mahube and that Mahube terminated her employment in retaliation for her reports. Martinson commenced this action originally in Minnesota state district court. Martinson asserts no claim created by federal law, and there is no assertion that the parties are of diverse citizenship. Mahube removed the case to federal court asserting that Martinson's claim \"turns on an embedded, substantial question of federal law which [Defendant is] entitled to litigate in a federal forum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following removal, Martinson moved to remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and Mahube moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Federal district courts \"have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he vast bulk of suits that arise under federal law\" assert a claim (or claims) created by federal law.\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

The Minnesota Whistleblower Act prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against an employee because the employee \"in good faith, reports a violation, suspected violation, or planned violation of any federal or state law or common law or rule adopted pursuant to law to any employer or to any governmental body or law enforcement official.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20181.932\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 181.932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1(1). The statute's inclusion of federal law as the basis for a protected report is not unusual among similar state statutes\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and implicates a great number of possible state-law claims with embedded federal issues. Countless individuals work in occupations, or for employers, subject to federal regulation. And it certainly seems as if finding subject-matter jurisdiction in this Minnesota Whistleblower Act case based on the presence of an asserted violation of the federal regulation Martinson identifies would-if followed in other cases-risk tilting the balance of employment-law litigation toward the federal courts in a way that is at odds with \u00a7 1331. If an asserted violation of Head Start regulations was sufficient to confer subject-matter jurisdiction, then it would seem many other categories of regulations and statutes governing all manner of commercial activities might suffice. There would be no obvious limiting principle. If a Head Start regulation is sufficient, then why not a regulation governing air travel? Or the manufacture of medical devices? The list would be very long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition to the potential for an \"enormous shift\" of traditionally state cases into the federal courts,\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    545 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , finding jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case effectively would cede significant power to states to define the expanse of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court alluded to in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   , though tort, contract, and employment claims are typically created by state law, state laws governing these claims often permit a violation of federal law to meet an element of the claim-a federal violation may have a negligence-per-se effect in a state tort case; federal law may establish a contract term; or, as here, reporting a federal violation may be protected activity under a state whistleblower statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    at 318-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
