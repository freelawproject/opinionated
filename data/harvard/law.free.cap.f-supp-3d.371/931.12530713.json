(ECF No. 24.) Currently before the Court is Suggs's Motion to Suppress, arguing that evidence against him was obtained through two unconstitutionally overbroad search warrants. (ECF No. 54.) The Court held an evidentiary hearing on February 25, 2019. (ECF No. 77.) For\n   the reasons explained below, the Court denies Suggs's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact based on the testimony and exhibits received at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Shooting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2018, a man named Daniel Johnson was crossing a street at a crosswalk in Colorado Springs and prevented a black BMW sedan from turning. Johnson and the driver of the BMW exchanged words, upon which the driver pulled out a black handgun and fired it at the ground near Johnson's feet. The driver sped away but a mother and daughter, who had been behind the black BMW in traffic, observed the incident and followed the BMW to the next intersection. They obtained a photo of the BMW's license plate (Colorado plate OXD692).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Menter's Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point, the police were called. A patrol officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, Adam Menter, was the first on the scene. While there, he recovered a silver Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber shell casing with the word \"Speer\" printed on it. He also viewed the license plate photo taken by the mother and daughter, who had returned to the scene of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When police interviewed Johnson about the incident,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was fairly certain that the license plate was UXD692, only one character off from the actual plate. Johnson described the shooter as a black male with a dark complexion, a small goatee, probably in his late 20s or early 30s, with a thin to medium build.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After obtaining this evidence, Menter continued the investigation. Using databases available to law enforcement, he found that license plate OXD692 was registered to a black BMW sedan owned by Suggs and associated with 2525 Nadine Drive, Colorado Springs. Menter found Suggs's profile in a police database and the associated photo showed a black male with a dark complexion and a goatee. Menter arranged for that photo to be part of a double-blind sequential photo line-up presented to Johnson. When Johnson reached Suggs's photo, he stated he was 80% certain that the man in the photo was the same one who shot at him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Menter investigated Suggs further through a police database and found that he had been convicted in Colorado state court of felony menacing and felon-in-possession, and had been investigated multiple times for burglary, felony assault, and domestic violence. He was also a confirmed member of the Gangster Disciples street gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Nadine Drive Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Menter authored an application for a warrant to search the home associated with Suggs at 2525 Nadine Drive in Colorado Springs. In his affidavit in support of a warrant (Attachment A to the application), Menter recited his investigation in detail. (ECF No. 54-1 at 4-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further noted, based on his \"training and experience,\" that he is \"aware that parties with gang affiliations and a history of violent criminal behavior\" are \"likely\" to \"possess more than one firearm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Concerning the scope of the search warrant, Menter's Attachment B to the warrant application proposed searching for and seizing the following items:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   GENERAL INFO\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 General photographs of the scene\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Indicia of residency\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Identification which would identify any occupants of the residence\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   GUNS INVOLVED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Any and all firearms: specify if known\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Any and all ammo: specify if known\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Any documentation showing the ownership of a firearm\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Any and all sales records showing the purchase of a firearm\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Any projectiles\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Any and all spent shell casings\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Any item commonly used to carry and transport a firearm (i.e. holster &amp; gun carrying case, magazines, cleaning kits)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   VEHICLE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Indicia of ownership of vehicle\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Vehicle registration\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MISCELLANEOUS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    \u2022 Any item identified as being involved in crime\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   NO OTHER ITEMS ARE SOUGHT FOR SEIZURE\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (formatting in original).) Menter derived this list by drawing on a template, which he usually does because, as a patrol officer, he does not regularly write warrant applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A Colorado state court judge issued the warrant. The warrant states that the reviewing judge found probable cause to search for items that \"[had] been used as a means of committing a criminal offense\" and items that are \"illegal to possess.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The warrant described the scope of items to be seized by cross-reference to \"Attachment 'B' which is hereby incorporated in [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] reference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The warrant did not incorporate Attachment A (Menter's affidavit) by reference. The judge also issued warrants for Suggs's arrest and for the search of his black BMW sedan, which are not challenged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Suggs's Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The next day, January 4, 2018, Menter and another officer named Bergstresser set up surveillance of 2525 Nadine Drive at about 5:30 PM. The black BMW sedan was parked in front of the house, but the officers saw no activity. Just before 6:00 PM, the officers observed an unrelated incident-a man chasing a woman down the street-and decided to break off their surveillance to address that situation. They used their patrol vehicles to catch up with the footchase, taking them out of sight of 2525 Nadine Drive. As they were dealing with that situation, Bergstresser noticed Suggs's black BMW driving by. At Menter's direction, Bergstresser returned to his patrol vehicle and followed the black BMW until the Colorado Springs version of a SWAT team, known as the Tactical Enforcement Unit (\"TEU\"), arrived to assist in what would presumably be the execution of the arrest warrant for Suggs. The TEU's participation was considered prudent given Suggs's alleged volatile behavior the day before and his criminal record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The TEU soon arrived and the officers approached the driver of the black BMW, which had been parked at a gas station. The TEU officers identified Suggs and arrested him there pursuant to the previously issued warrant. A member of the TEU obtained a house key from Suggs, who told the officers that no one else was inside 2525 Nadine Drive but that he had\n   two dogs there in kennels. Menter, having resolved whatever situation led to the footchase, showed up at the gas station later, just in time to see Suggs being placed in the back of a patrol vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Execution of the Nadine Drive Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having obtained a house key from Suggs, the TEU then assembled at Suggs's Nadine Drive residence. They were led by TEU officer (and acting sergeant) Teresa Tomczyk, and their goal was to \"clear\" the residence, or in other words, to look for any persons or things that might pose a threat to the officers who would execute the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Nadine Drive residence is a west-facing single-family structure with a carport attached to the south side of the home. It looked substantially as follows on the night in question:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Government's Exhibit 1 (excerpt).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The TEU officers approached the front door, knocked three times and demanded entry three times, and received no response. They let themselves in with Suggs's key, \"swept\" the residence, and found no one inside and nothing else of note beyond two dogs in kennels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The TEU officers then proceeded to clear the outside environs of the property. In particular, Tomczyk and another TEU officer inspected the carport, in which they found two parked vehicles: a gray sedan and a maroon Ford SUV. The following photograph is taken from the driveway leading into the carport, and it shows the gray sedan in the foreground and the outline of the Ford SUV just beyond the gray sedan:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Government's Exhibit 3 (excerpt).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Tomczyk shined her flashlight through the windows of both vehicles, looking for persons that might be hiding there. When she shined her flashlight into the rear cargo area of the Ford SUV, she immediately noticed an AR15-style rifle, a long magazine for that rifle, a Glock handgun, and two handgun cases. The scene looked as depicted in this photograph taken through the rear window of the Ford SUV:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Government's Exhibit 5 (excerpt).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Eventually Tomczyk considered the scene secure and Menter arrived to conduct the search. The search team comprised Menter, a supervising sergeant named Keith Wrede, and another officer named Aaron Lloyd. Menter brought the complete warrant with him, including Attachment A (his affidavit).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Menter does\n   not know if Wrede or Lloyd reviewed the warrant package. Menter's usual practice is to brief other officers about what they will be searching for before executing the warrant, but he could not recall if he did so in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Menter also could not recall if either of those officers physically entered the Nadine Drive residence before he did. He remembered, however, that he first took pictures of the undisturbed interior of the residence before he and the other officers began searching for evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When the search began, Menter began in the living room, working his way through that room and a connected dining room into a connected kitchen (from living room to kitchen was \"an open space\" with \"no walls in between\"). Lloyd started in the kitchen. Wrede began in a bedroom he reportedly characterized as \"the grandfather's bedroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Before Menter made his way to the kitchen, Lloyd found there, above the microwave, a box of ammunition. He called Menter over, who observed that the ammunition was Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber with the word \"Speer\" printed on it-thus matching the shell casing Menter had found at the scene of the shooting. There was also one round of a different kind of .40 caliber ammunition. The officers seized the ammunition as evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the kitchen or the dining room, Menter located and seized a bank statement addressed to Suggs at 2525 Nadine Drive. Menter and Lloyd then moved to a \"back bedroom\" (not the same as \"the grandfather's bedroom\" where Wrede searched). There, Menter located a retail sale contract for the black BMW sedan, which he seized as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Menter searched the bathroom, but found nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Ford SUV Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At some point, Tomczyk informed Menter of the items she had observed in the rear cargo area of the Ford SUV. It is not clear if this conversation happened before or after Menter and his partners searched the residence. Regardless, Menter himself went to the carport, shined his flashlight through the rear window of the Ford SUV, observed what Tomczyk had observed, and took the photo reproduced above. Menter ran the Ford SUV's plate and learned that it was registered to someone named Camisha Mobley. Mobley herself showed up after the search of the residence had concluded, reporting that she had come to take care of the dogs in the house. Menter\n   had a conversation with her about the Ford SUV. Mobley reported that the vehicle belonged to her but she had loaned it to Suggs over a year ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Menter then returned to the police station and authored a new warrant application for the Ford SUV. (ECF No. 54-5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The accompanying affidavit (again, \"Attachment A\") repeated verbatim the affidavit from the Nadine Drive application and then added a description of the Nadine Drive search and Menter's subsequent conversation with Mobley. As for the scope of the search, the application again contained an \"Attachment B,\" which was identical to the previous Attachment B (quoted in Part I.C, above) except that \": specify if known\" was removed from the first two lines under the \"GUNS INVOLVED\" heading. A Colorado state court judge issued the warrant, again setting forth the scope by cross-reference to Attachment B, and not incorporating Attachment A by reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Execution of the Ford SUV Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Menter and his partner from earlier that evening, Bergstresser, executed the warrant on the Ford SUV at about 10:20 PM that same night. Wrede supervised. Menter seized the Glock handgun, the rifle, the ammunition, the Glock carrying cases, and also the vehicle's registration document (which indeed showed Mobley as the registered owner).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Standards and Burdens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Suggs invokes the Fourth Amendment's \"particularity requirement,\" italicized below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\n   <em>\n    particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The purpose of the particularity requirement is to prohibit \"the 'general warrant' abhorred by the colonists\" and thereby prevent an \"exploratory rummaging in a person's belongings.\"\n   <em>\n    Coolidge v. New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027286\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/443/#p467\">\n    403 U.S. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027286\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/443/#p467\">\n    91 S.Ct. 2022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027286\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/443/#p467\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). \"The particularity requirement ensures that a search is confined in scope to particularly described evidence relating to a specific crime for which there is demonstrated probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Voss v.

At the first phase, it is the defendant's burden to show a particularity problem on the face of the warrant.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carhee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535762\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1493/#p1496\">\n    27 F.3d 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1496 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"Generally, if the search or seizure was pursuant to a warrant, the defendant has the burden of [proving that the search violated the Fourth Amendment].\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The face of the warrant alone, without reference to other materials (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the supporting affidavit), may be enough either to establish-or at least raise a sufficient suspicion of-a failure of particularity,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cassady v. Goering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651859\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/628/#p635\">\n    567 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (10th Cir. 2009), or to dispel that suspicion,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Andresen v.

At this phase, the question is whether the affidavit in support of the warrant may be consulted to \"cure\" language that might otherwise be \"overbroad.\"\n   <em>\n    Leary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788308\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/846/592/#p600\">\n    846 F.2d at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Two requirements must be satisfied to reach this result: first, the affidavit and search warrant must be physically connected so that they constitute one document; and second, the search warrant must expressly refer to the affidavit and incorporate it by reference using suitable words of reference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788308\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/846/592/#p600\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted; alterations incorporated). If both requirements are satisfied, the affidavit is considered part of the warrant and the context the affidavit provides may be considered. But even if these requirements are not satisfied, the task of giving the warrant a \"practical\" interpretation may still draw on the affidavit if \"the same officer both produced the affidavit and executed the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortega-Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11161779\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1325/#p1328\">\n    232 F.3d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Because this second phase is, like the first phase, dealing with practical construction of the warrant, the Court presumes that the burden remains on the defendant. This means both the factual burden of proof to show that the\n   <em>\n    Leary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortega-Jimenez\n   </em>\n   requirements are not satisfied, or, if they are satisfied, the burden of persuasion that the affidavit nonetheless fails to provide the necessary context to provide a \"practical\" construction that avoids particularity problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The third phase arises if the defendant persuades the Court that the\n   <em>\n    Leary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortega-Jimenez\n   </em>\n   requirements were not satisfied (such that the affidavit cannot be considered), or that the warrant still lacks particularity even considering the affidavit.

The point of\n   <em>\n    Andresen\n   </em>\n   was that the formatting of the warrant (which happened to be a run-on sentence in that case) was enough to assure the Supreme Court that \"crime,\" unmodified by a definite or indefinite article, must refer back to the crimes under investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Here, the Court is similarly assured.

Given that Menter was the affiant and the executing officer, as discussed above (Part II.B.2), a practical construction of the challenged bullet points demands that the Court construe them as narrowed to Suggs's black BMW sedan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Suggs further argues that \"a search for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   vehicle was unnecessary: By the time that the search was executed, the black BMW associated with the crime being investigated was in the government's possession.\" (ECF No. 54 at 7 (emphasis in original).) But the warrant did not authorize a search for a vehicle, much less \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   vehicle.\" It only authorized a search for documentary evidence related to the vehicle. To the extent Suggs means to say that the warrant need not have authorized a search for documentary evidence related to the vehicle because the Colorado Springs police already had evidence supporting ownership and registration, then: (a) it is not clear that this goes to the\n   <em>\n    particularity\n   </em>\n   of the challenged bullet point; and (b) Suggs cites no authority, and the Court has found none, holding that a warrant may be invalidated because the police already have evidence of the same type they wish to search for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For all these reasons, Suggs's particularity challenge to the vehicle-related portions of the Nadine Drive warrant cannot succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Gun-Related Portions of the Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the first time in his reply brief, Suggs argues that the \"GUNS INVOLVED\" section of the Nadine Drive warrant is overbroad because it authorized a search for any type of firearm or ammunition when the Colorado Springs police knew they were searching for \"a black handgun of a specific caliber.\" (ECF No. 63 at 5.) Suggs argues that this is all the more egregious because whatever template Menter worked from contained the words \"specify if known\" after \"[a]ny and all firearms\" and \"[a]ny and all ammo\" (ECF No. 54-1), yet Menter did not specify what he was searching for. Although the Court could treat this argument as forfeited given that Suggs only raised it for the first time in his reply brief, the Court will reach it anyway because the outcome on the merits is plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The fact that Menter knew the caliber of the firearm to search for, or even the color to search for, does not mean he could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   search for that type of gun and ammunition. To begin, on the cover page to the warrant application, Menter represents that \"probable cause exists\" to seize the items listed in Attachment B because \"probable cause exists to believe that [they] ... [are] or [have] been used as a means of committing a criminal offense\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   [they are] illegal to possess.\" (ECF No. 54-1 at 3 (emphasis added).) The reviewing judge approved these search justifications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Next, in the warrant affidavit, Menter noted that Suggs already had violent felonies on his record, and also a conviction for \"Felony Possession of a Weapon by a Previous Offender.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Any felony on a criminal record at least gives rise to a suspicion that the felon cannot possess a firearm, and surely someone who has already been convicted specifically of felon-in-possession cannot legally possess a firearm, absent exceedingly unusual circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Finally, Menter concluded his affidavit by noting Suggs's Gangster Disciples membership and that, through experience, Menter has learned \"that parties with\n   gang affiliations and a history of violent criminal behavior\" are \"likely\" to \"also possess more than one firearm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In sum, Menter's application demonstrated probable cause to search for any and all firearms and ammunition, along with related paraphernalia. Attachment B to the Nadine Drive warrant justifiably instructed executing officers that they could search for those items, and need not have been more particular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Specifically, he claims that Tomczyk did not view the guns in the Ford SUV from a lawful vantage point and so the resulting warrant was invalid because it was based on Tomczyk, and then Menter, unlawfully viewing the guns; and, in any event, the scope of the warrant was insufficiently specific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   If the warrant for 2525 Nadine Drive was valid, and the Court has concluded that it was, it is not clear these arguments matter. \"[A] warrant authorizing the search of a certain premises that is otherwise adequately described permits officers to search vehicles located on the curtilage when the objects of the search might be located in those vehicles, even though the warrant does not specifically authorize the search of vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, Tomczyk or Menter, or both, probably could have performed a full Fourth Amendment search of the Ford SUV on the authority of the Nadine Drive warrant, without first gaining suspicion that guns might be in the vehicle.

(ECF No. 58 at 1.) But Mobley told Menter that she was the Ford SUV's owner (which turned out to be true) and that she had loaned it to Suggs. Furthermore, the vehicle was also parked on Suggs's property, not Mobley's. Finally, the gun used to commit the crime was found inside that vehicle. The Court finds that Suggs has discharged his burden to establish his standing to contest the search of the Ford SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    \"Protective Sweep\" &amp; \"Plain View\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Tomczyk characterized her activities in and around the carport at 2525 Nadine Drive as part of a protective sweep to ensure no one was hiding in the Ford SUV. Suggs argues that the Supreme Court's \"protective sweep\" doctrine only extends to executing arrest warrants when there is a specific, articulable basis for believing that someone dangerous is on the property at the time of execution. Here, the Colorado Springs police were not executing an arrest warrant. Suggs claims that Tomczyk thus could not conduct a protective sweep and, in consequence, was not lawfully in a place where she could peer into the Ford SUV's rear window and see the guns and ammunition in the vehicle's passenger compartment. (ECF No. 54 at 9-12.) In response, the Government \"does not rely on a protective sweep theory,\" but instead argues that Tomczyk was lawfully on the premises because the search warrant was valid and the guns and ammunition were in \"plain view\" from a place Tomczyk could lawfully be while executing the warrant. (ECF No. 58 at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \"Plain view,\" according to the Government's cited authorities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 58 at 12), governs when an item outside the scope of a search warrant may be seized while executing that warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Furthermore, the warrant named the carport as part of the premises to be searched. (ECF No. 54-1 at 2.) Thus, Tomczyk, and then Menter, could lawfully view the guns inside the SUV while standing in the carport. Accordingly, no \"search\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurred when they viewed the guns with their own eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Gun-Related Portions of the Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Suggs further argues that the \"GUNS INVOLVED\" section of Ford SUV warrant's Attachment B was insufficiently specific. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 13; ECF No. 63 at 9.) Suggs points out that Menter knew precisely which firearms and ammunition he was searching for-having seen them through the window-and so should not have requested (or received) permission to search for \"[a]ny and all firearms\" or \"[a]ny and all ammo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the same reasons already discussed (Part II.C.2), Menter's warrant application fully justified a search for all firearms, ammunition, and related paraphernalia, given the suspicion that Suggs was unlawfully possessing firearms and the reason to believe that he possessed more than one. No requirement of which the Court is aware, from the Fourth Amendment or otherwise, mandated that Menter could only search for the gun used in the shooting the day before. Accordingly, Suggs's argument in this regard fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Suggs's Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 54) is DENIED. By separate order, the Court will set a new trial date and related deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The record is unclear whether Menter personally interviewed Johnson or received a report of that interview as part of his investigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Admitted in evidence at the suppression hearing as Government's Exhibit 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Menter took this photo a little later, as described below, but Tomczyk testified that the photo represents what she saw that night when she shined her flashlight into the Ford SUV. Only the barrel of the handgun is visible in the photo, at the bottom center. Only one of the Glock cases is visible in the photo, just above the flashlight glare on the window.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    In pre-hearing briefing, the parties appeared to agree that Menter's affidavit was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    attached to the executed warrant. (ECF No. 54 at 1, 3; ECF No. 58 at 6.) The Court called for a supplemental brief from the Government on this matter because Menter's affidavit \"appear[s] to be part of one physically connected package containing the warrant itself, the cover page of the application, attachment A (the affidavit), and attachment B (the scope of the warrant ...).\" (ECF No. 69.) The Court therefore asked the Government to explain \"its basis for asserting that the warrant affidavit[ ] [was] not physically attached to the resulting warrant[ ].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The Government responded that the application submitted to the reviewing judge was a physically connected package containing all the items just described, but that the officers did not leave the entire packet at 2525 Nadine Drive after executing the warrant because \"Colorado Springs Police Department officers are taught not to leave warrant affidavits with the warrants at the scene\" due to sensitive information sometimes contained in those affidavits. (ECF No. 70 at 1.) However, the Government continued, neither Menter nor Wrede could \"remember if the warrant packages (including the affidavits) were taken to the scene.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2.) Nonetheless, at the hearing, Menter himself testified that he \"usually\" brings the \"entire copy\" with him when executing warrants, but he simply could not \"picture it in [his] head if it was with [him]\" when he executed the Nadine Drive warrant. The Court is thus persuaded that Menter brought the full warrant package with him. Menter's hesitance to say as much reflects his desire not to testify beyond his memory, and does not convince the Court that the package he brought to 2525 Nadine Drive failed to include the affidavit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    His testimony was scattered on the subject, particularly as to Lloyd. Menter began by saying that he could not recall if he gave any briefing, although he usually does. He later stated that he informed Lloyd of \"the type of things we were looking for.\" But, even later, he stated that Lloyd \"wasn't there much, if any\"; that the briefing would have been with Wrede; and that perhaps Wrede briefed Lloyd. Nonetheless, the Court did not get the sense that Menter was changing his story so much as exploring his memory of details that he had not before considered, and that he was waxing and waning in his certainty about those details.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The additional round of ammunition and the fact that the officers seized all of it did not come into evidence at the hearing. The details of certain papers that were seized and the fact that the papers were seized, as described below, also did not come into evidence at the hearing. These facts are reported in Menter's after-action report, which was the Government's proposed Exhibit 20 (never moved into evidence), and which Suggs previously put into the record as ECF No. 54-4. Because these facts appear undisputed, the Court disregards the lack of evidence introduced to support them at the hearing itself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Admitted in evidence at the suppression hearing as Government's Exhibit 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The Government claims that later ballistic analysis confirmed that the Glock handgun found in the Ford SUV was the weapon that ejected the spent shell casing found at the scene of the shooting.

But it appears the primary problem was that the list of items to be seized was preceded by an \"include but are not limited to\" clause and a generic authorization to look for \"other\" items (in contrast to,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , items that had been used in committing a crime, items that would be illegal to possess, etc.).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20F.%20App%27x%20746\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20F.%20App%27x%20746\">\n     at 748-49, 755\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
