(Compl., Dkt. No. 1). On November 30, 2018, Douglas filed an unopposed motion\n   for class and collective certification and preliminary approval of a settlement agreement reached with Allied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Certify, Dkt. No. 33 (\"Mot.\") at 1-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The proposed settlement is a hybrid class and collective action resolution. A FLSA collective would cover employees who worked for Allied at JFK Airport between October 18, 2014 and the present, while a NYLL class would cover employees who worked there between September 1, 2013 and the present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice of Proposed Class and Collective Action Lawsuit, attached as Ex. 1 to Letter dated Feb. 18, 2019 (\"Suppl. Letter\"), Dkt. No. 41 (\"Class Notice\") at 4). The settlement proceeds along the following sequence. After preliminary approval of the settlement by the Court, notice would be mailed to all potential collective and class members. Class members-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   those who have NYLL claims-are automatically included in the class unless they affirmatively opt out within 60 days of the mailing of the class notice. (Proposed Schedule for Settlement Approval, attached as Ex. A to Mot., Dkt. No. 33 (\"Proposed Schedule\") ). The Court would then hold a final approval hearing. If the settlement is approved, checks would be sent to class members and potential collective members. Those employees who cash their settlement checks would be deemed to have opted into the FLSA collective and to have released their FLSA claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Class Notice at 2; Settlement Agreement, attached as Ex. 1 to Aff. of Christopher Q. Davis, Dkt. No. 34 (\"Settlement Agreement\") \u00b6 2.3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have proceeded as if this is a typical class action settlement. It is not. The proposed settlement ignores the special complexities attendant to approval of a settlement of FLSA claims in this Circuit-complexities resulting from the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cheeks v. Freeport Pancake House, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/\">\n    796 F.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015). The Court first alerted the parties to these issues by Order dated December 20, 2018, after the parties had submitted a motion seeking preliminary approval of the settlement, but failed to cite, let alone address,\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   . (Order dated Dec. 20, 2018, Dkt. No. 38 (\"Clarification Order\");\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Support of Mot., Dkt. No. 35 (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") ). In response, Plaintiff's counsel submitted a summary letter that said\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   had been addressed in their prior submission, albeit implicitly. (Letter dated Jan. 15, 2019, Dkt. No. 39). The letter did not address attorney's fees, among other things. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The Court then held a hearing on February 4, 2019 in which it addressed problems with these proposals and directed parties to revise their submissions to provide, among other things, authority regarding the interaction between a FLSA collective and NYLL class and whether the cashing of a settlement check is an appropriate opt-in procedure for a FLSA collective. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry dated Feb. 4, 2019; Tr. of Mot. to Certify Hr'g on Feb. 4, 2019, Dkt. No. 43 (\"Feb. 4 Tr.\") at 6:1-5). On February 18,\n   2019, parties jointly filed a letter providing the Court with additional briefing on the topics discussed at the hearing and a revised settlement notice for Court approval. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Letter; Class Notice). The additional submissions have not resolved the various issues that are present in the agreement, and as a result, the Court cannot approve the proposed settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rule 23(e) by its terms requires that a class action settlement be \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" At the preliminary approval stage of the case, \"the district court must determine that a class action settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and not a product of collusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Joel A. v.

For one thing, the proposed settlement results in a dismissal, with prejudice, of FLSA claims. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 3.7(c) (\"Any Class Member who endorses and cashes a Settlement Check will ... have any FLSA Claims released and dismissed.\") ). That requires Court approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/\">\n    796 F.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For another, the meaning of the term \"fair and reasonable\"-the inquiry the Court must undertake under Rule 23(e) -is determined by the particular kind of class action being settled.

May 19, 2016) (recognizing\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wolinsky\n   </em>\n   in context of preliminary class action approval).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That the parties have proposed a FLSA\n   <em>\n    collective\n   </em>\n   action settlement and NYLL\n   <em>\n    class\n   </em>\n   action does not mean that\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   review can be avoided at this stage. Under the proposed settlement, the NYLL class\n   members are employees who worked for Defendants from September 1, 2013 to the present, and the FLSA collective members are those employees who worked from October 18, 2014 to the present. Unless a NYLL class member opts-out, they will receive a single check for their unpaid wages that compensates them for both their NYLL and FLSA claims. For employees who worked from October 18, 2014 to the present, they cannot resolve their NYLL claims without simultaneously resolving their FLSA claims because the check is payment for both. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 5.3 (\"Each [NYLL] Claimant forever and fully releases Defendants from all New York State Law claims during the Class Period. Each Claimant that presents their settlement check for payment forever and fully releases the Defendants from all FLSA claims during the Class Period.\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no method available to resolve FLSA claims alone; indeed as the notice indicates, all collective members are members of the NYLL class. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Notice at 4). In other words, the NYLL class action operates as de facto\n   <em>\n    FLSA class action\n   </em>\n   for employees who worked from October 18, 2014 to the present. Where the class action is labeled as a NYLL class, yet operates as a FLSA class action, or even when FLSA claims are part of a collective action, it is appropriate to analyze the fairness of the settlement under\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   at the preliminary approval stage. That is the only method to give meaning in this case to Rule 23(e)'s requirement that preliminary evaluation of settlement consider whether the agreement is fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties have failed to provide the Court sufficient information to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   review of the proposed settlement. The Court lacks basic information on the potential range of recovery for any employees. The Court has twice asked for information necessary for\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   approval-once before and once during the hearing held on February 4, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clarification Order; Feb. 4 Tr. at 10:1-19). All that has ever been provided is a summary statement of the gross settlement amount and a basic breakdown of attorney's fees, costs, service awards, and employer-side taxes. In its most recent submission, Plaintiff indicates that the $ 2,529,000 gross settlement reached in this case reflects \"a risk-reduced percentage of the class members' maximum\n   <em>\n    probable\n   </em>\n   underpayment damages of ... approximately $ 3,228,000.\" (Suppl.

While the proposed settlement contains opt-in language on the back of every check, which would be signed by any employee cashing it, there is no mechanism in the agreement for filing such consent with the Court. That renders the proposed collective action settlement incompatible with \u00a7 216(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kempen v.

The structure of the collective action provision of FLSA-including the requirement that the opt-ins be filed-is to ensure the presence of plaintiffs before the court. Unlike in a class action, where the rights of unnamed parties are adjudicated in their absence (or via representative), the opposite is true in a collective action. Their presence takes on particular importance in light of\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   which requires the court to evaluate the fairness of the settlement, as this occasionally requires direct questioning of the party or submission of evidence via affidavit or declaration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

It is only while simultaneously cashing his check that an employee becomes a member of the collective. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement \u00b6 2.3). The settlement checks are not even issued until thirty days after the \"final effective date\" of the settlement agreement, which is after the Court's final approval hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2.13, 4.4). Yet the agreement provides that the Court's final approval order-issued before that-would release Allied from all potential claims against it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.9 (providing that the parties will request the Court to, at the final fairness hearing, \"order the dismissal with prejudice of ... all FLSA Claims of Class Members who endorse and cash a Settlement Check\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.4 (providing that, by operation of the Court's final order, \"each Claimant forever and fully releases Defendants\" from FLSA claims) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The proffered structure has the Court opining on the fairness of a settlement-that is not a class action-of employees who are not before the Court and dismissing their claims with prejudice before they ever appear. If the Court did so, \"then recipients of the settlement checks would have no litigation to opt in to.... The procedure set forth in the Agreement-namely that an individual opts in and simultaneously settles his or her FLSA claim by depositing a check-simply makes no sense in the context of\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Xiao Ling Chen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201633027\">\n    2018 WL 1633027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Most importantly, however, this framework releases a claimant's FLSA claims without consent and creates the possibility that, should a claimant decline to join the FLSA settlement by failing to cash the check, he or she would neither have the benefit of the settlement nor the ability to bring an a FLSA action. This would give the employee effectively no alternative \"but to accept the ... check,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201633027\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , a Hobson's choice that\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   and a true opt-in process is intended to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   None of the cases offered by Plaintiff address or solve this dilemma.
