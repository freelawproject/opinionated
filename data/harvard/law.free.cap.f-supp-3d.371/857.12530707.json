In\n      <em>\n       Gwaltney\n      </em>\n      , the Supreme Court determined that the CWA provision authorizing private suits against anyone \"in violation of ... an effluent standard or limitation\" meant the alleged unlawful discharge had to be on-going or at least intermittent and likely to recur: it cannot be wholly in the past.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n       at 64\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n       108 S.Ct. 376\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . In this context, the Court compared the CWA's language with other statutes, noting that the Solid Waste Disposal Act had recently been amended to explicitly target past violations by authorizing suit against any \"past and present\" generator, transporter, owner, or operator \"who has contributed or is contributing\" to hazardous waste handling, transportation, or disposal.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n       at 57\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600440\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/49/\">\n       108 S.Ct. 376\n      </extracted-citation>\n      n.2. The issue was the timing of the violation, not who could be sued.

Lasnik, United States District Judge\n     This matter comes before the Court on the \"Port of Seattle's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction.\" Dkt. # 31. Plaintiff sued the Port of Seattle and its tenant under the citizen suit provisions of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") for on-going stormwater discharges from a marine cargo terminal that allegedly exceed the limits imposed by the Industrial Stormwater General Permit (\"ISGP\") that covers the facility. The Port seeks dismissal of the claims against it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Having reviewed the submissions of the parties,\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      the Court finds as follows:\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      The Port argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the claims against it because (1) only a permittee can be held liable for violations of a discharge permit and (2) plaintiff failed to comply with the 60-day notice requirement imposed by the CWA. The first argument goes to the sufficiency of the factual allegations of the complaint and the viability of the claims asserted: it is more appropriately analyzed under Rule 12(b)(6). Notice, however, is a pre-requisite to bringing a citizens suit under the CWA, and the failure to provide timely notice deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the suit.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       e.g.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Ctr.

Requiring citizens to comply with the notice and delay requirements serves this congressional goal in two ways. First, notice allows Government agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environmental regulations, thus obviating the need for citizen suits.... Second, notice gives the alleged violator \"an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the Act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.\" This policy would be frustrated if citizens could immediately bring suit without\n     involving federal or state enforcement agencies. Giving full effect to the words of the statute preserves the compromise struck by Congress.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      <em>\n       Hallstrom v.

To the contrary, the fifteen-page notice letter, which includes a table of excess discharges of turbidity, copper, and zinc at specific monitoring points during most quarters from 2012 to 2018, specifies both the what and when of the alleged discharges as well as plaintiff's theory regarding the Port's responsibility for those discharges.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      To the extent the Port believes the theory of liability is not viable, that issue will be analyzed below under Rule 12(b)(6). The notice itself is more than sufficient to inform the Port that it allegedly failed in its oversight and control responsibilities and is therefore liable for the exceedances identified by plaintiff.

Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.

The relevant language of the CWA is broad and imposes liability on \"any person\" who is alleged to be in violation of the permit limitations. Liability is not limited to the permit-holder (or any other category of defendant).
