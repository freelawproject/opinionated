MOODY, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Herman Collins and his wife purchased group life insurance and optional spousal coverage from Life Insurance Company of North America (\"LINA\") through their employer, Fluid Routing Solutions, LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (\"FRS\"). When LINA did not pay benefits owed, Collins sued LINA and FRS in state court. FRS removed, alleging Collins is seeking to recover benefits from a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Collins argues the case should be remanded because the group life insurance plan falls within an ERISA safe harbor exception. Because the safe harbor exception is inapplicable, the Court concludes the Motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FRS offered a comprehensive welfare benefit plan to its employees, under which FRS was the plan sponsor and administrator. (Doc. 23-1). In addition to offering health, vision, disability, and other insurance, FRS also offered optional life insurance coverage that was funded by payroll deductions from employees who elected to take the coverage. (Doc. 23-1). The life insurance benefit was insured by a group insurance policy issued by LINA. (Doc. 23-1). FRS chose the coverage options, levels of benefits, and determined the eligibility waiting period for qualified employees. (Doc. 23-1). The policy specified that FRS was the plan sponsor and administrator, which meant FRS had the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan. (Doc. 23-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The group life insurance policy, attached to the Complaint, contained a Supplemental Information form required by ERISA. (Doc. 2-1, pp. 21-24). This form provided ERISA disclosures and told participants that they were entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. The form also explained how to make a claim under the policy, noting that, if a claim was denied, LINA was required to provide the claimant with\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A statement informing you of your right to appeal the decision, and an explanation of the appeal procedure, including a statement of your right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA if your appeal is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Doc. 2-1, p. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to the Supplemental Information form, the group life insurance policy also contained an Amendatory Rider that described \"CLAIM PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO PLANS SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT\" (the \"ERISA Rider\"). (Doc. 2-1, pp. 47-48). The ERISA Rider explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    This Policy has been issued in conjunction with an employee welfare benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). This Policy is a Plan document within the meaning of ERISA.\n   </strong>\n   As respects the Insurance Company, it is the sole contract under which benefits are payable by the Insurance Company. Except for this, it shall not be deemed to affect or supersede other Plan documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plan Administrator has appointed the Insurance Company as the named fiduciary for deciding claims for benefits under the Plan, and for deciding any appeals of denied claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Doc. 2-1, p. 47) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 1, 2008, Collins and his wife enrolled in the group life insurance benefits plan offered by their employer, FRS. (Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11, 21). Collins alleges that in addition to the life insurance coverage, he and his wife paid extra for spousal life insurance coverage. (Doc. 2, \u00b6 11). Collins wife died on December 27, 2012. (Doc. 2, \u00b6 15). LINA paid benefits to Collins under his wife's life insurance coverage, but allegedly failed to pay benefits under his spousal coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nearly five years after making his claim for spousal death benefits, Collins sued FRS and LINA in Florida state court. (Doc. 2). The Complaint brings claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment against FRS and LINA. FRS timely removed the action to this Court, alleging that Collins's claims are governed by ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MOTION TO REMAND STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

As the Eleventh Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Butero\n   </em>\n   , \"The [third element of the] regulation explicitly obliges the employer who seeks its safe harbor to refrain from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   functions other than permitting the insurer to publicize the program and collecting premiums.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628363\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1207/#p1213\">\n    174 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (italics in original). The\n   <em>\n    Butero\n   </em>\n   court held that the third element was not satisfied because the employer \"decided on key terms, such as portability and the amount of coverage; it deemed certain employees ineligible to participate; ... and it retained the power to alter compensation reduction for tax purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628363\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1207/#p1213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628363\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1207/#p1213\">\n    at 1213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on\n   <em>\n    Butero\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   held the third element was not satisfied because the employer decided on at least one of the eligibility terms, the employer selected the plan and made it part of its available benefits, and the employer kept claim forms and assisted in filling them out.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729034\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/1260/#p1267\">\n    464 F.3d at 1268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Like the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Butero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   , this Court also concludes that the third element is not satisfied here because FRS did more than allow LINA to publicize the plan and collect premiums. As FRS argued in its response, \"FRS chose the insurer, chose the coverage options and level of benefits available to FRS employees under the policy, and determined the applicable eligibility waiting period for qualifying employees.\" (Doc. 23, p. 16). And Collins alleges in the Complaint that FRS \"advised, counseled and encouraged participation in\" the plan to Collins as an employee of FRS. (Doc. 2, \u00b6 41). So the Court concludes that safe harbor exception does not apply because the third element is not satisfied. The Motion to Remand, therefore, should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Collins's Motion to Remand is without merit. The group life insurance plan undoubtedly\n   is governed by ERISA, and the safe harbor exception on which Collins relies is inapplicable. So Collins's state law claims are completely preempted by ERISA, thus giving this Court jurisdiction. Although the Court has determined that Collins's claims are completely preempted, Collins will be given an opportunity to respond to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss if he has a good-faith basis for believing this action should not be dismissed in light of the Court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   1. Plaintiff's Motions to Remand and for Attorney's Fees (Doc. 12) is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   2.
