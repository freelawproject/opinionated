The Court has carefully reviewed the Motions, the record, all supporting and opposing filings, the exhibits attached thereto, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons that follow, Kahane's Motion and the Joint Defense Motion are granted in part and denied in part and Ms. Melford's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 4, 2018 Ms. Melford filed her Complaint against Defendants for violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, breach of contract, and malicious prosecution. ECF No. [1]. The Court dismissed all counts except the malicious prosecution claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [53]. Defendants have moved for summary judgment as to the sole remaining claim, arguing that no genuine issue of material fact exists to support the following elements of a claim for malicious prosecution: an absence of probable cause for the original proceeding, malice on the part of Defendants, and damages suffered by Ms. Melford as a result of the original proceeding. Towd also argues that it was not the legal cause of the original proceeding against Ms. Melford. Additionally, Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Ms. Melford's claim for punitive damages. Ms. Melford moved for partial summary judgment as to liability, contending that there are no genuine issues of material fact to refute any element of malicious prosecution. Additionally, Ms. Melford requests judgment as a matter of law as to two of the Defendants' affirmative defenses: that the impact rule bars recovery for emotional damages and that Ms. Melford is not entitled to punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Loan Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 19, 2007, Plaintiff entered into a loan agreement with Regions Bank d/b/a Regions Mortgage (\"Regions Bank\") for the purchase of residential property located at 9297 N. Saponaria Drive, Citrus Springs, Florida, where Plaintiff and her now former spouse Michael P. Watkins (\"Mr. Watkins\") resided.

ECF No. [84] \u00b6 5. The First Loan Modification made Mr. Watkins a co-obligor on the subject debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about October 7, 2010, Plaintiff and Mr. Watkins divorced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.

On or about April 17, 2012, Plaintiff, Mr. Watkins, and Regions Bank entered into an agreement to modify the terms of the subject debt pursuant to another loan modification agreement (\"Second Loan Modification\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The Second Loan Modification expressly released Plaintiff from her obligation under the subject debt, stating in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Regions Bank d/b/a Regions Mortgage] does hereby consent to the assumption by [Michael P. Watkins] of the indebtedness owed subject to the terms, conditions, and modifications herein stated and does hereby release [Judith Watkins] from obligations under the Note and Security Instrument\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Foreclosure Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about January 1, 2015, Mr. Watkins defaulted under his obligations under the subject debt. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 19. Towd owned the subject debt. ECF No. [103] \u00b6 20. U.S. Bank is the trustee of Towd and is tasked to carry out functions on its behalf. ECF No. [78] \u00b6 5. SPS is an attorney-in-fact of Towd.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Kahane was retained by SPS to attempt to collect debts owed to Towd. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 21. On March 9, 2016, Kahane's title department obtained a title report on the Property through Florida Premier Title &amp; Escrow identifying Judith Watkins as a defendant to be named in a foreclosure action as the note maker and the signor of the mortgage. ECF No. [81] \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. A foreclosure complaint was sent to SPS for verification as part of a package of documents providing underlying support for the allegations in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20-22. The verification package included the Second Loan Modification and an internal SPS form listing Mr. Watkins as \"Borrower\" and leaving \"Co-Borrower\" blank. ECF No. [88]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 467, 522. SPS verified the foreclosure complaint. ECF No. [81] \u00b6 23. Additionally, as a matter of procedure, prior to filing a complaint, various Kahane employees review the complaint and the supporting documents, including the preliminary title report. ECF No. [78] \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 25, 2016, Kahane, on behalf of Towd and U.S. Bank, filed a Verified Complaint to Foreclose Mortgage (\"Foreclosure Complaint\") against various interested parties including Judith Watkins and Mr. Watkins in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit in and for Citrus County, Florida, Case No. 2016 CA 000336 (\"Foreclosure Action\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Attached to Defendants' Foreclosure Complaint was a copy of original promissory note, the First Loan Modification, and the Second Loan Modification. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 22. The Foreclosure Complaint alleged that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Defendant(s), JUDITH P.

The Document Control Officer for SPS verified the Foreclosure Complaint's representations, acting as attorney-in-fact for Towd, by U.S. Bank as their trustee. ECF No. [105] \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [54-1] at 7. Pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.115, the Officer declared that the facts alleged in the Foreclosure Complaint were true and correct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The fact that Plaintiff had been released from the subject debt was communicated to Kahane on multiple occasions from June 17, 2016 through July 31, 2017. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 42. On or about June 23, 2016, Ms. Melford sent a letter to Kahane requesting to be dropped as a defendant and stating that Ms. Melford signed a quit claim deed and relinquished her title in the property and referencing the Second Loan Modification. ECF No. [93] at 61:1-14; ECF No. [93-10] (the \"June 23, 2016 Letter\"). Stephanie Simmonds (\"Simmonds\"), a Kahane attorney, reviewed the June 23, 2016 Letter. ECF No. [93] at 61:18-23. Thereafter, on or about June 30, 2016, Simmonds sought advice from a Kahane title attorney regarding Ms. Melford's involvement in the foreclosure action and was advised that Judith Watkins needed to remain a named party because she had signed the note. ECF No. [78] \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 16, 2017, an Order of Default was entered against Judith Watkins. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 31; ECF No. [54-5]. Upon receiving the Order of Default, on or about June 24, 2017, Ms. Melford wrote to the Citrus County Clerk of Court objecting to the entry of the default and forwarding the June 23, 2016 Letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. This objection was placed on the docket by the Citrus County Clerk of Court on June 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On or about July 6, 2017, Ms. Melford retained Light &amp; Gonzalez, PLLC to represent her in the Foreclosure Lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. On July 14, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and affidavit of indebtedness. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 36. Defendants' affidavit of indebtedness included the promissory note Plaintiff originally signed on November 19, 2007 but did not include the Second Loan Modification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37; ECF No. [54-8]. The Document Control Officer for SPS reviewed and signed the affidavit of indebtedness. ECF No. [88] at 339 \u00b6\u00b6 6-13. Ms. Melford's counsel communicated to Simmonds that Ms. Melford was not obligated on the note. ECF No. [93] at 91:18-92:21. On July 31, 2017, Defendants voluntarily dismissed Judith Watkins from the Foreclosure Lawsuit.

On or about June 17, 2016, Ms. Melford informed Kahane that she was afraid to appear in the Foreclosure Action because Mr. Watkins had been abusive in the past and made her fear for her life. ECF No. [84] \u00b6 26. She also informed Kahane that in order to escape from her abusive ex-husband she had intentionally concealed her whereabouts, moved on multiple occasions and changed her name through a subsequent marriage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Ms. Melford did not lose employment as a result of the Foreclosure Action.

Defendants acknowledge that the Foreclosure Action was filed but argue that Ms. Melford does not identify any specific acts by SPS, Towd, or U.S. Bank to perpetuate the Foreclosure Action. To satisfy the first element of a malicious prosecution claim, Ms. Melford must demonstrate that the Foreclosure Action was commenced\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   continued against her. It is undisputed that the Foreclosure Action was commenced against Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court finds that the first element is satisfied as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    2. Legal Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Towd argues that it was not the legal cause of the Foreclosure Action because the record is devoid of any evidence reflecting affirmative steps taken by Towd to initiate or further the Foreclosure Action. Towd relies on the proposition set forth in\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Lewis State Bank\n   </em>\n   that the test to determine legal causation is \"whether the defendant's action was the proximate and efficient cause of putting the law in motion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7614278\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/482/1378/#p1381\">\n    482 So.2d 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1381 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986). However, that test applies where the defendant is a third-party, not the entity that brought the lawsuit that is the basis for a malicious prosecution claim. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   also states that \"legal causation is usually established by the signing of a complaint or affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7614278\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/482/1378/#p1381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, it is undisputed that Towd was a plaintiff in the Foreclosure Action. As the named plaintiff it is necessarily true that Towd was the legal cause of the Foreclosure Action. It is also undisputed that U.S. Bank was a plaintiff in the Foreclosure Action, that SPS verified the Complaint as the attorney-in-fact of Towd, and that Kahane filed the lawsuit. Thus, the Court concludes as a matter of law that Defendants were the legal cause of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    3.

ECF No. [54-1] at 52. SPS reviewed the verification package, including the Second Loan Modification, prior to verifying the Foreclosure Complaint. Additionally, Ms. Melford advised Kahane in June of 2016 that she had been released from the subject debt and requested that she be dropped as a defendant in the Foreclosure Action. Kahane did not voluntarily dismiss Ms. Melford until July 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kahane argues that its lawyers had a reasonable and honest belief that its clients had a tenable claim against Judith Watkins because its lawyers conducted a pre-suit review of documentation showing that Judith Watkins was the original borrower and owner of the property that was subject of the Foreclosure Action, reviewed and carefully considered all documentation provided by Ms. Melford during the pendency of the Foreclosure Action, sought assistance from one on-staff lawyer with a specialty in title issues who advised that Judith Watkins needed to remain a defendant, believed there was a legal basis to include Judith Watkins in the Foreclosure Action, and dismissed Judith Watkins from the Foreclosure Action once the determination was made that Plaintiff was not a necessary party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds that Kahane, through its attorneys, did not have a reasonable belief that its clients had a tenable claim in the Foreclosure Action. The Second Loan Modification clearly released Plaintiff from her obligation under the loan. That the Second Loan Modification was attached to the Foreclosure Complaint filed by Kahane is a sufficient basis for the Court to find that Kahane lacked probable cause. Further, Ms. Melford notified Kahane on multiple occasions, dating back to June of 2016, that she was not a proper defendant in the Foreclosure Action. Yet Kahane continued to prosecute the Foreclosure Action for more than one year after receiving Ms. Melford's communication. The Court is unpersuaded that Simmonds consulting with a second Kahane attorney with a specialty in title issues supports a finding of probable cause. Kahane may not shield itself from liability for malicious prosecution by one Kahane attorney relying on the advice of another Kahane attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly, it was not reasonable for SPS to believe that Ms. Melford was a\n   proper defendant in the Foreclosure Action because SPS reviewed the Second Loan Modification prior to verifying the Foreclosure Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As to Towd and U.S. Bank, there is no evidence before the Court that either was aware of the Second Loan Modification or was notified of Ms. Melford's communications with Kahane. In fact, the record is devoid of any evidence regarding what Towd or U.S. Bank knew at any point in time of the facts and circumstances concerning the claim against Ms. Melford. Ms. Melford argues that because SPS was given authority through a limited power of attorney, ECF No. [88] at 543-47, to file foreclosure complaints on behalf of U.S. Bank as trustee for Towd, any knowledge Kahane and SPS had is imputed onto Towd and U.S. Bank. Ms. Melford offers no support for this argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court does not agree that Kahane or SPS's knowledge may be imputed to Towd or U.S. Bank for the purpose of a probable cause analysis.

Ms. Melford testified that she incurred $ 124.00 in out-of-pocket expenses - on Federal Express packages, ink cartridges, printing paper, and postage -because of the Foreclosure Action. Additionally, Ms. Melford claims non-economic damages for distress associated with being party to a lawsuit in which Mr. Watkins, whom she feared, was also a defendant. Ms. Melford also claims that her relationship with Mr. Melford suffered because of the Foreclosure Action, and ultimately contributed to his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   SPS argues that it was not the proximate cause of any of Ms. Melford's claimed damages. Specifically, as to the out-of-pocket expenses, SPS contends that the costs arose from Ms. Melford's communications with Kahane. Regarding the claimed non-economic damages, SPS argues that Ms. Melford's emotional state pre-dated the Foreclosure Action and is attributable to other events in her life. Kahane argues that Ms. Melford's testimony regarding her non-economic damages alone, unsupported by medical bills, is insufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether the expenses were incurred as a result of the lawsuit. Kahane also argues that the record evidence establishes that Ms. Melford caused her own address to be published in the Foreclosure Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court first addresses SPS's proximate cause argument related to the claimed out-of-pocket expenses. To satisfy the damages element of a malicious prosecution claim, Ms. Melford must establish that she suffered damages as a result of the Foreclosure Action. Ms. Melford need not further prove that the costs resulting from the Foreclosure Action are attributable to any particular Defendant, given that the Court has already found that Defendants were the legal cause of the Foreclosure Action. It is for the jury to determine whether Ms. Melford's claimed out-of-pocket expenses were caused by the Foreclosure Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to the non-economic damages, on summary judgment, the Court will not preclude Ms. Melford from advancing her claim for emotional damages because she suffered prior life events that caused her\n   emotional distress. Ms. Melford testified that as a result of the Foreclosure Action, she became depressed and isolated herself. ECF No. [88] at 233:15-18. Ms. Melford feared that because of the Foreclosure Action her contact information would be exposed to the public and her ex-husband would come after her again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 233:19-234:6. To what extent, if any, Ms. Melford's emotional distress can be attributed to the Foreclosure Action as opposed to other events in her life is a jury issue. Additionally, regardless of how Ms. Melford's address actually became part of the public record, a reasonable jury could find that Ms. Melford suffered emotional distress because of the fear of her address becoming public due to the Foreclosure Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the Court is unpersuaded that to survive summary judgment Ms. Melford must support her non-economic damages claim with medical records. Indeed, in malicious prosecution cases, courts have awarded damages for mental anguish caused by the underlying action where the plaintiff did not seek medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Mr. Melford died of a heart attack on December 9, 2017, four months after Ms. Melford had been dropped from the Foreclosure Action. Additionally, Ms. Melford testified that at the time Mr. Melford had the heart attack there wouldn't have been any stress related to the Foreclosure Action because it had concluded. ECF No. [88] at 243:22-25. There is no record evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the Foreclosure Action contributed to Mr. Melford's death. However, Ms. Melford's contention that her relationship with her husband suffered due to the Foreclosure Action is a jury issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants also argue that Ms. Melford's request to recover emotional distress damages is barred by the impact rule. The rule requires that \"before a plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress caused by the negligence of another, the emotional distress suffered must flow from physical injuries the plaintiff sustained in an impact.\"\n   <em>\n    R.J. v.

Defendants Towd, U.S. Bank, and SPS's Motion for Final Summary Judgment,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. [80]\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   3. Plaintiff Ms. Melford's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Liability,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. [83]\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   4. Summary judgment is entered in favor of Defendants Towd and U.S. Bank as to the probable cause element of the Malicious Prosecution claim. Final Judgment as to Towd and U.S. Bank will be entered by separate order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   5. Summary judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff Ms. Melford against Kahane and SPS as to the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth elements of the Malicious Prosecution claim. The Court finds as a matter of law that the Foreclosure Action against Ms. Melford was commenced or continued; Kahane and SPS were the legal cause of the Foreclosure Action; the termination of the Foreclosure Action constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in favor of Ms. Melford; Kahane and SPS lacked probable cause for the Foreclosure Action; and Ms. Melford suffered damages as a result of the Foreclosure Action. Additionally, summary judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff Ms. Melford as to Defendants' affirmative defense that the impact rule bars recovery for emotional damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   6. Summary judgment is denied as to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. Damages may be recoverable consistent with this Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE AND ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers at Miami, Florida on March 29, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    To the extent that Plaintiff or Defendants did not dispute portions of Defendants' or Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, the Court cites directly to Plaintiff's or Defendants' Statements for ease of reference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Plaintiff changed her name from Judith Watkins to Judith Melford when she married Jeff Melford (\"Mr. Melford\") in 2014.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [88] at 158:24-159:1, 161:16-17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Defendants Towd, U.S. Bank, and SPS's Appendix in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Bates stamped 1-1204.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \"The premise of our adversarial system is that ... courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.\"\n    <em>\n     Carducci v.
