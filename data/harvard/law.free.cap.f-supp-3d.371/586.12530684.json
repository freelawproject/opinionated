Stuart\n   </em>\n   , the court summarized how to review and determine whether an ambiguity exists in an insurance policy under Missouri law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Insurance policies are read as a whole, and the risk insured against is made up of both the general insuring agreement as well as the exclusions and definitions. In construing the terms of an insurance policy, Missouri courts apply the meaning an ordinary person of average understanding would attach if purchasing insurance ... Ambiguities arise when there is duplicity, indistinctness, or uncertainty in the meaning of the language in the policy. Language is ambiguous if it is reasonably open to different constructions. Ambiguity also arises where an insurance clause appears to furnish coverage but other provisions signal that such coverage is not provided. However, [d]efinitions, exclusions, conditions and endorsements are necessary provisions in insurance policies. If they are clear and unambiguous within the context of the policy as a whole, they are enforceable. Finally, [a] court may not create an ambiguity in order to distort the language of an unambiguous policy, or, in order to enforce a particular construction which it might feel is more appropriate.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270153\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/969/#p972\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972-73 (E.D.

Rather, the parties' dispute is whether the under insured motorist provisions, in the Policy are ambiguous, such that coverage is triggered. Specifically, the parties argue as to whether the term \"occupying\" as defined is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court will examine the specific provision of the Policy Plaintiff claims is ambiguous with the above legal background in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argues that the exclusion is not ambiguous. Defendant argues that under\n   <em>\n    Loyd v. State Auto Prop. and Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205466,8205494\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/265/901/\">\n    265 S.W.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.App. 2008), there is no coverage because the\n   <em>\n    Loyd\n   </em>\n   Court concluded, under identical circumstances, that when a motorcyclist laid the motorcycle down, separated from it, and subsequently collided with the turning vehicle, the motorcyclist was \"occupying\" the motorcycle because he had not yet reached his destination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Loyd\n   </em>\n   , however fails to take into consideration the fact that in\n   <em>\n    Loyd\n   </em>\n   , there appears to have been no argument that the definition of \"occupying\" is ambiguous. In the instant matter, however, Plaintiff argues that the definition of \"occupying,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   exiting the motor vehicle, is indeed ambiguous. Under Defendant's interpretation of the meaning of \"exit,\" Whitley had to reach a destination before the exit was complete, whereas, under Plaintiff's interpretation of the term, the \"exit\" from the motorcycle is at that point when Whitley was no longer in contact with the motorcycle. If Defendant had intended the meaning of \"occupying\" the vehicle to mean an exit until one reaches ones destination, it could have included that language in the policy. The ordinary meaning of the word \"exit\" is \"to go out or away.\" See, Merriam-Webster,\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exit\n   </em>\n   . Once further explanation of the term is necessary, the term itself is not unambiguous. Indeed, the very two positions taken by the parties clearly establish that the definition of \"occupying\" in the policy exclusion is ambiguous. It is a reasonable interpretation by Plaintiff that Whitley's \"exit\" from the motorcycle was complete when he laid the motorcycle down and he was no longer in contact with the motorcycle. Under Defendant's interpretation of the term \"exit,\" there is further language to include \"until the insured reaches his/her destination.\" Under the applicable standards of contract interpretation, because an ambiguity exists in the policy terms, the ambiguity must be construed against the insurer. As such, Plaintiff is entitled to coverage under her underinsured motorist policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based upon the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes that the language defining \"occupying\" in the underinsure motorist policy at issue is ambiguous, and Plaintiff is entitled to the underinsured motorist coverage; Defendant's refusal to pay Plaintiff's claim is therefore a breach of the insurance contract. Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Judgment in\n   the amount of the policy limits of $ 500,000 will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, [Doc. No. 22], is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment, [Doc. No. 19], is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A separate judgment in accordance with this Opinion, Memorandum and Order is entered this same date.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
