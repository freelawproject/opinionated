The issue is whether one who has not suffered actual harm or was not at risk of harm as a result of a procedural violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g has standing to assert a claim for that violation. We hold that he does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Robert J. Pozzuolo alleges that the defendant debt collector, Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC (PRA), sent him an initial collection letter that violated the validation notice requirement of \u00a7 1692g. The letter advised him that he could dispute the debt by telephoning PRA even though only a written dispute suffices to trigger the debt collector's obligations under \u00a7 1692g(b) to cease collection and provide verification of the debt to the consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In moving to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), PRA argues that Pozzuolo does not have standing because he has not suffered and was not at risk of suffering a concrete injury. It cites Pozzuolo's deposition testimony that he merely skimmed the letter and had no intention to dispute the debt. PRA also contends that there was no risk of harm because it treats telephonic and written disputes the same. PRA maintains that the validation notice informing Pozzuolo that he could dispute the debt telephonically was a mere procedural violation of \u00a7 1692g(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that Pozzuolo lacks standing. Because he never intended to dispute the debt, PRA's violation of \u00a7 1692g by failing to inform him that only written disputes are legally effective neither harmed him nor created a material risk of harm. Therefore, we shall grant PRA's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 30, 2018, PRA sent Pozzuolo a collection letter regarding a debt originally owed to Capital One Bank (USA), N.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A box in the center of the page included the following validation notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless you notify this office within 30 days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof, this office will assume this debt is valid. If you notify this office in writing within 30 days from receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof, this office will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment and mail you a copy of such judgment or verification. If you request this office in writing within 30 days after receiving this notice, this office will provide you with the name and address of the original creditor if different from the current creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although this part of the letter clearly stated that a dispute had to be in writing, another part advised that a telephone call was sufficient. The bottom of the page directed Pozzuolo to the back of the letter: \"NOTICE: SEE REVERSE SIDE FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the back, there were several notices, including one that read: \"\n   <strong>\n    DISPUTES:\n   </strong>\n   Call 1-800-772-1413 or write to: Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, Disputes Department, 140 Corporate Blvd., Norfolk, VA 23502[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, read in its entirety, the letter gave Pozzuolo two options for disputing the debt - orally or in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PRA's corporate designee, Susan Guevara, testified that if a consumer submits a written dispute, PRA immediately begins the debt verification process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). If a consumer calls with questions about a debt, the associate reviews the account statements with the consumer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the consumer indicates at any point that he disputes the debt, the conversation ends and PRA begins the verification process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the consumer does not dispute the debt while the associate is reviewing the statements with him, the associate asks at the conclusion of the review if he disputes the debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the consumer responds affirmatively, the conversation ends and the verification process proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Guevara's testimony is not consistent with PRA's Account Representative Training Manual (Manual). According to the Manual, the conversation with the consumer does not immediately end if the consumer disputes the debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The representative does not accept the consumer's dispute. Instead, she challenges the consumer. She responds, \"Let me review your account\n   documents,\" then reviews the details of the consumer's account documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The representative next asks, \"Now that we have reviewed the supporting documentation associated with your account are you still disputing the account?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The customer must respond \"Yes or No.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only if the customer responds affirmatively does the representative submit the dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pozzuolo testified at his deposition that as he does with all collection letters he receives, he \"scan[ned] over\" the letter and forwarded it to the law firm representing him in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not contact PRA or any of the credit reporting agencies about it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although he did \"not enjoying seeing\" it, the letter caused him no damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   He concedes the validity and the amount of the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is treated similarly to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Gould Elecs.
