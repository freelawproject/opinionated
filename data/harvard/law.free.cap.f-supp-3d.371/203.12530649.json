ECF No. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.

Plaintiffs requested the NTSB to produce various types of materials, including \"investigation materials,\" \"missing pieces of the [Goldstein] accident aircraft wreckage,\" \"logbooks and video footage of the accident,\" and \"data download from equipment onboard the accident aircraft.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Earlier in the litigation, the Court granted the NTSB's motion to dismiss Count I -- \"Obstruction of Justice and Violation of Due Process\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15. Only Count II remains in this case -- \"Violation of the Freedom of Information Act\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The NTSB filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 51.

However, the Court finds that in this case, information concerning the wreckage and the wreckage itself has not been argued to be exempt under the FOIA, and so must be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The plain text of the Exemption 3 statute does not state that it covers video recordings made by a cell phone camera.

The court ruled that certain documents were part of the predecisional process where those documents had been prepared \"for the specific purpose of aiding the agency in its determination of the likely flight path of the aircraft following the explosion, a determination central to the [agency's] task of explaining what [happened],\" and that discussed \"estimates of the aircraft's flight path, [and] reviews those estimates and makes recommendations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660814\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/964/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660814\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/964/\">\n    at 982-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the NTSB is investigating various accidents, and has not yet issued a finding or recommendation as a result of the investigation. It is of no moment that the process may not result in an adjudication or the adoption of a policy; rather, the deliberative process is at work, has yet to be completed, and will likely result in the issuance of a report with recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, the materials reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process, including draft documents and correspondence containing questions and answers.

Accordingly, the NTSB shall provide all documents accounting for the custody of the wreckage pieces. Furthermore, although the NTSB did not challenge Plaintiffs' request to inspect the Goldstein accident wreckage, statements by the NTSB indicate that the agency has completed its investigation, has no further need for the wreckage, and has shipped the wreckage to the owner or Air Salvage of Dallas. To the extent the NTSB does have any pieces of wreckage still in its possession, the NTSB must make the same available for inspection.

On September 12, 2017, the Court held a status and scheduling conference during which the Court explained that the merits of Plaintiffs' FOIA requests would be resolved through summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 37 at 19. The NTSB stated that it had \"completed its production\" in this case, and that it had asserted exemptions as it believed were appropriate.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343326\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/498/#p502\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, the NTSB indicated that all issues in this case could be resolved following briefing. The NTSB filed a \"Motion for Summary Judgment,\" rather than a motion for partial summary judgment; moreover, the NTSB's proposed order stated that the case would be closed, should the Court find in favor of the NTSB.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 51, Proposed Order. Furthermore, despite receiving clear notice from Plaintiffs that it had not briefed the Court about the wreckage, the NTSB failed to seek leave to file a reply brief addressing Plaintiffs' arguments concerning the wreckage. In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the merits of all of the issues raised by Plaintiffs are squarely before the Court and can be ruled on.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
