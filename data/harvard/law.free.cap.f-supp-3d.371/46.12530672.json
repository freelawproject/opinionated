Bean pleaded guilty to Count 1 of the multi-count second superseding indictment (doc. no. 41) on November 21, 2018. Count 1 charges him with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 841(b)(1)(A)(viii). Bean stipulated in his plea agreement that the conduct underlying this charge involved his receipt of parcels of methamphetamine through the mail from Nevada, distribution of methamphetamine to buyers in New Hampshire, and transfer of proceeds through the mail or by wire transfer back to Nevada to purchase more drugs. In the plea agreement, the parties agreed that the government would recommend that Bean be sentenced at the bottom of the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines range and that the \"quantity of actual Methamphetamine for which [Bean] is accountable at sentencing is at least 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms.\" Doc. no. 79 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bean asks this court to declare a categorical policy disagreement with the guidelines applicable to methamphetamine offenses, which treat quantities of actual methamphetamine and \"ice\" more harshly than the same quantities of a mixture containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine. Bean requests that the court apply the guidelines for methamphetamine mixtures to all methamphetamine offenses. Bean's sentencing is scheduled for March 5, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Spears\n   </em>\n   , the Court upheld a sentencing judge's categorical policy disagreement with the 100:1 ratio in a crack cocaine case and use of a substitute ratio (20:1).\n   <em>\n    Spears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n    555 U.S. at 265-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that it is not \"an acceptable sentencing practice\" to apply the substitute ratio (20:1) as part of the sentencing judge's individualized assessment made under \u00a7 3553(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n    at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Court described such an approach as a judge \"masking\" her policy disagreement as an individualized determination-which the Court characterized as \"institutionalized subterfuge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679283\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To accomplish the transparency required of the sentencing process, the court should, therefore, avoid a procedure that collapses its policy disagreement into its individualized determination. Adding a separate analytical step between step one (the calculation of the guidelines range) and step two (the individualized assessment under \u00a7 3553(a) ) will address this concern. Specifically, after calculating the guidelines at step one, the court will, at the next step, recalculate the guidelines using the base offense level for the methamphetamine mixture guidelines. Maximum transparency is achieved if this second step occurs before the individualized assessment at the third and final step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This new three-step process makes sense based on the nature of the court's policy disagreement here. The court disagrees with the purity-driven ratio used to calculate a defendant's base offense level in methamphetamine cases. This disagreement will exist in every case where the step-one calculation of the base offense level is made using the actual methamphetamine guidelines ratio (10:1). The disagreement will take the form of a policy-based variance that is wholly independent of the individual defendant's unique circumstances and characteristics. In short, every application of this policy disagreement would result in a policy-based variance (as a result of the lower base offense level). And to promote transparency, the court should impose that policy-based variance independently and separately from its consideration of a defendant's individualized characteristics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the court will use the following sentencing methodology in all actual methamphetamine and ice cases: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   calculate the guidelines sentencing range using the purity-driven methamphetamine guidelines; (2) recalculate the guidelines using the base offense level for the same quantity of methamphetamine mixture; and (3) evaluate whether any upward or downward variances are appropriate based upon the individual characteristics of the defendant and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court will apply this approach in all actual methamphetamine and ice cases regardless of whether the defendant requests the court to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Other district courts have adopted this same three-step approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525543\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/969/#p974\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting court's own prior \"ad hoc\" approach to applying policy disagreement, and declaring that it would, in all actual methamphetamine and ice cases, engage in a separate analytical step to determine the guideline range based on methamphetamine mixture guidelines); Saldana,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20110790\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist.

First, it argues that it will engender intra-district disparities in sentencing in methamphetamine cases. However, the Supreme Court rejected the same argument in\n   <em>\n    Kimbrough\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimbrough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n    552 U.S. at 107-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n    128 S.Ct. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court observed that, although uniformity remains \"an important goal of sentencing,\" some departures from uniformity are a \"necessary cost\" of the Court's ruling that the guidelines are merely advisory and its recognition of district courts' discretion over sentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It further noted that variations among district courts are \"constrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n    at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p90\">\n    128 S.Ct. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the government contends that the court's application of this policy disagreement in all methamphetamine cases will make it more difficult for the government to administer a coherent policy regarding sentencing departures under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5k and negatively impact a defendant's incentive to accept responsibility and/or plead guilty. Those issues, however, are not for the court to resolve. The court's role is to impose a fair and just punishment in every case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the government argues that defendant's motion is premature and that the court should wait to decide whether to vary from the guidelines based on a policy disagreement until the time of sentencing. The court disagrees. As explained above, the court's policy disagreement with the guidelines is not dependent upon the unique facts and circumstances of each case. The government conceded that applying a policy disagreement here will impact only the calculation of defendant's base offense level, a process accomplished at the front end of the guidelines calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Mireles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612311\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1897/#p1904\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1904,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612311\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1897/#p1904\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The government further\n   agreed that, based on the quantity of actual methamphetamine for which the defendant agreed to be held responsible, the practical effect of this policy disagreement would result in defendant's base offense level decreasing from 34 (actual methamphetamine guidelines) to 30 (methamphetamine mixture guidelines). In short, the court need not consult the presentence report to explain how it will implement its policy disagreement in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, the court is not persuaded by the government's arguments.
