Plaintiffs, who are members of the U.S. Navy crew of the U.S.S. RONALD REAGAN, crews of other vessels participating in the Reagan Strike Force, land-based service personnel, and, in some cases, their dependents, were deployed to Japan as a part of a mission known as \"Operation Tomodachi.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.

A group of Navy sailors, including many of the Plaintiffs in this case, originally initiated an action against TEPCO in this Court,\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. TEPCO\n   </em>\n   , 12-CV-3032 JLS (WMC) (\"\n   <em>\n    Coo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   \"), on December 21, 2012.

Cal. Oct. 28, 2014). The plaintiffs did so, naming GE as an additional defendant (along with three other manufacturer defendants EBASCO, Toshiba, and Hitachi). TEPCO then moved for reconsideration of the Court's Order regarding its second motion to dismiss. The Court amended its Order and granted TEPCO's motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal and stayed the case at the district court level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341577\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/1103/\">\n    166 F.Supp.3d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

Japan has an interest in ensuring the uniform applicability of the Compensation Act, which limits liability to companies operating in Japan in the field of nuclear reactor operations. Japan instituted the Compensation Act to encourage businesses to participate in Japan's nuclear industry, and it has an interest in applying its law fairly to all businesses who participate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Kohei Nasu (\"Nasu Decl.\"), ECF No. 19-5 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meraz v.

Accordingly, Japanese law applies to the issue of GE's liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Application of Japanese Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Having determined that Japanese law applies, the Court must next determine the ramification of that finding. Article 3 of the Compensation Act provides that when damage that is attributable to the operation of a nuclear reactor occurs, the Nuclear Operator is liable for all damages\n   in connection with the operation of the nuclear reactor. Compensation Act, art. 3. Article 4 provides, in the case set forth in Article 3, \"no other persons shall be liable to compensate for damages other than the Nuclear Operator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 3 &amp; 4. Justice Kohei Nasu, former Justice on the Japanese Supreme Court, explains that the Compensation Act \"has adopted principles of ... strict and unlimited liability of the Operator of a nuclear plant ... [and] channeling of third party liability for Nuclear Damage exclusively to the Operator.\" Nasu Decl. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Only two questions remain about the applicability of the Compensation Act to this Case. The first is whether GE is an \"Operator\" within the meaning of the statute. Under Article 2 of the Compensation Act, there are a variety of definitions that may qualify an entity as a \"Nuclear Operator.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compensation Act art. 2 (listing eight possibilities). In his declaration, Justice Nasu, states that, in his opinion, GE is not an Operator because it is not licensed as such in Japan. Nasu Decl. at 9. GE also points to a recent Tokyo High Court decision which found that the Compensation Act precluded a finding of liability against any entity other than TEPCO. GE MTD at 21. The Court finds that GE does not fall within any of the Compensation Act's definitions for a Nuclear Operator, and thus GE \"shall [not] be liable to compensate for damages.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compensation Act art. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The second question is whether the exception to the Compensation Act's channeling provision applies. Article 3 provides that the channeling provision does \"not apply in the case where the damage was caused by an abnormally massive natural disaster.\" Compensation Act, art. 3. A massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake, giving rise to tsunami waves more than 40 feet high that struck and severely damaged the FNPP, releasing radiation as a result, caused the damage in this case. Although this exception would seem to apply, the Japanese government and courts have taken the position that it does not. GE MTD at 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of David Weiner, Ex. D, ECF No. 19-8 at 6 (July 19, 2012 Tokyo District Court decision finding Article 3 exception does not apply). Moreover, as GE points out, even if the exception were to apply, liability would fall to the Japanese government under Article 17 of the Compensation Act, resulting in no liability for GE. GE MTD at 22 (citing Compensation Act art. 17). Based on the clear positions of the Japanese government and courts regarding the applicability of the exception, the Court agrees that the Article 3 exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Court concludes that under the Compensation Act, all liability for the meltdown channels to the Nuclear Operator (TEPCO), GE is not an Operator under the Act, and that no exception applies. Thus, none of Plaintiffs' claims against GE can stand under the Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Under California's choice-of-law governmental interest test, the Court finds that Japanese law applies to this case. Further, the Court interprets the Japanese Compensation Act to channel all liability from third parties to the Nuclear Operator. Because GE is not an Operator and no exception applies, the Compensation Act precludes all liability against GE. Thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   GE's Motion to Dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   all of Plaintiffs' claims against GE pursuant to the Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court (1)\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   GE's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 19) and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint as to the claims against GE; and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   TEPCO's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 20) and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   as to the claims against TEPCO.
