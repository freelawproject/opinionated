(Compl. (Docket Entry No. 1) \u00b6 21.) Defendant Personal Integrative Medicine, PLLC (\"PIM\") is a Tennessee corporation with its principal place of business in Ringgold, Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Defendant Charles C. Adams, M.D. (\"Dr. Adams\") owns and operates PIM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the time period relevant to this action, Dr. Adams was a licensed physician in Georgia and did business in Ringgold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Defendant Charles C. Adams. M.D., P.C., d/b/a Full Circle Medical Center (\"FCMC\") was a Tennessee corporation with its principal place of business in Ringgold, and Dr. Adams operated it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants \"perpetuated a scheme between November 2008 and September 2015 involving the knowing submission of false claims for medically unnecessary and 'alternative' chelation therapy that Dr. Adams administered using the drug calcium disodium versentate, or edetatecalcium disodium (EDTA), which the [Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") ] only approved for indications of lead poisoning and lead encephalopathy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)

Public Law 111-21, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009\n   (\"FERA\"), which was enacted on May 20, 2009, amended the FCA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) According to Plaintiff, \u00a7 3729(a)(1) of the prior statute applies to conduct that occurred before FERA's enactment, while \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A) of the revised statute applies to conduct that occurred after FERA's enactment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B) applies to all claims in this case.

[a] false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 35 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (1986).) \"As amended in 2009, the [FCA] extends liability, both before and after its amendments, to any person who 'knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) (2009).) As defined in the FCA, \"knowing\" and \"knowingly\" \"mean that a person, with respect to information: (1) has actual knowledge of the information; (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)

Medicare and Claims Submission Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Congress enacted the Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Act, known as the Medicare Program, in 1965 to pay for the costs of certain health care services. (Compl. \u00b6 38.) Entitlement to Medicare depends on age, disability, or affliction with end-stage renal disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) HHS administers Medicare, and it delegated responsibility for administering Medicare to CMS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Medicare has several parts, and this action concerns claims submitted under Medicare Part B, Supplementary Medical Insurance for the Aged and Disabled, which applies to \"those drugs that are provided incident to a physician's service and cannot usually be self-administered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CMS initially contracted with carriers, typically private insurance companies, to process and pay Part B claims. (Compl. \u00b6 41.) Beginning in November 2006, Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") began to replace carriers and fiscal intermediaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) MACs act on CMS's behalf to process and pay Part B claims, and they perform administrative functions on a regional level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Between 2009 and 2015, Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators, LLC (\"Cahaba\") was the Part B MAC for the region that included Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Independent clinical laboratories, group practices, and individual providers must submit CMS Form 8551, a Medicare Enrollment Application to participate in Medicare as new enrollees. (Compl. \u00b6 44.) Those entities also must complete that form to change information or to reactivate, revalidate, or terminate Medicare enrollment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By signing CSM Form 8551, signatories certify that: (1) they \"agree to abide by the Medicare laws, regulations, and program instructions\" that apply to them or to their organizations; (2) they \"understand that payment of a claim by Medicare is conditioned upon the claim and the underlying transaction complying with such laws, regulations, and program instructions ... and on the supplier's compliance with all applicable conditions of participating in Medicare\"; (3) they \"will not knowingly present or cause to be presented\n   a false or fraudulent claim for payment by Medicare\"; and (4) they \"will not submit claims with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) \"[A]n authorized official must sign the 'Certification Section' in Section 15 of Form CMS-8551, which legally and financially binds the signer to all of the laws, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Dr. Adams signed the certification statement on Section 15 of Form CMS-8551 on November 10, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Medicare providers submit reimbursement claims for services provided on a CMS 1500 form (the \"CMS 1500\") or its electronic equivalent, the 837P Form. (Compl. \u00b6 48.) Providers or suppliers include certain five digit codes, Current Procedural Terminology Codes (\"CPT Codes\") or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Level II Codes (\"HCPSC Codes\") (collectively, the \"Procedure Codes\") on CMS 1500 or 837P Forms to indicate to CMS the services rendered for which the providers or suppliers seek reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Providers also must include a diagnosis code with each claim to Medicare, which describes the diagnosis or medical condition associated with the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the time period relevant to this action, Medicare providers were required to use the diagnostic codes set forth in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (the \"ICD-9 Codes\"). (Compl. \u00b6 51.) The ICD-9 Code 9840-Toxic Inorganic Lead Component indicates a diagnosis of lead poisoning.

(Compl. \u00b6 53.) Dr. Adams' and FCMC's NPI number is 1437192465. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When they submit claims to Medicare, providers certify \"that (a) the services rendered are 'medically indicated and necessary for the health of the patient;' (b) the information on the claim form is 'true, accurate and complete;' and (c) the provider understands that 'payment and satisfaction of this claim will be from Federal and State funds, and that any false claims, statements, or documents, or concealment of a material fact, may be prosecuted under applicable Federal and State laws.\" (Compl. \u00b6 55.) Federal law prohibits healthcare providers \"from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims that represent a pattern of items or services that the person knew or should have known were not medically necessary, or knew or should have known were false or fraudulent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Chelation Therapy and Medicare Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"[c]helation therapy is a rare treatment that is generally only indicated for patients suffering from an uncommon condition called heavy metal poisoning (HMP), of which lead poisoning is the most common subset.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2.) According to Plaintiff, \"HMP is the accumulation of heavy metals, such as lead, mercury and cadmium, in toxic amounts, in the soft tissues of the body.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Lead poisoning is the most commonly diagnosed form of HMP.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013951\">\n    \u00b6 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Lead encephalopathy is caused by acute lead poisoning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that an HMP diagnosis \"generally requires a symptomatic patient who (1) has been acutely and recently exposed to lead or other heavy metals, and (2) had a blood test indicating a sufficiently high amount of heavy metal in the patient's body.\" (Compl. \u00b6 3.) According to Plaintiff, for most cases, \"the only treatment for HMP is the removal of the patient from the source of exposure to heavy metal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In some acute cases, however, \"chelation therapy may be indicated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 69.) This treatment \"involves providing a patient with a 'chelating agent' such as EDTA, which binds itself to the metals in the bloodstream and is then excreted from the body\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   urine, thereby reducing the amount of heavy metals in a patient's body.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013951\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013951\">\n    \u00b6 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Other chelating agents include Dimercaprol (\"BAL\") and Succimer (\"DMSA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71, 100-03.) Chelating drugs, including EDTA, can have serious side effects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Plaintiff alleges that \"[g]enerally, an oral chelating agent (e.g., DMSA) - as opposed to an intravenous chelating agent (e.g., EDTA) - should be administered,\" while \"[i]ntravenous chelating agents [such as EDTA] should be reserved for an incapacitated patient.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) According to Plaintiff, \"chelation therapy should be of limited duration, and should cease when laboratory tests confirm that heavy metals have been reduced to a level where they no longer present an acute health risk to the patient.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that patients with HMP have few dispositive symptoms, and that the majority of HMP symptoms are associated with several other ailments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) According to Plaintiff, \"a broad medical differential should be performed before concluding that a patient is symptomatic of, and/or actually suffering from lead poisoning, or another form of HMP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Plaintiff alleges that a critical assessment in diagnosing HMP \"is whether the patient has experienced a recent and acute exposure to heavy metal,\" and it contends that metal toxicity does not usually occur absent an extraordinary exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.) Most acute HMP presentations involve industrial exposure to heavy metals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Laboratory testing is required to diagnose HMP, but it is generally medically necessary only if a patient has had a recent acute exposure to heavy metals and the patient is symptomatic. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.) According to Plaintiff, the American College of Medical Toxicology (the \"ACMT\") determined that patients should not be screened for heavy metals absent excessive exposure to heavy metals.

(Compl. \u00b6 87.) Physicians use blood tests to diagnose HMP by assessing the amount of heavy metal in a patient's body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Physicians also sometimes use urine tests in conjunction with blood tests for certain heavy metals, such as mercury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 n.11.) For suspected lead poisoning, physicians use blood tests to assess the amount of lead within a patient's body, or blood lead level (\"BLL\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A provoked urine test, on the other hand, involves administering a chelating agent to a patient and collecting a urine sample some hours later. (Compl. \u00b6 90.) According to Plaintiff, the results almost invariably \"show the presence of supposedly 'heightened' levels of heavy metal, as the chelating agent dislodges heavy metal\n   that is imbedded in the body, which is then excreted in urine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that \"[p]rovoked urine tests have been repeatedly criticized, and the consensus is that the test is unreliable and potentially dangerous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Plaintiff, \"the medical consensus and standard of care provide that chelation is indicated only where a legitimate laboratory test (e.g., a blood test) - as opposed to a provoked urine test - demonstrates that lead (or another heavy metal) is present in a patient's body at a sufficiently high level.\" (Compl. \u00b6 94.) Although \"there is some variability as to the precise BLL where chelation is indicated, the consensus is that chelation is only indicated for patients with extremely heightened BLLs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) According to Plaintiff, chelation is not reasonable or necessary for a patient with a BLL of less than 40 mcg/dL, and there is no evidence that chelation is beneficial to patients with suspected lead poisoning and BLLs of less than 40 mcg/dL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98 &amp; n.14.) Plaintiff alleges that \"the mean BLL in adults in the United States from 2011 to 2012 was only 1.09 mcg/dL, while the medical consensus is that no action whatsoever ... is necessary with respect to patients with BLLs less than 5 mcg/dL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to Plaintiff, \"although the medical consensus is that chelation is generally only indicated from HMP,\" some alternative or integrative medical practitioners, such as Dr. Adams, market and administer it for a variety of conditions, including circulation issues, autism, heart disease, premature aging, and fatigue. (Compl. \u00b6 106.) Certain \"alternative\" or \"integrative\" medicine practitioners \"espouse the view that even low levels of heavy metals cause harm, and that therefore chelation is a medically appropriate treatment for patients with relatively low levels of heavy metals,\" even though \"the medical consensus is that chelation is only possibly indicated for patients with extremely high levels of heavy metal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) Plaintiff cited a 2013 editorial from the\n   <em>\n    Journal of Medical Toxicology\n   </em>\n   that contained observations about alternative chelation therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) Plaintiff contends that National Coverage Determination (\"NCD\") No. 20.22, which was issued by CMS in 2003 and was effective during the time period relevant to this action, provided that alternative chelation therapy was not covered by Medicare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Specifically, NCD 20.22 stated that \"the use of EDTA as a chelating agent to treat atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, calcinosis, or similar generalized conditions not listed by the FDA as an approved use is not covered,\" and \"[a]ny such use of EDTA is considered experimental.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).) Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2.2 of the CMS Medicare Program Integrity Manual provides that items are reasonable and necessary if, among other things, they are not experimental or investigational. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n.44.) According to Plaintiff, because the FDA approved EDTA only for indications of lead poisoning and lead encephalopathy, Dr. Adams' use of it for anti-aging, bone growth, cancer prevention, and circulation problems was not covered by Medicare, as provided in NCD 20.22, and was not considered reasonable and necessary.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.)

Dr. Adams stated that \"the basic course of treatment is thirty to forty treatments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Dr. Adams also told \"potential patients that heavy metals caused various health problems, and then utilized the results of widely discredited 'provoked urine tests' to tell patients that they had 'heightened' levels of heavy metal, which chelation could reduce, thereby alleviating medical problems, such as high blood pressure, poor circulation and premature aging.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that Dr. Adams routinely failed to conduct viable differential diagnoses before chelating patients. (Compl. \u00b6 131.) According to Plaintiff, this failure \"is consistent with the fact the patients he chelated generally affirmatively sought him out seeking EDTA chelation as an alternative therapy for circulation problems, as well as other conditions for which Dr. Adam[s] marketed EDTA chelation as an alternative or integrative treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Plaintiff alleges that \"Dr. Adams routinely tested patients for heavy metal, 'diagnosed' such patients with HMP, and then chelated such patients (ostensibly to treat HMP), despite the fact that such patients - as evidenced by the medical records - had not been recently or acutely\n   exposed to heavy metal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Plaintiff contends that \"Dr. Adams sidestepped the essential heavy metal exposure aspect of a valid HMP differential diagnosis with his supposition that, because of the presence of lead in gasoline between 1930 and 1995, anyone that drove during this period has been exposed to lead, and thus may be an appropriate candidate for heavy metal testing and/or chelation therapy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135 (internal quotation marks, emphasis, and footnote omitted).) Dr. Adams stated that he would advise a patient who sought chelation, but who had no possible exposure to lead other than use of the roads, that chelation therapy was reasonable.

Instead, Dr. Adams relied on provoked urine tests, and he used the results of those tests to convince patients that they had elevated heavy metals levels that could be reduced by chelation with EDTA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.)

Between March 2, 2009 and December 30, 2009, Dr. Adams chelated an 83-year-old Medicare beneficiary, M.D., thirty-six times, stating that it was the patient's call because she felt badly.
