DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Orexo argues in its summary judgment motion that \"validity is a single issue\" as a matter of law and that, therefore, the doctrine\n   of issue preclusion bars Defendants from challenging the validity of the # 996 patent in this action. D.I. 172. Defendants disagree that validity is a single issue, but they do not dispute that if validity is deemed to be a single issue then the Actavis entities are precluded from challenging the # 996 patent's validity in this action. D.I. 203 at \u00b6 11. Defendants contend that Teva is not bound by any judgment or rulings issued in the Zubsolv litigation regardless of whether validity is a single issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 210 at 3-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their papers filed in opposition to Orexo's motion, Defendants asserted as a factual matter that \"[t]he identical issue of the [# ]996 patent's validity was not previously litigated\" in the Zubsolv litigation.

D.I. 203 at 12-14. Orexo does not dispute that \u00a7 112 and the prior art references cited by Defendants were not presented or adjudicated in the Zubsolv litigation. Orexo simply contends that Defendants are precluded from asserting these invalidity defenses in this action because validity is a single issue and \"validity under \u00a7 103 was actually litigated, adjudicated, and necessary to the judgment [in the Zubsolv litigation].\" D.I. 216 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

They agree that Judge Robinson's rulings with respect to the # 996 patent's validity were necessary to her decision.

Orexo does not challenge Defendants' factual assertion that, because of \u00a7 112 arguments they seek to make and new prior art references they seek to present to establish obviousness in this action, the invalidity defenses\n   in the two actions are not identical. Orexo's only response to this assertion is that \"Defendants could have raised [in the Zubsolv litigation] the additional \u00a7 112 arguments and prior art they seek to raise here.\" D.I. 216 at 8.

And it is hard to see how the adoption of a per se rule would promote the public interests that prompted courts to adopt the doctrine of issue preclusion in the first place.

If that were the case, litigation costs would rise, trials would become more complicated, jury confusion would likely increase, and precious judicial resources would be wasted.
