Having duly considered the written submissions filed in support of and in opposition to the motions, the Court now renders its decision. For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and DENIES Defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The central issue presented in these motions is whether United breached its agreement with policyholders when it terminated life insurance policies included in Plaintiff's Class definition because prior to terminating these policies, it failed to provide the requisite notices under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2010113.71\">\n    Cal.

[Doc. # 1.] During the two and a half years that this case has been pending before this Court, United has filed various motions, all of which the Court denied to varying degrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Re Defendant's Motion to Dismiss FAC (\"June 22, 2016 Order\") [Doc. # 27]; Order Re Defendant's Motion for Certification of Court's Order (\"Sept. 14, 2016 Order\") [Doc. # 46]; Order Re Defendant's Motion to Dismiss TAC (\"Aug. 8, 2017 Order\") [Doc. # 107]; Order Re Defendant's Motion to Deny Class Certification (\"January 4, 2018 Order\") [Doc. # 119].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court granted class certification on May 1, 2018 (\"May 1, 2018 Order\").

The Plain Language of the Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   United argues that the Statutes apply only to policies issued or delivered on or after the Effective Date. According to United, the use of the word \"shall\" in the first sentence of both \u00a7\u00a7 10113.71 and 10113.72 indicate that the Legislature intended the Statutes to apply prospectively. United also contends that the use of \"applicant\" in \u00a7 10113.72(a) and the reference to subsection (a) in subsection (c) read in light of subsection (b) indicate that the right to change designees would be unnecessary unless an applicant has already made a designation upon being issued a policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   United asserts that \"it would be impossible for an insurer to comply with a policy that it issued prior to the date of that statute's enactment\" and application of the Statutes to pre-Effective Date policies is an unconstitutional impairment of contracts because the Statutes impose new obligations to which it did not consent.

The three statutes that do apply to life insurance do not relate to procedural notification requirements.

The policy can be reinstated if the policyholder fulfills certain conditions, including paying all past due premiums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Reinstatement\"). Additionally, all the policies on the Class List terminated after the Effective Date because of failure to make a required premium payment. Jt. Suppl. Ex., Ex. A (Column E). [Doc. # 167-1.] Whereas neither the Class Policies nor the Statutes define renewal, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"renewal\" as \"[t]he re-creation of a legal relationship or the replacement of an old contract with a new contract, as opposed to the mere extension of a previous relationship or contract.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014). This definition is consistent with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Argonaut\n   </em>\n   because the court did not consider the policy renewal a mere extension of the previous policy, but a new contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Argonaut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4707276\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/70/608/#p619\">\n    70 Cal.

Bentley's individual breach of contract claim (the third cause of action) alleged United breached its policy with Eric because United did not provide coverage for the entire year even though Eric made one of two required semi-annual payments during that policy year. TAC \u00b6 71. [Doc. # 87.] By contrast, that a \"renewal\" can mean a subannual policy payment that renews a policy for the period of time that the payment covers is entirely consistent with the Court's previous ruling that one semi-annual payment does not result in the policy renewing for the entire policy year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under the renewal principle, a renewal must occur subsequent to the Effective Date for the Statutes to be incorporated into the policies on the Class List. Bentley's reliance on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010110.6\">\n    Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 10110.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for her assertion that a policy renews if it continues in force on or after its anniversary date is misplaced. Section 10110.6 provides that discretionary clauses in life and disability insurance policies are void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010110.6\">\n    Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 10110.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsection (b) states, \"for the purposes of this\n   <em>\n    section\n   </em>\n   , 'renewed' means continued in force on or after the policy's anniversary date.\" \u00a7 10110.6(b) (emphasis added). Bentley does not cite to any legal authority that applies \u00a7 10110.6's renewal definition outside the context of discretionary clauses. Nor does \u00a7 10110.6 contain language indicating that its renewal definition was meant to be applied to other aspects of insurance policies besides the voidability of discretionary clauses. Indeed, the phrase \"for the purposes of this section\" in \u00a7 10110.6(b) indicates otherwise. Furthermore, case law supports the application of the renewal principle to incorporate a new statute into different types of insurance policies that renew subsequent to the effective date of the new statute (e.g., auto insurance in\n   <em>\n    Modglin\n   </em>\n   , transportation liability insurance in\n   <em>\n    Argonaut\n   </em>\n   , disability insurance in\n   <em>\n    Stephan\n   </em>\n   , and life insurance in\n   <em>\n    Cerone\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the Statutes to apply to a Class Policy, it must renew after the Effective\n   Date. Bentley's arguments that the Statutes apply to the Class Policies either because (1) those policies were in force subsequent to the Effective Date or (2) the Statutes apparently authorize a private cause of action are of no avail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bentley MSJ at 11 and Suppl. Memo ISO Bentley MSJ at 5. If either argument were valid, it would obviate the need for the renewal principle entirely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff cannot rely on the renewal principle when it suits her and then jettison it when it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, United's argument that it had until December 31, 2013 to send out an Offer to Designate Notice is unavailing. United was aware of the Statutes prior to the Effective Date and was expected to be in compliance by the time the Statutes became effective, especially given California's renewal principle and the fact that a premium payment constitutes a renewal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United App'x, Ex. 19 at 51-52 (indicating the California insurance governmental agencies communicated to insurers that insurers needed to be compliant with the Statutes by their Effective Date).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In consideration of the requirement under the renewal principle that a policy must renew for the Statutes to apply and that renewal can be a premium payment, the Court revises the Class List. First, six policies\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   United contends should be removed from the Class List because they did not reach their anniversary date in 2013 will remain because a premium payment was made in 2013 after the Effective Date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Suppl. Ex., Ex. A (Column D). The Court removes four policies\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the Class List because no premium payments were made in 2013 and therefore the Statutes were never incorporated into those policies through the renewal principle prior to lapsing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010110.6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    4.
