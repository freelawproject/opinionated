Miller, Jr., Judge\n   Liberty Mutual Insurance Company sued Dometic Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Dometic against three putative class action complaints. Dometic counter-claimed, alleging Liberty Mutual breached its contractual duty to defend Dometic against the underlying complaints. Liberty Mutual and Dometic each moved for judgment on the pleadings, [Doc. Nos. 37, 39], and the court heard arguments on the motions on February 27, 2019. For the following reasons, the court grants the motions in part and denies them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dometic bought four consecutive commercial general liability policies from Liberty Mutual. The policies provide coverage for property damage (among other things) and require Liberty Mutual to defend Dometic against a suit seeking damages because of property damage. Dometic tendered three putative class action complaints to Liberty Mutual, seeking coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The underlying complaints allege that Dometic sold gas absorption refrigerators, mainly for RVs, containing a defective cooling unit that can leak flammable gases and cause fires. Liberty Mutual elected to participate in Dometic's defense in each of the underlying suits subject to a reservation of rights, including the right to seek reimbursement of defense costs, and filed this suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Dometic against the underlying complaints. Dometic filed breach of contract counterclaims. The parties moved for judgment on the pleadings on Liberty Mutual's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dometic purchased four policies, covering the periods from 2001 to 2002, 2002 to 2003, 2003 to 2004, and 2004 to 2005. The Liberty Mutual policies provide coverage\n   for \"bodily injury\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"property damage\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   caused by an \"occurrence\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the policy period. The policies provide that Liberty Mutual has the \"right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking [damages because of property damage].\" [Doc. No. 1-1 at 30]. The policies include several exclusions and Liberty Mutual argues that exclusions a, k, m, and n bar or limit coverage in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Underlying Complaints--The\n   </em>\n   Papasan\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dometic tendered three putative class action complaints to Liberty Mutual, seeking coverage under the policies. The\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   putative class action complaint alleges that Dometic \"refrigerators contain dangerous defects that can cause them to vent pressurized hydrogen and ignite a fire.\" [Doc. No. 1-5 at \u00b6 1]. Some of the named plaintiffs claim that fires caused by Dometic refrigerators damaged property, including damage to RVs, other personal property, and improvements to real property. The complaint alleges that Dometic's \"[d]efective [g]as [a]bsorption [r]efrigerators have caused thousands of fires since 1997\" and defines the putative class as including \"all persons who purchased or owned a [d]efective [g]as [a]bsorption [r]efrigerator manufactured or purchased on or after January 1, 1997.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 133, 194].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   Zucconi\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Zucconi\n   </em>\n   putative class action complaint alleges that Dometic refrigerators' \"can prematurely develop cracks that release highly flammable hydrogen and ammonia [that] leak and may ignite.\" [Doc. No. 1-6 at \u00b6 3]. Some of the named plaintiffs allege property damage from fires allegedly caused by Dometic refrigerators, including damage to RVs and other personal property.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32, 47.

No. 1-7 at \u00b6 3]. Some of the named plaintiffs allege that their Dometic products caused fires, but don't specifically claim that the fires damaged property.

Dometic points to third-party property allegations by the named plaintiffs and broad allegations of hundreds or thousands of fires that caused millions of dollars in property damage. Dometic argues that although the named plaintiff's claims fall outside of the coverage periods, the court can and should consider the putative classes' claims, which would fall within the unexhausted policy coverage periods. Liberty Mutual contends that no coverage lies because none of the named plaintiffs allege property damage that occurred during a policy period, the putative class claims are too speculative to trigger coverage and would be barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and the policies' exclusions bar or limit coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Liberty Mutual first argues that it has no duty to defend Dometic against the underlying complaints because no named plaintiffs allege a potentially covered property damage claim during a policy period. It's undisputed that the property damage claims of the named plaintiffs in the underlying complaints all occurred years after the Liberty Mutual policies expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liberty Mutual therefore contends it has no duty to defend because \"[i]f the pleadings reveal that a claim is clearly excluded under the policy, then no defense is required.\"\n   <em>\n    Newnam Mfg., Inc. v.

Courts outside of Indiana have addressed the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered a case in which the insurer argued, as Liberty Mutual argues in this case, that putative class members' claims are too remote and speculative to trigger the duty to defend and a court shouldn't consider whether a duty to defend exists in a putative class action in which coverage could potentially be triggered by the putative class members' claims until the class is certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem.

Liberty Mutual cites to the relevant statutes of limitations for a number of states, noting that the longest limitations period is six years. Liberty Mutual argues that the policy period for the last policy it issued expired in 2005 and the underlying suits were filed in 2016 and 2017, so the applicable statute of limitations would bar any potentially covered claim. Dometic contends that it would be improper for the court to adjudicate a potential statute of limitations defense to an underlying complaint's claim in a declaratory judgment suit because the question\n   before the court is whether the underlying complaints' allegation trigger coverage, not whether a potential defense might defeat a claim. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"It is the nature of the [underlying] claim, not its merits, that determines an insurer's duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    5200 Keystone Ltd.

Accordingly, the court declines to consider whether a statute of limitations defense could succeed against any claims in the underlying complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Liberty Mutual also argues that various policy exclusions limit its duty to defend, but, in the course of their briefing, the parties appear to agree that three of the four exclusions don't bar coverage for third-party property damage claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties' dispute is therefore narrowed to the applicability of exclusion a, which excludes coverage for property damage the insured expected or intended.

[Doc. No. 49]. Dometic asked the court to decline to take judicial notice, arguing the consolidated complaint was irrelevant to whether the underlying complaints attached to Liberty Mutual's declaratory action complaint triggered a duty to defend. At the hearing, Liberty Mutual agreed that the court needn't take notice of the consolidated class action complaint to resolve the issues relevant to the motions for judgment on the pleading, but argued that the consolidated complaint \"crystalizes\" the nature of the class action claims.
