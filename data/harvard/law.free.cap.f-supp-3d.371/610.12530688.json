Docket No. 16 (\"FAC\"). Defendant filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration on August 30, 2018. Docket No. 17 (\"Mot.\"). Both parties were heard on the matter on October 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This is the second motion to compel arbitration filed in this case. Rather than respond to the first motion to compel arbitration, Plaintiff filed her FAC, raising for the first time a PAGA claim.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   FAC. Plaintiff has since conceded that her PAGA claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Docket No. 18 (\"Opp.\") at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's claims arise under the Federal Labor Standards \u00a7 16(b); California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 226.7(a), 512(a), 226(a), 201 - 203, 221 - 224\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , 2699 ; and California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   FAC. Plaintiff argues that she and other class members are entitled to premium wages for overtime pay based on a regular rate with commission and bonuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Plaintiff contends that Defendant denied her, and other class members, minimum wages owed to her and others based on overtime work laws, wages upon discharge, and compensation for meals and rest breaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to keep accurate payroll and wage statements in accordance with California law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff worked as an employee of Defendant from December 2015 to June 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Her role was that of a mortgage specialist in Orange County, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She contends that in that position she regularly worked over eight hours a day without overtime pay or compensation for rest breaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Plaintiff filed the FAC, Defendant moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss the action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1). Mot. The basis for this motion is an arbitration agreement in Plaintiff's employment contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff opposes the motion to compel arbitration on several grounds. She claims that Defendant waived its right to arbitrate. She argues that the actual agreement is not valid because the express language of the agreement required a signature from the Executive Vice President, which was not satisfied. Opp. at 12. Plaintiff also contends that California law rather than Illinois law governs the contract despite a choice of law provision in the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Defendant does not address this contention in its papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff also challenges the arbitration agreement based on unconscionability. She asserts that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable because it is a contract of adhesion, and because Plaintiff did not receive a copy of the AAA rules which govern the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because the agreement requires her to arbitrate the types of claims an employee is most likely to bring while allowing Defendant the option to avoid arbitration for the types of claims that an employer is most likely to bring. Similarly, she takes issue with the conscionability of the choice of law provision as it requires Plaintiff to waive unwaivable claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-29. Plaintiff also challenges, as unconscionable, a fee shifting provision and the forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the defects in the arbitration agreement cannot be severed; therefore, if the Court finds that the contract is unconscionable, she claims that the Court cannot apply the agreement's severability clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the hearing, Plaintiff informed the Court that there is a parallel case in Sacramento County Superior Court (\n   <em>\n    Tadena v. Guaranteed Rate, Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 32-2018-00232323 (Sac. Super. Ct. 2018) ). The\n   <em>\n    Tadena\n   </em>\n   case is a class action with some overlapping claims to those in the present matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The relevant provisions of the arbitration agreement read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   V.

It contends that \"GRI has legitimate interests in protecting its intellectual property, trade secrets, and other confidential elements of their business.\" Reply at 8 n.4. But Defendant fails sufficiently to articulate a business reality justification. The arbitration agreement in a conclusory manner identifies a purported justification for breach of the non-solicitation clause stating that a breach will cause immediate irreparable injury. No other explanation is provided. And the agreement does not identify a business justification for injunctive relief not involving solicitation.

Defendant argues that the fee shifting provision does not even apply. The provision reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   The Company may recover from you its attorneys' fees and costs relating to any action to enforce, defend, and/or prosecute this Agreement. You acknowledge that a breach of any provision of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Company and that monetary damages will be inadequate and may be difficult or impossible to ascertain. Therefore, in the event of any such breach, or threatened breach, in addition to all other remedies, the Company shall have the right to require you to fulfill your obligations by way of temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 at 14. Defendant contends that the claims raised here arise under the Labor Code and are not claims to \"enforce, defend, and/or prosecute\" the Agreement. In the hearing held on October\n   26, 2018, Defendant conceded that it would not be able to seek attorneys' fees in the present dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It is true that Plaintiff does not claim breach of contract; rather Plaintiff's claims arise from the Labor Code. While an argument could be made that the present dispute (at least the motion at bar) involves \"enforcing\" the arbitration agreement, no party has so contended, and the Court must interpret the ambiguous language above in a manner that renders the contract lawful and enforceable.\n   <em>\n    Ajamian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248780\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/203/771/\">\n    203 Cal.
