In the original complaint, plaintiffs sought damages and response costs due to alleged contamination by hazardous substances of property owned by plaintiffs. The complaint was ostensibly brought on behalf of a class of owners, occupants and residents of an area identified in the complaint as the \"Houghton Plot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 21, 2018, the Court issued a Decision and Order (\"2018 Decision\") granting defendant's motion to dismiss all but plaintiffs' first cause of action, which seeks response costs under CERCLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also stayed that cause of action pending further order of the Court, based on the pendency of a remedial process taking place pursuant to administrative proceedings before the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"DEC\").\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528841\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/342/\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.N.Y. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs have now filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, or in the alternative for an order entering final judgment on the claims that were dismissed by this Court's 2018 Decision.

Plaintiffs' additional allegations in the proposed amended complaint add little of substance to that, and do not correct that basic defect.

Their chief justification for the requested Rule 54(b) certification is not that the claims are factually distinct, but that plaintiffs do not want to wait years (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , until the DEC-ordered remediation is completed) to obtain relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Mem.

Though the Court said that with respect to defendants' motion to stay plaintiffs' CERCLA claim for response costs, the same principle holds true as to their state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Undoubtedly, many litigants who have received an unfavorable decision on fewer than all of their claims would like to take an immediate interlocutory appeal, in the hopes of obtaining a quick reversal or remand. But that is not the rule in federal court. Rule 54(b) certification is confined to narrow circumstances, for good reason. That reason is to \"ensure[ ] that the court of appeals is not forced to review identical facts or identical legal issues in multiple appeals,\" thereby \"ensur[ing] the efficient and orderly administration of judicial resources.\"\n   <em>\n    National Asbestos Workers Med.

The same holds true as to plaintiffs' claims under state law. Even if the Court were to grant certification, and its dismissal of the state-law claims were reversed on appeal, plaintiffs' damages, if any, could not be fully determined until after the remediation is completed. While plaintiffs contend that they have already sustained, and continue to sustain damages, the fact remains that the DEC has directed a process of remediation. Until that is completed, it is impracticable, at the very least, to attempt to assess plaintiffs' damages.
