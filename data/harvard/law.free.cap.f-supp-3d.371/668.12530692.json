However, representative claim 25 is directed to the same idea as claim 41 because claim 25 already discloses the use of a synchronizer. Adding an additional synchronizer, as claim 41 does, fails to transmute claim 41 into disclosing a fundamentally different idea than representative claim 25 because the additional synchronizer of claim 41 is also involved in the data transfer process, thus performing the same basic process as the synchronizer of representative claim 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In sum, claims 1, 25, 43, and 46 are representative of the '399 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Below, the Court conducts the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis for claims 1, 25, and 46 of the '399 Patent together.

It discloses (1) the creation of an interactive connection, (2) the creation of a data transfer connection, and then (3) generating a single session ID associating the two connections. '399 Patent at 11:58-64. Thus, claim 1 boils down to starting two types of data connections, and then assigning a label (i.e., a session ID) to the data connections. Similarly, claim 25 tacks onto the concepts disclosed in claim 1 an additional limitation wherein the exchange of data is synchronized. Additionally, claim 46 adds to the concepts disclosed in claim 1 the idea of exchanging data with the use of a username. The Court finds that claims 1, 25, and 46 are all directed toward abstract ideas. The Court discusses each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   a.

'399 Patent at 11:58-64. Exemplified in claim 1 (and also common to claims 25 and 46, also discussed in this section) are the interactive connection and the data transfer connection.

Specifically, the specification makes clear that the Patent did not invent either the interactive connection or the data transfer connection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '399 Patent at 3:32-34 (\"Preferably, the service provider includes a\n   <em>\n    WWW server\n   </em>\n   , for the interactive session and an\n   <em>\n    FTP server\n   </em>\n   for the file upload session.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:61-64 (\"The interactive connection is made between WWW client 14, which is preferably a\n   <em>\n    standard browser\n   </em>\n   and WWW server 20 which is preferably a\n   <em>\n    commercially available WWW server.\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:28-29 (\"In a preferred embodiment of the invention, FTP client 14 and FTP server 18 are\n   <em>\n    standard commercial FTP programs.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Thus, the \"interactive connection\" and \"data transfer connection\" are generic computer functions related to receiving and transmitting data. Therefore, the creation of the interactive connection and the data transfer connection are akin to the patent in\n   <em>\n    TLI.\n   </em>\n   The '399 Patent's disclosure of the interactive connection and the data transfer connection constitute the performance of generic computer functions such as transmitting and receiving data.

However, a single session ID is simply a label by which the connections are identified. Applying an identificatory label to the generic exchange of data via the interactive connection and the data transfer connection is hardly a specific improvement on computer functionality or a nongeneralized computer activity. Per the\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   court, \"[t]he concept of data collection,\n   <em>\n    recognition\n   </em>\n   , and storage is undisputedly well-known.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, the well-known and abstract concept of data recognition is embodied by assigning a session ID to the data connections, because the session ID-as its name suggests-identifies the data connections that are created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff cites to\n   <em>\n    DDR Holdings\n   </em>\n   , a case Plaintiff claims is analogous, for the proposition that \"claims directed to website usability and functionality 'rooted in computer technology' \" are not directed to an abstract idea.

Here, we have the situation where generic aspects of computing-transmitting and receiving data-are performed using generic elements of data transfer via the internet-a WWW server and an FTP server. Neither the '399 Patent specification nor claims provide any additional details on how interactions with the internet are manipulated to yield a desired result, like in\n   <em>\n    DDR Holdings.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the '399 Patent is much more analogous to the patent in\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   , in which computer systems and methods were described and implemented in purely generic terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '399 Patent at 11:60-61 (claiming the process of \"creating an interactive connection\" and \"creating a data transfer connection\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Thus, claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   b.

This is an example of data recognition because the session ID is a form of identification that is associated with the interactive connection and the data transfer connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Additionally, claim 25 discloses a synchronizer, which, as explained above, \"generates a single session ID for two associated sessions, each on a different one of said servers.\" '399 Patent at 4:34-36. Using the same logic as applied to claim 1, the synchronizer is a tool by which the data or data transfer process can be further identified.

Here, however, claim 1 follows a conventional process of creating a data transfer protocol\n   wherein connections are established between two computers or servers, and the connection is identified by a session ID. For example, the court in\n   <em>\n    BuySAFE\n   </em>\n   held that the fact that \"a computer receives and sends the information over a network-with no further specification-is not even arguably inventive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186028\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/1350/#p1353\">\n    765 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, claim 25 is merely an extension of claim 1, adding a synchronizer that can generate one session ID for two associated sessions. As aforementioned, according to the\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   court, identification of data, such as through assignment of a session ID, can hardly be considered inventive enough to transform an abstract idea into a patentable one.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The remote server, remote data display, and local data display are, in broad terms, generic, conventional components. The specification confirms these are generic components, as the specification adds no more specificity as to the remote server or local data display.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '399 Patent at 5:26-34 (\"There is also provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a method of local file information display, comprising: uploading a list or fle [sic] information for a plurality of local files to a remote server; generating a data display at the remote server; and locally displaying said data display....\").

Claim 8 similarly requires performance of the same basic process and is linked to the same idea as claim 1 because claim 8 discloses the access checker restricting access to the data resource based on the path the resource takes through the network. Claim 8 is encapsulated in claim 1's requirement that the access checker allow access to a data resource only if prerequisite security levels are met. Thus, claim 1 is representative of the '505 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Below, the Court conducts the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis for claim 1 of the '505 Patent.

It recites no concrete components, whether generic or not.\" Mot. at 21. Defendant gives the example of the U.S. government controlling access to information by \"setting different levels of access control (e.g., Secret and Top Secret clearances), and then only allowing access to data set to [a] certain permission level based on the clearance of a person desiring access.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Plaintiff counters that the '505 Patent's claims \"recite a technical solution (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , tailoring authentication and encryption depending on the path taken through the network and the requested resource) to overcome a problem specifically arising in 1997 computer technology.\" Opp. at 12. Plaintiff further notes that the subject matter of the '505 Patent cannot be performed by a human mentally or via pencil and paper. \"No human mind could determine the path taken by a request for information or the mode of information used to determine the source of such a request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has oversimplified the '505 Patent so broadly that it ignores the features recited by the claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In reply, Defendant argues that the '505 Patent is not directed to solving an issue unique to the world of computing. Reply at 8. Rather, \"[c]laim 1 of the '505 Patent is likewise directed to control of access of information. There is nothing in the claim that indicates it is either a technological solution, or that it solves a uniquely technological problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Court finds that claim 1 of the '505 Patent is directed to (1) associating a security level with a data resource, (2) associating a security level with a mode of identification of a user, and then (3) ensuring that the user's security level is sufficiently high to meet the security level of the data resource to access the data resource. '505 Patent at 49:2-12. According to the specification, \"an access request for a[n information resource] will not be forwarded by the access filter unless the trust level of the mode of identification employed by the user ... [is] sufficient for the sensitivity\n   level of the resource.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:38-44. However, the claim does not provide any limits that curb how the apparatus performs these functions. Thus, the Court finds that claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea. The claim here invokes computers merely as tools to execute fundamental data access control principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court finds that claim 1 falls squarely within the category of controlling access to data, which the Federal Circuit has found to be an abstract idea. Specifically, the Federal Circuit has held as abstract the idea of \"controlling access to data based on payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Smartflash LLC v. Apple Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 680 Fed. App'x 977, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2017). In particular, the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Smartflash\n   </em>\n   \"all purport to retrieve and provide this data subject to 'payment validation' and 'access/use rule[s]' that specify conditions for accessing/using the retrieved data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although here, the access to data is not controlled based on payment like in\n   <em>\n    Smartflash\n   </em>\n   , the case is still analogous. Making payment, like the trust level of a user, is a threshold that must be met in order to gain access to the requested data. Here, if a user has an inadequate trust level, much like if the amount of payment were insufficient, access to the requested data would be blocked.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '505 Patent at 6:38-44 (\"[A]n access request for a resource will not be forwarded by the access filter unless the trust level of the mode of identification employed by the user ... [is] sufficient for the sensitivity level of the resource.\"). Moreover, claim 1 of the '505 patent certainly implements \"access/use rules,\" much like the\n   <em>\n    Smartflash\n   </em>\n   patent, in controlling access to data. 680 Fed. App'x at 982 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '505 Patent at 5:66-6:3 (\"The aspect of making access filters scalable which is addressed by the claims attached hereto is that of providing only as much authentication and encryption security as is required for a given user, a given path through the network, and a given resource.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In a similar vein, the District of Delaware found that a patent controlling access to data was directed to an abstract idea. Circuit Judge Bryson of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation on the District of Delaware, summarized the claim at issue as follows: \"[a] method entailing storing a customer's identity and the list of items as to which that customer has access rights and, when the customer requests one of the items for which the customer has access rights, obtaining that item from the source and sending it to the customer.\"\n   <em>\n    British Telecomms.

The\n   <em>\n    British Telecomms.\n   </em>\n   court found that this concept \"fits squarely within the category of fundamental economic and conventional business practices[ ] that the Federal Circuit has repeatedly held to be abstract ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20438335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Like in the '505 Patent, the\n   <em>\n    British Telecomms.\n   </em>\n   patent assigns a security level to the user and a security level to the item the customer is requesting. Here, access to a data resource depends on the security level of the user, much like how in\n   <em>\n    British Telecomms.\n   </em>\n   , a customer can only obtain an item from the source depending on if the customer is requesting an item to which the customer has access rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20438335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    British Telecomms.\n   </em>\n   court found a plethora of real-world analogues to this claimed process of assigning security levels to a user and a data resource, then controlling access to the data resource based on the user's security level: \"Many examples come to mind, such as ... a college record-keeping system that provides different degrees of access to a student's records depending on whether the record requester is the\n   student, an administrator, a professor, or a healthcare professional affiliated with the college.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20438335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Therefore, claim 1 of the '505 Patent is directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    Step Two for Claim 1 of the '505 Patent -Whether the Claim Contains an Inventive Concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendant argues that the '505 Patent acknowledges that access filters were generic components well-known in the prior art.

'505 Patent at 49:2-12. As aforementioned, claim 1 merely recites a \"sensitivity level\" associated with the data resource, a \"trust level\" associated with the mode of identification\" of a user, and an \"access checker which permits the apparatus to provide the resource only if the trust level for the mode of identification is sufficient for the sensitivity level of the resource.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Court finds that none of the elements of claim 1 (a \"sensitivity level,\" a \"trust level,\" and an \"access checker\"), assessed individually, provide an inventive concept. The '505 Patent specification discloses that a \"sensitivity level\" and a \"trust level\" are merely generic concepts in data security: \"[w]hen a user makes a request to access an information item, the access filter will grant the access only if the\n   <em>\n    trust level\n   </em>\n   for the mode of identification that the user employs in the request is no lower than the\n   <em>\n    sensitivity level\n   </em>\n   of the resource.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:13-16 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:30-33 (\"The sensitivity level of a resource is simply a value that indicates the trust level required to access the resource.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In general, the greater the need to protect the information resource, the higher its sensitivity level.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:27-32 (\"The data sensitivity level indicates the level of secrecy associated with the information resource and is assigned to the information resource by the security administrator responsible for the resource.

Moreover, Defendant's motion equates an access filter with an access checker, Mot. at 21, an assertion that Plaintiff does not challenge, Opp. at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In addition, access filters, as the above definition from the Patent specification discloses, are also generic computer components. Claim 1 describes access filters in purely functional terms; claim 1 fails to describe\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the access filter accomplishes the goal of restricting access based on the security level of the mode of identification of the user. The specification sheds no additional light, as it describes access filters in very vague terms as \"a set of software and hardware components in the computer system.\" '505 Patent at 2:55-56. Thus, none of the elements of claim 1, assessed individually, transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible concept as they are the \"application of an abstract idea using conventional and well-understood techniques\"\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    899 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Finally, the ordered combination of the elements of claim 1 also does not yield an inventive concept. In\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that \"an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\" 827 F.3d at 1350. Here, however, claim 1 follows a conventional order of how an access checker (i.e., access filter) serves as a gatekeeper to a data resource. Claim 1 claims a set of preset rules (i.e., a trust level of the mode of identification of a user and a sensitivity level of an information resource), rules that the access checker applies to grant or deny access to an information resource.

The answer in the instant case is no. The '505 Patent recites generic computers and computer servers to implement the idea of limiting access to data based on permissions.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the '399 Patent and the '505 Patent are directed to unpatentable subject matter and are thus invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Plaintiff has not identified any representative claims of the '399 Patent. As discussed below, the Court finds claims 1, 25, 43, and 46 to be representative of the '399 Patent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Plaintiff has not identified any representative claims of the '505 Patent. As discussed below, the Court finds that claim 1 is representative of the '505 Patent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    One court has noted that, like all tools of analysis, the \"pencil and paper\" analogy must not be unthinkingly applied.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cal.
