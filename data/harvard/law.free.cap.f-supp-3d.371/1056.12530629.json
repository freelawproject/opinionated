(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By way of background, Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (hereinafter, \"ERISA\"), to provide a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans, including health plans offered through private-sector employers and unions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The purpose of ERISA is to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by setting out substantive regulatory requirements for employee benefit plans and providing appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in December 2017, Plaintiff filed a series of cases against Defendant in small claims court, alleging that Plaintiff provided medical treatment to patients, submitted claims for reimbursement of its charges for those services, and Defendant did not pay the full amount that Plaintiff billed for those services. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 2) In the Pinellas County Cases, Plaintiff pursued the claims under a third-party beneficiary theory.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the ERISA Plan contract by \"fail[ing] to properly pay or deny\" Plaintiff's claims for services rendered to the patients in violation of Florida law.

The Court does not, however, have sufficient information to make this determination. Specifically, the Complaint does not plead whether the challenged failure to remit a full payment is due to a determination that the rate of pay is in dispute, or due to a challenge regarding the duty to pay some aspect of a claim at all, resulting in Plaintiff having received less than full payment. While certain factual allegations of the Complaint support Plaintiff's contention that its claims only involve a \"rate of payment\" dispute, a closer reading of the Complaint indicates that Plaintiff's allegations may also implicate the \"right to payment.\" (Dkt. 2) For example, in the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that it \"specifically challenges Defendant's billed rate reductions\" and \"has not agreed ... to be bound by the Defendant's reimbursement policies or rate schedules ....\" (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-14) In addition, Plaintiff asserts that \"Defendant received notice of the covered loss ... [yet] failed to pay the proper rate for the subject claim(s).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32) These allegations suggest that at least some of Plaintiff's claims may require the interpretation of the underlying ERISA Plan to determine whether Defendant properly paid or disclaimed Plaintiff's billed expenses for the medical services provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Without additional information, the Court is unable to complete the\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   analysis because the Complaint and record evidence before the Court are insufficient to resolve the mandatory inquiries. If, as Defendant asserts, its failure to reimburse Plaintiff the full rate for the claims at issue was based on the extent of the underlying ERISA Plan's coverage, in part or in whole, this action implicates a \"right to payment\" issue. On the other hand, if, as Plaintiff asserts, Defendant has in fact adjudicated the patient claims at issue and already determined each claim to be covered under the ERISA Plan policy, and Defendant's reductions are due to a dispute over the percentage of payment owed, then the only issue is the \"rate of payment\" at which Plaintiff was reimbursed. And of course, the remittance amount from Defendant could have been derived by both: a decision to disallow certain claimed amounts entirely due to the provisions of the ERISA Plan, and to pay reduced percentages for certain covered claims. This would be the so-called hybrid payment decision. In sum, the Court lacks sufficient information regarding the basis for Defendant's failure to pay the full amount demanded for the submitted claims to conclude\n   that the payment decisions implicate the ERISA Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant has failed to meet its burden of proving that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, and therefore, removal is permitted.\n   <em>\n    Hialeah Anesthesia Specialists\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273872\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/1323/#p1326\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    City of Vestavia Hills\n   </em>\n   , 676 F.3d at n.1 and\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9472830\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/1316/#p1319\">\n    269 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1319 ) (\"The removing party bears the burden of proof regarding the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction, and it bears the burden of demonstrating that removal is proper.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scimone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057566\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/876/#p882\">\n    720 F.3d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
