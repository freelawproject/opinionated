Davila-Lynch also alleges that heard a \"click and pause\" sound upon answering each of those calls, a fact that he contends \"indicate[s]\" the calls were made using an \"Automatic Telephone Dialing System\" (\"ATDS\").

In addition, the fact that Congress \"left the definition of ATDS untouched, even though the FCC's prior orders,\" including the 2015 ruling, \"interpreted this definition to include devices that could dial numbers from a stored list,\" suggested to the court that Congress had \"tacit[ly] approv[ed]\" this interpretation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1045\">\n    at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although not an obvious decision, the Court concludes that the understanding of the statute put forward in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   is correct. In addition to the reasons provided by\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , that conclusion is supported by the desire to avoid an anomaly that arises from the alternate reading of the statute. Under the alternate reading, the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" applies to both \"store\" and \"produce.\" Applying the phrase to both words creates the following definitions for an ATDS: (1) \"equipment which has the capacity to\n   <em>\n    store\n   </em>\n   ... telephone numbers to be called [ ] using a random or sequential number generator\" and (2) \"equipment which has the capacity to\n   <em>\n    produce\n   </em>\n   ... telephone numbers to be called [ ] using a random or sequential number generator.\" The second of those two definitions makes perfect sense; it is easy to imagine an ATDS that produces numbers using a number generator. The first definition, however, does not, because it is unclear how an ATDS-or indeed anything-could \"store\" numbers \"using\" a number generator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Courts that follow the alternate reading address that anomaly by finding that the use of the verb \"store\" ensures that \"a system that generated random numbers and did not dial them immediately, but instead stored them for later automatic dialing\" would still qualify as an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Yahoo!, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528382\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/346/1159/#p1160\">\n    346 F.Supp.3d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1162, n.4 (N.D.

Such a system, however, would also be covered by the reading of the statute in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   -in other words, such a system would still qualify as equipment that has the capacity to\n   <em>\n    produce\n   </em>\n   numbers using a number generator. Accordingly, under that interpretation of the statute, the word \"store\" serves no purpose, and is rendered superfluous. Because it is a \"cardinal principle\" that courts \"must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,\" such a result weighs in favor of the\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   reading of the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

But considering the statute as it is written, the Court concludes that the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" modifies only the verb \"produce\" and not the verb \"store.\" Therefore, to qualify as an ATDS under the TCPA, a device need only have the capacity to do one of the following: either (1) \"store ... telephone numbers to be called\" and \"dial such numbers,\"\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (2) \"produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator\" and \"dial such numbers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent Horizon Solar seeks dismissal on the basis that the devices at issue do not qualify as ATDSs under the TCPA, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Horizon Solar also contends that \"even if Plaintiffs allege[ ] the existence of an ATDS, their allegations are insufficient due to their conclusory nature.\" (Def.

Furthermore, the second amended complaint alleges that Davila-Lynch heard \"pre-recorded\" messages during the calls he received from Solar Spectrum. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Taken together, the facts alleged by the second amended complaint are sufficient to raise an inference that an ATDS was used to make the calls allegedly received by Davila-Lynch from Solar Spectrum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The facts alleged as to the calls received by Gonzalez are more problematic. The second amended complaint alleges the following: that Gonzalez received calls from a \"ViciDial predictive dialer\" and a \"Five9 virtual dialing sytem\"; that there is \"geographic distance between\" him and the companies that called him; that the calls he received contained \"scripted telemarketing pitches\"; that he received eight calls in a period of about five weeks, including calls on five consecutive days between February 12 and February 16, 2018; and that his \"experience\" is apparently \"not unique,\" as others have made online postings which claim to have received \"scam\" calls from Horizon Solar made from the same number that called his phone. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 47-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Gonzalez does not allege that he heard a \"click and pause\" after he answered any of the calls. Nonetheless, the allegations are sufficient, if barely so, to raise a plausible inference that an ATDS was used. He alleges the use of a specific type of predictive dialer and dialing system, not simply a generic ATDS, and further alleges that the calls contained a scripted pitch. More significantly, the high number of calls in a short period of time, all for the same purpose, raises a plausible inference that an automated system was used. In short, therefore, Gonzalez has raised at least a plausible claim of TCPA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Mass. Gen.

Here, the only potentially economic injury alleged is the claimed charges for calls. The complaint does not allege a specific dollar amount, and presumably such charges are imposed only with certain types of cell phone plans. That is, to say the least, a slender thread on which to hang a Chapter 93A claim. Nonetheless, it is at least a plausible claim of economic injury, sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. To the extent, however, the complaint alleges other injuries, such as annoyance or frustration, they are not legally cognizable under Chapter 93A, at least in an action brought by a consumer. Accordingly, Horizon Solar's motion to dismiss will be denied as to the claim brought under Chapter 93A, but the claim may proceed only on a theory of economic injury, based on charges incurred for receiving the calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motion of defendant HOSOPO Corporation, doing business as Horizon Solar Power, to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The second amended complaint also names David Goodstein, owner of Flowmedia and TMI, as a defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Davila-Lynch alleges that Solar Spectrum and Horizon Solar merged in September 2017.
