Plaintiff filed a Reply to Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion and a Response to Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 38] (\"Pl.'s Reply\"). Defendant filed a Reply to Plaintiff's Response [ECF No. 45] (\"Def.'s Reply\"). The Court has carefully considered the parties' submissions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   their exhibits, the record, Plaintiff's Complaint [ECF No. 1], and applicable law. For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion is denied and Defendant's Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a coverage dispute arising out of the duty to defend an underlying lawsuit alleging various construction defects. The facts are entirely undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 29, 2010, Eldorado Towers Condominium Association, Inc. (\"Association\") entered into a contract with Plaintiff's insured, National Concrete Preservation, Inc. (\"National Concrete\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts [ECF No. 32] \u00b6 1 (\"Pl.'s SOFs\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Facts [ECF No. 36] \u00b6 1 (\"Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF\") ). National Concrete agreed to serve as the contractor for the repair and restoration of a pool, Jacuzzi,\n   pool decks, clubhouse decks, and a garage area (\"Project\") for the Association's complex in Aventura, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff issued three commercial general liability policies to National Concrete for the policy periods of January 12, 2011 to January 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Plaintiff's Amendment to Other Insurance Condition Endorsement provides National Concrete insurance that \"is excess over any other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or any other basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Therefore, if there is a \"valid and collectible insurance available ... under any other policy,\" Plaintiff has \"no duty to defend ... the insured against any 'suit.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ). Under Plaintiff's policies, \"[i]f no other insurer defends, [Plaintiff] will undertake to do so, but [is] entitled to the insured's rights against all those other insurers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2011, National Concrete retained Rosmel Pools, Inc. (\"Rosmel\") to serve as one of its subcontractors on the Project. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). Rosmel agreed to perform work and supply materials for the Project. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). In the contract, Rosmel stated it would endorse National Concrete as an additional insured and would designate its retained insurance as primary over any other insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For its part, Defendant issued commercial lines policies that contained commercial general liability coverage to Rosmel for the policy periods of July 29, 2008 to June 20, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). The July 29, 2010 to June 20, 2013 policies contain an Additional Insured - Owners, Lessees or Contractors - Scheduled Person or Organization Endorsement, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Section II - Who Is An Insured is amended to include as an additional insured the person(s) or organization(s) shown in the Schedule, but only with respect to liability for ... \"property damage\" ... caused, in whole or in part by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.

In contrast, an \"occurrence\" under the policy is \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In October 2015 - nearly five years after National Concrete and Rosmel began working on the Project - the Association filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, case no. 2015-023546-CA-01 (\"Underlying Action\"), against National Concrete, alleging claims of breach of contract and negligence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 2). The Association filed multiple amended pleadings, concluding with a Fifth Amended Complaint, the final and operative pleading in the case. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). The claims by the Association against National Concrete remained the same and the allegations regarding the Project generally remained the same in all pleadings. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Association's operative Fifth Amended Complaint seeks damages for defects and deficiencies resulting from the 2010 Project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 23). The Fifth Amended Complaint [ECF No. 32-1] specifically alleges the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) In October, 2010, the Association entered into a contract with National Concrete for the repair and restoration\n   of an elevated pool, Jacuzzi, pool decks, club house decks, and the garage areas beneath the pool decks at Eldorado.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) The 2010 Project was completed in 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) In Count I, the Association alleges following the completion of National Concrete's work on the Project, the Association learned of and/or noticed various leaks, spalling, and rust stains below the pool deck at the Project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (4) On May 9, 2016 and August 10, 2016, the Association sent National Concrete an Amended Notice of Claim and Supplemental Notice of Claim respectively, in accordance with Chapter 558, Florida Statutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (5) National Concrete breached the 2010 contract with the Association by performing defective work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (6) In Count II, the Association alleges National Concrete was negligent and breached its duty of care by failing to make sure that the Association's pool, pool deck and garage were reasonably and adequately installed and/or were otherwise free of defects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   3-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff provided and continues to provide a defense to National Concrete for the allegations in the Underlying Action under a full and complete reservation of rights to later decline coverage for any damages not triggering coverage under the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On September 26, 2014 and January 4, 2015, Defendant's independent adjuster sent a letter and follow-up letter to Rosmel stating Rosmel's defective work had caused residual leaks that damaged the concrete structure below. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). The letters placed Rosmel on notice of the claim and demanded Rosmel provide a defense to National Concrete as an additional insured and contractual indemnitee. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). On July 2, 2015, Defendant sent a reservation of rights letter to the independent adjuster retained by Plaintiff declining to provide a defense to Plaintiff as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   National Concrete later filed Third-Party Complaints in the Underlying Action against Rosmel for common law indemnification, contractual indemnity, breach of contract, subrogation and negligence, alleging defects and deficiencies in Rosmel's scope of work on the Project, which resulted in property damage as defined in the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). In March and December 2017, Defendant reiterated it was declining to provide a defense and indemnity to National Concrete as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff then filed this action in March 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.). The Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Count I) stating that Defendant's policy to Rosmel provides coverage to, including a duty to defend, National Concrete as an additional insured on a primary and non-contributory basis for the allegations in the Underlying Action. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-39). Plaintiff also seeks damages for Defendant's breach of contract (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Count II) when it failed to provide a defense to National Concrete as an additional insured for the allegations in the Underlying Action. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-45).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As stated, both parties now seek summary judgment, asking the Court to determine whether Defendant owes a duty to defend National Concrete as an additional\n   insured in the Underlying Action. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the outset, the Court identifies the undisputed premises underlying the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties agree the subcontract between Rosmel and National Concrete required Rosmel to obtain commercial general liability insurance coverage and include National Concrete as an additional insured on a primary basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 5). The parties also agree that National Concrete's policies with Plaintiff provide that Plaintiff's policies are excess over any other insurance that is valid and collectible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"158906\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/512/1017/#p1023\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The parties do not dispute that (or at least do not brief whether) the allegation in the Underlying Action that National Concrete's (and by extension, Rosmel's) defective work caused damage to the Project, is an \"occurrence\" of \"property damage\" under Defendant's policies to Rosmel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply 2, 5). The parties therefore do not dispute that Defendant owes National Concrete a duty to a primary and non-contributory defense as an additional insured,\n   <em>\n    barring the application of any exclusions in Defendant's policies to Rosmel.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   These agreements lead to the single issue on which the parties depart: whether any exclusions in Defendant's policies to\n   Rosmel apply. If an exclusion applies, Defendant does not owe National Concrete a duty to defend in the Underlying Action. If an exclusion does not apply, Defendant owes National Concrete a duty to defend it as its additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because the Court concludes the completed-operations hazard exclusion in Defendant's policies bars additional-insured coverage for the Association's claims against National Concrete in the Underlying Action, the Court does not venture into the application of any other exclusion. The principles compelling this conclusion are explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties' Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is straightforward. Plaintiff asserts the Fifth Amended Complaint in the Underlying Action does not specifically allege whether the property damage occurred during Rosmel's ongoing operations or during the products-completed operations hazard - after Rosmel's work was completed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 11-12). Because the property damage\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have occurred during Rosmel's ongoing operations, Plaintiff asserts Defendant owes National Concrete a duty to defend as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"158906\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/512/1017/#p1023\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant states the argument is \"misplaced,\" as it \"wholly misses the temporal distinction between ongoing and completed operations hazard coverage.\" (Def.'s Mot. 6). According to Defendant, the completed operations hazard exclusion bars coverage to an additional insured \"for damage that occurs\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the named insured has left the job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original) ). Defendant points out (1) the 2010 Project was completed by 2012 and (2) the Association alleges in the Underlying Action that following completion of the Project, the Association learned of and noticed various leaks, spalling, and rust stains. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   6-7). It was not until 2015, three years after the 2010 Project was completed and put to its intended use, that the Association filed the Underlying Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   7). To Defendant, these circumstances \"clearly make[ ] the claim at issue a completed operations hazard and therefore preclude[ ] National Concrete from qualifying as an additional insured under the policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff nevertheless insists that \"whether the damages were discovered and the Complaints were filed after the work was completed has no bearing on when the property damage caused by Rosmel's allegedly defective work began.\" (Pl.'s Reply 5). Plaintiff explains Defendant's duty to defend, under Florida law, is triggered not when property damage is manifested or discovered, but rather when property damage actually takes place. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   5-12 (citing cases) ). Consistent with the injury-in-fact trigger, Plaintiff argues because the property damage \"may have begun during Rosmel's ongoing operations for National Concrete, ... trigger[ing] coverage to National Concrete as an additional insured,\" the completed-operations hazard exclusion does not apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10 (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant responds in kind, assuring the Court it is \"not arguing in favor of a trigger theory in the slightest.\" (Def.'s Reply 2). Defendant is not contesting whether there was an \"occurrence\" under Defendant's policies, that is, whether damage might have \"occurred\" during the policy period. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, Defendant contends even if there was an \"occurrence\" to\n   <em>\n    trigger\n   </em>\n   threshold coverage, the plain meaning of the\n   <em>\n    completed-operations exclusion provision\n   </em>\n   precludes coverage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In making this argument, Defendant relies on the plain meaning of its policies. Because the definition of completed operations \"focuses on the state or timing of the completion of the work\" and not the \"timing\n   of damages,\" Defendant states Plaintiff's emphasis on damage trigger theories is misplaced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2). Defendant states the completed-operations hazard exclusion is unequivocally clear. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Given \"the timeframe after the work its insured performed at the job site was completed and the Project was put to its intended use,\" the products-completed operation hazard exclusion precludes Defendant's coverage to National Concrete as an additional insured.

Where a latent defect\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have caused damages during the policy period, but the damage materializes after a project is complete and the site or product is put to its intended use, the completed-operations hazard exclusion bars coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Association's operative Fifth Amended Complaint seeks damages for defects and deficiencies arising from the 2010 Project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 23). The Fifth Amended Complaint alleges that around October 2010, the Association entered into a contract with National Concrete for the repair and restoration of an elevated pool, Jacuzzi, pool decks, clubhouse decks, and the garage areas beneath the pool decks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). The Association alleges the 2010 Project was completed in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). The Association alleges\n   <em>\n    following the completion\n   </em>\n   of National Concrete's work on the Project, the Association \"learned of and/or noticed various leaks, spalling, and rust stains below the pool deck at the Project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). Because the preexisting defects allegedly did not materialize until after the Project was completed and turned over to the Association to put the site to its intended use, the completed-operations hazard exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Courts outside Florida also lend support to this conclusion. For example, the Fifth Circuit recently held the same in interpreting Mississippi law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carl E. Woodward, L.L.C. v. Acceptance Indem. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n    743 F.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2014). The court noted that \"logically, [ ] liability for construction defects arises out of a subcontractor's completed operations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n    at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration added; citing cases). But the court rejected the same theory now urged by Plaintiff because it would lead to the untenable conclusion that \"a project owner could assert a breach of contract claim against a contractor for any error made during the course of construction, notwithstanding that the contractor might correct the problem before completing the project.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Even though \"liability for construction defects [is] created during ongoing operations, [it] legally arises from completed operations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations added). In sum, \"\n   <em>\n    [e]ven accepting the ... factual finding that damage had occurred during ongoing operations\n   </em>\n   , the only 'damage' supported by allegation is the construction that was not in conformity with plans and specifications[,]\" and \"[l]iability for such damages arises out of completed operations, for which [the plaintiff] was not an additional insured under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116952\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/91/\">\n    at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations and emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The rationale behind the decision in\n   <em>\n    Carl E. Woodward, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   is sound. Were the Court to adopt Plaintiff's theory, Defendant would be perpetually required - under a purely ongoing operations policy with Rosmel - to provide coverage to additional insureds, for any latent damages arising from defective work which\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have occurred during the policy period. It would be of no moment that a subcontractor completed its work, turned it over to the contractor, and the contractor turned over the final work-product to the owner,\n   who put it to its intended use. Such a reading would effectively nullify the difference between commercial general liability policies that provide coverage for completed-operations hazards and those that do not. The Court is required to read all provisions in Defendant's policies in harmony, and give full effect to the completed-operations exclusion provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaMarche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9575234\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/371/198/#p200\">\n    371 So.2d 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (Fla. 2d DCA 1979), approved,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9561867\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/390/325/\">\n    390 So.2d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1980) (favoring an interpretive method that reads the insurance policy \"as a whole and the provisions given their express and harmonious meaning and effect\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has also reached the same conclusion in interpreting Illinois law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nautilus Ins.

Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183835\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/726/#p730\">\n    764 F.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (7th Cir. 2014). Finding that an identical completed-operations hazard exclusion provision barred coverage, the court noted the \"residents had moved their personal property in the condominium units\" and that fact \"unambiguously establishes that the intended use had begun by the time any destruction of personal property occurred because of the water leakage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183835\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/726/#p730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183835\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/726/#p730\">\n    at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   So, too, here Plaintiff does not dispute the Association's condominium complex was complete in 2012 and put to its intended use. The damages arising from Rosmel's construction defects materialized years later, when the Association learned of the faulty workmanship; those damages unambiguously fall within the completed operations hazard. Defendant therefore does not owe a duty to defend National Concrete as an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on trigger theories is misplaced.

Whether there is an \"occurrence\" under a policy is a threshold question used to determine whether damages occur during a policy period. That coverage falls within a policy period does not negate the application of an exclusionary provision. And again, Defendant does not dispute the Association's damages may have occurred during the policy periods contained in Defendant's policies to Rosmel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff essentially asks the Court to subsume trigger theories, used to define \"occurrences\" in commercial general liability policies, within the meaning of the completed-operations hazard exclusion.
