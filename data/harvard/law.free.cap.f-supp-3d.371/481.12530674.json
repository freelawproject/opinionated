While there, he purchased flares and other fireworks from Defendant Dr. Atomic's Depot (\"\n   <em>\n    Dr. Atomic's\n   </em>\n   \"), a vendor that had rented a booth from World Class to sell its products at the Gun Show. When Mr. Schmarr set off one of the flares nearly four months later during a Fourth of July celebration, the flare exploded in his hand. Mr. Schmarr lost his thumb, middle finger, and ring finger knuckle on his right hand, and his left hand was injured as well. Mr. Schmarr initiated this litigation against World Class, Dr. Atomic's, and Phil Bisenius, the sole proprietor of Dr. Atomic's, alleging negligence claims against each. World Class has filed a Motion to Dismiss, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26\n   </em>\n   ], which is now ripe for the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a claim that does not state a right to relief.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] World Class also solicited the patronage of the general public for the sale of items and benefitted from that patronage. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] As part of its operations, World Class accepted payments from vendors to sell their products to patrons at the Gun Show. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] World Class required vendors to submit payment and a form, and provided vendors with the Indy 1500 Gun &amp; Knife Show Exhibitor Rules and Regulations (the \"\n   <em>\n    Rules and Regulations\n   </em>\n   \").

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 1\n   </em>\n   .] Prior to the Gun Show, Mr. Bisenius submitted a form entitled \"INDY 1500\" which lists the \"Name of Company\" as \"Sgt. Savages Book Bunker,\" and stated that Mr. Bisenius intended to exhibit \"pyrotechnic supplies,\" among other things.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] Dr. Atomic's warranted the items as being safe and usable and did so in order to induce Mr. Schmarr to purchase the flares and other fireworks.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] Upon lighting the flare, it immediately exploded in Mr. Schmarr's right hand causing his right thumb, right middle finger, and right ring finger knuckle to be blown off his hand. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Schmarr also suffered severe and permanent damage to his left hand.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 19\n   </em>\n   .] World Class has moved to dismiss Mr. Schmarr's negligence\n   claim against it, and that motion is discussed below.

Ultimately, Mr. Schmarr's negligence claim rises or falls based on whether World Class owed a duty to him. Accordingly, the Court discusses World Class's last argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   World Class argues that Mr. Schmarr has not alleged that World Class assumed any duty relating to Mr. Bisenius' products. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 27 at 9-10\n   </em>\n   .] World Class notes that Mr. Schmarr alleges in connection with his claim against World Class that Mr. Bisenius owed a duty of reasonable care to him, and that Mr. Bisenius warranted the flares as being safe and usable and did so in order to induce Mr. Schmarr to purchase the flares. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 27 at 10\n   </em>\n   .] World Class also argues that the INDY 1500 Form indicates that it took no responsibility for Mr. Bisenius's products. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 27 at 10\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, Mr. Schmarr argues that he \"has pled two separate breaches of duty between [World Class] and Mr. Bisenius,\" and that \"[t]here is nothing preventing [him] from alleging that both breaches concurrently caused the damages to [him].\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 33 at 7\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Schmarr also asserts that the INDY 1500 Form is a private agreement between World Class and Mr. Bisenius, and \"is not a waiver of [Mr. Schmarr's] rights or an acknowledgement by him that [World Class] was not responsible for the goods sold by Mr. Bisenius.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 33 at 7\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its reply, World Class reiterates its arguments and contends that it is Mr. Schmarr's burden to show that World Class owed a duty to Mr. Schmarr regarding the safety of the flares. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38 at 6-7\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court notes at the outset that the parties' briefing on the duty issue is lacking. Specifically, neither side provides any meaningful discussion of whether World Class owed a duty to Mr. Schmarr in the first instance under the circumstances presented here. As discussed below, the Court finds that, based on Mr. Schmarr's allegations, it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sitting in diversity, as this Court does, the Court's duty \"is to decide issues of Indiana state law\" by predicting how \"the Indiana Supreme Court would decide them today.\"\n   <em>\n    Doermer v.

Reasonable Foreseeability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the Court again turns to the landlord/invitee of tenant analogy when considering whether World Class could have reasonably foreseen the harm to Mr. Schmarr. \"[F]or purposes of determining whether an act is foreseeable in the context of duty we assess 'whether there is some probability or likelihood of harm that is serious enough to induce a reasonable person to take precautions to avoid it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137688\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/62/384/#p394\">\n    62 N.E.3d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v. Breeding Insulation Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202882\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/347/#p367\">\n    266 S.W.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367 (Tenn. 2008) ). In the landlord/invitee of tenant context, the element of control also factors into the foreseeability analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider v. Paragon Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6781410\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/55/374/#p378\">\n    55 N.E.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (Ind. Ct. App. 2016) (\"In premises liability cases, whether a duty is owed depends primarily upon whether the defendant was in control of the premises when the accident occurred.... The rationale is to subject to liability the person who could have known of any dangers on the land and therefore could have acted to prevent any foreseeable harm\"). While World Class arguably had notice that Mr. Bisenius would be selling pyrotechnics at the Gun Show from the information noted on the Indy 1500 Form, none of Mr. Schmarr's allegations indicate that it had notice of the allegedly defective or unsafe nature of the flares, or a level of control over the Dr. Atomic's booth such that it should have known of the danger. Perhaps for this reason, World Class specifically disclaimed any responsibility for \"goods brought into the building.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26-1\n   </em>\n   .] Given World Class's lack of control over Mr. Bisenius and Dr. Atomic's, it is difficult to see how World Class could have foreseen that Dr. Atomic's would sell allegedly unsafe flares to Mr. Schmarr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    3. Public Policy Concerns\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court considers the public policy concerns with finding the existence of a duty versus the absence of one. Trade shows and expos serve an important economic purpose. They bring together numerous vendors in one spot for customers. Additionally, they stimulate the economy for the cities that host them. And customers who purchase unsafe or defective products at trade shows have recourse: they can pursue IPLA remedies against the manufacturers and sellers of those products. The Court finds that public policy concerns weigh against imposing a duty on the operator of a trade show to ensure that goods sold by vendors are safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Weighing the\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court concludes that the Indiana Supreme Court would not impose a duty upon World Class to ensure that explosives and fireworks were not sold at the Gun Show, to ensure that products sold by Dr. Atomic's at the Gun Show were safe, to ensure that vendors would not induce customers to purchase unsafe products, or to place and enforce reasonable restrictions on the goods and items sold at the Gun Show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assumption of Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Additionally, to the extent that Mr. Schmarr bases his negligence claim against Word Class on a duty owed by Mr. Bisenius and Dr. Atomic's but assumed by World Class, such a claim would also fail as a matter of law. A duty of care can arise \"where one party assumes such a duty, either gratuitously or voluntarily,\" and \"[t]he assumption of such a duty creates a special relationship between the parties and a corresponding duty to act in the manner of a reasonably prudent person.\"\n   <em>\n    Yost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328953\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/3/509/#p515\">\n    3 N.E.3d at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation and citation omitted). Assuming a duty \"requires affirmative, deliberate conduct such that it is 'apparent that the actor ... specifically [undertook] to perform the task that [it] is charged with having performed negligently....' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328953\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/3/509/#p515\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lather v.

App. 1988) ). The Court rejects the notion that the Rules and Regulations indicate that World Class assumed a duty merely because they provided that \"[n]o explosives, bombs, incendiary devices, or related items will be allowed.\" [Filing No. 19-2.] Additionally, the Indy 1500 Form if anything indicates that World Class did not assume any duty related to the products sold by Mr. Bisenius or Dr. Atomic's. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26-1\n   </em>\n   (Indy 1500 Form stating that World Class \"assumes no responsibility of (sic) goods brought into the building\").] Mr. Schmarr has not set forth any further allegations indicating that World Class assumed any duties owed by Mr. Bisenius or World Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   World Class did not owe a duty to Mr. Schmarr, nor did it assume such a duty, to ensure that explosives and fireworks were not sold at the Gun Show, to ensure that products sold by Dr. Atomic's at the Gun Show were safe, to ensure that vendors would not induce customers to purchase unsafe products, or to place and enforce reasonable restrictions on the goods and items sold at the Gun Show. Accordingly, Mr. Schmarr's negligence claim against World Class fails as a matter of law and World Class's Motion to Dismiss, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26\n   </em>\n   ], is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   World Class's Motion to Dismiss, [26], and dismisses Mr. Schmarr's claim against World Class\n   <strong>\n    WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   No partial final judgment shall issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Schmarr's claims against Dr. Atomic's and its sole proprietor, Mr. Bisenius, will proceed. The Court notes that Dr. Atomic's and Mr. Bisenius, who are proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , failed to appear at an October 23, 2018 initial pretrial conference. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 30\n   </em>\n   (Magistrate Judge ordering Mr. Bisenius and Dr. Atomic's to show cause within 14 days why sanctions should not issue for their failure to appear at the initial pretrial conference; to date, they have not responded to that order to show cause).] Further, neither Mr. Bisenius nor Dr. Atomic's have answered or otherwise pled to the Third Amended Complaint. The Court requests that the Magistrate Judge set a status conference to discuss the resolution of Mr. Schmarr's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Mr. Schmarr initiated this litigation in state court, and World Class removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.

Savages Book Bunker\" as Mr. Bisenius' company, and does not reference Dr. Atomic's, Mr. Schmarr does not dispute in his response to the Motion to Dismiss that this is the form he refers to in his Third Amended Complaint. The Court may consider the INDY 1500 Form, even though it is not attached to the Third Amended Complaint, because Mr. Schmarr refers to the form in his allegations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williamson v. Curran\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869475\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/432/#p436\">\n     714 F.3d 432\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 436 (7th Cir. 2013) (Court may consider \"documents that are attached to the complaint, [and] documents that are central to the complaint and referred to in it\"). In any event, as discussed below, the INDY 1500 form is not dispositive of Mr. Schmarr's claim against World Class.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    This analogy is not perfect, as landlord/invitee of tenant cases generally involve injuries from unsafe conditions on the premises, such as an icy sidewalk. Even closer to the situation here is the potential liability of a mall owner for the safety of products sold by its tenants. However, there is a dearth of case law involving that scenario as well, likely because the idea of imposing liability under those circumstances lacks facial or legal merit. Given available case law, the Court finds the landlord/invitee of tenant cases most instructive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court need not consider World Class's other arguments in favor of dismissal, including that the Third Amended Complaint contains insufficient and conclusory statements and boilerplate language, that World Class cannot be liable under IPLA, and that Mr. Schmarr's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Court is dismissing Mr. Schmarr's claim against World Class with prejudice. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B), a plaintiff may amend his complaint once as a matter of course in response to a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Brown v. Bowman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201296274\">\n     2011 WL 1296274\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *16 (N.D. Ind. 2011). The 2009 notes to that rule emphasize that this amendment \"will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion. A responsive amendment may avoid the need to decide the motion or reduce the number of issues to be decided, and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised seriatum.\" Mr. Schmarr did just that, filing the Third Amended Complaint in response to an earlier Motion to Dismiss filed by World Class. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 7\n    </em>\n    (World Class's first Motion to Dismiss) and\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 15\n    </em>\n    (Mr. Schmarr's Motion to Leave to File Amended Complaint, which notes that the motion was prompted by World Class's Motion to Dismiss).] The Court is not required to give Mr. Schmarr yet another chance to plead his claim against World Class because he has already had an opportunity to cure deficiencies in his pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Emery v. American General Finance, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11591569\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/1321/#p1323\">\n     134 F.3d 1321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1323 (7th Cir. 1998). Further, given the Court's finding that World Class did not owe a duty to Mr. Schmarr, he would not be able to amend his complaint to allege viable claims against World Class even if given the opportunity to do so - particularly in light of his concession that the IPLA does not apply to any claims he may have against World Class. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 33 at 4\n    </em>\n    (Mr. Schmarr agreeing with World Class's position that his claim against World Class \"does not fall under the IPLA\").] Consequently, the Court, in its discretion, dismisses Mr. Schmarr's claim against World Class with prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
