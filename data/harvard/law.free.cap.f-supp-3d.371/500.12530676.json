Griesbach, Chief Judge\n   This case represents another episode in the ongoing dispute between the Oneida Nation and the Village of Hobart over land use regulation and control. The Oneida Nation filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the legal authority of the Village to enforce its Special Events Permit Ordinance, Chapter 250 of the Village Code, against the Nation, its officers, and its employees within the Village, which lies entirely within the 1838 boundaries of the Oneida Reservation. The action arises out of the Village's effort to enforce the Ordinance by requiring the Nation to obtain a permit for its annual Big Apple Fest. The Nation argues that as a federally recognized Indian tribe, it is immune from state and local regulations within its reservation and not subject to the Ordinance. The Village, on the other hand, challenges the Nation's claim that the boundaries of the original Oneida Reservation remain intact and contends that it is entitled to enforce the Ordinance to the extent necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its residents and the public. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1362.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Presently before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The Nation moves for summary judgment, claiming that its reservation was created by its Treaty of February 3, 1838, with the United States and that the original Reservation boundaries remain intact. It thus follows, the Nation contends, that the Nation and its officials and employees are not subject to the Ordinance as a matter of law and the Village should be enjoined from attempting to enforce it against them. The Village filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in which it argues that the 1838 Treaty under which the Oneida received their land did not create a reservation. Even if the Treaty did create a reservation, the Village argues that a 1933 decision by this court held that the Oneida Reservation was disestablished and that the Nation is collaterally estopped from relitigating its status. Alternatively, the Village argues that, even aside from the 1933 decision, this court should find that the Oneida Reservation has been disestablished or, at a minimum, diminished. The United States filed a brief in support of the Nation as amicus curiae. The motions have been fully briefed and argued by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having fully considered the arguments set forth, I conclude that the Treaty of 1838 created a reservation that has not been disestablished. But the Nation's reservation has been diminished such that the Village may enforce the Ordinance on those lands not held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Nation. In addition, I conclude that the Nation's sovereign immunity forecloses the Village's counterclaim for monetary damages. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth below, the Nation's motion will be only partially granted as to the Village's counterclaim for damages. The Village's motion for summary judgment dismissing the Nation's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief will be granted. Summary judgment on the Village's counterclaim for declaratory relief that the Ordinance may be enforced as to covered activities on fee land owned by the Nation, as well as activities on public roadways, rights-of-way, and neighboring properties is also granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Historical Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Oneida Tribe of Indians was one of six Iroquois Nations living in the area that later became the State of New York. In the years following the Revolutionary War, encroachment by the new Americans on their ancestral lands, as well as other factors, gave rise to a plan for the Oneida to move west to the Wisconsin Territory. On February 8, 1831, the United States entered into a treaty with the Menominee Tribe, which was already located in the Wisconsin Territory, under which the Menominee agreed to cede a tract of land to be set apart as a home to the several tribes of the New York Indians, including the Oneida. The tract of land was to be apportioned among the New York tribes \"so as not to assign any tribe a greater number of acres than may be equal to one hundred for each soul actually settled upon the lands.\" PSUMF \u00b6 3 (quoting Treaty with the Menominee, 1931, signed Feb. 8, 1831,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Stat.%20342\">\n    7 Stat. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ECF No. 92-10 at 4).

On October 27, 1832, the United States entered into a third treaty with the Menominee to amend the February 8, 1831 Treaty to alter the boundaries of the tract ceded to the United States for the benefit of the New York tribes. The October 27, 1832 treaty provided that the terms of the February 8, 1831 Treaty, as amended, were otherwise confirmed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Then, on February 3, 1838, the Oneida entered into a treaty with the United States in which it ceded to the United States their title and interest in the 1831 Menominee cession in return for reserving \"to the said Indians to be held as other Indian lands are held a tract of land containing one hundred (100) acres, for each individual, and the lines of which shall be so run as to include all their settlements and improvements in the vicinity of Green Bay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 (quoting Treaty with the Oneida, 1838, signed Feb. 3, 1838,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Stat.%20566\">\n    7 Stat. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Arts. 1 and 2, ECF No. 92-13 at 3).

The allotted lands were to be held in trust by the United States for a period of at least 25 years, after which Indian allottees were to receive fee patents, which removed all restraints on alienation and allowed transfer of the land to non-Indians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20348\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The 1838 Treaty and the Creation of a Reservation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court begins with the parties' dispute regarding the origin and creation of the Oneida Reservation. In 1831, the United States entered into a treaty with the Menominee Tribe to acquire a 500,000-acre tract of land to be set apart as a home to several New York tribes, including the Oneida Tribe of Indians. This tract of land was to be apportioned among the emigrating New York tribes \"so as not to assign any tribe a greater number of acres than may be equal to one hundred for each soul actually settled upon the lands.\" ECF No. 92-10 at 4. The treaty indicated further that the ceded lands were to be held by the New York Indian tribes \"under such\n   tenure as the Menomonee [sic] Indians now hold their lands, subject to such regulations and alteration of tenure as Congress and the President of the United States shall, from time to time, think proper to adopt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the treaty was amended twice to extend the three-year deadline by which the New York tribes were to relocate to the ceded lands and to alter the boundaries of the ceded tract of land, the original terms of the 1831 treaty were otherwise confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The United States entered into a treaty with the Oneida on February 3, 1838. The Oneida ceded to the United States its interest in the 1831 Menominee land set apart for them in return for reserving \"to the said Indians to be held as other Indian lands are held a tract of land containing one hundred (100) acres, for each individual.\" ECF No. 92-13 at 3. The land was subsequently surveyed by the United States. The survey, labeled \"Oneida Reservation,\" consisted of 65,400 acres of land. The Nation asserts that this treaty created a reservation held in common by the Tribe. The Village maintains that the Treaty provides for the reservation of individual 100-acre tracts for each member, rather than one reservation held in common by the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In determining whether a reservation has been created, courts \"ask whether the area has been validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231060\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/505/#p511\">\n    498 U.S. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231060\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/505/#p511\">\n    111 S.Ct. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231060\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/505/#p511\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (citation omitted). When a party asserts that a treaty created a reservation, the \"treaty is to be construed as the Indians would have understood it, as disclosed by the practices and customs of the Indians at the time the treaty was negotiated, and by the history of the treaty, the negotiations that preceded it, and the practical construction given the treaty by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Treaty of 1838 provides that \"there shall be reserved to the said Indians to be held as other Indian lands are held a tract of land containing one hundred (100) acres, for each individual.\" ECF No. 92-13 at 3. The Village argues that the reference in the Treaty of 1838 to \"a tract of land containing one hundred (100) acres for each individual\" means that the Treaty allotted land to individual members of the tribe rather than creating a reservation held in common. Yet, a reading of the Treaty in its entirety and consideration of the surrounding circumstances indicates that the language simply conveys how the United States would calculate the amount of land that would be apportioned to the Oneida Tribe from the 500,000 acres of ceded Menominee land set apart for the New York tribes. Indeed, the 1831 Menominee Treaty stated that the ceded land was to be apportioned among the tribes \"so as not to assign any tribe a greater number of acres than may be equal to one hundred for each soul actually settled upon the lands\" and that those tracts would be held \"as the Menomonee [sic] Indians hold their lands,\" which the 1831 Menominee treaty described\n   as a \"reservation.\" ECF No. 92-10 at 4. Although it is true that certain individual members of the Oneida Tribe sought to trade their participation in the Oneida Reservation in favor of more land elsewhere, the principal tribal leaders intended to establish a permanent home for the Tribe in Wisconsin and ultimately entered into a treaty with the United States to do so. The United States' December 1838 survey labels a single tract of land, totaling 65,400 acres, as the Oneida Reservation. Both the United States and the Tribe agreed that the survey satisfactorily reflected the parties' understanding of the Treaty. In short, the language of the 1838 Treaty, the history of the Treaty, the negotiations that preceded it, and the practical construction given the Treaty by the parties compel the conclusion that the lands were ceded to the Oneida Tribe as a reservation and not as individual allotments to its members. For these reasons, the court holds that the Treaty of 1838 created the Oneida Reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Current Boundaries of the Reservation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Issue Preclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Village contends that, even if the Treaty of 1838 created a reservation, Congress disestablished, or at the very least, diminished, the Oneida Reservation by legislative act. In support of its disestablishment argument, the Village argues at the outset that the Nation is collaterally estopped from relitigating the status of the Oneida Reservation by virtue of the 1933 decision of this court which held that the Reservation was discontinued and ceased to exist.\n   <em>\n    See Stevens v. County of Brown\n   </em>\n   (E.D. Wis. Nov. 3, 1933) (unpublished decision), ECF No. 89-45. The court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , the Village contends, has preclusive effect in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prevents the relitigation of issues resolved in an earlier lawsuit. \"Issue preclusion ... bars successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment, even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The doctrine \"has the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co. v.

The prerequisites for applying the doctrine are satisfied when \"(1) the issue sought to be precluded is the same as an issue in the prior litigation; (2) the issue must have been actually litigated in the prior litigation; (3) the determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment; and (4) the party against whom estoppel is invoked must have been fully represented in the prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. City of Indianapolis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071379\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/720/#p736\">\n    742 F.3d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (7th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Nation maintains that it is not bound by the decision in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   because the Village has not satisfied the elements of issue preclusion. More specifically, the Nation asserts that it was not a party to the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   case and that there is no identity of issues between the issue in this case and the issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff class consisting of Oneida tribal members and representatives brought an action against the counties of Brown and Outagamie as well as the townships of Hobart and Oneida to recover local property taxes that had been levied and assessed on their lands as well as the lands of other Oneida tribal members. The\n   plaintiffs also sought an injunction against any further assessment, levy, or collection of property taxes. The defendants moved to dismiss the case on four grounds: (1) the plaintiffs did not pursue the remedy outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2074.73\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 74.73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) more than twenty years had elapsed since the creation of the towns without questioning their creation by a writ of certiorari or other appropriate proceeding as prescribed in the state statute; (3) the Oneida Reservation was lawfully discontinued; and (4) the doctrine of laches barred the plaintiffs from questioning the legality of the organization of the towns and their assumption of authority over the Oneida Reservation. ECF No. 89-45 at 3. The court concluded that, because the reservation had been discontinued through the implementation of the Dawes Act, the plaintiffs were bound by the state statute governing the procedure to recover taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Village asserts that, even though the Tribe was not a named party in the litigation, the complaint in that action indicates that the plaintiffs were duly authorized and empowered to act for and on behalf of the Oneida Tribe. But the fact that the lawsuit was brought by members of the Tribe, rather than the Tribe itself, suggests that the Tribe was not fully represented in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   and did not itself participate in the proceedings. Indeed, there is no evidence that the Tribe exercised a sufficient degree of control in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER &amp; EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE \u00a7 4451 (2017) (\"Lesser measures of participation without control do not suffice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition, issue preclusion does not apply here because this case raises different factual and legal questions than those raised in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   . \"Identity of the issue is established by showing that the same general legal rules govern both cases and that the facts of both cases are indistinguishable as measured by those rules.\" WRIGHT &amp; MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE \u00a7 4425. Again, the question raised in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   was whether individual members of the Tribe were required to pay local property taxes upon the issuance of fee patents for their allotments. The underlying issue in this case is whether the Nation is subject to the regulations of a local municipality in the conduct of its special events. Although similar issues regarding the reservation's status were raised in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , that action was not a comprehensive adjudication of the true status of the reservation. In addition, the issue of whether the Nation itself is immune from local regulatory authority was not litigated in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   to any extent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein v. Bankert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715669\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/190/\">\n    733 F.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2013) (holding issue preclusion did not apply because the issues involved facts that were not \"identical in all material aspects\"). Because this case presents different facts and legal foundation, issue preclusion does not apply. The court will therefore turn to the Village's alternative argument that, even apart from the 1933 decision in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , the Oneida Reservation was disestablished or diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

There was no surplus land act passed in connection with the Oneida Reservation because it was not contemplated that there would be surplus land remaining after the land within the Reservation was allotted to individual tribal members and fee patents finally issued. It would make no sense for an allotment act to contain the type of cession language that is found in surplus land acts or terms like \"surrender, grant, or convey.\" Those terms have no place in the context of allotment. In the process of allotment, the tribes were not conveying surplus lands to the United States; instead, the United States was conveying its interest in the lands it had held in trust for the benefit of the tribes to the individual tribal members and terminating the restrictions that had previously applied to it. For the same reason, allotment acts would not contain language indicating that the Indian tribes would be compensated for the allotted lands. The land was not being conveyed to outsiders by the tribe, but instead divided among the tribal members free of all federal restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Notwithstanding the absence of such language, the intent of the allotment policy in general and the Dawes Act in particular is unmistakable. It was \"to hasten the demise of the reservation system and to encourage Indian assimilation into the white system of private property ownership.\"\n   <em>\n    Podhradsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343683,3680300\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/994/\">\n    606 F.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, \"[w]ithin a generation or two, it was thought, the tribes would dissolve, their reservations would disappear, and individual Indians would be absorbed into the larger community of white settlers.\"\n   <em>\n    Yankton Sioux Tribe\n   </em>\n   , 522 U.S. at 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7345702\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/789/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even though complete assimilation of the Indians and the elimination of the reservation system was the ultimate intent of the Dawes Act and related legislation, those acts did not themselves abolish the reservations. In fact, they assumed the reservations would continue at least until the trust patents were replaced with fee patents giving individual tribal members complete control over their own land. Before that process was complete, however, Congress changed its mind as reflected in the IRA of 1934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The purpose of the IRA was to stop the loss of Indian lands through the allotment process and re-establish tribal governments and land holdings. COHEN , \u00a7 1.05, at 81-82. As noted above, among other steps taken to achieve these goals, the IRA terminated the further allotment of reservation lands, extended unexpired trust periods on allotted lands, and empowered the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands to be placed into trust status and thus exempt from state and local taxation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20463\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465. The IRA also \"permitted tribes to organize and adopt constitutions with a congressional sanction of self-government, and it permitted tribes to form business committees or business corporations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20476\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Within two years of the passage of the IRA, the Oneida Tribe adopted its Constitution and By-Laws, and the Oneida tribal government was formed. Since that time the Oneida Tribe, now known as the Oneida Nation, has remained in existence with a functioning tribal government. Although the precise number of acres may be in question, it is undisputed that at least some amount of land remained under tribal ownership or otherwise in trust status at the time the IRA was enacted, putting a complete stop to the further alienation of tribal lands. DSUMF \u00b6 98. It thus follows that the Oneida Reservation has not been disestablished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But while it has not been disestablished, the size of the Reservation has been significantly diminished as a result of the issuance of fee patents to tribal members who then conveyed their interests to non-tribal members. This is because Congress's intent to diminish, if not disestablish, the Reservation, which was explicit in the Dawes Act, the Burke Act, and the Act of 1906, became effectuated with the issuance of fee patents to tribal members and the subsequent sale of the land to non-Indians. The intent to diminish was born out by Congress singling out the Oneida Reservation, in particular, and allowing the Secretary to quickly issue fee patents at his discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Nation argues that the Dawes Act and the Burke Act have never been construed to alter reservation boundaries. Indeed, the mere act of dividing the Reservation into individual allotments for each member, by itself, is insufficient to divest the land of its reservation status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Notwithstanding the absence of \"the hallmark language\" suggesting that Congress intended to disestablish or diminish the reservation in the 1906 Act, the court concluded that the circumstances surrounding it and the manner in which the reservation was treated in the aftermath of the Act made clear Congress's intent to extinguish the reservation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-68\">\n   The intent to extinguish what remained of the reservation is born out by the act's provision for allotments in fee simple.

The dispute there initially arose out of an effort by the Yankton Sioux Tribe to regulate a landfill within the boundaries of its original reservation, over which the State of South Dakota claimed jurisdiction.

Under the Dawes Act, about 167,325 acres of the reservation were allotted and patented, and then an additional 95,000 acres were allotted after the passage of an Act of February 28, 1891. The allotments, which totaled approximately 262,300 acres, were not contiguous parcels and were interspersed with approximately 168,000 acres of unallotted surplus land.

The Tribe and the federal government claimed that, because the site was located within the reservation's original 1858 boundaries, it remained part of the reservation and was therefore subject to federal environmental regulations.

That fee lands lawfully sold to non-Indians were no longer part of the reservation was virtually unquestioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I find this line of cases instructive for the issues before me here. Just as the Eighth Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Gaffey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Podhradsky\n   </em>\n   that fee lands conveyed to non-Indians were no longer part of the Yankton Sioux Reservation, so also I conclude that the fee lands within the original boundaries of the Oneida Reservation that\n   were sold to non-Indians, unless reacquired and placed into trust by the federal government, are no longer a part of that Reservation. The loss of that land has necessarily resulted in the diminishment of the Reservation from its original boundaries. Nothing in the text of the Dawes Act or the Act of 1906 suggest that Congress anticipated that the Nation would exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians who purchased land after it lost its trust status. Congress knew based on the Burke Act, which was enacted less than one month before the Act of 1906, that allottees who were issued fee patents would become subject to the civil and criminal laws of the State or territory in which they resided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]t the expiration of the trust period and when the lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee ... then each and every allottee shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or Territory in which they may reside.\"). It thus follows that as more non-Indian settlers purchased lands held in fee from Oneida members, increased involvement by the state on the settlers' behalf was expected, thereby increasing the State's jurisdiction over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montana v.

By distributing reservation land through allotment and taking a definitive and considered step in allowing the Secretary to expedite the issuance of fee patents to Oneida members, Congress understood that the Nation would be divested of its authority once the allotment process was complete. In short, a reading of the Dawes Act and the Act of 1906 and an examination of the historical context in which they were enacted establish that Congress intended to diminish the Oneida Reservation by the land which it foresaw would become fee simple patents and would subsequently pass out of Indian ownership into the hands of white settlers.

The parties have presented volumes of material evidencing the subsequent treatment of the land after the passage of the Act of 1906.

For instance, the Village, on the one hand, asserts that certain federal officials in the Office of Indian Affairs as well as superintendents of the Keshena Agency repeatedly referred\n   to the area as a former reservation and note that the Oneida lost almost all of their land. The Nation, on the other, asserts that these views did not represent a consensus among federal officials on the status of the Oneida Reservation and that the remaining documents are ambiguous on disestablishment. References to the \"former reservation,\" for example, could simply mean the \"original reservation,\" as opposed to the substantially diminished reservation that resulted from the sale of their allotments by tribal members and that continued to exist up until the passage of the IRA. Such language could also reflect the common assumption during the allotment era that reservations were in the process of becoming extinct. But as noted above, before that process was complete, Congress enacted the IRA and ended it. The Village's evidence of the aftermath of the 1906 Act does not overcome this undisputed fact, especially considering that subsequent treatment is the \"least compelling evidence\" in the court's diminishment analysis.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594897,12594898\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1072/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The subsequent treatment of the land in question does support the conclusion that the Oneida reservation was diminished, however. The numerous statements of federal officials referring to the \"former reservation,\" even if ambiguous as to disestablishment, at least manifest the view that the original boundaries were no longer intact. Just as in\n    <em>\n     Stockbridge-Munsee\n    </em>\n    , \"the land became subject to state taxes, and the Department of the Interior refused to intervene in alcohol-related problems within the original reservation.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684130\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/657/\">\n     554 F.3d at 665\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In 1903, the Wisconsin legislature enacted legislation to create the towns of Hobart and Oneida \"from the territory now embraced within the Oneida Reservation in said counties\" and conferred upon them \"all the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon and granted to other towns in the state of Wisconsin.\" DSUMF \u00b6 37. Soon thereafter, each town formed its own government. This court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Stevens\n    </em>\n    , though not entitled to preclusive effect, also constitutes evidence of the manner in which the Reservation was viewed by federal officials prior to the enactment of the IRA and demonstrates that once fee patents were granted, local property taxes were assessed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Other state and federal officials also viewed the Oneida Reservation as at least diminished. In 1919, the Office of Indian Affairs, the predecessor to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, closed the Oneida Agency and transferred jurisdiction over the Oneida to the Keshena Agency, located on the Menominee Reservation.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53. In 1931, the Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin wrote a letter addressing jurisdiction with respect to the Oneida in which he stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    There is very little tribal land left, and most of the individual allotments have passed from the control of the United States and are therefore subject to the unquestioned jurisdiction of the state. However, in the case of the small amount of tribal land remaining and the individual allotments which are still held in trust, the federal courts would have jurisdiction .... Most of the Oneidas have received a fee patent discharged of any trust. Many of them have sold their lands. The state has jurisdiction over those Indians that have a fee patent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 76. On November 19, 1931, C.J. Rhoads, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, wrote to a member of the Tribe concerning hunting and fishing rights:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    Generally speaking, the State game laws apply to the Indians except when exercising their hunting and fishing privileges on tribal Indian land within their reservation or, if allotted, within the limits\n    of their own allotments still held in trust or under restricted patents.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    There are only a few small tracts of tribal Indian land within the limits of what was formerly the Oneida Indian Reservation. The ceded land to which the Indian title has been extinguished no longer belongs to the Indians, and as you have received a fee patent to your ... land and the Oneida Indian Reservation has been broken up, you would have no special hunting or fishing privileges thereon because of the fact that you are an Indian. Under the circumstances you should comply with the state laws and regulations as to season, license, etc.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 78.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    This and other similar evidence cited by the Village supports the conclusion that in the aftermath of the 1906 Act and up until the enactment of the IRA, the Oneida Reservation was substantially diminished, though not completely disestablished. In 1975, the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a report entitled \"Statistical Data for Planning Oneida Reservation,\" which stated that \"the total acreage of this reservation is 2,581 acres-2,108 acres are tribally owned and 473 acres are allotted.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 123.

The Oneidas long ago relinquished the reins of government and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.\"). As of December 28, 2017, however, 14,078.612 acres of the original Reservation are held in trust on behalf of the Nation. Def.'s Statement of Additional Proposed Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 12, ECF No. 100. The record is silent, however, as to how much of the total acreage held in trust is within the Village, but this acreage reflects the current size and location of the Oneida Reservation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Enforcement of the Ordinance\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    It follows from the foregoing that the Village may enforce the Ordinance on those lands not held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Nation. There is no dispute that the activities associated with the Big Apple Fest take place at least in part on land that is not part of the Oneida Reservation but instead is non-trust land owned by the Nation in fee simple. It is also undisputed that in order to conduct its festival, the Nation closes off, in whole or in part, streets and highways that are also not part of the current reservation. As the Village notes, the stated purpose of the Ordinance is \"to address potential impacts on the general public of a special event, including without limitation noise, light, dust, traffic, parking, and other\n    public health safety and welfare concerns,\" as well as \"to promote the economic welfare and general prosperity of the community by safeguarding and preserving property values by addressing potential impacts of a special event.\" Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 94, at 48 (citing ECF No. 86-1, \u00a7 250-2). These are lawful purposes under the Village's police power,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2061.34\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 61.34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017-18), and the Nation does not contend that they are not. Nor does the Nation contend that compliance would create a hardship or that the Village would unreasonably deny it a permit. Instead, the Nation's sole argument is that it is immune and not subject to the Ordinance because it's special event occurs within the boundaries of its 1838 Reservation boundaries, the entirety of which it claims constitutes Indian country. For the reasons set forth above, the court concludes that it does not and instead holds that only those portions of the original Reservation held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Nation, as well as any allotments still under trust patents, constitute Indian country.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In truth, the implications of the Nation's argument are quite breathtaking. If accepted, then not only are the Nation and its members immune from the regulatory measures of the Village, but also those of a substantial portion of the City of Green Bay, Brown and Outagamie Counties, and the State of Wisconsin. To hold in its favor would mean that the Nation has primary jurisdiction over land largely populated by people who have no say in its governing body. Because the Oneida Reservation has been diminished, however, and does not include land held in fee, the Nation's argument fails. The Nation is therefore not entitled to the relief it seeks, and the Village's motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     D. The Nation's Sovereign Immunity\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    As a final matter, the Nation asserts that its sovereign immunity bars the Village's counterclaim for enforcement of the Ordinance against the Nation and the payment of the $ 5,000 fine issued through the citation. It is well established that Indian tribes possess immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Okla.Tax Comm'n v.

It nevertheless argues that the bar is not complete if an alternative mechanism is not available for the enforcement of its Ordinance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n     at 795\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 2024\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    But as the Court suggested, the Village in this case may have other tools that it can use to enforce its laws on its own lands, for example, bringing a suit against tribal officers responsible for unlawful conduct.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As an extreme measure, the Village could presumably act to shut down the event if the Nation again sought to hold it without a permit, but there is no reason to believe that such an extreme measure will be necessary. The Nation brought this action to vindicate its\n    sincerely held belief that it is not subject to the authority of the Village in the enforcement of the Ordinance. Should it not ultimately prevail, there is no reason to believe that the Nation will not comply with the Ordinance. In any event, the Nation is immune and the Village's counterclaim for monetary damages must be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the Treaty of 1838 created the Oneida Reservation. I also conclude that, while there is no evidence of congressional intent to disestablish the Reservation, Congress's intent to at least diminish the Reservation is manifest in the Dawes Act and the Act of 1906, and that intent was effectuated with the issuance of unrestricted fee patents for the allotted land within the Reservation. To the extent the Nation's special event was held on property not held in trust by the United States, it is subject to the Ordinance. In addition, the Village's counterclaim for monetary damages is barred and must be dismissed. The Nation's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 85) is therefore\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED-IN-PART\n    </strong>\n    and\n    <strong>\n     DENIED-IN-PART\n    </strong>\n    and the Village's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 84) is accordingly\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    . The Clerk is directed to set the matter for a telephone conference to address the need for further proceedings as well as the form of the judgment to be entered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    at Green Bay, Wisconsin this\n    <em>\n     28th\n    </em>\n    day of March, 2019.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
