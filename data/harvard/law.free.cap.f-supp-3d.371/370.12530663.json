Plaintiffs sold Medicare Advantage plans for Superior HealthPlan, Inc. and allege that they were mis-classified as independent contractors when they were in fact employees. They assert claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") for failure to pay required overtime wages. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs were independent contractors, but even if they were employees, they were exempt outside sales employees. Assuming that Plaintiffs were employees rather than independent contractors, which the Court does not decide, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were exempt under the \"outside sales employees\" exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals who worked as sales representatives for Superior HealthPlan, Inc. (\"Superior\"). Centene Corporation is a holding company with multiple subsidiaries, including Defendant Superior and non-party Centene Management Company, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Original Complaint against Defendants Superior HealthPlan, Inc. and Centene Corporation on August 31, 2016, alleging violations of the FLSA for failure to pay required overtime wages. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or, alternatively, for a more definite statement. After a hearing, the Court issued an oral order granting in part and denying in part, and Plaintiffs then filed a First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The First Amended Original Complaint alleged that Plaintiffs entered into an Employed Sales Rep and Exclusive Independent Sales Agent Agreement with Superior and that their job duties included, but were not limited to, soliciting Medicare Advantage Plans to the public on behalf of Superior and Centene. Plaintiffs alleged that Superior and Centene exercised substantial control over Plaintiffs' job duties and responsibilities. Plaintiffs further alleged that although they executed written agreements with Superior, Centene also maintained an employer relationship with them as evidenced by payroll and IRS records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that their jobs \"often required that they talk to and meet with customers during and after the regular work day\" and \"frequently worked numerous hours well in excess of forty (40) hours per week.\" Plaintiffs alleged that they were\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   employees entitled to the protections afforded by the FLSA. They further alleged that because they were misclassified as independent contractors, they were denied employee benefits such as pension, retirement, profit-sharing, and insurance. Thus, they alleged that Defendants intentionally and willfully deprived them of the opportunity to participate in\n   these benefits under ERISA. Last, Plaintiffs assert a violation of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (\"COBRA\") based on their failure to be informed of and failure to obtain COBRA benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court mostly denied the motion to dismiss, but did find that Plaintiffs needed to plead more specific facts demonstrating individual or enterprise coverage. Plaintiffs then filed a Second Amended Complaint (docket no. 37), which remains the live pleading. It asserts claims under the FLSA, ERISA, and COBRA. Defendant Superior filed counterclaims against David Silva and Eugene Martinez for money had and received based on mistaken overpayment of commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed Plaintiffs' ERISA and COBRA claims on the basis that, even assuming they were employees, they did not meet eligibility requirements. Docket no. 49. The Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' FLSA claims and Superior's counterclaims remain pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' FLSA claims. Defendant Superior asserts that all Plaintiffs were independent contractors or, in the alternative, were outside salespersons exempt from FLSA overtime coverage. Superior further asserts that there is no cause of action for FLSA record-keeping violations, and that Ruby Martinez and Sylvia Trevino's FLSA claims must be dismissed under the statute of limitations. Defendant Centene adopts Superior's arguments and additionally moves for summary judgment on the basis that it was not Plaintiffs' employer. Plaintiffs responded in opposition. Because Plaintiffs' response failed to meaningfully respond to Defendants' assertion that Plaintiffs were exempt outside salespersons, Defendants focused their reply on application of the exemption, asking the Court to rule that the exemption applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court will assume without deciding for purposes of this motion that Plaintiffs were employees rather than independent contractors, and limits its analysis to the issue of whether Plaintiffs were exempt outside salespersons. That issue requires the Court to determine whether Plaintiffs' primary duty was making sales and whether they were customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer's places of business. For purposes of the analysis, the Court will further presume that both Superior and Centene were Plaintiffs' employers, but does not decide the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs each entered into independent sales agreements with Superior on November 30, 2012. Each contract was called \"Employed Sales Rep and Exclusive Independent Sales Agent Agreement\" and was entered into between the individual Plaintiff and Superior \"for the purpose of setting forth the terms and conditions under which Sales Rep/Independent Agent shall provide certain services to Superior for the solicitation of Medicare Advantage Plans.\" Superior is authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services to offer Medicare Advantage Plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each Sales Rep/Independent Agent may solicit enrollment of Enrolling Persons in a \"defined service area\" under the Agreement, which is \"limited to the jurisdiction(s) in which Superior is licensed to operate as a Medicare Advantage Organization.\" \"Sales Rep/Independent Agent\" is defined as the signing agent who (1) is duly licensed pursuant to the jurisdiction in which such Sales Rep/Independent Agent intends to solicit Enrolling Persons, (2) is approved and appointed by Superior to solicit enrollment of Enrolling Persons under the Agreement; and (3) has executed the Independent Sales Agent Agreement with Superior to solicit enrollment of Enrolling Persons under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the Agreement, each sales agent was responsible for complying with continuing education requirements for maintaining licensure and was to pay for licenses, fees, or taxes for licensing, except Superior would pay the appointment fees for those holding a Texas Resident Agent license. Agrmt. \u00b6 2.1. The Agreement contains a section entitled \"Limitation on Authority,\" which provides that sales agents shall not, among other things, (1) bind coverage, (2) accept an applicant, (3) misrepresent or omit important facts in any application, (4) receive any money for Superior, (5) solicit in any area of the state in which Superior is not authorized to market Medicare Advantage Plans, (6) extend credit or incur any liability or obligation on behalf of Superior, (7) modify or waive any Medicare Advantage Plan provisions or any terms regarding enrollment, coverage, or benefits, (8) distribute any advertising, circular, or promotional literature without prior approval by Superior, except such materials provided to the agent by superior, or (9) represent that the agent has authority on behalf of Superior or has any authority except as explicitly provided by the agreement. Agrmt. \u00b6 2.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With regard to training, the Agreement provides that the sales agent \"shall complete Superior's initial and ongoing training to assure Sales Rep/Independent Agent's compliance with Superior's marketing and enrollment policies,\" including \"routine evaluation of Sales Rep/Independent Agent's performance under this Agreement.\" Agents \"must pass the annual compliance and plan proficiency test with a minimum score of 85%.\" Agrmt. \u00b6 2.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under a section entitled \"Solicitation,\" the Agreement provides that sales agents \"shall use best efforts to solicit enrollment of Enrolling Persons under the terms of this Agreement.\" The agents \"shall submit to a prospective Enrolling Persons proposal letters in a form and upon such terms as are approved in advance by Superior\" and no terms may be altered without prior written approval by Superior. Further, \"Sales Rep/Independent Agent shall accurately and fully record information required by Superior for the enrollment of Enrolling Persons under a Medicare Advantage Plan and shall comply with applicable policies and procedures as established by Superior from time to time.\" Agrmt \u00b6 2.4. Only Superior could accept or reject a prospective Enrolling Person submitted for enrollment by a Sales Rep/Independent Agent. Agrmt. \u00b6 2.5. The Sales Rep would deliver and explain initial administrative forms such as enrollment materials and renewal forms (approved in advance by Superior) and would ensure the Enrolling Persons sign and return\n   forms to Superior in a timely manner. Agrmt. \u00b6 2.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the term of the Agreement, \"Sales Rep/Independent Agent's business relationship with Superior shall be 'exclusive' as follows: Sales Rep/Independent Agent shall market and solicit the enrollment of Enrolling Persons, as that term is defined in this Agreement, in the Defined Service Area(s), only for Superior and not for any other insurance company, preferred provider plan, health maintenance organization, or any other entity licensed and under contract with CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to sell Medicare Advantage plans.\" Agrmt. \u00b6 2.7. Agents could obtain marketing and enrollment materials necessary for solicitation from Superior, and shall return them upon termination of the Agreement. Agrmt. \u00b6 2.8. Agents were required to maintain their own general liability, professional liability, and employee dishonesty insurance policies. Agrmt. \u00b6 4.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Agreement was to continue until terminated under \u00b6 5.2, which allowed either party to terminate upon thirty days prior written notice or upon certain conditions such as violations of the exclusivity provisions, failure to maintain insurance coverage, failure to meet performance and production standards set forth in the Appendix, and failure to maintain appropriate licensing. The Agreement states that, for tax purposes, agents are considered self-employed and Superior did not withhold taxes or social security. Agrmt. \u00b6 3.2. It further provides in the miscellaneous provisions that \"[t]he relationship between Superior and Sales Rep/Independent Agent is solely that of independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement or otherwise shall be deemed or construed to create any other relationship, including one of employment, joint venture, or agency.\" Agrmt. \u00b6 7.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sales Reps were paid pursuant to an Agent Compensation Policy attached as an Appendix to the Agreement. It provides that Sales Reps will be paid $ 1,500 bi-weekly and \"Superior shall also reimburse Sales Rep/Independent Agent an additional $ 60 per month to be applied to the premium charges for the Sales Rep/Independent Agent's errors and omissions insurance coverage that is in place and effective during the term of this agreement upon presentation to Superior of appropriate receipts indicating premium payments made.\" Commissions were paid monthly at $ 125 per CMS-approved application, with 100% chargeback for disenrollment within the first three months. Bonuses were also paid based on exceeding sales goals, which were set at 25 for San Antonio/Bexar County. There was also a 2013 compensation guarantee that compensation would be no less in total than that received in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Non-party Centene Management Company LLC issued Plaintiffs' payroll checks and Form 1099s.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket no. 81-4; docket no. 81-5. Appendix A to the Agreements also included certain Articles concerning the \"Medicare Sales Commission Plan (MSCP),\" including that the compensation plan was \"subject to approval and discretionary amounts can be added by Centene management.\" Further, \"Centene management has the authority to make plan changes and/or terminate the MSCP at any time.\" The compensation plan was effective November 1, 2012 and would automatically renew annually unless terminated or amended by management. Appendix B to the Agreement contained a \"Code of Ethics\" to which Sales Reps were expected to adhere. Appendix C was a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   An employee who brings a FLSA action for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation must demonstrate, by a\n   preponderance of the evidence, that there existed an employer-employee relationship during the periods claimed.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

By their motions, Defendants seek summary judgment on this issue, asserting that Plaintiffs were independent contractors rather than employees. However, Defendants further contend that, even if Plaintiffs were employees and otherwise established an FLSA claim, they were exempt under the FLSA's outside sales employee exemption. As noted, Defendants' reply focuses on the application of the exemption. Because the Court finds that summary judgment is warranted on the outside sales employee exemption, the Court will presume for purposes of analysis that Plaintiffs were employees of Superior and Centene, but does not decide the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An employer bears the burden of proving that an employee is ineligible for overtime or minimum-wage compensation.\n   <em>\n    Meza v.

However, the proposed Sur-Reply not contain much additional analysis of the outside sales exemption or discuss its application to the specific facts of this case beyond asserting that \"Plaintiffs' productivity and scope of work were under the control, supervision and guidance of Centene Corporation and Superior HealthPlan Inc, and as such, they were not exempt from the application of overtime and minimum wage provisions under the 'Outside Sales' exemption of the FLSA.\" Docket no. 83-1 at 2. Plaintiffs again reference their summary-judgment evidence as a whole, without providing specific deposition citations other than a single citation concerning Defendants' record-keeping.

The relevant underlying facts in this case are undisputed, and the issue may therefore be resolved on summary judgment as a matter of law. Defendants have provided sufficient evidence that Plaintiffs' primary duty was sales - selling Superior's Star+Plus plan to potential customers - and that sales appointments would most frequently happen at a prospect's home, though senior centers were also common, satisfying the requirement that they were customarily and regularly engaged away from their employer's place of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Whether Plaintiffs' primary duty was sales?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It appears undisputed that Plaintiffs' job was sales, specifically selling Medicare Advantage plans to customers.

As an initial matter, some degree of control must be presumed to be consistent with the exemption, as outside sales employees are employees, not independent contractors. Thus, courts generally focus on whether employees receive little or no direct or constant supervision in carrying out daily work tasks to determine outside sales status.\n   <em>\n    Nielsen v.

After a morning sales meeting, Plaintiffs drove on their own to sales appointments, and their sales appointments were conducted without supervision. Plaintiffs were limited by regulations as to what they could say in presentations, but they had discretion in how to structure their sales presentations and used their judgment to establish rapport. As a result, the length of sales appointments varied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs emphasize in their affidavits that: (1) they were required to be in the office at 8 a.m. and were required to return to the office at the end of the day if the last appointment ended within business hours; (2) they did not provide their own material or literature to enrollees, as the information was strictly controlled by Defendants; (3) tight control was exercised over all training including the materials used for enrollment and specific methods of enrolling plan participants; (4) all information about enrollees was provided by Defendants; and (5) performance was regularly\n   managed. Plaintiffs also provide an affidavit from their former supervisor Steven James Klaus, who trained and supervised them, as evidence of control. Klaus also states that independent agents and employees essentially performed the same work and were paid under the same compensation structure, which he believed was unfair to agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although Plaintiffs did have sales quotas, had to report daily to their immediate supervisors, and were otherwise subject to some control and supervision, this does not mean they were not exempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnick v.

Calif. 2007) (\"Federal courts have found workers subject to daily reporting requirements and call quotas to be sufficiently unsupervised to qualify as outside salespersons.\"). Moreover, the Second Circuit recently held that the absence of substantial supervision by the employer is not a pre-condition to the application of the outside salesman exemption.\n   <em>\n    Flood v. Just Energy Marketing Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n    904 F.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit considered the degree of supervision of door-to-door salespersons. It noted that, on a typical work day, the plaintiff arrived at a regional office in the morning for a morning meeting that lasted about one hour and covered topics such as updates on products, awards, regulatory or market information, and sales practices. By around 12:30, a company employee used a van to transport plaintiff and his colleagues to different neighborhoods where they then dispersed to knock on doors to solicit business for the employer. The plaintiff wore a company badge and followed a company script and handed out his employer's brochure. \"If the customer was convinced by [the plaintiff's] pitch, then the customer filled out a service agreement setting forth the essential terms of service\" and the plaintiff then remained nearby but outside the customer's immediate presence \"while the customer was required to complete a third-party verification call ... to prevent fraud and to ensure that the customer understood what he or she was purchasing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiff would then confirm the program details and would give the customer all the paperwork, which completed the sale. At the end of the day, the company van returned plaintiff and his colleagues to the regional office, where he submitted signed copies of customer agreements, which were forwarded to a corporate office for processing, where it could be rejected if the customer had poor credit or a block on changing utility accounts. The Second Circuit held that this control was insufficient to preclude application of the outside sales exemption, noting that while plaintiff invoked the absence of direct supervision as being within the purported \"spirit and purpose\" of the exemption, the court must focus on what the law says, and absence of supervision and control is not a requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n    at 234-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As in this case, the plaintiffs' \"argument reduces to an argument about just one of the many external indicia factors:\n   <em>\n    supervision\n   </em>\n   - that [Defendants] engaged in too much supervision for [plaintiffs] to be deemed an outside salesman.\"\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n    904 F.3d at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit held that, \"[i]n the absence of words in the statute or regulation that require consideration of the degree of supervision when deciding if an employee is 'making sales,' we decline to add a 'subject to supervision' exception to the 'making sales' requirement of the outside salesman exemption under the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Second Circuit could not conclude that the high degree of supervision, standing alone, could create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Flood was making sales.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court recognizes that\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   is contrary to a recent district court opinion with virtually the same facts and the same defendant (or its privy) and the same types of door-to-door sales -\n   <em>\n    Hurt v.

The underlying facts in this case are undisputed and, as in\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' opposition to application of the exemption relies solely on the element of control. The Court finds that no material fact issues exist to preclude summary judgment. The evidence conclusively shows that Plaintiffs were employed for the purpose of and were customarily and regularly engaged away from their employer's places of business in making sales within the meaning of the FLSA. They regularly and customarily met for face-to-face sales presentations with potential enrollees, primarily at the enrollees' homes, and they obtained commitments as far as possible under the regulatory framework in the form of enrollment applications. Plaintiffs were also credited with their own sales and were paid with incentive compensation based on their own sales. They engaged in other work primarily incidental to and to further their own sales. As such, sales was their primary duty, and they customarily and regularly engaged in exempt sales activity away from Defendants' offices. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were exempt outside sales agents as a matter of law. The Court therefore grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    Superior's Counterclaims for Money Had and Received\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Superior filed counterclaims against Eugene Martinez and David Silva for money had and received.

Superior asserts that it has requested a return of the overpayments, but Silva and Martinez have not repaid the duplicate commissions. The Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the counterclaims in docket no. 49, noting that the pleading sets forth a claim for money had and received or unjust enrichment sufficient to comply with\n   <em>\n    Twombly.\n   </em>\n   The counterclaims remain pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Suggestion of Death of Sylvia Trevino\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff' counsel filed a Suggestion of Death for Sylvia Trevino pursuant to Rule 25 on January 22, 2018.
