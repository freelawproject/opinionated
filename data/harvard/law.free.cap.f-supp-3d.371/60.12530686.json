On April 29, 2015, the United States Secretary of Labor (\"the Secretary\") brought this action against Defendants Special Police Force Corp. (\"SPF\"), H\u00e9ctor Rivera (\"Rivera\") and Freddy De Jes\u00fas (\"De Jes\u00fas\") (\"Defendants\") alleging failure to pay employees the federal prescribed minimum wage and overtime premiums in violation of the FLSA, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 and 215(a)(2). The Complaint also alleged that Defendants failed to make, keep and/or preserve proper records of hours worked by employees, wages paid to employees and employees' home addresses in violation of federal law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20211\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and 215(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After dispositive motion practice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the issues that remained to be determined at trial were: (1) whether Rivera was an employer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), during the period covered by the Complaint and is therefore liable for the payment of back wages and liquidated damages and subject to an injunction against future violations of the FLSA; (2) whether De Jes\u00fas was an employer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), during the period covered by the Complaint and is liable for the payment of back wages and liquidated damages and subject to an injunction against future violations of the FLSA; and (3) whether Defendants violated the record keeping provisions of section 11(c) of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20211\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 13, 14, and 15, 2019, a non-jury trial was held. When Plaintiff rested, Defendants Rivera and De Jes\u00fas argued for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 (c). The Court granted co-Defendant De Jes\u00fas' petition but denied Rivera's petition. (Docket Nos. 162 and 163). SPF, the corporation, did not make a similar petition. The non-jury trial continued and concluded on March 1, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff presented the testimony of the following witnesses: Gloriana Ort\u00edz Cruz (\"Ortiz\"), a former security guard with SPF, Jos\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, the Director of the Caribbean District office for the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, in charge of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and co-Defendants Rivera and De Jes\u00fas. In turn, Jonathan And\u00fajar M\u00e9ndez (\"And\u00fajar\") and Jos\u00e9 A. Torres-Longo (\"Torres\"), the company's accountant, testified on behalf of Defendant Rivera. No evidence or witnesses were presented on behalf of SPF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Defendant SPF was a corporation duly organized under the laws of the\n   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where it engaged in the business of providing security services. (Docket No. 126, at 6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Defendant Rivera started SPF in 2009, along with Eric Resto Rivera (\"Resto\"), a licensed detective. (Feb. 14 Tr. 5:15-16; Ex. 16, at 11:7-11:23; Defs.' Ex. A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3.

Defendant Rivera invested all of the money to start SPF.

On January 7, 2009, Defendant Rivera signed and filed a \"Certificate of Incorporation\" with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico incorporating SPF (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 5; Ex. 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   6. SPF's \"Certificate of Incorporation\" identifies Defendant Rivera as the \"Resident Agent in charge\" and as an \"incorporator\" (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 7; Ex. 4; Feb. 14 Tr. 7:10-24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. On January 30, 2009, Defendant Rivera signed SPF's corporate bylaws. (Feb. 14 Tr. 54:2-14; Ex. 5). The bylaws established that the only \"officers of the Corporation\" then designated were a president, a treasurer, and a secretary. (Ex. 5, Art. VI, Sec. A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   8. SPF's corporate bylaws also provided that SPF's \"President will be the main executive officer of the Corporation\" and that among the President's \"powers and duties ... are representing the Corporation in official activities.\" (Ex. 5, Art. VI, Sec. D \u00b6 1). The same corporate bylaws established that the Treasurer \"will approve the expenses that arise from day to day for the Corporation\"; \"will be the custodian of all funds and financial reports\"; and \"will also perform all other duties and functions inherent to the position,\" among other duties specifically enumerated as well as those \"inherent to the position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Art. VI, Sec. D \u00b6 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   9. On August 27, 2012, Defendant Rivera signed a corporate resolution, as President and Treasurer of Special Police Force, that certified that he was the \"owner and sole shareholder of the Corporation, for all pertinent legal purposes.\" (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 9; Ex. 10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   10. Pursuant to the resolution, And\u00fajar, who had been listed on the 2009 Certificate of Incorporation as an \"incorporator\" (Ex. 4) and had signed SPF's corporate bylaws (Ex. 5), \"assign[ed] his share and interest\" in SPF to Defendant Rivera. (Ex. 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   11. Defendant Rivera's half-brother, Javier Ort\u00edz Ort\u00edz, signed the 2012 corporate resolution as \"Secretary\" of Special Police Force, but had no role in Special Police Force other than to sign the 2012 corporate resolution and some bank account opening paperwork. (Ex. 10; Feb. 14 Tr. 12:13-20; see Ex. 7, at 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   12. During the period covered by the Complaint, Defendant Rivera was the President, Treasurer, sole owner, and sole shareholder of Special Police Force. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 8; Feb. 14 Tr. 8:6-12, 9:13-10:2, 11:12-25; Ex. 10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   13. Defendant Rivera opened SPF's two bank accounts, personally signing the account opening paperwork. Rivera opened the first Doral Bank account for SPF on January 26, 2013, and the second Doral Bank account for SPF on September 28, 2013. (Feb. 14 Tr. 17:8-10, 17:25-18:11, 20:20-21:10; Ex. 6; Ex. 7).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   14. Defendant Rivera was the only individual authorized to sign checks for each of the two SPF bank accounts. (Feb. 14 Tr. 18:17-25, 21:11-19, 31:16-21; Ex. 6, at 4-10; Ex. 7, at 4-7; Ex. 19, at 30:2 -20).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   15. As part of the paperwork for opening the second Doral Bank account on September 28, 2013, Defendant Rivera submitted a \"Certificate of General Corporate Resolution\" stating that as President of SPF, he was \"authorized to act on behalf and in representation of this Corporation to perform and execute any and all business.\" (Ex. 7, at 5). Defendant Rivera also submitted a \"Certificate of Resolution Regarding Facsimile Signatures\" stating that \"use of a facsimile of the signature of the officer indicated\" therein \"is desirable to facilitate and accelerate the internal operations of this Corporation,\" and that SPF had \"authorize[d] ... use\" of the \"facsimile signature.\" This facsimile signature was Rivera's. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   16. SPF's 2013 \"Annual Reconciliation Statement of Income Subject to Withholding\" filed with the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury, listed Defendant Rivera as SPF's \"withholding agent.\" (Feb. 14 Tr. 13:24-14:6; Ex. 9). Defendant Rivera signed this document electronically on October 21, 2014, declaring \"under penalties of perjury\" that he had personally \"examined\" the document and that its contents - including the monthly and annual dollar amounts of \"Services Rendered by Individuals\" - were \"to the best of [his] knowledge and belief,\" \"true, correct and complete.\" (Ex. 9, at 2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   17. Defendant Rivera invested additional money into Special Police Force whenever necessary, such as when the company had cash flow issues. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 16; Feb. 14 Tr. 31:22-24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   18. In his capacity as President of SPF, Defendant Rivera signed the written proposals SPF presented to its prospective clients. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 11; Feb. 14 Tr. 14:24-15:14; Ex. 11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   19. These proposals detailed to prospective clients the kind of security\n   services SPF offered. Rivera's proposals explained that \"[e]ach one of the specialized security services areas requires a rigorous process of personnel screening, coaching, training and certification, guaranteeing a high degree of excellence and professionalism for all of our clients.\" Rivera also promised in the proposals that \"we at the Special Police Force Corp. guarantee to protect\" clients' security. (Ex. 11, at 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   20. Shortly after SPF obtained the contract to provide security services at the Pine Grove Condominium, Defendant Rivera attended a meeting with the administration of said condominium. (Feb. 13 Tr. 24:22-25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   21. Rivera \"introduced himself as the owner of Special Police Force\" to one of SPF's new employees, Ort\u00edz, at the Pine Grove Condominium. (Feb. 13 Tr. 21:8-14, 23:20-24:8, 24:20-25:1, 49:4-6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   22. Sometime after SPF had already taken over security staffing at Pine Grove, that condominium needed additional security guards. The condominium's vice president understood Defendant Rivera as the person at SPF with authority over recruitment and directed Ort\u00edz to contact Defendant Rivera to coordinate recruitment of guards for SPF to assign to Pine Grove. (Feb. 13 Tr. 31:20-32:15, 32:22-33:3, 96:22-25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   23. Ort\u00edz called Defendant Rivera, who gave the green light for recruitment of new SPF's guards. Defendant Rivera then directed Ort\u00edz to work with SPF's Director of Operations, De Jes\u00fas, to coordinate recruitment for approximately one to one and a half months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Feb. 13 Tr. 31:20-32:12, 32:22-33:3, 96:21-24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   24. Defendant Rivera personally visited the posts where SPF's security guards worked, for instance to install security cameras and repair computers. Ort\u00edz communicated directly with Defendant Rivera about the installation and maintenance of those cameras at Pine Grove, and former employee Emma Garc\u00eda (\"Garc\u00eda\") saw him perform such work at the field site where she was stationed. (Feb. 13 Tr. 30:24-31:19, 53:18-23; Feb. 14 Tr. 90:6-9; Ex. 1, at 10:13-11:4, 38:2-22).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   25. Defendant Rivera also communicated directly with Ort\u00edz to oversee her use of a computer program that SPF used to store information about various condominium residents' and visitors' personal information. (Feb. 13 Tr. 34:22-25, 38:3-13, 59:20-23).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   26. SPF's employees understood Defendant Rivera to be their \"boss\" - the person who supervised their direct supervisors - and knew him to be the company's owner as well. (Feb. 13 Tr. 38:14-15, 41:19-21, 55:5-9; Ex. 1, at 8:2-5, 9:14-18, 10:7-12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   27. Defendant Rivera personally signed an employment verification letter on SPF letterhead for SPF employee Garc\u00eda after she initially\n   requested such a letter from her direct supervisor, so that she could obtain a personal loan. (Ex. 1, at 17:1-18:5; Ex. 4 to Ex. 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Mar. 1 Tr. 10:23-11:2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   28. The letter signed by Defendant Rivera, in his capacity as SPF's president, stated in relevant part: \"I, H\u00e9ctor Rivera Ortiz, hereby certify that Ms. Emma Garc\u00eda Santos works for the company Special Police Force Corp., over which I preside\". (Ex. 4 to Ex. 1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   29. Defendant Rivera's \"Verification of Employment Letter\" elaborated that the recipient should \"please let [Mr. Rivera] know\" if the recipient, the Puerto Rican Cooperative, needed more information about Ms. Garc\u00eda's employment. (Ex. 4 to Ex. 1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   30. In 2013, Defendant Rivera personally signed a letter on SPF's letterhead disclosing that SPF would withhold $ 40.00 from the pay of employees such as Garc\u00eda, on the supposed ground that the SPF's employees were \"merchants\" and were required to register as such with the Treasury Department of Puerto Rico. Rivera's letter detailed the information SPF's employees needed to provide SPF's \"central office\" to facilitate the guards' registration with the Treasury Department. (Ex. 1, at 12:15-13:10, 15:2-16:10; Exs. 2-3 to Ex. 1; Mar. 1 Tr. 10:16-22). SPF subsequently withheld the $ 40.00 from Garc\u00eda's pay. (Ex. 1, at 14:5-13).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   31. When Ort\u00edz resigned from SPF, she understood Defendant Rivera as the appropriate person to whom to report her resignation and in fact reported her resignation directly to him. (Feb. 13 Tr. 41:12-21, 62:4-12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   32. Defendant Rivera was the only person authorized to sign checks for SPF. (Feb. 14 Tr. 18:17-25, 21:11-19, 31:16-21; Ex. 6, at 4-6; Ex. 7, at 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   33. All paychecks given to employees contained Defendant Rivera's signature and only Defendant Rivera's signature, whether because he personally signed the checks or a stamp with his signature was used to sign the checks. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 13; Feb. 14 Tr. 85:11-13; Mar. 1 Tr. 58:9-15; Ex. 1, at 11:5-9; Ex. 13, at 2 (\u00b6 7); Ex. 15, at 2 (\u00b6 9); Ex. 8).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   34. From at least 2012 to 2014, Defendant Rivera was physically present at SPF's office on instances that could be at \"any time of day.\" (Feb. 13 Tr. 34:3-7, 34:11-21; Ex. 16, at 56:15-16, 59:18-19, 61:11-12, 61:21-22; Mar. 1 Tr. 60:24-62:14; Ex. 19, at 13:22-14:2, 17:19-18:17).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   35. Defendant Rivera was familiar with SPF's payroll process and periodically helped total the hours worked by SPF's employees, based on information compiled from the attendance sheets that SPF's line-level supervisors collected from the field posts. SPF's outside accountant Torres then input employees' hours on a spreadsheet with other pre-populated information. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 36-37; Ex. 19, at 17:11-18:17, 23:3-6; Ex. 20, at 39:15-18; Mar. 1 Tr. 23:25-24:8, 27:21-28:13, 32:19-21; Exs. 2-3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   36. Defendant Rivera personally made loans to some employees which were repaid through SPF's payroll. (Mar. 1 Tr. 63:7-65:5; Ex. 2, at 18 [\"Comments\" column listing \"HRO\"]; Ex. 2, at 20 [\"Comments\" column], 21 [\"Comments 2\" column] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   37. In 2012, Defendant Rivera, along with Resto, And\u00fajar, and Torres, made the decision to retain one week's worth of wages from each employee to help with SPF's cash flow deficits. (No. 134 \u00b6 17; Ex. 19, at 31:9-36:11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   38. Following Defendant Rivera's decision to retain employees' wages, employees did not begin to have their withheld wages reimbursed to them until sometime in 2013, \"no less\" than 14 months after the retention decision was made. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 18; Ex. 19, at 35:13-18, 36:6-11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   39. Some employees had to wait up to eighteen months before SPF reimbursed their \"retained\" wages. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 19; Ex. 19, at 36:9-11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   40. The policy of retaining wages from employees continued in effect until the Wage and Hour Division began an investigation of SPF in July 2014. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 20; Ex. 19, at 34:21-24; Mar. 1 Tr. 67:25-68:3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   41. Eric Resto had originally obtained the license for SPF to operate as a security agency because Resto was a detective. (Feb. 14 Tr. 33:7-9, 43:5-8; see Defs.' Ex. A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   42. Although Resto was deceased well before this litigation, it is largely undisputed that Resto was involved in the decision to establish SPF in 2009 and the hiring of And\u00fajar; at the outset of the corporation's founding, he was involved in decisions about how much security guards were paid (amounts that generally did not fluctuate in subsequent years), certain disciplinary policies\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , creating templates for payroll that Torres later used; and the default price levels for client contracts. (Feb. 15 Tr. 70:7-12, 72:11-12, 80:16-18, 80:23-24, 87:16-18; Mar. 1 Tr. 26:23-25, 47:9-13; Ex. 20, at 34:8-15; Ex. 2). Resto never invested any money in SPF's operations. (Ex. 16, at 12:23-25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   43. There is no evidence that Resto had an ownership stake in SPF or was a corporate officer within the meaning of any of the documents in evidence, such as the Articles of Incorporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   44. Resto died in August 2014 of a health condition that had been worsening for approximately two years. (Feb. 14 Tr. 33:10-19).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   45. During the time that Resto's \"disease progressed, he could no longer carry out certain functions\" at SPF and from 2012 onward, visited SPF's office at most \"once in a while.\" (Feb. 14 Tr. 65:9-13; Feb. 15 Tr. 85:17-88:1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   46. After Resto's death, Defendant Rivera functioned as SPF's \"CEO,\" \"ran the operations of the company\" and oversaw all administrative personnel. (Docket No. 134 \u00b6 21;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Ex. 13, at 2 (\u00b6 5a); Ex. 15, at 1 (\u00b6\u00b6 1-2) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   47. The personnel whom Defendant Rivera oversaw included, but was not limited to And\u00fajar, De Jes\u00fas, and Torres.

And\u00fajar was SPF's general manager or \"assistant to the manager\" at SPF (Feb. 15 Tr. 78:3-6; Ex. 20, at 15:3-10, 23:21-22). The roles delegated to And\u00fajar at certain times included some levels of responsibility regarding corporate operation\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but And\u00fajar could not independently make decisions regarding SPF's operations. Before making or implementing any operational decisions, And\u00fajar had to consult with either Resto or after Resto's death, Defendant Rivera. For example, And\u00fajar had to report up \"all information about all contracts, about employees,\" and \"[a]ny and all information of what was done on the day-to-day-basis\" at the company's posts in which And\u00fajar was involved.

Defendant Rivera never took the stand as a defense witness to explain his involvement in crucial issues in this case, such as the decision to retain a week's work of employees' wages, or who at SPF had responsibility for hiring or firing employees. Rivera only testified as part of the Secretary's case, during which the Court repeatedly announced its rulings pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 611 to limit the scope of defense counsel's cross examination based on the scope of the Secretary's direct examination. Therefore, Rivera's testimony was circumscribed to the limited questions posed by the Secretary's counsel. At that time, the Court specifically noted that should Defendant Rivera take the stand in his defense, he would have an opportunity during the presentation of his own case to present \"his [own] testimony\" and to \"sit\" for \"a full direct.\" (Feb. 13 Tr. 129:9-130:12, 135:10-13; Feb. 14 Tr. 58:11-59:19; see also Feb. 14 Tr. 93:13-22, 96:9-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Toward the close of Defendant Rivera's case, his counsel initially indicated that Rivera would testify for a very limited purpose, namely in connection with two proposed exhibits. After the Court admitted one exhibit and took judicial notice of a provision of law, Defendant Rivera's counsel stated his intention that Rivera testify \"that his decision to close the company was because he was compelled to by law.\" After the Court correctly observed that Rivera had already testified to that limited point during the Secretary's case, Defendant Rivera promptly rested his case without testifying and without his counsel making any other proffer. (Mar. 1 Tr. 72:4-78:25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Feb. 14 Tr. 102:21-103:10 [Rivera testimony that SPF \"had to cease operations\" because SPF lacked a \"valid license,\" and SPF's clients had been asking \"for the documents to be delivered to verify that [they] were in compliance with the law\" before clients would renew contracts] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   While the Court rejects Plaintiff's invitation to draw an adverse inference from Rivera's failure to take the stand, the Court finds that what little testimony he offered left gaping holes in his defense, and was contradictory to what he previously offered in his answers to Plaintiff's interrogatories, thus undermining his credibility. Rivera had the opportunity to correct these deficiencies and set the record straight as to these important matters via his direct testimony during his case in chief, and he failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   During the Secretary's case, Defendant Rivera provided inconsistent testimony, as compared to his sworn answers during discovery, regarding a number of key topics, including his role at SPF following the death of Eric Resto. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Feb. 14 Tr. 111:15-21). For example, Rivera offered the sweeping testimony that he \"had to consult everything with And\u00fajar because And\u00fajar was the one who was assuming control of the operations of the corporation\" and \"had the knowledge\" regarding \"security\" that Rivera supposedly lacked. (Feb. 14 Tr. 95:16-20). This testimony directly contradicts Defendant Rivera's sworn interrogatory responses that Rivera himself \"ran the operations of\" SPF after Resto's death and oversaw all administrative personnel. (Ex. 15, at 1 (\u00b6\u00b6 1-2); Docket No. 134 \u00b6 21). Rivera's testimony also contradicts And\u00fajar's testimony, offered in Rivera's defense, that after Resto's death, And\u00fajar actually reported to Defendant Rivera. (Feb. 15 Tr. 90:7-9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Rivera's testimony that he personally had \"zero\" knowledge of \"security,\" also contradicts the undisputed evidence that he personally installed security cameras at SPF's clients' posts; communicated directly with SPF's employees about the installation and maintenance of those security cameras; and communicated directly with at least one SPF employee regarding the computer program that SPF used to store clients' data that determined which residents or visitors could enter client sites - not to mention all the other evidence discussed above about his personal role in the corporate operations. (Compare Feb. 14 Tr. 95:20-21, with Feb. 13 Tr. 30:24-31:19, 34:19-21, 38:3-13, 53:20-54:2, 59:17-23; Feb. 14 Tr. 90:6-9; Ex. 1, at 10:13-11:4, 38:2-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At trial, Rivera could not remember his own testimony from earlier in the day about whose decision it was to cease operations, and further testified inconsistently about that decision.

These facts are especially compelling in establishing liability under the economic reality standard because they \"suggest[ ] a high level of dominance over the company's operations,\" a level of dominance further evidenced in this case by Rivera's eventual decision for SPF to cease operations and role in communicating that decision to SPF's clients.\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070846\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/34/#p47\">\n    725 F.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing significance of defendant's power to dissolve a corporation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, Defendant Rivera had operational control over significant aspects of SPF's business at all relevant times.

He oversaw all administrative personnel from at least August 2014 onward, and well beforehand supervised the company's hiring process, delegating the day-to-day implementation to others such as Operations Manager De Jes\u00fas.

Specifically, Rivera was an architect of the wage retention policy pursuant to which employees had an entire week's worth of wages withheld for between 14 and 18 months, continuing into the time period for which back wages are at issue in this case. As the only owner, shareholder, investor, and the Treasurer with ultimate approval over SPF's expenses, Defendant Rivera's approval of the wage retention policy effectively shifted the corporation's financial liabilities to the backs of employees, leaving them unpaid for an entire workweek for over a year.

As former presider Hon.

Regarding this issue, Resto, And\u00fajar, De Jes\u00fas, Torres, and other supervisors had various roles at SPF, and those roles varied over time. The Court need not and does not decide whether any of these other individuals also met the standard under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (other than De Jes\u00fas, whom the Court has already held not liable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 163-64). It is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the evidence regarding others'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   roles does not negate Rivera's own liability. Regarding this matter, the Court explains briefly as follows: \"The FLSA contemplates\" that employees may have \"several simultaneous employers, each responsible for compliance with the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Baystate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11782253\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/668/#p678\">\n    163 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rivera was the only investor, shareholder, owner, and officer at the company. He had \"ultimate control over\" several key aspects of SPF's operations, including its bank account, approval of expenses (including in his capacity as Treasurer), maintaining corporate records including employment records, creation of client proposals, and held himself out to WHD as the primary corporate representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hotel Oasis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511058\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/26/\">\n    493 F.3d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Rivera also held himself out to employees as the person with ultimate oversight over certain aspects of the hiring process and authority to verify employment. Rivera was instrumental in a number of \"critical decisions regarding the allocation of [SPF's] resources,\" diverting funds from employees' wages to the corporation's bottom line, and ultimately deciding to cease operations entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070846\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/34/#p47\">\n    725 F.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does not negate his own liability that Rivera delegated many day-to-day functions to line-level supervisors (such as personally interviewing employees or assigning them to work at particular posts) and did not personally design and implement each and every corporate policy (such as establishing security guards' rate of pay or setting prices for clients' contracts).\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baystate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11782253\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/668/#p678\">\n    163 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing in the related context that a corporate employer often exercises control over employees through \"indirect supervisory oversight\" and does \" 'not need to look over his workers' shoulders every day in order to exercise control' \") (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brock v.

Laws Ann. tit., 25, \u00a7 285h. Under Puerto Rico law, a corporation that provides security services can apply for a license to operate provided only that \"its senior executive officer is a private detective\" with a certain separate license. Defendant Rivera has pointed to that law, in connection with the fact of Resto's death, as motivating Rivera's decision to terminate SPF's operations. But Rivera's decision for SPF to cease operations (and promptly to open a new security guard firm with substantially similar clients and the same employees) was no less an exercise of Rivera's \"ultimate control\" over SPF's operations even if motivated by an effort to comply with certain aspects of the Law of Private Detectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Nor does the Court draw any further findings or conclusions regarding SPF's compliance or non-compliance with the Law of Private Detectives. Defendant Rivera has not established that Eric Resto acted as one of SPF's \"chief\" or \"senior executive officer[s]\" in conformity with the Law of Private Detectives, let alone that Resto's role at SPF before his untimely death negates the conclusive evidence regarding Rivera's own role. Particularly in light of the fact that the issue - namely whether a security agency has conformed with the Law and its requirements regarding chief or senior executive officers - is the subject of frequent litigation, the Court cannot and does not conclude that the Law's provisions have any bearing on the actual record in this case regarding the allocation of authority within the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In any event, the Law of Private Detectives does not require that the person who occupies the highest position in the hierarchy of a security agency be the same person who petitions for a security agency license as the corporation's \"chief\" or \"senior executive officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Ranger Am. of P.R\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205166513\">\n    2011 WL 5166513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bravo-Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985937\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/828/441/#p459\">\n    828 F.Supp.2d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing statute's ambiguity). The evidence suggests that as President, Rivera was actually the company's \"main executive officer.\" (Ex. 5, Art. VI, Sec. D \u00b6 1). Accordingly, given the actual evidence in this case, the Law of Private Detectives has no bearing on the question of Rivera's liability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Having concluded that Defendant Rivera is an employer under 29 U.S.C \u00a7 203(d) of the same employees as Defendant SPF, and jointly and severally liable for the back wages and liquidated damages already found due, the Court in its discretion also enters an injunction against Defendant Rivera requiring compliance with the FLSA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20215\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), 217. As previously noted, Defendant Rivera was personally involved in key decisions that led to FLSA violations at SPF. Even before dissolving SPF, Rivera founded a new security guard company, Security Police Force, which has many of the same employees, supervisors, and clients as did SPF. Rivera owns Security Police Force and operates the new company from the same office where he operated SPF. For substantially the same reasons as those noted by Hon. Judge Gelp\u00ed, in issuing an injunction against SPF on summary judgment, and now that the Court has found that Rivera is also personally liable for the same violations - many of which continued for months even after the Wage and Hour Division specifically informed Rivera of the Act's requirements - an injunction is appropriate to ensure that Rivera bears the burden of future compliance with the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 126, at 25 (entering injunction absent evidence of \"present\" violations, based on consideration of all other relevant factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The injunction is neither punitive nor a hardship. Rather, having considered the factors discussed in the relevant cases, and given the evidence regarding the history of Rivera's non-compliance long after being informed of WHD's findings, and based on the further reasoning as set forth in Hon. Judge Gelp\u00ed's opinion including the absence of a good faith attempt to comply with the FLSA, the Court in its discretion enters this injunction to send an important message that reiterates the Act's compliance requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herman v.

Defendant Rivera submitted findings of fact which were wholly unsubstantiated, as he provided no citations to the record to buttress them. Consequently, the Court did not credit Rivera's proposed facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The Court adopted the proposed stipulations in the parties' Joint Pretrial Memorandum.

(Feb. 15 Tr. 78:3-6; Ex. 20, at 15:3-10, 23:21-22). And\u00fajar testified he \"asked to be taken out of all the corporation's documents\" in 2012 for multiple reasons. (Mar. 1 Tr. 15:3). As of 2012, And\u00fajar \"spent more time\" in the continental United States than he did in Puerto Rico. He elaborated that \"let's say there was a problem and I did not have money to do the traveling. Because I had been traveling. So any problem that the company might have,\" And\u00fajar would not be around to \"resolve it.\" (Ex. 20, at 23:12-16, 23:23-24:13; Mar. 1 Tr., 9:18-23, 15:11-14, 16:10-17:4). And\u00fajar also testified that Resto and And\u00fajar had some financial agreement, that Resto \"never complied,\" which was another reason And\u00fajar wanted to be taken out SPF's corporate documents. (Mar. 1 Tr. 15:1-3; see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20215\">\n     id. at 15:17-20, 19:6-9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Tying these explanations together, And\u00fajar explained that his intention in being removed from the corporate documents was not \"to get into any trouble,\" regarding \"overtime, or any problem of the company.\" (Mar. 1 Tr. 17:6-14).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Although Ort\u00edz did not know the exact time period she was involved in this recruitment, it was before July 2014, when Ort\u00edz resigned from SPF. (Feb. 13 Tr. 41:8-10, 62:4-6, 96:21-97:4).

Ort\u00edz and Garc\u00eda testified that, during the period covered by the Complaint, they saw And\u00fajar ever less frequently; Garc\u00eda saw Defendant Rivera at SPF's client sites at least as often as she saw And\u00fajar. (Ex. 1, at 38:13-39:6; Feb. 13 Tr. 34:3-15, 59:14-22, 89:21-90:3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Many of And\u00fajar's responsibilities eventually shifted to De Jes\u00fas, apparently because of Resto's declining health and And\u00fajar's absence from Puerto Rico.

During Torres's deposition, he repeatedly discussed Defendant Rivera's role in each of these topics, but on the stand, he conspicuously strained to avoid nearly any mention of Rivera. (Compare Mar. 1 Tr. 34:15-17, 37:9-12, 38:2-12, 40:24-41:2, 41:21-24, 48:1-24, 54:19-21, with Ex. 19, at 17:11-18:17, 30:2-6, 30:19-20, 34:3-16, and Mar. 1 Tr. 61:6-62:14, 66:19-67:24).
