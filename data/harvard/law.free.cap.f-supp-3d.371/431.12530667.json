She argues that Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4117.04 -05 is unconstitutional and moves for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from recognizing the Union as Plaintiff's representative.

The Union is an employee organization that represents employees of the Marietta School District. It is affiliated with the Ohio Education Association and the National Education Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Board and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"). The CBA establishes a bargaining unit of \"all full and regular part-time certificated personnel employed under contract, including classroom teachers, special education teachers, psychologists, guidance counselors, librarians, school nurses, head\n   teacher(s), attendance officer, resource teachers, and full-time substitutes employed sixty-one (61) or more consecutive days in the same position in a school year.\" CBA \u00a7 1.01, ECF No. 15-2. As such, Plaintiff is a member of the bargaining unit as defined in the CBA. Plaintiff is not, however, a member of the Union. Thompson Decl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 15-2. In fact, Plaintiff disagrees with the Union's position on several issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 12-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nonetheless, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 permits the Court to issue preliminary injunctions upon the satisfaction of certain requirements. The Court considers four factors in\n   determining whether to grant injunctive relief: (1) whether the movant has established a substantial probability of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether an injunction would substantially harm third parties; and (4) whether an injunction would serve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winnett v.

Before turning to the merits of those arguments, the Court notes that Plaintiff also alleged in her Complaint that the designation of the Union as her exclusive representative impinges her ability to engage in her own free speech or her ability to petition the government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 117 (\"That designation\n   <em>\n    restricts\n   </em>\n   the Plaintiff's speech and petitioning.\") (emphasis added), but Plaintiff has waived those arguments. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for Plaintiff repeatedly asserted that Plaintiff is not alleging that the statutes violate a right of Plaintiff to be heard by the Board or to bargain on her own behalf. Tr. 4:17-24, 16:8-10, 33:22-34:12, 36:12-23; 38:3-8, ECF No. 43.

In rejecting the notions that PELRA impermissibly delegated state sovereignty to the union, impermissibly granted the union the power to make \"economic laws,\" and that the union was, in essence, a political party, the district court held that \"Minnesota may provide for exclusive representation by an employee association in the public sector and may require that nonmembers of the association financially support its collective bargaining efforts through a fair share fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

In a separate opinion, the Supreme Court reversed that portion of the district court's opinion. The Supreme Court's specific holding in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   (as it related to the appellees' freedom of association claim with respect to the \"meet and confer\" sessions) was that PELRA's\n   <em>\n    restriction of participation in \"meet and confer\" sessions to the exclusive representative\n   </em>\n   did not violate the nonmembers' associational rights.\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, the holding is not directly dispositive of the claim Plaintiff makes here-that the very designation of the Union as Plaintiff's exclusive representative forces an association between Plaintiff and the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In coming to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , however, the Supreme Court made broad statements about PELRA and the freedom of association. For instance, the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he state has in no way restrained appellees' ... freedom to associate or not to associate with whom they please, including the exclusive representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, it stated later that the nonmembers' associational freedom was not impaired because the nonmembers were both \"free to form whatever advocacy groups they like\" and were \"not required to become members of\" the union.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These broad statements at the very least suggest that because joinder in the Union is not required, the First Amendment right to be free from compelled association is still protected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bierman v.

Of course,\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   has since established that fair share provisions violate the First Amendment. But because the fair share provision was not at issue in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court's association claim analysis in that case rested on the reasoning above-the fact that employees were\n   not forced to join the union meant that their associational rights were not infringed by designating the union as those employees' exclusive representative for purposes of meet and negotiate or meet and confer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   That reasoning is applicable to this case.

Any such harm would be irreparable, but, because the Court has concluded that Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail on her First Amendment claims, the Court also finds that Plaintiff will not likely suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction. This factor therefore weighs against granting a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Harm to Third Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Union and the Board are currently negotiating a successor CBA, and a\n   preliminary injunction could substantially harm the Union, the Board, and other bargaining unit members. If the Court granted Plaintiff's requested injunction, it would be utterly unclear to both the Union and the Board how to proceed with negotiations as they related to the terms and conditions of Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff is not seeking the right to negotiate her contract herself or through another entity, and if the Union did not represent her in negotiations, the Board would be unable to negotiate her contract. Further, Plaintiff's proposed injunction prohibits the Board from recognizing the Union as the representative of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   bargaining unit members who are not members of the Union,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15-3, leaving each of those third parties likewise unrepresented in negotiations. Such relief would harm those third parties, and the Court finds this factor weighs against granting Plaintiff's requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Court has concluded, though, that Ohio's exclusive representative system does not likely violate Plaintiff's free speech or association rights, and the public interest also lies in avoiding the type of labor strife that predated passage of Ohio's collective bargaining law. Accordingly, this factor weighs against granting Plaintiff's requested preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the above reasons, Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 15, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk shall terminate ECF No. 15 from the pending motions list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Plaintiff originally challenged the collective bargaining agreement's provision requiring the Board to exact a \"fair share\" fee (in the same amount as union dues) from non-union-member employees' paychecks and remit the same to the Union (Count I).
