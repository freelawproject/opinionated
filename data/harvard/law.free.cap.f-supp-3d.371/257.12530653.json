Defendant then filed his\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition only seventeen months after\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   was decided. Thus, the fact that the basis for defendant's challenge to his convictions emerged a reasonably short time before defendant filed his petition is a valid explanation for defendant's decision not to challenge his convictions earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bereano v.

Thus, by waiting to file his petition until after the resolution of Jefferson's\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -based\n   </em>\n   claims, defendant promoted judicial economy by ensuring the petition would not be frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, to determine whether a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition is timely, courts also consider whether the government has suffered prejudice as a result of the petitioner's delay in seeking\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanton v.

Va. 1995). In this respect, it does not appear that the government has suffered prejudice as a result of defendant's failure to challenge his convictions earlier. Indeed, the government has not identified any evidence the government was unable to produce, and it appears that the government was fully able to oppose defendant's\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition. Accordingly, in light of the sound reasons for defendant's delay in filing a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition and the absence of significant prejudice to the government caused by the delay, defendant has satisfied the second\n   <em>\n    Akinsade\n   </em>\n   element required to support his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , it is also apparent, and undisputed by the government, that defendant continues to face adverse consequences stemming from his convictions that are sufficient to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of Article III.

Indeed, given that defendant continued to pay Jefferson over a period of time during which Jefferson performed only non-criminal and non-official \"constituent services\" for iGate, it appears that defendant paid Jefferson with the understanding and intent that such payments would be made in exchange for acts by Jefferson that are not criminal under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Therefore, in the absence of other evidence reflecting a criminal intent, the fact that Jefferson did not perform official acts demonstrates that defendant did not give, offer, or promise anything of value to Jefferson, or conspire to do so, with the intent to influence official acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, the government argues that even if Jefferson did not perform official acts for defendant and iGate, two statements made by defendant during his testimony at Jefferson's trial, which occurred after defendant's plea hearing, reflect that defendant did intend to influence official acts by Jefferson. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that this subsequent testimony by defendant is relevant to whether there was a factual basis for defendant's guilty plea, the government's argument fails because defendant's testimony does not demonstrate that defendant intended to influence official acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant's first statement, made in reference to Jefferson's meeting with U.S. Army officers, which occurred before defendant agreed to pay Jefferson, was that \"I watched him give orders, if you will, to a United States general ... I just watched him be so effective for me, and he ... [had] as much zeal as I did.\" This statement does not establish that defendant paid Jefferson in exchange for official acts. Defendant's characterization of Jefferson's conduct as \"giv[ing] orders, if you will, to a United States general\" is clearly a loose-not literal-description. Moreover, the Statement of Facts to which defendant admitted and the evidence at Jefferson's trial demonstrates that what defendant actually witnessed Jefferson do was \"ma[ke] several encouraging statements about iGate's technology\" and \"persuad[e] the U.S. Army to test iGate's ... technology.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523312\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/717/#p721\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   737 ;\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , 1:06-cr-00161-TSE, Statement of Facts, ECF No. 6. Defendant's obviously loose characterization of what transpired during this meeting, uttered seven years after the meeting occurred, is insufficient to demonstrate that defendant misperceived what Jackson had actually done. Thus, it is clear that Jefferson's meeting with U.S. Army officers did not cause defendant to believe that Jefferson actually had done or would continue to do acts tantamount to giving binding orders or otherwise exerting pressure on other public officials in exchange for payments to Jefferson. Indeed, to the extent that Jefferson's meeting with U.S. Army officers framed defendant's expectation going forward, it shows that defendant paid Jefferson in exchange for persuasion, not official pressure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The government also highlights defendant's statement at Jefferson's trial that \"I believed when I called upon [Jefferson] to help, he would help, because I was paying him to help.\" Although this statement reflects that defendant expected some kind of help in return for his payments, it does not show that defendant's payments were made in exchange for official acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, the better evidence, namely the actions that Jefferson in fact performed for iGate in return for defendant's continued payment, demonstrates that the \"help\" defendant paid Jefferson to perform was non-official \"constituent services\" that are not criminal under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, the facts alleged in the Indictment and the Statement of Facts, along with the evidence adduced at Jefferson's trial, reflect that there was not a factual basis for defendant's guilty plea to the charges of bribery of a public official and conspiracy to bribe a public official.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's guilty plea was thus accepted in error and in violation of Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Before resolving the second step in the fundamental error analysis-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   whether these errors would have entitled defendant to relief on direct appeal-it is necessary to determine what standard of review would have applied to defendant's claim on appeal.

Accordingly, these cases confirm that because defendant here did not raise his Rule 11 and Fifth Amendment objections during his underlying proceeding, he would be required to show plain error on direct appeal and thus must satisfy the plain error standard on review of his\n    <em>\n     coram nobis\n    </em>\n    petition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      13\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    decision applies retroactively because it is a \"new 'substantive' rule\" that \"narrow[s] the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,\" namely\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)'s definition of \"official act.\"\n    <em>\n     Jefferson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523312\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/717/#p721\">\n     289 F.Supp.3d at 731\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Schriro v.

The government chose to have defendant plead guilty only to bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery and did not seek a guilty plea on any other charge or basis. But nothing in this Memorandum Opinion should be read as deciding that other aspects of defendant's activity did not constitute criminal conduct. All that is before the Court is whether defendant is entitled to a writ of\n    <em>\n     coram nobis\n    </em>\n    with respect to his convictions under the bribery statute, and in light of the Supreme Court's narrow reading of \"official act,\" it is necessary to conclude that he is.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    --------\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
