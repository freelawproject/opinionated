PARKER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Defendants asserting the following claims: (I) age discrimination in violation of the federal Age Discrimination and Employment Act (\"ADEA\"); (II) age discrimination in violation of Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (\"ELCRA\"); (III) race and ethnic discrimination in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (IV) race and national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"); and (V) race and national origin discrimination under the ELCRA. Defendants are General Motors, LLC (\"GM\") and GM (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (\"GMCIC\"). The matter is presently before the Court on GM's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, under the forum non conveniens doctrine. (ECF No. 11.) The motion has been fully briefed (ECF Nos. 14, 15.) GM and Plaintiff also filed supplemental briefs addressing the law of the People's Republic of China, which is relevant to arguments raised by GM. (ECF Nos. 22, 24-27.) Finding the facts and legal arguments sufficiently presented in the parties' briefs, the Court is dispensing with oral argument pursuant to Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 7.1(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Applicable Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its motion, GM states that it is seeking dismissal pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This Court previously addressed whether GM's motion is properly considered under Rule 12(b)(1) in an opinion and order issued on September 20, 2018. (ECF No. 21.) As the Court explained there, GM's challenges to Plaintiff's claims are not in fact challenges to the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 406-09.) Rather, they are challenges to Plaintiff's ability to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Accordingly, the standards applicable to a Rule 12(b)(6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   motion, rather than a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, govern GM's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\" Under this notice pleading standard, a complaint need not contain \"detailed factual allegations,\" but it must contain more than \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action....\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8, ECF No. 1 at Pg ID 2.) He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1999, and currently maintains only U.S. citizenship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, Pg ID 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In February 1989, Plaintiff began working for GM in Canada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, Pg ID 3.) On or about July 1, 2009, GM transferred Plaintiff to a new job assignment at GMCIC as Senior Manager for Automotive Performance, Test and Validation in the Engineering Laboratories Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10, Pg ID 3.) The position was in Shanghai, China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a United States citizen, Plaintiff was required to have a work visa and resident permit to work in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Pg ID 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about August 1, 2015, Charon Morgan became Director of Engineering at GMCIC and, in that capacity, was Plaintiff's immediate supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12, Pg ID 3.) Plaintiff believes that Ms. Morgan's supervisor was Tobias\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suenner, GMCIC's\n   Vice President for Vehicle Engineering, who in turn reported to Kenneth L. Kelzer, who worked in the United States as GM's Vice President of Global Vehicle Components and Subsystems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, Pg ID 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or about January 24, 2017, Ms. Morgan and Grace Zheng, GMCIC's Human Resources Manager, informed Plaintiff that he was going to be mandatorily retired on July 3, 2017, when he turned sixty years-old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, Pg ID 3.) Plaintiff objected, noting that David Reeck, a colleague who was transferred to GMCIC around the same time as Plaintiff, worked in China for GMCIC until he was sixty-five years-old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, Pg ID 4.) Plaintiff believes Mr. Reeck, who is Caucasian, is a United States Citizen and not of Chinese national origin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, Pg ID 4.) At a subsequent meeting with Ms. Morgan on February 17, 2017, Plaintiff tried to reverse the decision to mandatorily retire him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18, Pg ID 4.) In response, Ms. Morgan analogized Plaintiff's situation to Kevin Wang, a locally hired engineer manager who was a Chinese citizen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19, Pg ID 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Plaintiff sent Ms. Morgan an email, stating that the decision to mandatorily retire him at age sixty contradicted a company memorandum he became aware of in 2009, when he transitioned to his job position in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, Pg ID 4.) Entitled \"Retirement Age\" with a GM logo heading and an effective date of April 1, 2000, the memo reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.0\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     PROVISION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3.1 The retirement age shall be 55 years for female employee [sic], and 60 years for male employee [sic].

Ms. Morgan responded to Plaintiff's email on February 24, 2017, \"clarify[ing] that there's no business needs to extend your employment after your legal retirement age in China which is 60 years old according to applicable China law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, Pg ID 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In an email to Ms. Morgan and Ms. Zheng on March 13, 2017, Plaintiff disputed Ms. Morgan's claim that there was no business need to retain him, pointing out that there was a posting for Plaintiff's same and/or similar position already on \"GM Global Internal Jobs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24, Pg ID 5.) The following day, Ms. Zheng responded, asserting that \"business need\" refers to the continuation of employment of the employee, not the job position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26, Pg ID 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his March 13, 2017 email to Ms. Morgan and Ms. Zheng, Plaintiff also asked to be transferred back to the United States if he could not continue working in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25, Pg ID 5.) Plaintiff made several other contacts with GM, attempting to obtain positions in the United States. He was unable to secure a position, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 16, 2017, Ms. Morgan and Ron Fraser authored a mass email using the GM logo announcing that Plaintiff \"will retire after 28 years of service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, Pg ID 6.) The email also announced that Gregory Schone had been appointed as the new manager of GM China Engineering Laboratories and would be relocating to\n   Shanghai, China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, Pg ID 6.) Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Schone is a substantially younger Caucasian who had been working for GM in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 1, 2017, Plaintiff was involuntarily retired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29, Pg ID 6.) He thereafter returned to his home in Clarkston, Michigan, and filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31, Pg ID 2, 6.) The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter on January 17, 2018.

However, as outlined in the previous section, the Court may not consider such evidence to decide GM's Rule 12(b)(6) motion. GM nevertheless argues that Plaintiff fails to plead sufficient facts to plausibly support his allegation that GM controls GMCIC. In fact, in the paragraph of his Complaint asserting that GM controls GMCIC, Plaintiff simply recites the four factors set forth above.

Plaintiff submits an affidavit from his attorney, David Kotzian, attesting to the need for discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 3, ECF No. 14-4 at Pg ID 185.) Yet, Plaintiff also states that he already possesses sufficient facts to state a plausible claim regarding GM's control of GMCIC if the Court were to grant him leave to amend his Complaint. Plaintiff sets forth some of those facts in his response brief. Plaintiff also contends that GM used carefully selected language and omitted key facts in the declarations submitted in its\n   support of its motion which are therefore misleading as to GM's role in GMCIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For example, Plaintiff points to Robert Treme's statement in his declaration that he is the Human Resources Director of GMCIC in China. Plaintiff notes that Mr. Treme never states whether he is a GM or GMCIC employee. Instead, Mr. Treme represents that he is \"on assignment as an International Service Personnel ('ISP') in China.\" (GM's Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 2, ECF No. 11-2 at Pg ID 77.) Plaintiff asserts that most or all of the senior managers at GMCIC are ISPs who are temporarily assigned to GMCIC while remaining GM employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff also points to the official press release announcing Ms. Morgan's appointment to GMCIC in August 2015, which clearly identifies GM as her employer. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 11, ECF No. 14-12 at Pg ID 222.) According to the announcement, Ms. Morgan was succeeding \"Matt Crossley, who will officially retire\n   <em>\n    from GM\n   </em>\n   on September 1.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , emphasis added.) Plaintiff further relies on GM's organizational charts, which show that Mr. Treme and Ms. Morgan report directly or indirectly to GM employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 4, 5, ECF Nos. 14-5, 14-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff further points out that Matt Tsien, the President of GMCIC, also holds the title of Executive Vice President of GM. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 12, ECF No. 14-13 at Pg ID 225.) Moreover, Mr. Tsien reports to Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Tsien signed a \"Certificate of Recognition\" on May 6, 2014, acknowledging Plaintiff's \"25 years of loyal and dedicated service to\n   <em>\n    General Motors.\n   </em>\n   \" (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 14, ECF No. 14-5 at Pg ID 231, emphasis added.) Plaintiff had not reached that milestone solely at GMCIC or GM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff argues that GM uses the term \"GM\" interchangeably to refer to both the China and United States operations when it suits it, but then claims they are entirely distinct when doing so is beneficial. Plaintiff points to the letter offering him the position in China, which bears the \"GM\" logo with a reference to the \"GM China Group.\" (GM's Mot., Ex. B, ECF No. 11-2 at Pg ID 87.) The letter identifies Plaintiff's \"corporate GM employee level\" in the new position and states: \"General Motors is the world's largest automotive manufacturer with aggressive growth plans for China.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, when he was transferred to China, his move was handled directly by two GM managers from the United States. (Pl.'s Aff. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 14-3 at Pg ID 176.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The GM logo was also at the top of the May 16, 2017 announcement of Plaintiff's retirement \"after 28 years of service\", which was signed by Ms. Morgan and Ron Fraser, GM's Director of Infotainment, Telematics &amp; Displays Validation. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 9, ECF No. 14-10 at Pg ID 216.) Mr. Fraser works for GM in Detroit, Michigan. (Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 14, ECF No. 14 at Pg ID 145.) The email announcing Plaintiff's retirement further stated that Gregory Schone had been appointed as the new Manager, GMCIC Engineering Laboratories and would be relocating to Shanghai, China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9, ECF No. 14-10 at Pg ID 216.) Plaintiff indicates that Mr. Schone had been working at GM in Warren, Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Pl.'s Aff. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 14-3 at Pg ID 176.) The Court also takes note of the fact that the email addresses for Plaintiff and the above-identified individuals-whether they worked at GM or GMCIC-all are at \"gm.com.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Exs. 8, 9, ECF Nos. 14-9 at Pg ID 209, 14-10 at Pg ID 215-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff presents sufficient facts in response to GM's motion to plausibly support his assertion that GM controls GMCIC and survive GM's Rule 12(b)(6) motion. In other words, Plaintiff demonstrates that, if allowed to amend his Complaint (as he requests in response to GM's motion), he could state facts to support the four control factors set forth already in his current pleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, all of the cases GM cites in its reply brief to argue that Plaintiff's evidence is insufficient were decided on summary judgment or following a trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GM's Reply Br. at 3-4, ECF No. 15 at Pg ID 253-54.) Thus, for purposes of evaluating GM's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court is accepting as true Plaintiff's assertion that GM and GMCIC are a single employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Transfer and/or Rehire Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he requested to \"be transferred back to the United States if he was not allowed to continue to work in China\" and \"made several other contacts with GM in an effort to obtain a position back in the United States, but he was denied a transfer.\" (Compl. \u00b6 25, ECF no. 1 at Pg ID 5-6.) Plaintiff asserts that this conduct-as well as the decision to involuntarily retire him at age sixty-violated the ADEA, the ELCRA, \u00a7 1981, and Title VII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 44, 49, 55, Pg ID 8-11.) GM argues in its motion to dismiss that Plaintiff's factual allegations are insufficient to state a plausible failure-to-hire claim. Specifically, GM contends that Plaintiff pleads, in a conclusory manner, that he was denied a \"transfer\" or \"reassignment\" based on the protected characteristics of age, national origin, and race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In response to GM's motion, Plaintiff sets forth further details regarding his efforts to secure a position with GM in the United States after he was involuntarily retired from his position in China. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 6, ECF No. 14 at Pg ID 137.) He already asserts in his Complaint that those employment decisions were based on unlawful reasons (i.e., his age, national origin, and/or race). Plaintiff also presents facts in his Complaint suggesting that his position in China was wrongfully terminated based on his race, age, and/or national origin. If GM controls GMCIC and thus that termination position and its unlawful basis can be imputed to GM, the Court believes Plaintiff sets forth sufficient facts to state a plausible unlawful hire or transfer claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   GM argues that Plaintiff's \u00a7 1981 claim should be dismissed because the statute does not protect individuals employed outside the territory of the United States.

Plaintiff further argues that aside from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ofori-Tenkorang v.

Plaintiff urges the Court to reject the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Ofori-Tenkorang\n   </em>\n   . The Court declines to do so and finds that \u00a7 1981 does not apply to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 1981 protects \"persons\n   <em>\n    within the jurisdiction of the United States\n   </em>\n   \" from discrimination in \"the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , emphasis added.

If not terminating Plaintiff would have violated PRC law, Plaintiff's Title VII and ADEA claims are subject to dismissal under the statutes' foreign law provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As indicated above and in the Court's September 20, 2018 decision, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow courts to consider a broad spectrum of materials to determine an issue of foreign law, even when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Thus, the Court invited the parties in its earlier decision to submit materials they believe will aid the Court in interpreting PRC law. Having reviewed Plaintiff's and GM's submissions the Court cannot conclude at this time that it would have been a violation of PRC law to allow Plaintiff to continue working in China at GMCIC after he turned sixty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Article 21 of the Implementation Regulation for the Labor Contract Law of the People's Republic of China provides that an employee's labor contract terminates when the employee reaches the statutory retirement age, which is sixty years of age for male employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GM's Mot. Ex. 5(A), ECF No. 11-6 at Pg ID 109; GM's Reply Ex. 1, ECF No. 15-2 at Pg ID 265.) GM presents several decisions in which courts in China held that the employment contracts of the plaintiffs-employees, Chinese nationals, terminated upon their sixtieth birthdays. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GM's Supplement Exs. 2-8, ECF Nos. 24-2 to 24-8.) However, some of the same cases reflect that those individuals were not precluded by PRC law from working for their employer after turning sixty. Instead, the relationship became one of \"independent contractor.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409843,3617590\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/447/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 4-8, ECF Nos. 24-4 to 24-8.) One of the articles GM supplied to the Court,\n   <em>\n    2018 GTDT: Labour and Employment China\n   </em>\n   , similarly provides that \"[e]mployees ... are allowed to hire retirees using a labour service contract.\" (GM's Supp. Ex. 9 at 15, ECF No. 24-9 at Pg ID 762.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Courts in China appear to reach the same conclusion in cases where the worker-plaintiff is a foreigner, as reflected in another case GM submitted:\n   <em>\n    Immtsukenji v. Heifei Sanjiing Electronics Co. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Nov. 12, 2014 (Intermediate People's Court, Hefei City, Anhui Province) (China).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (GM's Suppl. Ex. 14, ECF No. 24-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In that case, Immtsukenji, a Japanese citizen, signed a contract with Hefei Sanjiing Electronics Co., Ltd. (\"Sanjiing Electronics\") on December 1, 2011, to work in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, ECF No. 24-14 at Pg ID 813.) Sanjiing Electronics stopped paying Immtsukenji's salary in November 2013 and terminated him on January 13, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Immtsukenji had turned sixty years old in January 2010, before he signed the work contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 814.) He filed suit to recover the salary he was not paid prior to his termination and alleging that he was wrongfully terminated under PRC law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The lower court found that the contract between the parties was \"\n   <em>\n    not against the law\n   </em>\n   \" but deemed it a \"service contract\" because Immtsukenji had turned sixty before its execution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, Pg ID 813-14, emphasis added.) The lower court stated: \"for work-related disputes between the parties, their relationship shall be treated as an independent contractor relationship, which is beyond the coverage of the\n   <em>\n    Employment Law of the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   or the\n   <em>\n    Employment Contract law of the People's Republic of China.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 814.) The court concluded that Sanjiing Electronics was liable for the salary it failed to pay Immtsukenji, but not damages for unlawful termination of his employment contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Intermediate People's Court affirmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, Pg ID 815-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This decision-as well as many of the other cases submitted to the Court-strongly suggest that it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have been \"against [PRC] law\" for GM and/or GMCIC to maintain a work relationship with Plaintiff after his sixtieth birthday. Whether that relationship would have been characterized as an employment or independent contractor arrangement under PRC law is of no relevance, as Plaintiff is not seeking here to obtain coverage under the\n   <em>\n    Employment Law of the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   or the\n   <em>\n    Employment Contract law of the People's Republic of China.\n   </em>\n   In other words, unlike\n   <em>\n    Immtsukenji\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff is not seeking to enforce the termination protections or benefits provided under PRC law. Instead, he is seeking protection under United States federal and state anti-discrimination laws. The Court will need to define the working relationship between the parties based on those statutes, not PRC law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   GMCIC's retirement policies and practices further suggest that GM and/or GMCIC would not have violated PRC law by retaining Plaintiff after he turned sixty. GMCIC's retirement policies, effective April 1, 2000, state: \"The company may, at its discretion, continue the employment of an employee on a year-to-year basis up to the age of 65....\" (Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 7, ECF No. 14-8 at Pg ID 207.) Plaintiff indicates that GMCIC in fact retained another employee to work in China until age 65. (Pl.'s Aff. 19, ECF No. 14-3 at Pg ID 178.) Further, in response to Plaintiff's EEOC charge, GM wrote: \"on the rare occasion that business needs require GMCIC to utilize the services of a former employee, then it enters into a year-to-year service provider contract (i.e., an independent contractor agreement) for those services.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 13 at 2, ECF No. 14-4 at Pg ID 228.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In short, GM has not shown that GM and/or GMCIC would have violated PRC law if Plaintiff was retained beyond his sixtieth birthday. Therefore, the Court concludes that the \"foreign law\" exception in Title VII and the ADEA do not mandate dismissal of Plaintiff's claims under those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

GM fails to demonstrate that Plaintiff's Title VII or ADEA claims are subject to dismissal under those statutes' foreign law provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, GM has not satisfied its burden of showing that China provides an alternative adequate forum to Plaintiff's chosen forum in which to litigate his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that GM's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 11) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   in that Count III of Plaintiff's Complaint, only, is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint reflecting this decision within fourteen (14) days of this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Plaintiff refers to this individual as \"Toblas\" Suenner in the Complaint; however, documentation submitted to the Court indicates that the correct name is \"Tobias.\" (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 4, ECF No. 14-5 at Pg ID 189).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The GM organizational charts Plaintiff submits reflect that Mr. Treme reports to John Quattrone, Senior Vice President, Global Human Resources for GM. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 5, ECF No. 14-6 at Pg ID 199.) Those charts reflect that Ms. Morgan reports to Tobias Suenner, GMCIC's Vice President for Vehicle Engineering, who in turn reports to Kenneth L. Kelzer, GM's Vice President of Global Vehicle Components and Subsystems in the United States. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Ex. 4, ECF No. 14-5 Pg ID 189-90.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court notes that, despite GM's assertion to the contrary, Plaintiff's Complaint does include some factual allegations supporting his control assertion, although he does not expressly connect those facts to the four relevant factors. Some of those facts are included here in Section II.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Court therefore is rejecting GM's argument as a basis for dismissal of Plaintiff's Title VII and ADEA claims that Plaintiff was employed by a foreign company not controlled by a United States company. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    GM's Br. in Supp. of Mot. at 8-11, ECF No. 11 at Pg ID 56-59.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    GM does not argue that the ELCRA limits its territorial reach. In fact, unlike \u00a7 1981, the ELCRA does not include restricting language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Plaintiff provides materials reflecting that there are no age restrictions for certain foreigners working in China and that specific provinces have extended the retirement age to sixty-five for certain workers. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 18, ECF No. 14-19 at Pg ID 248; Pl.'s Supp. Wang Aff., Ex. D, ECF No. 22-4 at Pg ID 429;\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517120\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/615/#p618\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Ex. E at 8, ECF No. 22-5 at Pg ID 444.) The Court located articles supporting the same conclusions.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Junlu Jiang and Xiaodan Xu,\n    <em>\n     Employment and Employee Benefits in China: Overview\n    </em>\n    , https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I0206eb7d1cb611e38578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?contextData=(sc.Default) &amp; transitionType=Default &amp; firstPage=true &amp; bhcp=1;\n    <em>\n     The Employment of \"Elderly\" Foreigners in China: Service or Employment?,\n    </em>\n    Lexology, Mar. 9, 2016, https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=26e9fb94-dd83-41c3-ab6b-88a216058081; Huang Yue,\n    <em>\n     Shanghai to Allow Expats Over 60 to Work\n    </em>\n    , CRIEnglish.com, Aug. 20, 2016, http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-08/21/content_26547297.htm; Alex Linder,\n    <em>\n     Expats Over 60 Years Old Can Now Work in Shanghai, Just So Long as They are Corporate Execs\n    </em>\n    , Shanghaiist, May 5, 2018, http://shanghaiist.com/2016/08/24/shanghai_elderly_foreign_experts. Nevertheless, because GM does not satisfy its burden of showing that PRC law mandated Plaintiff's retirement at age sixty, the Court does not find it necessary to decide at this time whether the statutory retirement age applies to foreigners working in China or if certain provinces in China have extended the retirement age for certain categories of workers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    As such, the Court need not determine, at least at this time, whether the terms \"independent contractor\" and \"employee\" have the same meaning under United States and PRC law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
