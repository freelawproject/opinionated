Allied marketed Forex investments to clients by guaranteeing them a certain rate of return, or interest, regardless of whether the trading resulted in a profit or loss to Allied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27, 85- 87, 96-97;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Gilliland RFAs at 11, 16; Wongkhiao RFAs at 12, 17; Allied RFAs at 44, 48.

Wongkhiao solicited customers to invest their money with Allied and conducted the majority of the Forex trades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 37- 38, 70-71, 83, 91;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Wongkhiao Plea (Wongkhiao conducted various trades with investors).

Gilliland's role in the company was to manage the information technology required to facilitate trading-he set up the servers and computers and created Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Office documents for use during trading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. On occasion, though not very often, Gilliland himself conducted trades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32, 70-72;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Gilliland RFAs at 28. In his deposition, Gilliland stated that he never solicited customers to invest in Allied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 132-34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83, 91. However, CFTC served Gilliland with the Gilliland RFAs, to which Gilliland failed to respond, despite having been served with them on two occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Gilliland RFAs; Allied RFAs. In the Gilliland RFAs, CFTC requested that Gilliland admit that he solicited customers to provide funds to Allied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gilliland RFAs at 10, 15, 18, 22, 30. Pursuant to Rule 36, \"[a] matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney.\" Rule 36(a)(3). Gilliland did not respond to or otherwise deny the requested admissions, therefore, the facts in the relevant request are deemed admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anheuser Busch, Inc. v.

The purpose of the Citibank accounts was to facilitate and hold funds for Forex trading,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43, and the accounts were funded entirely from investments from customers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44. Nevertheless, Allied also used the accounts to pay both its business expenses and the personal expenses of Gilliland and Wongkhiao.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49, 56, 76-79;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Gilliland RFAs at 29-30; Wongkhiao RFAs at 27, 30-31; Allied RFAs at 55; Wongkhiao Plea at 18; Gilliland Plea at 17. Indeed, both Wongkhiao and Gilliland possessed debit cards linked to one of Allied's Citibank accounts that both used to pay their personal expenses, such as a gym membership and luxury car rental fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 49, 56-57. Additionally, on occasion, Gilliland and Wongkhiao would write checks or transfer money from an Allied account to their personal accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54- 60, 63-64, 67-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 2012 and December 2014, Allied accepted funds from at least five individual investors: $ 1,150,000 from Cindy Maxwell (Maxwell), $ 100,000 from Kim Stanley (Stanley), $ 100,000 from Daniel Slowinski (Slowinski), $ 80,000 from Stevon Webster (Webster), and $ 130,000 from Lauren O'Bryan (O'Bryan).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 83-84, 86, 88-89, 91, 95-98, 100; Gilliland RFAs at 24-25; Wongkhiao RFAs at 26. Allied deposited approximately $ 1,161,000 of the $ 1,560,000 it received from customers, into its Forex trading account, but over time withdrew approximately $ 886,000 from that account to pay its business expenses and the personal expenses of Gilliland and Wongkhiao.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the course of its operations, Allied executed written investor agreements with certain investors including Maxwell and Stanley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-86, 88, 95-97.

Notably, neither Allied, nor Gilliland or Wongkhiao, ever informed the customers that their funds were to be used for anything other than Forex trading; no customer ever agreed to allow Allied, Gilliland, or Wongkhiao to use those funds for other purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 24-27, 77, 87-90; Gilliland RFAs at 29; Wongkhiao RFAs at 30; Wongkhiao Plea at 18, 21; Gilliland Plea at 17, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Allied did make several returns to the investors over its lifetime. From November\n   of 2012 through May of 2013, Allied remitted seven payments to Maxwell, each for $ 4,167, totaling $ 29,169, and represented to Maxwell that the payments constituted returns derived from its Forex trading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 87; Gilliland Plea at 20; Wongkhiao Plea at 21; Gilliland RFAs at 12-13; Wongkhiao RFAs at 13-14; Allied RFAs at 45.

CFTC introduced evidence of numerous misrepresentations made by Defendants to their customers and potential customers. Defendants tricked potential customers into thinking that Forex trading was a safe investment, going so far as to guarantee customers certain percentage returns in order to capture their funds. Defendants also told customers that they were experienced in Forex trading and had conducted exhaustive research into trading strategies. In fact, Defendant Wongkhiao showed at least one investor falsified documents that purported to show that Allied had experienced \"significant daily and monthly profits from forex trading.\" Wongkhiao Plea at 20; Gilliland Plea at 19. Finally, Defendants paid out funds to certain customers, and told those customers that the funds were profits from trading, when in reality, the funds were paid using new investments from customers in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants also deceptively omitted certain information in soliciting their customers. Defendants never informed any customer that the funds they were investing were being used to pay Allied's business expenses or the often lavish personal expenses of Defendants, including gym memberships and luxury car rentals, or that in fact, Defendants traded very little of the investments entrusted to Allied-depositing only $ 1,160,000 of the $ 1,560,000 invested with Allied, and withdrawing the majority of these funds to pay other expenses. Defendants also never informed their customers that Allied was consistently losing money trading. Finally, Defendants never informed their customers that neither Allied nor either of the Defendants was registered with CFTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, Defendants' use of invested funds to pay Allied's and Defendants' expenses, as well as to pay \"returns\" to other customers, when the invested funds were meant to be used only for trading, constitutes misappropriation.

The evidence demonstrates that Allied violated all three regulations. Allied did not operate its Forex pool as a legal entity separate from itself-rather, Defendants founded Allied as a limited liability company and under its name opened the Citibank trading account from which it operated the Forex trading pool.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition at 42-44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Wongkhiao Plea at 17; Gilliland Plea at 16.

However, as all three of these regulations place mandates on a CPO-in this case, Allied-and as CFTC does not seek entry of summary judgment against Allied, the Court must ask whether Defendants can be held liable for Allied's violations of the CEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Defendants jointly set up Allied's business form, and thus, could have exercised that control to create a pool separate from that of the CPO itself. Both Defendants also had sufficient contact with investors such that each Defendant could have directed those investors to send funds to the proper entity. Though Wongkhiao conducted most of the communications with Allied's investors, there is no evidence indicating that Gilliland did not also have the power to do so, and in fact, Gilliland had significant communications with Stanley regarding the return of her investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gilliland Plea at 20-21; Wongkhiao Plea at 21-22. Finally, both Defendants had the power to, and in fact did, control the commingling of funds. Defendants possessed debit cards linked to Allied's bank accounts and would withdraw funds from Allied's account to pay for personal expenses, sometimes paying those expenses directly from Allied's account, and sometimes depositing the funds into their personal bank accounts. Additionally, there is evidence that on occasion, Wongkhiao deposited funds that were directed to him personally into Allied's account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wongkhiao RFAs at 26-27.

Credit Bancorp, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148539\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/738/376/#p391\">\n    738 F.Supp.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). The penalties already imposed in the corresponding criminal case against Defendants, along with the permanent injunction the Court orders today, are sufficient to deter future illegal conduct. Thus, the Court will deny CFTC's request that the Court impose a monetary penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court has found that Defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions and the registration requirements of the CEA and its accompanying regulations, and are liable as controlling persons for Allied's violations of the regulations. Therefore, summary judgment is due to be entered against Defendants on Counts One, Two, Four, and Five of the Complaint. The Court will grant CFTC's request that the Court enter a permanent injunction, but will deny CFTC's request that the Court order restitution or a civil monetary penalty against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Remaining before the Court are CFTC's claims against Allied. As noted above, CFTC obtained the entry of a default against Allied, but the Court denied without prejudice a motion for default judgment because the claims against the individual Defendants remained unresolved. Thus, at this time, CFTC may file a renewed motion for default judgment. Alternatively, if CFTC is satisfied that the judgment ordered to be entered here accomplishes its purposes, it may so advise the Court and dismiss its claims against Allied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   1.
