The Port District states in its complaint: \"This is a civil action for damages caused by the continuing release of hazardous substances from property owned by NSG into the soil and groundwater of a number of neighboring parcels owned by the Port District.\" (ECF No. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6 1.) The Port District further alleges the following. North Shore Gas's South Plant MGP (Manufactured Gas Plant) in Waukegan operated from 1898 to 1927, and then again between 1935 and 1946. It was demolished in 1951. The South Plant MGP generated various byproducts and wastes, such as coal tar, ammonia, cyanide, ammonium sulfate, sulfur, wastewater sludges, ash, and tar/oil emulsions. These materials contain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and phenolic compounds, several of which are known or suspected carcinogens. North Shore Gas released hazardous substances from these byproducts and wastes onto the South Plant MGP parcel and further released and continues to release these hazardous substances onto adjacent and nearby parcels owned by the Port District and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   North Shore Gas conducted contaminant investigations and limited cleanup activities on its parcel from the early 1990s to around 2003. Most of the work was done under the Illinois Voluntary Site Remediation Program and did not address off-site property contamination. In 2003 or 2004, North Shore Gas removed some of the contaminated soils above the groundwater table from its own property only. It left in place the contamination in soil and groundwater located below the groundwater table on its property, and it did not install any barriers at its eastern property boundaries to prevent continuing releases of contamination onto the Port District's and other neighboring parcels. In 2006, North Shore Gas requested that the South Plant MGP parcel be included in the federal Superfund program. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") accepted the site into the Superfund Alternative program. The South Plant MGP Superfund Site (the \"Site\"), as defined by the EPA, covers more than twenty acres and includes several properties adjacent to the South Plant MGP parcel, among them eight parcels comprising more than thirteen acres that are owned by the Port District and located east of the South Plant MGP parcel. The Port District's parcels include a marina, a visitor center/administration building, a maintenance building, a marine service facility, landscaped open space and a public park, and asphalt-paved public parking lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the direction of the EPA, and pursuant to a 2007 Administrative Order on Consent under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), North Shore Gas conducted a Remedial Investigation (\"RI\") of the Site. The RI found that Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (\"DNAPL\") hazardous-substance contamination (made up of the substances described above) released as a result of North Shore Gas's operations was a continuing source of contamination to the soil and groundwater of nearby properties. In July 2015, the EPA issued a \"Record of Decision for Interim Action\" (the \"ROD\"), which established an interim remedy for the DNAPL contamination beneath the Site. The ROD provides for interim action-the\n   \"enhanced recovery of mobile DNAPL using a network of co-located horizontal groundwater injection and DNAPL recovery wells.\" (ECF No. 1-1 at 171.) Recovered DNAPL is to be collected and shipped off site for treatment and disposal. The ROD estimates that \"DNAPL recovery would occur over a[n] 8-year period before the mass and mobility is reduced to the extent practicable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194.) The work is projected to begin in 2020. The ROD states that once the work under the interim remedy is completed, the EPA will select a final remedy to address site groundwater and soil contaminants as well as potential soil vapor intrusion risks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182.) In September 2015, North Shore Gas and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent for Remedial Design under CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Port District says that it has never consented to, permitted, or approved of North Shore Gas's continuing contamination and impairment of the use of its property. In June 2017, a Master Plan for Redevelopment of the Port District's marina property was approved. The Port District alleges that the contamination of its property by North Shore Gas has damaged redevelopment efforts. It asserts state-law claims for negligence, trespass, public nuisance, and private nuisance, and it seeks compensatory and punitive damages. On November 1, 2018, North Shore Gas removed the action to this court. It asserts that federal-question jurisdiction exists under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the case \"arises under\" federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Port District moves to remand the action to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The presence or absence of federal-question jurisdiction is governed by the 'well-pleaded complaint rule,' which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Citadel Sec., LLC v.

(Def.'s Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. at 8.) In North Shore Gas's view, the Port District is essentially saying that by\n   <em>\n    complying\n   </em>\n   with the EPA's chosen remedy and the consent order, North Shore Gas is violating tort law. North Shore Gas further asserts that a trial on the Port District's claim would necessarily require a factfinder to consider the appropriateness of the EPA's interim remedy; whether North Shore Gas has breached any duties it may owe by implementing the remedy; whether the remedy interferes with the Port District's property rights; and whether North Shore Gas's implementation of the remedy rises to the level of willful and wanton conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court does not see it that way. Assuming that the Seventh Circuit would adopt other circuits' approach to\n   \"challenges\" to CERCLA cleanups in the context of \"substantial federal question\" jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Port District's suit does not constitute a \"challenge\" to the EPA's interim remedy such that its tort claims will require resolution of a substantial question of federal law. The Port District seeks the following relief: (1) compensatory damages for loss, impairment, and delay of use of its affected properties; (2) compensatory damages for increased costs of construction and other environmental and risk-management costs that it will incur in improving and building on the parcels affected by the contamination; (3) compensatory damages for permanent diminution in the value of its properties; and (4) punitive damages for the alleged willful and wanton nature of the contamination. (Compl. at 14, Prayer for Relief.) While the Port District in its complaint undoubtedly criticizes the EPA's chosen remedy as inadequate, it does not seek review of that remedy or to alter or add to its terms in any way; it does not seek to be involved in the implementation or supervision of the remedy; and it does not seek equitable or declaratory relief that would interfere with the selected remedial process (indeed, it does not seek\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   equitable or declaratory relief). The Port District seeks only financial compensation, and North Shore Gas fails to explain how that remedy would interfere with the work ordered by the EPA.

Although the Court has held that federal subject-matter jurisdiction does not exist here, the contours of the \"substantial federal question\" doctrine in the context of CERCLA cleanups are somewhat indistinct, and authority from this circuit is sparse. Because the Court is thus unable to conclude that North Shore Gas lacked a reasonable basis for removal or otherwise acted in bad faith, the Port District's request for attorneys' fees is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to remand this action [13] is granted as to remand and denied as to the request for attorneys' fees.

(Def.'s Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. at 11.) That conclusion does not follow. There is no request in the complaint, explicit or implicit, for injunctive relief. Even if there were such a request as to this claim, North Shore Gas fails to explain why the resolution of the issue would create a \"substantial\" federal question. The relief to which the Port District may be entitled if it prevails on its wholly state-law claim is a matter of state law, not federal law. And a potential determination of whether such relief would conflict with the terms of the interim remedy-the evaluation of an ordinary conflict-preemption defense-is something state courts are \"clearly competent to do.\"\n    <em>\n     Vorhees v.

July 5, 2007), the federal district court remanded the case to state court and rejected an argument that a substantial federal question was presented where the plaintiff brought state-law claims (including nuisance and trespass) to recover damages resulting from defendants' contamination of certain property, while a CERCLA cleanup was occurring. The court described the facts of\n    <em>\n     New Mexico\n    </em>\n    as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    Defendants also rely on a Tenth Circuit case,\n    <em>\n     New Mexico v.

This case is distinguishable.... There, the plaintiffs brought two complaints-one against private defendants under state law, and the other in federal court against the State of New Mexico. The state court action was removed to federal court. After a year of extensive discovery, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss its CERCLA claim as well as all the federal defendants, and also moved for remand. The district court granted the state plaintiffs' motion to dismiss their CERCLA claims and the federal defendants, but it denied their motion for remand. The court explained that \"the remaining claims inescapably must be defined in terms of the CERCLA remedy and the scope and extent of the ongoing CERCLA remediation,\" and that \"considerations of economy and convenience in a case over three years old weighed in favor of retaining jurisdiction over the state law claims.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804406\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1223/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    By this time, the plaintiffs had narrowed their claim for damages to those \"not recoverable under CERCLA for groundwater contamination,\" and by doing so, the \"core of the controversy\" between the parties had become the intended scope of CERCLA-mandated remedial efforts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804406\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1223/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804406\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1223/\">\n     at 1240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
