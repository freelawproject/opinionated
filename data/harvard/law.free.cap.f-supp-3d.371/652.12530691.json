As such, Malwarebytes argues that it satisfies the statutory requirements for immunity and PC Drivers cannot plead around the immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   PC Drivers raises four arguments in response. First, PC Drivers contends that the Complaint raises factual issues that preclude a ruling on whether Malwarebytes is immune from suit. In particular, PC Drivers contends that the viability of its claims cannot be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because of factual issues regarding (a) Malwarebytes' alleged misappropriation of page clicks from paid-for advertising and (b) publication of false and misleading statements about PC Drivers' Products. PC Drivers' Opp'n. at 6-7 (Dkt. No. 62 at 10-11). PC Drivers' argument might have force at the summary judgment stage, but at the motion to dismiss stage, PC Drivers' factual allegations are accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Moreover, several courts have resolved the applicability of CDA section 230(c)(2)(B) immunity at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holomaxx Techs. Corp. v.

Ill. 2008) (granting judgment on the pleadings based on section 230(c)(2) immunity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, PC Drivers contends that Malwarebytes is not entitled to blanket immunity from all tortious conduct. Specifically, PC Drivers contends that section 230(c)(2) immunity does not shield Malwarebytes from liability for \"stealing\" click advertising services paid for by PC Drivers and making false and disparaging statements about PC Drivers' Products. Dkt. No. 62 at 12. PC Drivers contends that these actions are \"not actions attendant to enabling or making available the technical means to restrict access to material,\" and therefore are not shielded by section 230(c)(2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830458\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/546/605/#p609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The alleged theft of click advertising services is described in the Complaint as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Malwarebytes is also profiting from the use of PC Drivers' Marks through by [sic] using the MALWAREBYTES free\n   version product to redirect clicks from the PC Drivers website to the Malwarebytes website. When a Malwarebytes free version software user opens a search engine in his own web browser and searches for DRIVER SUPPORT or ACTIVE OPTIMIZATION, PC Drivers' ads or website links bearing the Marks will prominently appear in the search engine results. However, instead of going directly to PC Drivers' official website when clicking these links, it redirects consumers to the Malwarebytes website for the purpose of executing a Malwarebytes sale. The result is that Malwarebytes obtains the benefits of a potential paying customer based on the acquisition costs paid by PC Drivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 22. These allegations describe conduct that falls within the scope of the statutory protection afforded by the CDA. The statutory protection is broad, applying to \"any action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). The phrase \"any action\" has only one qualifier for the immunity to apply: that the \"action\" is \"taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The alleged redirection in this case clearly is an action that enables or makes available the technical means to restrict access to material. The Complaint essentially alleges that Malwarebytes' software filters website domains for programs associated with PUPs. Compl. \u00b6 22. Malwarebytes performs this filtering when a user who has installed Malwarebytes' software navigates to driversupport.com or a PC Drivers advertisement. Dkt. No. 61-4. Malwarebytes identifies the domain driversupport.com as associated with a PUP and then directs the user to a Malwarebytes' page. Dkt. No. 61-5, 61-6. This page notifies the user that Malwarebytes blocked driversupport.com \"due to PUP.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also informers the user: \"Learn about PUP.

The statute does not contain qualifiers, conditions, or exceptions for \"actions\" that have the secondary effect of depriving PC Drivers of the benefits of the page-click advertising it purchased from a third party. Applying the plain language of section 230(c)(2)(B), Malwarebytes is entitled to immunity for the alleged classification of PC Drivers' software as a PUP and the redirection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The allegedly false and disparaging statements are found in a Malwarebytes' online forum post and consist of Malwarebytes' explanation for the basis of its classification of Driver Support as a PUP as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Malwarebytes has determined that Driver Support is a \"system optimizer.\" These so-called \"system optimizers\" use intentional false positives to convince users that their systems have problems. Then they try to sell you their software, claiming it would remove these problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Compl., Ex. 1. The post also includes a series of screenshots to show users what they would see if Driver Support was installed on their computer and instructions for downloading Malwarebytes and removing Driver Support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Malwarebytes' stated basis for classifying Driver Support as a PUP is not necessarily an \"action taken to enable or make available\" the technical means to restrict access to objectionable material. It is an explanation provided in Malwarebytes' forum for why Malwarebytes provides the\n   technical means-filtering software-to restrict Driver Support from users; Malwarebytes' stated explanation does not necessarily \"enable or make available\" that filtering software. PC Drivers also alleges that Malwarebytes' explanation is false and disparaging and made with malice, reckless disregard for the truth, ill will and with the intent to interfere with PC Drivers' economic interest. Compl. \u00b6 57. Accepting these allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of PC Drivers, it is premature at the pleading stage to make a definitive ruling on the applicability of the statutory immunity to Malwarebytes' allegedly false and disparaging statement in the forum post. Whether the alleged false and disparaging statement is sufficient to state a claim is addressed separately in the next section of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In contrast, the screenshots and instructions for removing Driver Support are \"actions\" taken to \"make available... the technical means to restrict access to\" objectionable material.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). Malwarebytes' filtering software is the \"the technical means to restrict access\" to objectional material. Providing instructions for the installation and use of the filtering software is an integral part of making the filtering software available to others. Therefore, Malwarebytes is immune from liability for providing the screenshots and instructions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, PC Drivers contends that Malwarebytes' conduct goes \"beyond\" merely enabling and making available to others the technical means to restrict access to material. PC Drivers' Opp'n. at 9. Specifically, PC Drivers contends that Malwarebytes blocks access to PC Drivers' website even for customers who have already paid for a PC Drivers' subscription; and discourages users from using PC Drivers' Products by prompting users to finalize quarantine of all PUPs with one click instead of allowing users to readily deselect individual webpages from quarantine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Ninth Circuit analyzed section 230 immunity as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   By providing its anti-malware software and malware definition update services, Kaspersky both enables and makes available the technical means to restrict access to malware. Users choose to purchase, install, and utilize the Kaspersky software. Regardless of whether Zango\n   is correct in its allegation that Kaspersky does not provide users of Kaspersky products a choice to override the security software and download and use Zango, there is no question that Kaspersky has \"made available\" for its users the technical means to restrict access to items that Kaspersky has defined as malware. Therefore, Kaspersky satisfies the requirements of subsection (B) so long as the blocked items are objectionable material under \u00a7 230(c)(2)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655472\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/1169/#p1173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655472\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/1169/#p1173\">\n    at 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This alleged promise is too indefinite to be actionable. Malwarebytes agreed to \"reconsider\" its decision to classify PC Drivers' Products as PUPs. That PC Drivers may have understood Malwarebytes' representation as a commitment to de-list the Products as PUPs (Compl. \u00b6 69) does not make it so. Malwarebytes' proffer to reconsider is no more definitive than \"promises to negotiate\" which courts have found insufficient as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Stolts v.

PC Drivers' Request for Leave to Add a Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   PC Drivers requests leave to amend the Complaint to add a claim under the Texas Theft Liability Act (\"TTLA\") which provides in pertinent part that a person commits \"theft of service\" when: \"having control over the disposition of services of\n   another to which the actor is not entitled, the actor intentionally or knowingly diverts the other's services to the actor's own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled to the services.\" Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 31.04(a). This proposed claim, however, is predicated on the same allegations of click advertising theft underlying claims that the court has found fall within the CDA's \"generous coverage\" of immunity. The proposed new claim would be futile and accordingly PC Drivers' request for leave to amend will be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sikhs for Justice, Inc. v.
