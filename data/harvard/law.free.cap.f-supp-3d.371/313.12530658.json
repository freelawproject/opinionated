If the moving party successfully carries this burden, the burden of production then shifts to the non-moving party to direct the Court's attention to something in the pleadings or other evidence in the record setting forth specific facts sufficient to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does indeed exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   If the dispositive issue is one on which the non-moving party will bear the burden of persuasion at trial, the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by either (1) submitting affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the non-movant's claim, or (2) affirmatively demonstrating that there is no evidence in the record to establish an essential element of the non-movant's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the movant fails to affirmatively show the absence of evidence in the record, its motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the non-moving party may defeat a motion for summary judgment by \"calling the Court's attention to supporting evidence already in the record that was overlooked or ignored by the moving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[U]nsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence.

Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court laid out the general requirements for plaintiffs, whether\n   seeking damages or injunctive relief, to establish standing under Article III of the Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To satisfy Article III's standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The only prong at issue in this case is the first prong, injury-in-fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief, unlike a plaintiff seeking damages, must establish more than the existence of a \"past wrong\" to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, a plaintiff must \"show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Title II of the ADA authorizes plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief against public entities generally,\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Title III of the ADA authorizes plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief against places of public accommodation operated by private entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has not addressed the injury-in-fact requirement under either title. The Fifth Circuit addressed the legal standard for establishing an injury-in-fact for a Title II ADA claim in\n   <em>\n    Frame v. City of Arlington.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than laying out a separate legal standard for analyzing the injury-in-fact prong of claims for injunctive relief under the ADA, the Fifth Circuit applied prior Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit caselaw regarding the injury-in-fact prong in general. Although\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   was a Title II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   case, it relies for its reasoning on Title III cases from other circuits without suggesting a different standard applies under Title II or Title III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, in this case, the Court relies on\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   to analyze Plaintiff's standing to seek injunctive relief under both Title II and Title III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff urges the Court not to rely solely on\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   but instead to follow the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp.\n   </em>\n   , which lays out a test for analyzing the injury-in-fact prong for injunctive claims specific to Title III of the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kreisler\n   </em>\n   court stated that standing under the ADA exists in cases in which \"(1) the plaintiff alleged past injury under the ADA; (2) it was reasonable to infer that the discriminatory treatment would continue; and (3) it was reasonable to infer, based on the past frequency of plaintiff's visits and the proximity of defendants' restaurants to plaintiff's home, that plaintiff intended to return to the subject location.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, the Supreme Court has not addressed the legal standard for plaintiffs to establish standing to seek injunctive relief against a public accommodation under Title II or Title III of the ADA, and the federal courts of appeal addressing the issue have adopted varying approaches. Some courts, including the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Kreisler\n   </em>\n   , apply an \"intent to return\" test, requiring plaintiffs to show they intend to return to the place of public accommodation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Others apply a \"deterrent effect\" test, which is a \"broader conception of injury\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   under which plaintiffs need only show they were deterred from visiting the public accommodation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still other courts apply a hybrid of the two approaches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit has not clearly adopted either test. The Fifth Circuit\n   has not cited\n   <em>\n    Kreisler\n   </em>\n   , and only one district court in the circuit has adopted the\n   <em>\n    Kreisler\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs were wheelchair users who alleged certain inaccessible sidewalks \"ma[d]e it dangerous, difficult, or impossible for them to travel to a variety of public and private establishments.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   They sought injunctive relief from the City of Arlington, Texas under Title II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City argued plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge sidewalks they had not personally encountered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Mere \"some day\" intentions to use a particular sidewalk, \"without any description of concrete plans,\" does not support standing. But \"imminence\" is an \"elastic concept\" that is broad enough to accommodate challenges to at least some sidewalks that a disabled person has not personally encountered. For example, a plaintiff may seek injunctive relief with respect to a soon-to-be-built sidewalk, as long as the plaintiff shows a sufficiently high degree of likelihood that he will be denied the benefits of that sidewalk once it is built. Similarly, a disabled individual need not engage in futile gestures before seeking an injunction; the individual must show only that an inaccessible sidewalk actually affects his activities in some concrete way. On remand, the district court will be able to apply established standing doctrine to weed out any hypothetical claims. At this point, however, the plaintiffs have alleged in detail how specific inaccessible sidewalks negatively affect their day-to-day lives by forcing them to take longer and more dangerous routes to their destinations. This is sufficient to support their right to sue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   court did not explicitly adopt either the \"deterrent effect\" test or the \"intent to return\" test. However, the Fifth Circuit cited with approval First Circuit and Ninth Circuit cases standing for the proposition that a showing of a deterrent effect is sufficient to establish standing to seek injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Frame\n   </em>\n   , district courts in the Fifth Circuit have generally adopted the \"deterrent effect\" test in Title III cases under the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Fifth Circuit has not clearly adopted either test, the Court analyzes whether Plaintiff has standing to seek injunctive relief under Title II and Title III of the ADA under both tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. \"Deterrent Effect\" Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At deposition, Plaintiff testified that she had bought two tickets for a concert at the Smoothie King Center, adjacent to the Superdome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   She intended to go to the concert with her daughter, and she was told over the phone the tickets\n   were for accessible seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified she chose not to go because she was \"fearful.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked to be more specific about what she feared would happen, she responded: \"The exact same thing that had happened with Guns N' Roses.
