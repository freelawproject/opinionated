HAMILTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Samsung Electronics America, Inc.'s (\"Samsung\") motion to compel arbitration came on for hearing before this court on February 27, 2019. Plaintiffs appeared through their counsel, Michael Woerner. Defendant appeared through its counsel, Michael McCarthy and Robert Herrington. Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART defendant's motion, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Lynette Pang, Timo Masalin, and Cindy Seminatore bring this putative false advertising and warranty class action against Samsung. Generally, plaintiffs allege that, contrary to Samsung's representations and advertising, the rear cameras on various Samsung smartphones-the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S7 Active, the Galaxy S8 and Note 8 (the \"devices\")-are not high quality because the lenses spontaneously shatter (the \"defect\"), rendering the camera all but useless. Plaintiffs' warranty claims allege that Samsung failed to honor its warranty by requiring consumers whose phone exhibited the alleged defect to pay for the repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Class Action Complaint (the \"SAC\"), which added plaintiff Cindy Seminatore as a named plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53, SAC. Seminatore was added as a named plaintiff because, unlike Pang and Masalin, Seminatore did not opt out of the Samsung arbitration agreement that accompanied her phone purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Other than that difference, Seminatore's experience was largely similar to Pang and Masalin's. On November 19, 2016, Seminatore purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 from T-Mobile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. On December 4, 2016, \"Seminatore discovered the cover of the rear-facing camera was shattered in the shape of a circle[,]\" even though \"the phone had merely been charging, undisturbed on her counter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49; Dkt. 62, Cindy Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. \"Upon discovering the shattered lens cover, [ ] Seminatore immediately took the phone to T-Mobile, which refused to repair or replace the device.\" SAC \u00b6 49; Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. T-Mobile directed Seminatore to contact Samsung and Seminatore\n   did so the next day, on December 5, 2016. Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; SAC \u00b6 50. During her phone call with Samsung support, \"Samsung's representative informed Seminatore that the device was 'in warranty' and directed [her] to mail [her] device to a Samsung repair center in Plano, Texas,\" which Seminatore did. Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; SAC \u00b6 50. On January 30, 2017, however, \"Samsung updated [Seminatore's] service ticket to indicate that the damage to the device was [ ] 'out of warranty.' \" Seminatore Decl. \u00b6 19; SAC \u00b6 51. Samsung informed Seminatore that the repair fee was $ 182.89 and that if she did not pay that fee, Samsung would dispose of the device. Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-22; SAC \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. Because Seminatore was not given an option to have the device returned unrepaired, she agreed to pay the repair fee. Seminatore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; SAC \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted, the Galaxy S7's packaging includes the following relevant features. The middle of the second to last paragraph on the back of the box states, in tiny text that contrasts badly with the black box, \"Device purchase subject to additional Samsung Terms and Conditions.\" Dkt. 59-2, McBeth Ex. B. Upon opening the box, the purchaser finds a textless black envelope under the device. McBeth Ex. I. Within the black envelope, there are four booklets. McBeth Ex. J. The second of which is issued by Samsung (as opposed to T-Mobile) and its cover states: \"Health &amp; Safety and Warranty Guide\" (the \"Guidebook\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As the cover of the Guidebook indicates, the Guidebook includes health and safety information, as well as information about Samsung's Limited Warranty.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C. The first page of the Guidebook states \"Please read this manual before operating your device and keep it for future reference. This document contains important terms and conditions with respect to your device. By using your device, you accept those terms and conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next page of the Guidebook discloses that the Guidebook contains a dispute resolution procedure and, in conjunction with the prior sentence, indicates that use of the phone subjects the user to that dispute resolution procedure (the \"Arbitration Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Specifically, the pages states, inter alia, \"\n   <strong>\n    Samsung Limited Warranty\n   </strong>\n   - This product is covered under the applicable Samsung Limited Warranty\n   <strong>\n    INCLUDING ITS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE and your right to opt out of arbitration within 30 calendar days of the first consumer purchase. You may opt out by either sending an email ... or by calling\n   </strong>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (also referring reader to the \" 'Dispute Resolution Procedure and Arbitration and Opt-Out' section of the Limited Warranty\"). The contents page, appearing on the seventh page of the Guidebook, also references Samsung's Arbitration Agreement and the Opt-Out policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-35 (Samsung's dispute resolution procedures).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the Arbitration Agreement, Samsung now moves to compel Seminatore to arbitrate all claims she asserts in this action, including warranty claims based on Samsung's Limited Warranty. Plaintiffs respond only that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable as to Seminatore because she never agreed to arbitrate. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that that Seminatore never accepted Samsung's offer to arbitrate as she did not know an offer was made because Samsung's offer was inconspicuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Samsung essentially raises two theories of contract formation to support its argument that Seminatore entered into a binding contract with Samsung to arbitrate her claims. First, Samsung argues that Seminatore should have known that the phone included an offer to contract because the offer was obvious. Second, Samsung argues that Seminatore invoked the warranty within 30 days of her purchase and in doing so accepted, or was on notice of, Samsung's offer, but nevertheless failed to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Samsung's Offer to Arbitrate Was Not Conspicuous.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court finds that Samsung's offer to arbitrate was not conspicuous to a reasonable consumer who purchased or used the Galaxy S7. That finding aligns with directly on point Ninth Circuit precedent and district court decisions considering nearly the exact same packaging and offer to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Norcia\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit confronted the question of whether the brochure in Samsung's Galaxy S4 box created a binding arbitration contract between Samsung and the consumer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/#p1283\">\n    845 F.3d at 1284-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Ninth Circuit found that notice lacking because the arbitration provision appeared in a brochure titled \"Product Safety &amp; Warranty Information\" and \"[a] reasonable person in [the plaintiff's] position would not be on notice that the brochure contained a freestanding obligation outside the scope of the warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/#p1283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/#p1283\">\n    at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Nor would a reasonable person understand that receiving the seller's warranty and failing to opt out of an arbitration provision contained within the warranty constituted assent to a provision requiring\n   arbitration of all claims against the seller, including claims not involving the warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dang v.

A Reasonable Consumer Who Invokes The Limited Warranty Would Be On Notice Of The Offer to Arbitrate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   All that said, the present facts are distinct from the above decisions in one important way: Seminatore invoked Samsung's Limited Warranty within the Arbitration Agreement's 30-day opt-out period. That fact, and her continued attempts to enforce that warranty in this action, puts this case outside the purview of\n   <em>\n    Norcia\n   </em>\n   . In fact, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that its decision might be different if the action involved a warranty dispute.\n   <em>\n    Norcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178699\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/1279/#p1283\">\n    845 F.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1288 n.3 (\"Samsung may be able to require Norcia to arbitrate claims arising out of the Standard Limited Warranty ... but we need not consider the enforceability of any such limitation because Norcia has not brought any warranty claims against Samsung.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the facts present here, the relevant question is whether a reasonable person in Seminatore's position-i.e., one who invoked the warranty within 30-days of purchase-would be on notice of Samsung's offer to arbitrate. Seminatore's invocation of Samsung's Limited Warranty makes this case meaningfully dissimilar to the decisions discussed above that essentially held that those plaintiffs had no reason\n   to open the guidebooks accompanying their devices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to those cases, here, Seminatore \"had [ ] fair notice that [s]he should read\" the Guidebook entitled \"Health &amp; Safety and Warranty Guide,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Samsung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524118\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1285/#p1297\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because she intended on making a warranty claim.

C. at 7. And the next page would have informed Seminatore that the Limited Warranty included an arbitration agreement with an opt-out period. Ex. C at 8. The Guidebook's contents page would have informed Seminatore of the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, Samsung's Arbitration Agreement is part of Samsung's Limited Warranty: \"This product is covered under the applicable Samsung Limited Warranty\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INCLUDING ITS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   [.]\" Ex.
