She asserts, however, that the .037 breath test vitiated any probable cause and therefore Defendant had an affirmative duty to release her. Plaintiff further contends that after obtaining her breath test result Trooper Buck abandoned his acting under the influence of alcohol theory and improperly pursued a drug-related DUI for which there was insufficient probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the time of Ms. Calhoun's arrest, Utah's DUI statute stated. in in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) A person may not operate or be in actual physical control of a vehicle within this state if the person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) has sufficient alcohol in the person's body that a subsequent chemical test shows that the person has a blood or breath alcohol concentration of .08 grams [of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood] or greater at the time of the test; [or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) is under the influence of alcohol, any drug, or the combined influence of alcohol and any drug to a degree that renders the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, although Ms. Calhoun's BAC of .037 precluded prosecution under subsection (1)(a) of the statute, it did not vitiate probable cause under subsection (1)(b). Subsection (1)(b) clearly allows for prosecution of a DUI with a BAC below .08, if an individual is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both \"to a degree that renders the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, there was sufficient indicia to support the conclusion that Ms. Calhoun was unable to safely operate her vehicle, and the totality of the circumstances gave Trooper Buck probable cause. While Trooper Buck did not observe any unsafe driving, Ms. Calhoun's glassy eyes, the odor of alcohol, admission to drinking, difficulties both physically and cognitively on the field sobriety tests, positive PBT and an admission to taking Xanax provided sufficient probable cause to establish that Plaintiff was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both, and incapable of safely operating a vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In turn, Trooper Buck was not required to believe Ms. Calhoun's qualifications,\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   or pick a specific theory under the statute. Indeed, at the time of arrest, a reasonable officer may not be able to determine whether the indicia of intoxication stem from the use of alcohol, drugs or both. As such, an arrest is considered lawful \"as long as probable cause exists for\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    b. No Claim For Malicious Prosecution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The existence of probable cause bars a Section 1983 claim for malicious prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Where .. no Fourth Amendment violation occurred because the officer possessed probable cause to arrest and charge the individual, 'the inquiry ends and the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, because Trooper Buck had probable cause, Ms. Calhoun's claim for malicious prosecution must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Duty To Release.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court further concludes that Trooper Buck had no affirmative duty to release Ms. Calhoun after obtaining her .037 breathalyzer result. The Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Titus v. Ahlm\n   </em>\n   is instructive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Titus\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was arrested, under\n   New Mexico law, for driving while intoxicated after running a red light, smelling of alcohol, admitting to drinking beer, performing poorly on at least two field sobriety tests and refusing a PBT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequent to his arrest, plaintiff provided a breath test of .02.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police officer then obtained a blood sample and, while the test results were pending, charged plaintiff with driving while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similar to the present case, after the charges were dismissed, plaintiff sued claiming probable cause was vitiated by his breath test result and the officer had an immediate duty to release him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In affirming the District Court's finding of probable cause, the Tenth Circuit concluded that under New Mexico statute, a driving while intoxicated prosecution could be brought for \" 'driving while impaired to the slightest degree' \" and therefore under a totality of the circumstances \"a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to charge [plaintiff].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further the court determined that the police officer had no duty to immediately release plaintiff because his \".02 did not exonerate him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This court fails to discern a meaningful distinction between the facts of this case and\n   <em>\n    Titus\n   </em>\n   . While Utah's statutory language differs from that of New Mexico, under Utah's statute, Ms. Calhoun's .037 BAC did not preclude a viable prosecution pursuant to subsection (1)(b). Specifically, subsection (1)(b) criminalizes the operation of a vehicle \"if the person is under the influence of alcohol influence of alcohol, any drug, or the combined influence of alcohol and any drug to a degree that renders the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle since.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, Trooper Buck had sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Plaintiff could not safely operate her vehicle, her .037 BAC did not vitiate probable cause and Defendant had no affirmative duty to release her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Qualified Immunity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Trooper Buck asserts he is entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiff's claims. \"Individual defendants named in a \u00a7 1983 action may raise a defense of qualified immunity, which shields public officials from damages actions unless their conduct was unreasonable in light of clearly established law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Once an individual defendant asserts qualified immunity, the plaintiff carries a two-part burden to show: (1) that the defendant's actions violated a federal constitutional or statutory right, and, if so, (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant's unlawful conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"This is a heavy burden. If the plaintiff fails to satisfy either part of the inquiry, the court must grant qualified immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Courts have discretion to determine \"which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed, Trooper Buck had probable cause and there was no violation of a federal or statutory right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, even assuming a violation, there was no clearly established right and therefore qualified immunity applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    a. No Violation of Clearly Established Law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In order to determine whether a right was clearly established, the court asks \"whether 'the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff may demonstrate that a constitutional right is clearly established by reference to cases from the Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit, or the weight of authority from other circuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has repeatedly counseled \"not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the dispositive question is \"whether the violative nature of\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   conduct is clearly established.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   The specificity needed for the clearly established law requirement is especially important in Fourth Amendment probable cause cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to probable cause, relevant law must show that the law is clearly established and \"beyond debate\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ms. Calhoun is unable to show that an affirmative duty to release \"was clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tenth Circuit has unambiguously held that there is no clearly established law imposing a duty to release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the duty is not recognized by \"the clearly established weight of authority of other courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, \"[t]he majority of courts have never imposed such a duty, much less under circumstances similar enough to make the contours of the right ... sufficiently clear that a reasonable officer [ ] would understand that [their] actions violated that right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Given the Tenth Circuit's clear pronouncement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court concludes that even if, as Calhoun argues, a .037 BAC eliminated probable cause to arrest and detain her for DUI, Buck was not on notice of a recognized duty to release her and is therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Amendment Would Be Futile\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ms. Calhoun argues she should be given an opportunity to amend her complaint.
