Frantz, the insured's designated contingent beneficiary. The matter is presently before the court on plaintiff's Motion To Deposit Policy Benefit Into The Court's Registry And For Interpleader Relief. (Doc. 13). For the reasons discussed below, the court grants plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Deposit Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's motion first seeks to deposit the policy benefit into the court's registry. In its discretion, a court may allow a party to deposit a sum of money with the court, \"whether or not that party claims any of it,\" if any part of the sought-after relief involves disposition of the sum of money. Fed. R. Civ. P. 67(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrick v.

Here, plaintiff disclaims any interest in the policy benefit but requests the court's determination as to which defendant's competing claims entitle them to the benefit. Neither defendant objects to plaintiff's deposit request. A filing construed to be an answer by defendant Barbara Frantz, in fact, affirmatively requests the policy's benefits \"be held by the court as trustee.\" (Doc. 12, at 1). Under the authority of Rule 67 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, therefore, the court grants plaintiff leave to deposit the policy benefit and any interest applicable under law with the court's registry.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   7 Charles Allen Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1716 (3d ed. 2001) (stating that \"the general equitable powers of the court permit it to receive a deposit,\" which \"can be made in accordance with Rule 67\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Interpleader Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff next requests interpleader relief under Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Granting that relief as requested would involve: (1) discharging plaintiff from further liability with respect to the at-issue policy; (2) dismissing plaintiff from this action; and (3) enjoining defendants (and those who may make claims by or through them) from continuing or bringing any action against plaintiff (or its representatives or agents) concerning the right to and distribution of the policy benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Interpleader ... under Rule 22... affords a party who fears being exposed to the vexation of defending multiple claims to a limited fund or property that is under his control a procedure to settle the controversy and satisfy his obligation in a single proceeding.\" 7 Wright et al., \u00a7 1704 (3d ed. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Millennium Multiple Employer Welfare Ben.

This action concerns a single fund-insured decedent Gary Patrick Frantz's life insurance policy benefit. Defendant Barbara Frantz and defendant Patrick C. Frantz adversely claim exclusive entitlement to the policy benefit. Defendant Barbara Frantz claims entitlement as the designated primary beneficiary. A jury, however, has convicted defendant Barbara Frantz of homicide in connection with the insured's death. Defendant Barbara Frantz disputes the jury's verdict, pursues an appeal to overturn her conviction, and insists that defendant Patrick C. Frantz instead bears responsibility for the insured's death. Defendant Patrick C. Frantz, however, denies any responsibility for the insured's death. He claims entitlement as the policy's designated contingent beneficiary, alleging not only that defendant Barbara Frantz's homicide conviction bars her from receiving the benefit but also that she renounced any right to the benefit under the terms of a separation agreement she and the decedent previously executed. Whatever the merit to these claims, they are not so lacking in substance-or so clear as to make proper distribution of the funds sufficiently certain-that plaintiff's concern over incorrect distribution or defending multiple claims is unjustified. Plaintiff's invocation of interpleader is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna U.S. Healthcare v.

Plaintiff, as just discussed, has properly filed this interpleader action. Plaintiff has conceded its liability to pay the policy benefit to the proper beneficiary, whoever the court determines that to be. And to facilitate proper payment, plaintiff has requested to deposit and the court has agreed to accept the policy benefit into its registry. Plaintiff, therefore, is a disinterested stakeholder entitled to interpleader relief. Upon deposit of the policy benefit and, as discussed more fully below, final resolution of plaintiff's claim to attorneys' fees, the court will issue an order: (1) discharging plaintiff from all further liability to defendants concerning Gary Patrick Frantz's life insurance policy; (2) dismissing plaintiff from this action; and (3) enjoining defendants from taking any further action against plaintiff regarding the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff also requests reasonable costs and attorneys' fees associated with filing this interpleader action. Defendant Patrick C. Frantz objects to assessing any costs or fees against the benefit. Each party provides authority from this district supporting its position. Plaintiff requests the court award it fees under the general rule that \"[w]here the stakeholder is disinterested, i.e., does not claim any right to the fund, concedes its liability in full, deposits the fund in court, seeks discharge, and does not appear to the court to be culpable, it is appropriate and equitable to allow fees and costs from the fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Irwin v.

Nov. 13, 1995)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A closer look at\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   is necessary to understand why the court will not follow its result in this case.\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   involved an insurer-initiated interpleader action concerning adverse claims to life insurance proceeds where the designated primary beneficiary was under investigation as a suspect in the insured's death.\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n    962 F.Supp. at 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In deciding not to award fees, the court touched on three reasons for its decision. First, it noted its belief that the insurer \"is not merely a bystander; rather, it is in the business of distributing proceeds from insurance policies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the court observed that the interpleader process benefits the insurer \"because they satisfy a self interest in not paying the wrong beneficiary by filing an interpleader\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n    1414-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Third, the court relied on the fact that the insurer's entitlement to the interpleader process \"presented a close question,\" presumably based on the fact the designated primary beneficiary was simply a suspect in the insured's murder and evidence of her involvement in the killing was\n   \"not nearly as much\" as in other like cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The justifications deemed persuasive in\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   are, in the exercise of this court's discretion, unpersuasive. Initially, the Tenth Circuit has never explicitly embraced the first (cost-of-business) and second (self-interest) rationales relied on by\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20675368\">\n    1995 WL 675368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.3 (explicitly reserving the question of whether to recognize the cost-of-business exception to the interpleader fee rule);\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021289986\">\n    2003 WL 21289986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (declining to apply the cost-of-business exception at it \"has not been established by the Tenth Circuit\"). Those rationales, moreover, arguably are present in every insurer-initiated interpleader case involving policy proceeds. That is, insurers are in the business of distributing proceeds and do-like all other stakeholders-benefit from the interpleader process. But this court disagrees with the proposition, implied by\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   , that being in the business of distributing proceeds\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   makes the insurer less than a mere bystander or makes the costs of distributing proceeds under a particular policy ordinary. Each case and its equities vary. Wright, Miller, and their\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   co-authors-cited by\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   make these very points in criticizing the cost-of-business and self-interest rationales that decisions like\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   accept:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Insofar as these [self-interest rationale] decisions rest on the notion that the stakeholder benefits by being discharged, they are wrongly decided because all stakeholders benefit by being able to use interpleader and that alone does not negate the equitable considerations supporting an award of attorney fees. Further, the cost-of-business rationale fails to recognize that other equitable concerns should be consulted in determination whether fees or costs are warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7 Wright et al., \u00a7 1719 (3d ed. 2001). As the criticism continues, these rationales overlook the important equitable concern to make the stakeholder whole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021289986\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    c.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20675368\">\n    1995 WL 675368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (\"The rationale for the award is that the plaintiff has, at its own expense, facilitated the efficient resolution of a dispute in which it has no interest (other than avoiding liability for an erroneous distribution of the stake), to the benefit of the competing claimants-the true disputants-who should be able to cover the typically minor expense involved out of the fund distributed to them.\"). Equity justifies awarding the stakeholder reasonable costs and fees, therefore, unless the stakeholder either \"contributed to the need for interpleader by acting in bad faith or by unduly delaying in seeking relief\" or prematurely sought interpleader \"without sufficient basis for believing that it will be subjected to multiple vexation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20675368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, defendants have made no claims that plaintiff has engaged in inequitable conduct of this type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Notwithstanding these criticisms,\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   ' third justification is absent here. In this case, plaintiff's entitlement to interpleader does not present the same \"close question\" that persuaded the\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   court to deny plaintiff requested fees. This case involves added complexity that makes interpleader more obviously appropriate. In\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   , no allegations implicated the contingent beneficiaries in the insured's death and the evidence implicating the primary beneficiary was \"not nearly as much\" as existed in other like cases.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002520\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/962/1412/#p1414\">\n    962 F.Supp. at 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, both defendants contend the other bears responsibility for the insured's death. And while defendant Barbara Frantz apparently has been found guilty with respect to the insured's death, that conviction is under appeal and challenged by proffered evidence implicating Patrick\n   C. Frantz. The potential that either or both of these claimants-not just one claimant, as in\n   <em>\n    Higgs\n   </em>\n   -bears any responsibility for the insured's death makes the risk of erroneous distribution and/or vexatious litigation greater than existed in\n   <em>\n    Higgs.
