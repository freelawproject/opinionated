Stat. (\"ORS\") \u00a7 652.140 against Defendant Applied Integrated Technologies, Inc. Defendant removed this case to federal court on the ground that it is preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"). Plaintiff now moves to remand this case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and Defendant moves to dismiss this claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Court denies Plaintiff's Motion to Remand and grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiff was hired by Defendant to fulfill its obligations under a contract to supply the federal government with security officers. Notice of Removal Ex. 1 (\"Compl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16, ECF 1-1. Plaintiff was subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"). Compl. \u00b6 12. The CBA contains provisions governing sick pay, vacation pay, and undisputed errors in payment. Redman Decl. Ex. A \u00a7\u00a7 7.4, 8.5, 10.1, 10.4, ECF 7-1. Section 8.5 provides that up to eighty hours of sick leave may carry over into the following year, but otherwise \"all unused hours will be paid at 100% of the earned amount within 30 days after the end of the government contract year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 8.5. Similarly, \"at the time of termination of employment,\" Defendant is to pay employees unpaid vacation hours that have vested but have not been used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 10.4. Section 7.4 of the CBA also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In case of an undisputed error on the part of the Company as to an employee's pay, proper adjustment will be made within one (1) week for undisputed\n   errors over $50 after the Company is provided a payroll discrepancy form identifying the error. All other such undisputed errors will be made on the next paycheck. Employees shall notify the Company of all errors on the part of the Company as to an employee's pay as soon as the error is noticed by the Employee. It is expressly agreed and understood that this Section 7.4 shall apply, without limitation, to those instances where an employee has separated from employment and believes that his/her final pay was incorrect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7.4.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Plaintiff alleges that more than 50 other individuals were similarly terminated by Defendant. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Plaintiff alleges Defendant violated state law when it made a late partial payment of final wages and failed to pay Plaintiff accrued sick and vacation leave until June 7, 2018, over a month after Plaintiff's employment ended. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-30. As a result of this conduct, Plaintiff seeks statutory penalty wages of not less than $6,432.00 pursuant to ORS 652.150.

Thus, the plaintiff's claims were to some degree preempted by \u00a7 301.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court then proceeded to find that the plaintiff could not pursue her claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agreement had a mandatory grievance procedure for \"problems arising in connection with the application or interpretation of the Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1035, 1036. It also \"authoriz[ed] grievances to be filed up to 45 days following the occurrence of the matter being grieved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1035. Because the plaintiff had not exhausted and could not exhaust her contractual remedies for those extra shifts worked outside of the 45-day period, she could not pursue any alleged violation of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1036-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the grievance and arbitration provision at issue provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A grievance shall mean a disagreement or dispute raised by the Union or an employee which arises during the term of this Agreement\n   <em>\n    concerning the application, meaning or interpretation of an express provision of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   or the employment relationship between the Company and employee, including but not limited to claims of unlawful employment discrimination as set forth in Article 5 of this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Article shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any grievance asserted by the Union or an employee.\n   <em>\n    Grievances involving the discharge or suspension of an employee will begin at Step Three.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Redman Decl. Ex. A \u00a7 13.1 (emphasis added). The CBA then describes a three-step grievance procedure. Step one requires the employee or Union representative to present the grievance in writing to their direct supervisor within ten days of its occurrence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the grievance is not settled or the supervisor does not respond within ten days, then at step two the employee or Union representative must submit a grievance in writing to Defendant's program manager within ten days of the date the supervisor responded or should have responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At step three-the first step for those grievances involving discharge or suspension-the Union must present the grievance to the Director of Human Resources within 10 calendar days of the response date of the program manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Failure to comply with the timing requirements laid out in steps one, two, and three results in waiver or settlement of the grievance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Where the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the Union may-within ten days after receipt of the response from the Director of Human Resources-seek binding arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 13.2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds that this case is subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the CBA. The grievance procedure is the exclusive remedy \"concerning the application, meaning or interpretation of an express provision of [the CBA].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The present case involves the application and interpretation of the undisputed error, vacation pay, and sick leave provisions of the CBA. Accordingly, Plaintiff is required to exhaust the grievance and arbitration remedies provided in the CBA in order to\n   maintain a \u00a7 301 claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DelCostello v.
