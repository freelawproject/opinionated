INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff's Second Amended Motion and Memorandum for Entry of Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. # 81) and Defendant Amazon.com, Inc.'s Unopposed Motion to File Documents Under Seal (Dkt. # 82). Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction maintains that Defendant is impermissibly using Plaintiff's trademark in various contexts to further Defendant's own business interests. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's actions are harming its own business and seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendant's numerous uses of its trademark. Defendant maintains that its use is in accordance with trademark law and that no preliminary injunction is warranted. Dkt. # 84. Having reviewed the record and\n   for the reasons below, the Court denies Plaintiff's Motion and grants, in part, Defendant's motion to seal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, The Comphy Company, markets itself as a luxury company, historically supplying its linens to luxury spas. Dkt. # 34 at \u00b6 2. Plaintiff's business has grown from a single employee to a successful industry leader in spa linens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-11. Over time, Plaintiff expanded into bedding and began selling to luxury hotels and spas and allowing those customers to sell bedding directly to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. To further capitalize on its new product and reputation, Plaintiff began marketing its bedding to high-end bed and breakfasts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Around this same time, Plaintiff began shipping directly to the public so that the hotels, spas, and bed and breakfasts selling its products did not have to carry inventory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Ultimately, Plaintiff decided to start retailing its products online through its own website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff does not market directly to customers and instead relies upon word of mouth and first-hand exposure at hotels, spas, and bed and breakfasts utilizing its products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-34. Defendant has solicited Plaintiff several times to sell its products on Defendant's platforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. To maintain the luxury branding of its products, Plaintiff has actively decided not to sell or market its products on Defendant's platforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In furtherance of its own business, Defendant purchases keyword advertising from various search engines so that members of the public searching for certain terms are offered to search on Defendant's website. Defendant has purchased keyword advertising utilizing keywords including COMPHY from several search engines. Dkt. # 1-12 (Google search for \"comphy sheets\" displaying Defendant's ad for \"Comfy Sheets Queen\"); Dkt. # 1-13 (Bing search results for \"comphy sheets\" displaying Defendant's ad for \"Shop Comfy Sheets\"); Dkt. # 97-2 (Yahoo! search results for \"comphy\" displaying Defendant's ad for \"Comphy Co. Sheets\"); Dkt. # 104-3 (Bing search for \"comphy co sheets\" displaying Defendant's ad for \"Comphy Company Sheets at Amazon\"). Some ads appear to take consumers to searches for related products on Defendants' website and some appear to take consumers to specific products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Within Defendant's website, individuals may also make searches. If \"comph\" is entered, Defendant's search bar provides possible searches including for \"comphy sheets,\" \"comphy company sheets,\" and \"comphysheets\" along with seven other unrelated possible searches. Dkt. # 1-7. Because Plaintiff's products are not available through Defendant, a search for \"comphy sheets\" provides products similar to Plaintiff's products, including bedding offered for sale by \"Comfy.\" Dkt. # 1-8. On one product advertised in response to a search for \"comphy sheets,\" Defendant includes a prominent tag providing: \"Amazon's Choice for 'comphy sheets.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. # 1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff believes that Defendant's actions are causing it to fall short of its yearly growth target and that Defendant's actions are harming its brand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 32. Plaintiff projected a significant increase in its online sales in 2018 but has not met that growth rate through May 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Plaintiff maintains that, if not granted the requested relief, it will suffer irreparable harm from Defendant's continued actions. Plaintiff requests that the Court enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendant from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Promoting, supporting or allowing third parties' unauthorized use of the COMPHY trademark (or highly similar marks such as COMFY) to promote bedding, sheets, pillows and related products not made by or under the authority of The Comphy Co.

But the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims on the record before the Court. The Court's task is made more difficult because Plaintiff challenges Defendant's use of COMPHY in several distinct contexts but does not address those situations separately. Rather, Plaintiff focuses on the sum of Defendant's uses which strengthens certain of Plaintiff's claims and dilutes others. On this record, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on its various claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendant challenges the validity of Plaintiff's trademark by (1) questioning whether the registered mark has application in this case because the case deals with products outside of those specified in the registration, and (2) questioning whether the stylized nature of the registered mark provides the same protection to bare uses of COMPHY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Registered Trademark Does Not Expand Beyond Specified Goods\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's registered mark is for: \"Linens and bedding\n   <em>\n    for health spas\n   </em>\n   , namely, towels, pads in the nature of bed pads, mattress pads and table pads, sheets, duvets, comforters, pillow cases, pillow shams, and table skirts.\" Dkt. # 103-1 at 2 (emphasis added). Defendant points out that Plaintiff seeks to protect the use of COMPHY in relation to consumer bedding-a good outside the scope of Plaintiff's registration. Dkt. # 84 at 9-10 (advancing argument and citing Plaintiff's testimony that spa bedding and consumer bedding are distinct). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v.

Conversely, Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Applied Info. Scis.

This case is more akin to\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss\n   </em>\n   as Plaintiff seeks to expand its registration mark into consumer bedding. The Ninth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Applied Infor Scis.

Protection Does Not Extend to Component Parts of Registered Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also challenges whether Plaintiff's registered mark for a stylized \"C\" with \"Comphy\" provides a presumption\n   of validity applying to bare uses of COMPHY. Dkt. # 84 at 10 (\"Any presumption that results from registration 'pertains to the whole mark ... rather than to any individual portion of the mark.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Igloo Prods. Corp. v.

Plaintiff does not address this challenge and the Court agrees with Defendant. Plaintiff's own testimony is that: \"From the beginning, all Comphy brand products have been marked with a tag that prominently included the word mark 'Comphy' and\n   <em>\n    associated logo.\n   </em>\n   \" Dkt. # 34 at \u00b6 14 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 34-8 (representations of the tags used). Nowhere does Plaintiff allege that Defendant is making use of the registered mark itself or any use of the stylized \"C\" that distinguishes Plaintiff's registered mark. Determining the protection afforded the bare use of COMPHY therefore requires analysis apart from the fact Plaintiff holds a registered trademark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Further, Plaintiff provides no authority indicating that its market standing and advertising expenditures in the hospitality sector likewise establishes the strength of its mark in the consumer retail market. As regards the consumer retail market, Plaintiff maintains social media accounts but otherwise does not market to consumers and relies on personal exposure and word of mouth. Dkt. # 34 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-34. Nothing indicates that Plaintiff's strength in the luxury hospitality sector translates to mark strength\n   in the consumer retail setting, outside of a limited number of consumers who experience Plaintiff's products in the luxury hospitality sector and later look for Plaintiff's products in the commercial market.

Strength of the Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The confusion analysis brings the Court back to considering the strength of COMPHY. There are few points to add to the Court's earlier consideration. In this context, the strength of the mark is essentially an analog for brand knowledge. For the consuming public to be confused by Defendant's uses of COMPHY, the consuming public must know that COMPHY specifies Plaintiff's goods. As discussed above, the Court does not view Plaintiff's use of COMPHY as an overly strong mark and Plaintiff offers nothing more than unsubstantiated conclusions to the contrary. Dkt. # 81 at 9-10. But in this case, the strength of mark factor has increased importance. Plaintiff's arguments are in large dependent on the assumption that the average retail customer is searching for Plaintiff's goods anytime they search COMPHY. Defendants attack this point on two bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, Defendant points out that COMPHY is a common misspelling of \"comfy\" and that within reviews on its site, COMPHY is used in reference to bedding only nine-percent of the time and used in reference to Plaintiff's goods only slightly more than one-percent of the time. Dkt. # 84 at 11. The Court agrees that use of COMPHY as a search term does not necessarily indicate an intent to search for Plaintiff's\n   products. This is true even in the more limited situation where COMPHY is used in reference to bedding.\n   <em>\n    C.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Network Automation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200180\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1137/#p1149\">\n    638 F.3d at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"consumers searching for the term are presumably looking for its specific product, and not a category of goods\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Defendant provides the results of a study suggesting that consumers are not particularly familiar with Plaintiff's brand such that they associate COMPHY with Plaintiff's products. Dkt. # 84 at 12-14. Specifically, Defendant had an expert conduct a survey which determined that thirteen-percent of consumers regarded COMPHY as referring to a particular source for bedding, but that more than twelve-percent of those consumers also regarded \"comfort\"-a non-existent company also presented-as also referring to a particular source for bedding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200180\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1137/#p1149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff attacks the utility of Defendant's study on several grounds but does not present countervailing evidence.

Proximity of the Goods and Similarity of the Marks\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   These factors likely weigh in favor of Plaintiff's potential success. Plaintiff points primarily to Defendant's use of COMPHY and COMPHY COMPANY to sell bedding. Dkt. # 81 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further points out that \"such '[a]ural and semantic similarities increase the likelihood of consumer confusion.\" Dkt. # 81 at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pom Wonderful Ltd.

The Court agrees, but still finds the strength of the mark to be a highly relevant factor in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Consider four scenarios:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1) If Defendant uses COMFY to sell \"Comfy Sheets\" to a customer who intends to buy \"Comfy Sheets\" and has independently chosen to shop on Defendant's site, there is no confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   2) If Defendant uses COMPHY to sell \"Comfy Sheets\" to a customer who intends to merely buy comfortable sheets and has independently chosen to shop on Defendant's site, there is no confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   3) If Defendant uses COMPHY to sell \"Comfy Sheets\" to a customer who intends to buy \"Comphy Sheets\" and has independently chosen to shop on Defendant's site, there may or may not be confusion. Such a customer may have intended to buy \"Comphy Sheets\" and elected instead to buy \"Comfy Sheets\" because Defendant-the retailer the customer chose-only sold \"Comfy Sheets.\" On the other hand, the customer may have intended to buy \"Comphy Sheets,\" seen \"Comfy Sheets\" available, and bought \"Comfy Sheets\" intending to receive \"Comphy Sheets.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   4) If Defendant uses COMPHY to advertise \"Comfy Sheets\" to a customer who intends to buy \"Comphy Sheets,\" knows that \"Comfy Sheets\" are not the same, and departs Defendant's website to find \"Comphy Sheets\" elsewhere, there is no confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Only where the customer knows that \"Comphy Sheets\" are Plaintiff's sheets is there a possibility of actual confusion. And, the Court can only determine whether a customer knows of Plaintiff's sheets based upon the strength of the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Actual Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff's strongest argument regards instances of actual confusion. Dkt. # 81 at 11-13. Plaintiff points to three main indices of actual confusion. First, Plaintiff relies on its direct contact with consumers through phone and email. Dkt. # 40. Second, Plaintiff relies on reviews from Defendant's website referencing Plaintiff. Dkt. # 41. Third, Plaintiff relies on the Declaration of Michael Shinn, who has extensive experience shopping with Defendant, detailing his experience intending to purchase Plaintiff's sheets, ending up on Defendant's website, buying \"Comfy Sheets,\" realizing the mistake when the sheets arrived, and returning the Comfy Sheets. Dkt. # 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There is no question that Plaintiff presents evidence of actual confusion that is often compelling, including written reviews by verified purchasers. Defendant has little retort for the fact other than to point out that the evidence is only that a small percentage of purchasers indicate they were confused. Dkt. # 84 at 14. Defendant argues that \"trademark laws tolerate 'a certain degree of confusion on the part of consumers,' especially where 'an originally descriptive term was selected to be used as a mark.' ...

While true, Plaintiff fails to equally appreciate that irreparable harm is not established by platitudes that do not establish \"whether 'irreparable injury is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   in the absence of an injunction' ... [or] whether legal remedies, such as money damages, are inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727074\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1239/#p1247\">\n    736 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Winter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis in original). Here, Plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that irreparable harm is likely to occur in the absence of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff presents two main theories of irreparable harm. First, Plaintiff argues that, through the first half of the year, its online sales are falling short of a growth estimate made before the year. Dkt. # 34 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Plaintiff anticipated that its online sales would grow by 34%, but as of the middle of 2018, Plaintiff was only seeing 24.2% growth in its online sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's actions mean Plaintiff \"loses control over its trademarks, reputation, and goodwill.\" Dkt. # 81 at 18. Plaintiff argues that customers are left believing that it sells its\n   products on Defendant's platforms and believing that the inferior products they receive are Plaintiff's. The Court is not persuaded that either are irreparable harms, that an injunction would prevent the harms, or that final remedies are inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As pertains to Plaintiff's growth target, Defendant aptly questions whether failing to meet an ambitious growth rate can constitute irreparable harm. Dkt. # 84 at 21. The Court agrees and further finds that Plaintiff has not adequately tied its decreased sales to Defendant's actions. Defendant's actions could possibly be the sole cause for the reduction in Plaintiff's anticipated sales and an injunction could possibly result in an uptick in sales. But it may not. Indeed, Plaintiff only conveys its\n   <em>\n    belief\n   </em>\n   that it would not fall short of its growth target in the absence of Defendant's actions. Dkt. # 81 at 17-20. Lastly, and as Defendant points out, Plaintiff does not demonstrate why money damages are inadequate to remedy a mainly financial harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As pertains to Plaintiff's trademarks, reputation, and goodwill, the Court finds that Plaintiff merely asks this Court to presume that irreparable harm is imminent. But misuse of a trademark no longer results in a presumption of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727074\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1239/#p1247\">\n    736 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evidence of customer confusion does not necessarily imply irreparable harm). Plaintiff presents evidence of consumer confusion and dissatisfaction. Evidence of consumer confusion alone goes primarily to Plaintiff's likelihood of success.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727074\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1239/#p1247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When combined with consumer dissatisfaction that may be attributed to Plaintiff's brand, the harm is cognizable but still must be presumed on the record before the Court. Further, Plaintiff does not explain why final remedies cannot adequately remedy any harm to Plaintiff's trademarks, reputation, and goodwill. Indeed, this case appears quite distinct from prior cases where interaction with confused consumers cannot be remedied because those consumers are unknown to the parties. Here, there seems to be a much higher chance that, if liable, Defendant could contact almost every purchaser of the allegedly inferior products and seek to repair any damage that may have been done to Plaintiff's brand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Court Need Not Consider the Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not established a likelihood of success on the merits or a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, the Court does not find it necessary to address the balance of equities or whether a preliminary injunction serves the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Defendant's Motion to File Documents Under Seal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendant has also filed an Unopposed Motion to File Documents Under Seal. Dkt. # 82. Defendant seeks to file its response and certain exhibits under seal to protect Defendant's confidential business material.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727074\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1239/#p1247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To minimize the material filed under seal, Defendant has filed redacted versions of the documents. Dkts. # 87-# 89. Defendant's Motion notes that some information filed under seal was done so at the request of Plaintiff and takes no position on the merits of maintaining the material under seal. Dkt. # 82 at 4. Plaintiff, in conference with Defendant, would not withdraw its confidential designation but has failed to respond in support of maintaining its confidential material under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"There is a strong presumption of public access to the court's files.\" Local Civil Rule 5(g). The party seeking to seal a judicial record must overcome the strong presumption of public access by\n   establishing a \"compelling reason\" justifying sealing.\n   <em>\n    Kamakana v.

Defendant has complied with the requirements of Local Civil Rule 5(g), has provided a factual basis supporting its confidential designation, and has limited the amount of material filed under seal. Dkts. # 82 and # 83. Further, the material filed under seal is only tangentially related to Plaintiff's Motion and does not significantly impact the public's interest in and access to judicial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not met its burden. Local Civil Rule 5(g)(3) specifically provides that Defendant need not justify the sealing of Plaintiff's records, but that \"the party who designated the document confidential must satisfy [the relevant standards] in its response to the motion to seal or in a stipulated motion.\" Plaintiff's failure to respond leaves the Court with no factual basis for maintaining Plaintiff's allegedly confidential material under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This is not an easy decision. Many of Defendant's actions toe exceedingly narrow legal and equitable lines. But, on the record presented by Plaintiff, there are simply too many pitfalls for the Court to map an equitable course.

Dkt. # 84 at 6. Plaintiff argues that a preliminary injunction is warranted to assure that Defendant does not resume this activity during the pendency of this case. Dkt. # 95 at 1 n.2. The Court believes that Defendant will continue to act in the manner represented to the Court. Regardless, Defendant does not stipulate to a preliminary injunction in this regard and Plaintiff must still meet the standards applicable to the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    To the extent the Ninth Circuit still applies a sliding scale test,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alliance for the Wild Rockies v.
