He alleges that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and his rights under the 14th, 1st, and 4th Amendments were violated. None of his arguments has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Pillault first argues that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated, as well as his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury of his peers, because: (1) he had no attorney when his home was searched, (2) his public defender failed to visit him, (3) he was misled by his attorney, (4) he pled guilty based on his attorney's bad advice, (5) he is actually innocent, (6) his accuser would not testify against him, and (7) his attorney ineffectively cross-examined witnesses during sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   He next argues that his Fourteenth amendment right to due process was violated because arresting officers coerced him into signing away his right to counsel and be interviewed and because defense counsel advised him to plead guilty, resulting in a feeling that he had no defense, and no one was defending his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Third, Mr. Pillault argues that his First Amendment right to freedom of speech was violated because only his mother or parental figure possessed the authority to censor his expressive activities on the internet, and his threatened acts of violence were protected under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, Mr. Pillault argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search of his home at the time of his arrest - and because he was denied an interview for a determination of the facts\n   prior to his arrest and the search of his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 4, 2012, Joshua Pillault, while playing the online multiplayer game \"RuneScape\" and using the display name \"PaulGilbert (Merlan91),\" threatened to use firearms, pipe bombs, and Molotov cocktails to recreate the Columbine massacre at Oxford High School in Oxford, Mississippi (ROA.15-17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pillault told other players that he planned to commit suicide, but it would be a waste to just kill himself, and that he had to kill other people first (ROA.15). He stated that he needed to get \"at least two guns,\" and \"backup clips, mopolotov(sic) cocktails, [and] pipe bombs\" all of which he was going to use to \"level oxford hish (sic) school\" (ROA.16). Pillault further stated, \"If I have anything to say about it, that school is going to be gravel\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He went on to state, \"look for the last name Pillault on the news 4-20-13..... because 4-20-13 is the anniversary of Columbine\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pillault explained that he was consumed by the Columbine Massacre, stating multiple times, \"We'll never forget: The Columbine Massacre....Ask me anything about the massacre. I know it all\" (ROA.17). Pillault continued his threats, stating, \"I can't wait to blow brains out of skulls,\" and \"the world is going to know my wrath god dammit\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   These same threats had been communicated to two of Pillault's former girlfriends. One of these girlfriends, Jane Doe\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , was with him when he made these specific threats on \"RuneScape\" (ROA.281). Doe testified that while Pillault was intoxicated at the creation of these threats, Pillault discussed and planned to carry out the threats when both sober and intoxicated (ROA.281-282).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Another former girlfriend, Susan Roe\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , testified that Pillault had researched at length how to make bombs (ROA.253). Roe drove Pillault to a Home Depot store where he obtained a piece of copper pipe, which he told Roe could be used to make a pipe bomb (ROA.253). Later, Pillault told her that he tested the pipe bomb and it worked. (ROA.254). Pillault had told Roe to stay home from school on April 20, 2013, the anniversary of Columbine (Roe testified she later discovered April 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   would be a Saturday) (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Doe stated that Pillault was saving money to have someone buy him a gun, and even went to Wal-Mart to look at guns (ROA.282). Doe added that Pillault attempted to make Molotov cocktails out of empty glass Sprite bottles, which did not work properly when tested (ROA. 283).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Both Doe and Roe testified that Pillault had started making plans outside of just drawings and talking. Roe testified that Pillault created plans for the school shooting in a journal (ROA.254). Doe also testified that Pillault devised multiple plans to execute the school shooting. One plan was to break through large plate glass windows at the high school cafeteria, deploy either pipe bombs or smoke bombs, and proceed through the school, spraying bullets as he\n   went. Another plan was to enter near the high school's office entrance, and try to begin the attack by shooting the school principal in the head (ROA.282). Roe said she did not go to the authorities because Pillault told her if she did, he would kill her and her family (ROA.255).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both Doe and Roe testified that Pillault was obsessed with Columbine and admired the two shooters (ROA.251-252, 284). Doe testified that Pillault told her that he believed that school shootings were sometimes moral and necessary to achieve justice (ROA.252).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 4, 2012, the Oxford Police Department received two phone calls alerting them to the threats against Oxford High School made on the \"RuneScape\" game (ROA.12). The first call came from a person in Virginia who had been playing \"RuneScape\" at the time and saw the threats being made. The second call came from Jagex Ltd, the London based company that operates \"RuneScape\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jagex provided account information and the messages that contained the threats to the Oxford Police Department (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Internet Protocol (IP) address from which the threats originated, which was provided by Jagex Ltd, was registered to a computer owned by Stacey Pillault, Pillault's mother, and which was located at a residence on Combs St., in Oxford, Mississippi (ROA.12,15). The user account for Internet service was also registered to Stacey Pillault at the same address (ROA.15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pillault, who had dropped out of high school and had over 20 disciplinary actions on his school record, was known by Officer Harper Thomas, the Oxford High School resource officer (ROA.473, 259). Officer Thomas told the Oxford Police Department that he was concerned for the safety of the Oxford High School students and that they should take these threats seriously because Pillault was a person who had \"very impulsive tendencies, a lot of anger problems...a lot of outbursts and just a lot of anger\" (ROA.259-260). On October 5, 2012, Officer Thomas was sent to find Pillault. Extra security was put in place for the Oxford High School football game that night (ROA.515).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 8, 2012, the FBI obtained an arrest warrant for Pillault (ROA.18). At the same time, a court authorized search warrant was issued for any electronic device that connected to the internet at his residence (ROA.35). Pillault was arrested later that day at his residence (ROA.18). Pillault admitted to police that he had been playing \"RuneScape\" on October 4, 2012, under the display name \"PaulGilbert(merlan91)\" (ROA.515). When the police read the threats to him, Pillault admitted that he probably wrote them but did not remember them because he was drunk (ROA.104). Pillault also admitted to police that he had attempted to download the controversial online game \"Super Columbine Massacre RPG,\" in which players assume the roles of the Columbine shooters and act out the massacre. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the same time as the arrest, the FBI also executed the search and seizure warrant (ROA.37). The FBI seized four laptop computers and two cellular telephones from the residence, including the computer Pillault used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the FBI computer examiner, who testified at the sentencing hearing, on Pillault's computer he found a folder named \"4chan\" (ROA.515). The \"4chan\" folder contained a folder named \"columbine\" and a folder named \"serialkiller,\" both of which contained pictures related to the Columbine shooting and the two Columbine shooters, along with other famous serial killers (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"4chan\" directory also contained files with instructions on how to make \"DIY Thermite,\" \"Carbon Tet\" pipe bombs, and how to use a bicycle to ignite a blasting\n   cap (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pillault had also conducted the following Google searches \"pipe bomb\"; \"jolly-rogers cookbook\"; \"how to make bomb explodes[sic]\"; \"anarchistcookbook\"; and \"timothy mcveigh\" (ROA.516). Pillault also conducted the following Youtube searches: \"tennis ball bomb\"; \"pipe bomb\"; and \"Columbine 'shooting' and 'footage' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pillault also made the following Wikipedia searches: \"assault rifle\"; \"columbine massacre\"; and \"bomb-making-instructions-on-the-internet\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 17, 2012, a psychiatric examination of Pillault, to be done by a local forensic psychologist, was ordered by the court to determine whether Pillault was competent to stand trial and whether he would be a danger to himself or others if released from prison. Dr. Cauthern, the psychologist who examined Pillault, found that while very intelligent, he was a \"troubled young man\" (ROA.364). The psychologist noted that Pillault had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as well as cannabis and alcohol abuse (ROA.365). Cauthern concluded that Pillault was competent to stand trial (ROA.364). Also, Dr. Cauthern concluded that Pillault was suffering from a major psychiatric disorder and did not understand the seriousness by which the law views threats over the Internet, yet still concluded that Pillault was not a danger to himself or others (ROA.365).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 25, 2012, Pillault was charged in a two-count Indictment. Count One alleged that he knowingly transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce a communication containing a threat to injure the person of another in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Count Two alleged that Pillault knowingly and willfully made a threat to kill and injure individuals and unlawfully damage and destroy buildings and other real and personal property by means of fire and explosives, the threat being communicated through an instrument of interstate and foreign commerce in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20844\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (ROA.50-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 20, 2013, Pillault and the United States reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to Count Two of the indictment, which carried maximum possible penalties of 10 years imprisonment, a $ 250,000 fine, 3 years supervised release, and a special assessment of $ 100 (ROA. 164-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following Pillault's guilty plea, the United States Probation Service (\"Probation\") completed a Presentence Investigation Report assigning a total offense level of 15. The probation officer used the 2012 Sentencing Guidelines Manual and, applying Section 2A6.1(a)(1) with a base offense level of 12, adding 6 points for conduct evidencing intent to carry out such threat under specific offense characteristic 2A6.1(b)(1), arrived at the initial base offense level of 18 (ROA.517, PSR, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27). Probation reduced the offense level by 3 points for Pillault's acceptance of responsibility under sections 3E1.1(a) and (b) (ROA.518, PSR \u00b6\u00b6 33-34). Pillault was assigned a criminal history category of I, based on a Possession of Marijuana conviction in 2011 (ROA.518-519, PSR, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Based upon a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of I, Pillault's Sentencing Guideline incarceration range was 18 to 24 months (ROA.522, PSR, \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While held in custody, Pillault wrote and illustrated pages of personal notes and drawings. These notes and drawings were seized by jail officials after a cell mate warned government officials of their existence (ROA.366). While the notes and drawings consisted mainly of innocent drawings and song lyrics, there were a sizeable number of disturbing drawings and notes. The drawings depict guns, heads exploding after being shot, a person\n   holding a pipe bomb and gun, a person holding a shotgun, a person with an arrow through his head, a person committing suicide in a jail cell, and other violent images (ROA.369). The notes describe in graphic detail the rape, torture, and murder of women and how the women deserved the treatment. For example, one read: \"So to the girls in this song, who feel like they were done wrong ... Fuck you stupid hoes, You deserved it all along\" (ROA.369, 373, 378, 387).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Many of the threats and comments appear to be directed at his ex-girlfriend Jane Doe (ROA.369, 373, 387-88, 404). For example, he wrote: \"So listen up, bitch. Here's your warning, stay back\" and \"Then I'm coming for you, you can't hide I swear. I'll cut that neck open til you're gurgling for air\" (ROA.404).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There are also writings about a dream in which one of the Columbine shooters gave Pillault his weapon, a Tec. 9 semi-automatic nine millimeter handgun (ROA.381). Pillault described killing \"fucking teachers and spraying everyone\" (ROA.381). Pillault wrote that he dreamt of murder every once in a while, \"it makes me smile...that type of power would drive you wild\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pillault continued, from the point of view of Eric Harris: \"I made Jesus raise his hands and pray to be saved. Danger to mixed company, shoot everyone in front of me... Their bodies slumping see... Gun to a bitch's dome and give her a choice. Take a clip inside the lip, bitch, or swallow my boys... Telling me I'll go to prison if I try to murder ya. Fuck that! I'd rather slit both these wrists, stick my knife in my spinal cord and give it a twist\" (ROA.407).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The District Court, desiring more information as to the mental condition of Pillault prior to sentencing, ordered a psychiatric/psychological examination of Pillault to be conducted by the United States Bureau of Prisons (ROA.167-68). The evaluation was completed by Dr. Heather Ross. Dr. Ross found that Pillault had been abusing alcohol and drugs since he was 14 years old (ROA.222-223). A typical day of drug and alcohol use for Pillault started with smoking two \"bowls\" of marijuana and drinking nearly half a fifth of vodka when he woke up (ROA.225). His girlfriend would come over later in the day and they would finish the fifth of vodka and smoke three to four more \"bowls\" of marijuana together (Id). Dr. Ross found that Pillault had a focus on death and suicide (ROA.227) and at times fantasized about the Columbine School massacre (ROA.230).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dr. Ross's clinical opinion regarding Pillault was that if he continued to abuse substances his risk for future dangerousness would be moderate to high, but his risk of dangerousness would be significantly reduced if he could remain sober (ROA.239). \"Dangerousness\" was considered to be any act of violence, not necessarily a school shooting (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Prior to and at the sentencing hearing, held on March 6, 2014, Pillault objected to the 6-level increase in his offense level for conduct evidencing intent to carry out such a threat (ROA.320-321). At the sentencing hearing both Doe and Roe testified to the conduct they witnessed, such as the detailed planning, testing pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails, and Pillault's plan to save money to purchase a gun (ROA.249-56, 279-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Pillault testified and denied all of the allegations made by Roe and Doe (ROA.292-307). Pillault testified that the threats were nothing more than \"trolling,\" and that the grotesque pictures and rap lyrics were nothing more than jokes and doodles he made while \"high\" in custody (ROA.297-298, 308-309).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court found the testimony of Doe and Roe more credible than Pillault's and overruled Pillault's objection to the 6-level enhancement under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(1), finding that Pillault had taken steps to carry out the threat (ROA.320-321).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court imposed a sentence of 72 months incarceration (ROA.328), varying from the Sentencing Guidelines out of the need to protect the public from Pillault (ROA.327). Pillault objected to the upward variance, in part, because he believed the court used the length of the sentence to afford him better access to drug treatment and rehabilitation, and also psychological treatment (ROA.330). The District Court expressly denied that as a factor, saying: \"I didn't impose the length for that reason. I'm trying to protect the public.... I think I made that clear. But you (Pillault's counsel) had requested that he get the treatment, so I am going along with that\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The court made special note of the psychiatric evaluation, which stated that Pillault's risk of future violence was mitigated \"as long as he stays sober\" (ROA.327). If not sober, the court found Pillault was \"a possible high threat to someone, not necessarily school children, but to anyone who might cross his path\" (ROA.327-328). But as the government pointed out, the last time he was sober before he was incarcerated was unknown (ROA.325).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Pillault appealed the 6-level enhancement under Section 2A6.1(b)(1) and the upward variance (ROA.185). The Fifth Circuit affirmed both the enhancement and the upward variance.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mr. Pillault's counsel raised several issues on appeal including: (1) an objection to a six-point enhancement under USSG 2A6.1, arguing that the enhancement was inappropriate because Pillault did not commit an overt act that was substantially and directly connected to the offensive threat, (2) that the district court's sentence was unreasonable because it did not account for the nature and circumstances of the offense, and (3) that the district court violated the\n   <em>\n    Tapia\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n   standard by giving significant weight to Pillault's need for treatment.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Had Pillault proceeded to trial and been convicted on both counts, he faced a maximum of fifteen years in prison. Under his plea agreement, the maximum sentence would have been 10 years and his guideline offense level reduced from 18 to 15 points, due to accepting responsibility for his criminal acts. (PSR \u00b6 26-35). The court ultimately sentenced Mr. Pillault to 72 months, due in part to the government's Motion for Upward Variance, which sought the maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.

(Plea Supp. \u00b6 3). While Mr. Pillault and counsel may have hoped for a sentence within the guideline range of 18 to 24 months, the government's motion for upward variance and the judge's sentencing discretion were entirely beyond defense counsel's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Pillault understood this when he changed his plea to guilty.

Demik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3484431\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/644/#p646\">\n    489 F.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (5th Cir. 2007) (conclusory allegations and general claims are insufficient to establish ineffective assistance or to require an evidentiary hearing on that issue). Indeed, the addendum to Mr. Pillault's PSR makes clear that Pillault's counsel carefully read it and made several objections to its content. (Add. to PSR \u00b6 1-3). Counsel raised those issues and several others during sentencing and on direct appeal. Mr. Pillault has not shown that counsel rendered ineffective assistance under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Pillault also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he had no counsel present when his home was searched. This claim is simply frivolous. Mr. Pillault was not under arrest or in custody at the time; as such, he was not entitled to appointed counsel. There is no requirement that counsel be present at the exact moment that a defendant is initially arrested or his home searched pursuant to a lawful warrant: \"[A] person's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirby v. Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173132\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/682/#p688\">\n    406 U.S. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173132\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/682/#p688\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173132\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/682/#p688\">\n    32 L.Ed.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (Justice Stewart, with three Justices concurring and one Justice concurring in result.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mr. Pillault acknowledged that counsel could not guarantee a short sentence and that the government reserved the right to seek an upward variance in sentencing. (Plea Tr. 10-12). This is not deficient performance, and the ultimate sentence was outside of defense counsel's control. Counsel's advice to plead guilty was also sound. Had Pillault proceeded to trial, the weight of the evidence against him would almost certainly have resulted in a guilty verdict, even if his \"accuser\" had refused to testify against him at trial. (Plea Tr. 12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During sentencing, defense counsel tried to mitigate a finding of his dangerousness and to undermine the credibility of the witnesses against him. The witnesses included multiple former girlfriends, each of whom verified that Pillault had been planning to detonate explosives and shoot up Oxford High School, had idolized the Columbine shooters, and had done so for years. (Sentencing Tr. 44-46, 71-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court found that the witnesses against Pillault were more credible than Pillault, himself. The court nonetheless found in favor of Pillault on several issues, finding that the proof did not establish that he had the ability to carry out the planned attack or possessed the means to purchase a shotgun. However, the court ultimately granted the government's motion for upward variance from the sentencing guidelines and imposed a 72-month sentence. (Sentencing Tr. 108-118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The sentence the court imposed was beyond defense counsel's control, a fact that Pillault acknowledged when he pled guilty. (Plea Tr. 10-12). Pillault's counsel vigorously defended his client, preserved important issues for appeal, and tried to mitigate the sentence imposed. For these reasons, Mr. Pillault has not met the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test. Defense counsel performed well in the face of an extremely strong case for the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Pillault Cannot Show Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Pillault has not shown that counsel's performance caused prejudice to his legal position. Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that Pillault would have risked going to trial. The evidence against him was overwhelming, and he did not challenge the nature or amount of the evidence, though he was reluctant to stipulate to witness statements about him occurring outside of his presence. (Plea Tr. 17-20). If Mr. Pillault had not pled guilty, the jury would surely have convicted him based on the overwhelming evidence against him. By pleading guilty, he avoided being charged with other offenses arising from the charge to which he pled guilty. (Plea Tr. 7-10). He avoided a significantly higher sentence and the possibility of facing other charges. He also benefited from a three-point reduction of his offense level during sentencing because he accepted responsibility for his criminal actions. He received a higher sentence than he or his counsel had hoped for; however, long before he pled guilty, he acknowledged that the government retained the right to file a motion for upward variance and that there was no guarantee of a lower sentence. (Plea Tr. 10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Mr. Pillault also argued that counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to visit him in pretrial detention, failing to properly cross-examine witnesses during sentencing, and failing to take advantage of the accuser's alleged decision not to testify. First, there is no requirement that counsel visit a defendant in jail. Second, contrary to Mr. Pillault's bald assertion, the record reveals that defense counsel vigorously cross-examined the government's witnesses. Third, the government had marshaled sufficient evidence to convict Mr. Pillault, even if one of the witnesses had decided not to testify. None of these alleged deficiencies rises to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, and these grounds for relief are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   There is simply no evidence to support the actual prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   The evidence against Pillault was overwhelming, and counsel's advice to plead guilty was sound. Defense counsel did a fine job and attempted to mitigate the severity of Pillault's sentence by cross-examining the government's witnesses during sentencing, making numerous cogent objections, and preserving issues for appeal. Mr. Pillault's claim that counsel's\n   performance was deficient is without substantive merit and will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Waiver of Counsel and Agreement to Speak With Investigators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Pillault argues that his Fourteenth amendment right to due process was violated because arresting officers allegedly coerced him into both signing away his right to counsel and participating in an interview. The alleged coercion, coupled with defense counsel's advice to plead guilty, led Mr. Pillault to believe that he had no defense, and no one defending his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Pillault has offered nothing more than his bald assertion that the arresting officers coerced him into signing away his right to counsel before or during interrogation. Such \"conclusory allegations do not raise a constitutional issue in a habeas proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487408\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/1008/#p1012\">\n    694 F.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (5th Cir. 1983). As such, this claim for relief will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pillault next claims that his attorney's advice to plead guilty was faulty and denied him his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. Pleading guilty does not deny a defendant of his due process rights - instead, with a guilty plea, a defendant waives certain constitutional rights, such as the right to trial by jury, as a necessary condition of making a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Brady v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    397 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). With proper knowledge and understanding, guilty pleas provide a method to dispose of a case without a trial in a constitutional manner that upholds due process. Mr. Pillault understood that he was surrendering this right and other important constitutional rights when he pled guilty. (Plea Tr. 4-12). \"The rule that a plea must be intelligently made to be valid does not require that a plea be vulnerable to later attack if the defendant did not correctly assess every relevant factor entering into his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    397 U.S. at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, given the strength of the government's case against him, counsel's advice to plead guilty was sound. Mr. Pillault cannot show that counsel's performance on this issue was deficient or prejudiced his defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this claim for relief must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Threats as Protected Free Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mr. Pillault argues that his First Amendment right to freedom of speech was violated because only his mother or a parental figure possesses the authority to censor his expressive activities on the internet. He thus argues that his threatened acts of violence are protected under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First Amendment protections are not, however, all-encompassing. The government may restrict certain categories of speech without violating the First Amendment. In this case, the government may prohibit true threats. When evaluating a threat to determine if it constitutes protected speech, the court must consider its political nature, context, the manner in which the statement is received by its audience, and whether the statement is conditional in nature.\n   <em>\n    Watts v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    394 U.S. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    22 L.Ed.2d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969). In the present case, Mr. Pillault transmitted threats to blow up Oxford High School and kill students, teachers, and administrators. Such threats do not constitute protected speech. In\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   , the speech was clearly political, conditioned on a certain event occurring (being drafted), and the audience laughed rather than taking the speech as a serious threat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    at 706-708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Mr. Pillault's case, there was no political message behind the speech. He threatened to blow up Oxford High School, and expressed\n   the desire to \"blow[ ] brains out of skulls.\" He told the audience to look for the last name \"Pillault\" in the news, expressed his obsession with the Columbine shooting, and specified that he intended to make good on his threat on the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. The audience did not laugh. Indeed, one audience member located in Virginia took the time to identify Pillault and contact the school resource officer at Oxford High School regarding the threat. The game developer (who was located in the United Kingdom), also forwarded Pillault's threatening messages - and independently reached out to the high school staff to warn of a credible threat. None of this constitutes political speech or words that the audience dismissed as mere hyperbole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The speech had no conditions; it was not humorous or received as such by the audience; it held no political message, and the evidence shows that Mr. Pillault had planned and truly intended to build bombs and carry out a mass shooting at Oxford High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Supreme Court has noted, \"the First Amendment permits a State to ban true threats ... [which] encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

Pillault's threats to shoot up Oxford High School are clearly a type of true threat intended to place the listener and audience in fear of bodily harm or death. Mr. Pillault even made these same threats to shoot up and bomb Oxford High School to past girlfriends in a clear effort to intimidate them, demonstrating that his school shooting comments in the Runescape online game chat were hardly a one-off event intended only as a joke. (Sentencing Tr. 41-45, 71-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Pillault's threats were not protected speech under the First Amendment. Pillault's comments constituted true threats. For these reasons, this claim should be denied on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    Consultation Before Executing the Search Warrant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Pillault asserts that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search of his home at the time of his arrest because he was denied an interview for a determination of the facts prior to his arrest and the search of his home. This claim is frivolous, as there is no constitutional right to an interview prior to the search of one's home or possessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The arrest of Pillault and search of his home and computers were based upon legally issued warrants after findings of probable cause. The Fourth Amendment imposes two requirements on issuing warrants: (1) all searches and seizures must be reasonable, and (2) a warrant may not be issued unless probable cause is properly established, and the scope of the authorized search is set out with particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

Pillault made threats to blow up Oxford High School and shoot students and administrators. These threats were communicated to the school and the school's resource officer by both a concerned citizen who witnessed Pillault's comments as they were made and by the game's developer. The threats were directly traced back to Pillault's home and computer. The school resource officer knew Pillault and in his professional opinion considered Pillault someone likely to follow through with that kind of threat. Examination of Pillault's computer that he used to make the threats served to demonstrate whether he made the threats or not, as well as provide evidence regarding whether this was a serious threat. This search of Pillault's home and seizure of his computer were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, a young man in Virginia grew concerned about the threats he saw Pillault make in the Runescape chat and contacted the school resource officer at Oxford High School. The game developer also independently contacted authorities and provided transcripts of Pillault's threats, as well as information identifying Pillault's address and computer from which the threats originated. The information was reliable, and both informants had personal knowledge of the threats made by Pillault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The school resource officer knew Pillault, including his tendency towards violence, bullying, and fighting, and moved to prevent a mass shooting of innocent school children. An arrest warrant was eventually issued for Pillault, and a search warrant for his home and his computer were also obtained. The issuing magistrate's decision to issue a warrant was based on a probable cause determination that was wholly reasonable given the available evidence and the totality of the circumstances. It was necessary to search Pillault's home and seize his computer to ensure that the threats had definitely come from it and had been made by Pillault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mr. Pillault's claim that law enforcement officers had a constitutional duty to provide him a chance to explain his side of the matter before searching his home and belongings is utterly frivolous. In this case law enforcement officers reasonably believed that Pillault was armed and preparing to use explosives or firearms against schoolchildren. The actions of the law enforcement officers and the court were reasonable and within the bounds of the law. This claim is frivolous and will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    The Claim of Actual Innocence Is Also Frivolous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mr. Pillault claims that he is actually innocent of the crime of his conviction; he has not, however, offered any proof or argument that would refute the evidence the government was prepared to introduce against him. In addition, at his change of plea hearing, he testified that he was pleading guilty because he was actually guilty - and agreed to the factual basis for his change of plea. Based upon the summary of the evidence set forth above, this ground for relief will be dismissed as frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In sum, none of the Movant's claims has merit, and the instant motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence will be denied.
