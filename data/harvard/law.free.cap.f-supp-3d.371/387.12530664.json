The case was originally assigned to the Honorable Lawrence Zatkoff, who dismissed the case, concluding that Plaintiff was required to exhaust administrative remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\"). The Sixth Circuit agreed with Judge Zatkoff and affirmed his dismissal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address confusion as to the IDEA's exhaustion requirement, vacated the Sixth Circuit's opinion, and remanded the matter for consideration of the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fry v.

In particular, the Court explained that the parties failed to provide evidence as to the reasons why the Frys changed course (i.e., why they stopped pursuing administrative relief under the IDEA and, instead, filed suit in federal court under the ADA/Rehabilitation Act). In other words, there was no evidence in the record as to the reasons behind their shift to judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff has now filed a new partial summary judgment motion, asking the Court to rule that Plaintiff's claims in this action are not subject to the IDEA's exhaustion requirements, and to strike Defendants' affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a school-say, a public theater or library? And second, could an\n   <em>\n    adult\n   </em>\n   at the school-say, an employee or visitor-have pressed essentially the same grievance?\n   <em>\n    When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject; after all, in those other situations there is no FAPE obligation and yet the same basic suit could go forward. But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE, even if it does not explicitly say so; for the FAPE requirement is all that explains why only a child in the school setting (not an adult in that setting or a child in some other) has a viable claim.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Take two contrasting examples. Suppose first that a wheelchair-bound child sues his school for discrimination under Title II (again, without mentioning the denial of a FAPE) because the building lacks access ramps. In some sense, that architectural feature has educational consequences, and a different lawsuit might have alleged that it violates the IDEA: After all, if the child cannot get inside the school, he cannot receive instruction there; and if he must be carried inside, he may not achieve the sense of independence conducive to academic (or later to real-world) success. But is the denial of a FAPE really the gravamen of the plaintiff's Title II complaint? Consider that the child could file the same basic complaint if a municipal library or theater had no ramps. And similarly, an employee or visitor could bring a mostly identical complaint against the school.\n   <em>\n    That the claim can stay the same in those alternative scenarios suggests that its essence is equality of access to public facilities, not adequacy of special education.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 751-752 (describing OCR's use of a similar example). And so \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) does not require exhaustion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   But suppose next that a student with a learning disability sues his school under Title II for failing to provide remedial tutoring in mathematics. That suit, too, might be cast as one for disability-based discrimination, grounded on the school's refusal to make a reasonable accommodation; the complaint might make no reference at all to a FAPE or an IEP. But can anyone imagine the student making the same claim against a public theater or library? Or, similarly, imagine an adult visitor or employee suing the school to obtain a math tutorial?\n   <em>\n    The difficulty of transplanting the complaint to those other contexts suggests that its essence-even though not its wording-is the provision of a FAPE,\n   </em>\n   thus bringing \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) into play.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 756 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In a footnote addressing concerns raised in the concurring opinion, the majority\n   opinion stated that the \"point of the questions is not to show that a plaintiff faced with a particular set of circumstances could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have proceeded under Title II or \u00a7 504 - or, alternatively, could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have proceeded under the IDEA. (Depending on the circumstances, she might well have been able to proceed under both.) Rather, these questions help determine whether a plaintiff who has chosen to bring a claim under Title II or \u00a7 504 instead of the IDEA - and whose complaint makes no mention of a FAPE - nevertheless raises a claim whose\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   is the denial of an appropriate education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 757 n.10 (italics in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the Court suggested a \"further sign\" that should be considered in deciding if the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a FAPE:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A further sign that the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a FAPE can emerge from the history of the proceedings. In particular, a court may consider that a plaintiff has previously invoked the IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute-thus starting to exhaust the Act's remedies before switching midstream. Recall that a parent dissatisfied with her child's education initiates those administrative procedures by filing a complaint, which triggers a preliminary meeting (or possibly mediation) and then a due process hearing. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 748-749. A plaintiff's initial choice to pursue that process may suggest that she is indeed seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE-with the shift to judicial proceedings prior to full exhaustion reflecting only strategic calculations about how to maximize the prospects of such a remedy. Whether that is so depends on the facts; a court may conclude, for example, that the move to a courtroom came from a late-acquired awareness that the school had fulfilled its FAPE obligation and that the grievance involves something else entirely. But prior pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies will often provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 757. A footnote to that paragraph explained: \"The point here is limited to commencement of the IDEA's formal administrative procedures; it does not apply to more informal requests to IEP Team member or other school administrators for accommodations or changes to a special education program. After all, parents of a child with a disability are likely to bring\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   grievances first to those familiar officials, whether or not they involve the denial of a FAPE.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 757 n.11.

The school districts' \"refusal to allow Wonder to act as a service dog,\" the complaint states, \"discriminated against [E.F.] as a person with disabilities ... by denying her equal access\" to public facilities. App. to Brief in Opposition 15, Complaint \u00b6 68. The complaint contains no allegation about the denial of a FAPE or about any deficiency in E.F.'s IEP. More, it does not accuse the school even in general terms of refusing to provide the educational instruction\n   and services that E.F. needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229325\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/622/\">\n    788 F.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acknowledging that the Frys do not \"state that Wonder enhances E.F.'s educational opportunities\"). As the Frys explained in this Court: The school districts \"have said all along that because they gave [E.F.] a one-on-one [human] aide, that all of her ... educational needs were satisfied. And we have not challenged that, and it would be difficult for us to challenge that.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. The Frys instead maintained, just as OCR had earlier found, that the school districts infringed E.F.'s right to equal access-even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements. See App. to Brief in Opposition 15, 18-19, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 69, 85, 87; App. 34-37;\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 751-752.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   And nothing in the nature of the Frys' suit suggests any implicit focus on the adequacy of E.F.'s education. Consider, as suggested above, that the Frys could have filed essentially the same complaint if a public library or theater had refused admittance to Wonder. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 756. Or similarly, consider that an adult visitor to the school could have leveled much the same charges if prevented from entering with his service dog. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   In each case, the plaintiff would challenge a public facility's policy of precluding service dogs (just as a blind person might challenge a policy of barring guide dogs, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 751 ) as violating Title II's and \u00a7 504's equal access requirements. The suit would have nothing to do with the provision of educational services.\n   <em>\n    From all that we know now, that is exactly the kind of action the Frys have brought.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, the Court remanded the case so that the history of the proceedings could be considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    But we do not foreclose the possibility\n   </em>\n   that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different. As earlier discussed, a plaintiff's initial pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies can serve as evidence that the gravamen of her later suit is the denial of a FAPE, even though that does not appear on the face of her complaint. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 756-758. The Frys may or may not have sought those remedies before filing this case: None of the parties here have addressed that issue, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts. Accordingly, on remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA's dispute resolution process before bringing this suit. And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   With these instructions and for the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joined, concurred in the result but wrote separately to explain that he would not suggest the \"clues\" included in the majority opinion, particularly with respect to the clue suggesting the court look at whether the parents pursued but then abandoned procedures under the IDEA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court provides another false clue by suggesting that lower courts take into account whether parents, before filing suit under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, began to pursue but then abandoned the IDEA's formal procedures.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 756 - 758.

Jim Graham, the Superintendent of the Napoleon Community School District, testified that Stacy Fry informed him of this during some type of program at the elementary school. He testified that he walked away without saying anything in response. (Graham Dep. at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On October 12, 2009, E.F.'s parents wrote a letter to Graham, as the Superintendent of the Napoleon School District, which stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   I am writing to inform the school district that my child, [E.F.], will be receiving a certified service dog in October, 2009.

More specifically, I recall Mr. Rendell, from the Intermediate School District, stating that he would not continue to pay for an aide for our daughter if she had the service dog and he would not pay for the aide to handle our daughter's service dog, so we are assuming there are budgetary concerns as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   We look forward to communicating further with you in regard to our daughter [E.F.] and her service dog Wonder.

One outcome of that meeting was there was another meeting scheduled for January 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . Do you know who asked for that January 7 meeting to be scheduled? Was it the Frys or was it Napoleon Community Schools?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. Well, any time a parent would want an accommodation, it would be the Frys. If they want that dog to come to school, that's something different than what the IEP says, then they would be asking for that accommodation, which we would need to reconvene the IEP team, which I was invited to that meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. Okay. So just to understand the process, any time a parent asks for an accommodation for a student that has an IEP, that's automatically discussed in the context of an IEP meeting that's called at the Napoleon Community Schools. Is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A. To the best of my knowledge it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q. Okay. Just as a matter of process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A. Yeah. When that IEP changes, something is brought to the table that would change the IEP process, we would have the family involved and have a team meeting, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q. Was that any type of accommodation or only accommodations that in\n   the school's view would change the IEP process?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A. I would say any type of accommodation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q. Okay. So just to be clear, it's the Napoleon Community School's position that as a result of the Frys requesting an accommodation, that was the same thing as asking for an IEP to be convened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A. Yes. When a family comes and asks us to do something different than the IEP says, to accommodate that, we would have a family team meeting. We would have a team meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (Graham Dep. at 38-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Graham sent the Frys a letter dated January 4, 2010, in response to their December 17, 2009 letter.

During the time that the dog was being discussed in those ten minutes, did you explain why you felt the dog should be permitted?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   A. I did. I expressed the fact that she had the right to utilize a service dog under the Americans with Disabilities Act and that was her Civil Right. That is [sic] was an access issue for her to be able to use the dog.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Q.

During the meeting all team members discussed [E.F.'s] educational needs in her current program. It was the consensus of the IEP team that [E.F.'s] was being successful in school and that all of her educational needs were being met by current programs/services and accommodations. As such, it was determined that the addition of a service dog would not be beneficial to [E.F.'s] education at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   After the discussion with all team members you chose to disagree with the IEP decision and pursue mediation.

On January 21, 2010, the ACLU sent Defendants a letter, that stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   We write in support of Stacy and Brent Fry's request that their daughter [E.F.] be able to bring her service dog, Wonder, with her to school at Ezra Eby Elementary School... As set forth below, [E.F.] has a right under the Americans with Disabilities Act to bring Wonder to school. The Frys and the [ACLU] would like to resolve this issue amicably and quickly and request a meeting at your earliest convenience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   In May 2008, [E.F.'s] pediatrician ... wrote a prescription for a mobility assistance dog for her to promote her independence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Prior to registering E.F. for school, the Frys advised the school of their decision to purchase a service dog to assist E.F. with her everyday activities. At no point did the school district suggest that a service dog would not be permitted in the school. In fact, the Frys were led to believe that the service dog could attend school with E.F.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Nonetheless, in December 2009, the Frys were informally advised that E.F. could not bring Wonder to school. The School District formalized this decision by rejecting the request to bring Wonder to school in a specially convened Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting on January 7, 2010. The IEP confirms that the Frys \"requested a service dog for their daughter to enhance her independence\" and that the request was denied as E.F.'s \"physical and academic needs are being met through the services/programs/accommodations of the IEP.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   E.F'S RIGHT TO A SERVICE DOG UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   The [ADA] provide that public entities, such as public schools, must\n   make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   There is no evidence that Wonder would in any manner interfere with the school's activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   The [IDEA] addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities and requires school districts to provide special education and related services designed to meet the specific learning needs of a child with a disability. By working with the family and teachers to draft an IEP for a child with a disability, a school district sets forth how the child's academic needs will be met. Napoleon Community Schools determined at the recent IEP meeting that E.F.'s educational needs are being met, and therefore Wonder is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    We disagree. According to Dr. Nelson, Wonder is able to help E.F. increase her independence. Wonder has also helped [her] gain self-confidence.

(Stacy Fry Dep. at 95).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   On March 22, 2010, Plaintiffs and Defendants signed an \"Interim Agreement.\" (ECF No. 40-9). It noted that an IEP team meeting had been held on January 7, 2010 and that, at the conclusion of it, the Frys \"requested mediation to address their concerns regarding the IEP Team's conclusion that the presence or use of a dog was not necessary to provide E.F. with a free appropriate public education.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 580). It stated that the \"Parties held a mediation session on January 29, 2010\" and that they were agreeing to allow the dog access to the instructional setting at the school, while accompanied by a designated handler provided by Plaintiffs, for a trial period. The agreement notes that Defendants \"recognize that it is the Parents'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   view that Wonder is a service animal as that term is defined by the [ADA]\" but states that they \"do not concede that to be the case.\" The agreement states that the Parties \"agree that this Interim Mediation Agreement constitutes a mediation agreement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and as such, is enforceable under IDEA in any court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   After that agreement, Wonder was allowed to attend Ezra Eby Elementary School with E.F. for a trial period. The Frys were not satisfied with the way the trial period went. They believed that the School refused to let Wonder perform various tasks he was trained to assist E.F. with and excluded E.F. and Wonder from some in-school and/or extracurricular activities. (Stacy Fry Decl. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   At the end of the trial period, in approximately May of 2010, the Frys removed E.F. from school and began home-schooling her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff never filed a complaint for a due process hearing under the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   On June 24, 2010, the ACLU filed a discrimination complaint on behalf of the Frys against Defendants with the United States Department of Education, alleging \"Discrimination on the basis of disability\". (ECF No. 40-10). That letter asserted that Defendants \"refusal to recognize Wonder as a service dog, and permit his access in the instructional setting, is a denial of [E.F.'s] rights pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That same letter asserts that Wonder is a valuable tool to help [E.F.] increase her independence\" and that \"[s]uch independence is critical for [E.F.'s] educational success and thus a necessary component of her IEP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 591). The letter states that the Frys \"request that the Department of Education - Office of Civil Rights [\"OCR\"] investigate this matter and ultimately find in favor or [E.F.] and permit her to return to Ezra Eby Elementary School in September with her service dog Wonder, and that Wonder be utilized fully in assisting [E.F.] and have full access within the school setting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   During the OCR investigation, which lasted nearly two years, the Frys continued to home-school E.F. (Stacy Fry Decl. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   At the end of the 2010-2011 school year, the Frys removed their two sons from the Napoleon Community School District. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   On or about May 3, 2012, the OCR issued a decision letter. (ECF No. 54-11). The OCR agreed with the Frys that Defendants' exclusion of E.F.'s service animal violated her rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The OCR \"explained in its decision letter that a school's obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services: A school could offer a FAPE to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws' ban on discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court explained, the OCR found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   Ezra Eby had indeed violated that ban, even if its use of a human aide satisfied the FAPE standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 35-36. OCR analogized the school's conduct to \"requir[ing] a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried\" by an aide or \"requir[ing] a blind student to be led [around by a] teacher\" instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Regardless whether those - or Ezra Eby's - policies denied a FAPE, they violated Title II and \u00a7 504 by discriminating against children with disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   It is undisputed that in order to settle the complaint with the OCR, on April 26,\n   2012, Defendant entered into a six-page resolution agreement in which it agreed it would invite E.F. to return to Ezra Eby Elementary School \"and notify her that, should she return, she will be provided the opportunity to have a service animal accompany and assist her throughout the school day ...\" (ECF No. 54-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Frys did not have E.F. return to school after that resolution agreement. Stacy Fry filed a Declaration along with the pending motion, wherein she states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   8. Following the OCR settlement, we had another uncomfortable and contemptuous meeting with the school. During that meeting, the school informed us that, pursuant to the OCR settlement, it would allow [E.F.] and Wonder to attend Ezra Eby Elementary School in the fall of 2012. However, the school continued to refuse to acknowledge Wonder was a service animal. The school district's attitude during this meeting made it clear to us that the school had no intention of creating a positive and healthy learning environment for [E.F.] and Wonder, even after the OCR ruling. As a result, rather than expose [E.F.] to this negative environment, we chose to enroll our daughter in a different school district which welcomes Wonder into the school with open arms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   9. At this time, our attorneys advised us that the IDEA hearing officer had no power to adjudicate whether Wonder was a service animal under the ADA or if his use would be a reasonable accommodation. Furthermore, the attorneys informed us that any damages we had suffered as a result of the school's discriminatory or retaliatory actions could not be recovered under the IDEA. Because that was the injury we wished to have addressed, our attorneys advised us to file this lawsuit in federal court under the ADA rather than pursuing any remedies under the IDEA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   (ECF No. 54-12 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   On December 17, 2012, the Frys filed this action in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Application Of\n    <em>\n     Fry\n    </em>\n    Tests To This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Although the Supreme Court's decision remanded for consideration of just the final \"clue\" regarding history of the proceedings, this Court will include here all of the components of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Look To The Complaint Itself\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Supreme Court noted that the \"central inquiry\" is the \"plaintiff's own claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Fry, supra\n   </em>\n   , at 755. Thus, a \"court deciding whether \u00a7 1415(l) applies must therefore examine whether a plaintiff's complaint - the principal instrument by which she describes her case - seeks relief for the denial of an appropriate education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   As the Supreme Court noted, the Plaintiff's complaint in this case \"alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E.F.'s school provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758. Plaintiff's complaint \"contains no allegation about the denial of a FAPE or about any deficiency in E.F.'s IEP. More, it does not accuse the school, even in general terms, of refusing to provide the educational instruction and services that E.F. needs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The Frys instead maintained, just as OCR had earlier found, that the school districts infringed E.F.'s right to equal access - even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   In addition, the complaint contains factual allegations as to how the Frys ultimately chose to send E.F. to a school in another district, one that allegedly enthusiastically welcomed E.F. and Wonder. There is no indication in the complaint that the Frys ever intended to have E.F. return to Ezra Eby Elementary School. In fact, during the years that this case has proceeded, E.F. has finished elementary school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Accordingly, there is nothing about the allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint that indicate that it is actually seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Consideration Of The Pair Of Hypothetical Questions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Consideration of the pair of hypothetical questions suggested by the majority opinion also suggests that the essence of Plaintiff's complaint is equality of access to public facilities, not the adequacy of special education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   In a footnote addressing concerns raised in the concurring opinion, the majority opinion stated that the \"point of the questions is not to show that a plaintiff faced with a particular set of circumstances could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have proceeded under Title II or \u00a7 504 - or, alternatively, could\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have proceeded under the IDEA. (Depending on the circumstances, she might well have been able to proceed under both.) Rather, these questions help determine whether a plaintiff who has chosen to bring a claim under Title II or \u00a7 504 instead of the IDEA - and whose complaint makes no mention of a FAPE - nevertheless raises a claim whose\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   is the denial of an appropriate education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 757 n.10 (italics in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Here, Plaintiff could have proceeded under both the IDEA and the ADA/Section 504:1) Plaintiff could have asserted a claim under the IDEA, asking the hearing officer to rule that E.F. had to have the use of Wonder in order to receive a FAPE at Ezra Eby Elementary, and asking that her IEP be modified to include the use of Wonder; and 2) Plaintiff could have asserted a claim under the ADA/Section 504, taking the position that, even if she had a FAPE under the IEP, Defendants nevertheless violated the statutes by refusing to allow E.F. to take Wonder to school with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Consideration of the hypothetical questions here, shows that the substance of Plaintiff's complaint asserting ADA/Section 504 claims, with no allegation of a denial of a FAPE and not seeking to modify her IEP in any way, is not the denial of a FAPE. As the Supreme Court noted in the majority opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   Consider, as suggested above, that the Frys could have filed essentially the same complaint if a public library or theater had refused admittance to Wonder.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 756. Or similarly, consider that an adult visitor to the school could have leveled much the same charges if prevented from entering with his service dog.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   In each case, the plaintiff would challenge a public facility's policy of precluding service dogs (just as a blind person might challenge a policy of barring guide dogs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 751 ) as violating Title II's and \u00a7 504's equal access requirements. The suit would have nothing to do with the provision of educational services.

Consideration Of The History Of Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Consideration of the history of the proceedings, therefore, is the only \"clue\" that could possibly suggest that the gravamen of Plaintiff's complaint is actually the denial of a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"From all that we know now,\" this suit has nothing to do with the provision of educational services \"[b]ut we do not foreclose the possibility that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Plaintiff's current motion now offers the Court evidence as to the reasons behind their change from participating in the IDEA mediation to their decision to pursue litigation under the ADA/Section 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   In discussing the consideration of the history of proceedings issue, the majority opinion stated that a \"court may consider that a plaintiff has previously invoked the IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute - thus starting to exhaust the Act's remedies before switching midstream and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   Recall that a parent dissatisfied with her child's education initiates those administrative procedures by filing a complaint, which triggers a preliminary meeting (or possibly mediation) and then a due process hearing.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 748-749.

Notably, in those first communications, the Frys referenced only the ADA, not the IDEA or any questions or concerns regarding an IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Defendants then responded by addressing the requested accommodation as an issue with E.F.'s IEP. Indeed, Graham testified that\n   <em>\n    any time a parent asks for an accommodation\n   </em>\n   , they would convene an IEP meeting. That is what they did here when the Frys requested to have Wonder accompany E.F. to school. Thus, Defendants, not the Frys, invoked the IDEA's procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The Frys then attended an IEP meeting and, at the end of it, were advised that the request for a service dog was rejected by the IEP team. The Frys, who were not represented by counsel, then checked the box indicating they wanted to mediate. Stacy Fry testified that they did so because they knew of no other way of continuing the conversation about the service dog with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Later, because Defendants kept addressing the issue of the service dog as one under the IDEA, the Frys then addressed it as\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   an ADA access issue and as an issue as to the adequacy of E.F.'s IEP. The Frys stated, \"We feel that this is more of an access issue rather than an educational one. However, since the school has deemed it an educational issue we see your refusal to allow our daughter access to her service animal\" as a denial of FAPE. The Frys, and later the ACLU on their behalf, addressed the issue as\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   an access issue under the ADA and as a challenge to the adequacy of E.F.'s IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The Supreme Court recognized that, under appropriate circumstances, a given plaintiff may be able to proceed\n   <em>\n    under both\n   </em>\n   the IDEA and the ADA/Section 504.\n   <em>\n    Fry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   757 n. 10. So the fact that the Frys proceeded under both for a short period of time does not answer the question of whether the gravamen on Plaintiff's complaint is the denial of a FAPE. Again, the Court considers the history of administrative proceedings to determine whether the change in court reflects a strategic calculation about how to maximize the prospects of a remedy for the denial of a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In this case, the OCR ruling came down in May of 2012 - after the Frys had already removed E.F. from the school. The OCR agreed with the Frys that Defendants' exclusion of E.F.'s service animal violated her rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The OCR \"explained in its decision letter that a school's obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services: A school could offer a FAPE to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws' ban on discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court explained, the OCR found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   Ezra Eby had indeed violated that ban, even if its use of a human aide satisfied the FAPE standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 35-36. OCR analogized the school's conduct to \"requir[ing] a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried\" by an aide or \"requir[ing] a blind student to be led [around by a] teacher\" instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Regardless whether those - or Ezra Eby's - policies denied a FAPE, they violated Title II and \u00a7 504 by discriminating\n   against children with disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Not surprisingly, counsel for the Frys then advised them that the ADA, and not the IDEA, could address the injury they wished to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Stacy Fry's declaration states that their attorneys advised them that an IDEA hearing officer would have no power to adjudicate whether Wonder was a service animal under the ADA, or if E.F.'s use of him would be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. (Fry Decl.). Their attorneys further advised them that any compensatory damages that E.F. had suffered as a result of the school's actions could not be recovered under the IDEA, which does not authorize monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because that was the injury that the Frys wished to address, their attorneys advised them to file this action in federal court under the ADA/Section 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Notably, these are the very kinds of circumstances discussed in the majority and concurring opinions that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   indicative of a strategic calculation to maximize the prospect of a remedy for the denial of a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   There is no evidence to indicate that the Frys filed suit in federal court under the ADA/Section 504 as a strategic calculation to maximize the prospect of a remedy for the denial of a FAPE. The only relief available under the IDEA is relief for the denial of a FAPE (e.g., a declaratory ruling that an amendment to an IEP is needed, a declaration that the student was denied a FAPE under an existing IEP, an award of additional educational services to be provided, etc.). In this action, Plaintiff has not requested any relief for the denial of a FAPE, nor has she sought any relief relating to an IEP at all. Plaintiff has no desire for E.F. to return to Ezra Eby Elementary School and, in fact, E.F. is no longer in elementary school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Accordingly, this Court concludes that Plaintiff's complaint in this action is not subject to the IDEA's exhaustion requirements, and shall strike Defendants' affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION &amp; ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED and the Court STRIKES Defendants' affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    It also included a claim under Michigan's Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act, but Judge Zatkoff declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim and dismissed it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Money damages are not available under the IDEA.\n    <em>\n     Crocker v.
