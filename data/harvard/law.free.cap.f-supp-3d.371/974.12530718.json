BRACK, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Ms. Meda Bittermann and Mr. Doru Bittermann worked as volunteer campground hosts at the Rio Bravo Campground in Taos, New Mexico. They claim that their Bureau of Land Management (BLM) supervisors violated their civil rights. Ms. Bittermann alleges that she was subjected to ongoing sexual harassment. Both plaintiffs allege that they were fired in retaliation for complaining of the sexual harassment. Since the BLM is a division of the Department of the Interior, Plaintiffs sued Defendant Ryan Zinke in his official capacity as Secretary of the Interior. He argues that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because they are not BLM \"employees\" and only employees can bring actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Having reviewed the submissions of counsel and relevant law, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    deny\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs worked as volunteer \"Campground Hosts\" at the Rio Bravo Campground within the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument in Taos County, New Mexico from April 1, 2016, until September 13, 2017. (Doc. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16-17, 63.) In that role, Plaintiffs were responsible for \"taking care of the campground by keeping it clean and in good operating mode; cleaning the bathrooms, showers and grills; and serving the needs of campers\" as well as \"greet[ing] campers and recreational users, and ensur[ing] fee and regulation compliance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiffs worked as campground hosts from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. five days a week and were each paid $ 20.00 per day for their services, for a total of $ 100.00 per week. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22.) Ms. Bittermann also worked eight hours per week at the Visitor Center, which involved \"selling merchandise, keeping the area clean and assisting customers with directions, information and answering their questions, selling federal passes and conducting book sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As part of their contract as volunteer campground hosts, Plaintiffs were allowed to park their personal camper trailer at the campground for free, which would otherwise cost $ 15.00 per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) \"Plaintiffs also received propane, electricity, and water/sewage for their camper trailer without charge, a[nd] regular campers were charged for such utilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs were allowed to use an official BLM vehicle and were reimbursed for mileage at the same rate as other BLM employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiffs were given BLM uniforms, gloves, and other protective\n   gear, and were insured for work-related injuries under the BLM's workers' compensation program. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) The BLM provided Plaintiffs with free training courses, including a CPR class, and Plaintiffs were also given passes to stay at other campgrounds for free. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"It was common practice for persons contracting with Defendant Agency to eventually become BLM federal employees\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31), and Plaintiffs' supervisor and campground manager Randy Roch had promised Plaintiffs future employment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). Barry Weinstock was an assistant manager and was Ms. Bittermann's supervisor at the Visitor Center. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35.) In June 2017, Mr. Weinstock began sexually harassing Ms. Bittermann, which included unwelcome touching and hugging, making offensive sexual remarks and comments about Ms. Bittermann's appearance, and repeatedly inviting her out for drinks and creating situations in which Ms. Bittermann was forced to be alone with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-47.) About a month after the sexual harassment began, Ms. Bittermann \"in clear language told Weinstock that she was not interested in his sexual advances, that she was married, and that she and Weinstock were just working together.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Mr. Weinstock then began complaining frequently that Ms. Bittermann was \"always late,\" making offensive remarks about her accent and \"workstyle,\" and yelling at her repeatedly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Bittermann twice reported Mr. Weinstock's harassing and retaliatory behavior to Mr. Roch, and on September 5, 2017, met with Mr. Roch to again complain of Mr. Weinstock's behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 61-62.) Mr. Bittermann was also present during this in-person meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Approximately one week later, Mr. Roch \"came to talk to [Plaintiffs] and started the conversation with the words, 'I am here to ruin your day' and terminated both [Plaintiffs] on the pretext of 'complaints we received from people about your work.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed formal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) discrimination complaints-Ms. Bittermann's complaint alleged both discrimination on the basis of sex (sexual harassment) and retaliation, and Mr. Bittermann's complaint alleged retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) After receiving final agency decisions, Plaintiffs timely filed suit in this Court, alleging sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-91.) Defendant has moved to dismiss the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted because they \"have failed to plead any facts to support the conclusory assertion that Plaintiffs, who admittedly worked as volunteer Campground Hosts and received only insignificant benefits incidental to their Campground Host duties, were employees of Defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The issue of whether potential future employment is an indirect benefit that may be considered remuneration has not been squarely addressed by any court in applying the threshold remuneration test, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) compliance manual suggests that volunteers may be protected under federal employment statutes when \"volunteer work is required for regular employment or regularly leads to regular employment with the same entity.\" EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 2-III(A)(1)(c) (citing\n   <em>\n    Charlton v.

Though Plaintiffs suggest the Court may also analyze their volunteer relationship with Defendant using the Sixth and Ninth Circuits' approach (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 17 at 7-9), the Court finds that the Tenth Circuit clearly adopted the threshold remuneration test in\n    <em>\n     McGuinness\n    </em>\n    and will not engage in the common-law agency analysis without a threshold showing of remuneration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Though Plaintiffs assert that these payments, combined with the value of their free camper parking space, equal the federal minimum wage, this is only true if both Mr. and Ms. Bittermann are credited the full value of the free parking space.
