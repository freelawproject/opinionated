(collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Diamond\n   </strong>\n   \") sued Defendants Austin N. Aaronson (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Aaronson\n   </strong>\n   \") and Aaronson, Austin, PA (\"\n   <strong>\n    Aaronson Law Firm\n   </strong>\n   \") (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Defendants\n   </strong>\n   \") for claims arising from advertisements on the Aaronson Law Firm website (\"\n   <strong>\n    Firm Website\n   </strong>\n   \") and Mr. Aaronson's representation of clients who are or were Diamond members (\"\n   <strong>\n    Diamond Clients\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 47.) Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims (Doc. 115 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") ), and Diamond opposed (Doc. 133). The Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Diamond consists of Las Vegas-based timeshare developers managing over 420 membership resorts worldwide. (Doc. 47, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 17-24.) Defendants are an Orlando-based attorney and his law firm focused on\n   soliciting Diamond's and other developers' timeshare members to become clients to free them from financial obligations under their timeshare purchase and financing contracts (\"\n   <strong>\n    Timeshare Contracts\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 25.) To induce Diamond members to hire Defendants, Diamond alleges that Defendants put out false advertisements (\"\n   <strong>\n    Subject Advertisements\n   </strong>\n   \") that lead Diamond members to believe they can get out of their Timeshare Contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26, 29, 32-53.) Thus, timeshare members have ceased payments under their Timeshare Contracts, and occasionally Diamond faced baseless arbitration proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 31, 37, 39-53.) The Court discusses the Subject Advertisements before turning to Defendants' representation of Diamond Clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Subject Advertisements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Subject Advertisements that Diamond claims are false and misleading all appear or have appeared on the Firm Website in text on webpages, articles, blogs, and videos. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 133-5.) One advertisement touting Defendants' approach to timeshare cancellation appeared on the Firm Website's homepage (\"\n   <strong>\n    Homepage\n   </strong>\n   \") from August 2015 until August 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Timeshare ownership often feels like entrapment. How do we know this? Because people tell us. Their stories are remarkably consistent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   But reciting this disturbing series of events is not going to help legally. Why? Because it's your word against there's [sic].

In early 2016, that page read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Quite often, one's signature on a timeshare contract is obtained by fraud.

And by far the best way to leverage this is through a licensed attorney, who will have subpoena power over books and records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   So call us free of charge to discuss your situation, please. Your problems are not insurmountable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 8.) The \"How It Works\" page updated later to include a diagram of the Aaronson Law Firm's process of getting individuals out of their Timeshare Contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 9.) The language from the Homepage and \"How It Works\" page also appears in videos on the Firm Website in which a man wearing a gray suit recites the same information. (Doc. 132, \u00b6 4 (video available from August 2015 to August 2016);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (current video).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   These advertisements generally espouse Defendants' view of common practices of the timeshare industry as a whole. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-5.) But other advertisements on the Firm Website discuss Diamond specifically. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 133-23, 133-24.) An example is the \"article\" entitled \"Timeshare Traps\" dated May 5, 2015:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Diamond Resorts International, Inc., is an incredibly profitable company. They are also publicly traded, so that one can gain a certain amount of insight into how they operate. And they appear willing to stop at nothing to maintain this profitability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Diamond's modus operandi recently has not been about building new resort facilities. Rather, it is inclined to acquire existing facilities from previous developers, many of which were set up on the deed system. In some cases, these resorts were substantially sold out to deeded owners. Undeterred, Diamond has then endeavored to 'revoke' the deeds, a unilateral act utterly without legal authority, and impose a 'points' system conferring greater access based upon amount of points purchased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In this fashion, Diamond can accomplish several things that it could not do otherwise: 1. It can again commence the sale of new timeshare interests without having to build new facilities; 2. It can do so without recording deeds in public records, which was a public disclosure substantially impeding it from overbooking resorts. This practice is incredibly unfair\n   to owners of existing interests in these resorts, deeded or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   So don't be too surprised if, next time you try to book your vacation, you are told that you have insufficient points to access any of the accommodations, and that you'll have to buy more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If you are disappointed with your Diamond timeshare, please don't hesitate to call us concerning your legal options, including rescission of the contract, free of charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Doc. 133-23.) Another targeted advertisement appeared on the \"Diamond Resorts Timeshare Cancellation\" page:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Rescinding your Diamond Resorts International Timeshare Contract\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Unlike some other timeshare developers, Diamond Resorts International has never been a 'hotelier' per se.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Why are timeshares often more profitable than hotels? Simply that selling you space in their facilities is more profitable than renting them to you, for several reasons:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. It creates a more predictable cash flow\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. They can still rent the same facilities as a hotel if they're not fully booked\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   3. On the 'points' system, they can overbook, and deny you access on the basis that you don't have enough of them. (No one said that any of this is necessarily lawful)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   4. They can just plain charge you more money. (See our blog on the 'true cost of a timeshare').\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   If you've been hoodwinked into 'purchasing' your vacation, please feel free to contact us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Doc. 133-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Last, this blog post titled \"Timeshare Conflict of Interest\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Simply put, a conflict of interest exists when one's duty to act in your best interest is compromised by some other factor, typically money. In the case of Diamond Resorts International, such a conflict is evident in every aspect of what they do, particularly in the management of their resorts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Here's what we mean: You, as an owner of a timeshare, have certain rights, particularly voting rights, in association with the election of condominium association board members, which in turn make decisions concerning the management of the timeshare. Of these decisions, the most significant is the appointment of a professional 'management' company to maintain the facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   But with DRI, that's not exactly how it works. Rather, Diamond will invariably install\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   as the management company running its resorts, even though it lacks a majority ownership interest in any given resort that would legally qualify it to do so. How can this be, you ask? If they don't own most of the units, they can't even control the vote. By what legal authority can they do anything at all to control the management of the resort?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Here is their rationale, taken from language contained in [the] most recent annual report ... filed with the S.E.C.:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    HOAs. Each of the Diamond Resorts managed resorts, other than certain resorts in the European Collection, is typically operated through an HOA, which is administered by a board of directors. Directors are elected by the owners of intervals at the resort (which may include one or more of the Collections) and may also include representatives appointed by the Company as the developer of the resort. As a result, the Company is entitled to voting rights with respect\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to directors of a given HOA by virtue of (i) its ownership of intervals at the related resort, (ii) its control of the Collections that hold intervals at the resort and/or (iii) its status as the developer of the resort. The board of directors of each HOA hires a management company to provide the services described above, which in the case of all Diamond Resorts managed resorts, is the Company. The Company functions as an HOA for two resorts in St. Maarten, collects maintenance fees, earns management fees and incurs operating expenses at these two resorts.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Almost every statement in the foregoing 'rationale' is a non-sequitur. The disclosure makes a statement that the directors are elected by interval owners, which is an accurate statement of how things are supposed to work. But it then goes on to say that \"As a result, the Company (Diamond) is entitled to voting rights with respect to directors of a given HOA ...\" Stop right there. The fact that the owners elect directors does not entitle Diamond to 'voting rights' except to the limited extent to which it actually has title to intervals in the resort. On information and belief, in no case does Diamond actually own a majority of intervals in any resort that they manage. But it get[s] better: In trying to explain the legal basis for its control of the resorts, the disclosure goes on to say that it's \"... [because] i. its ownership of intervals at the related resort\" (duly noted and refuted) ... [and] ii. its control of the Collections that hold intervals at the resort and/or ... (so it's [sic] control of the\n   <em>\n    management\n   </em>\n   company gives it the right to control the\n   <em>\n    board of directors\n   </em>\n   - not\n   <em>\n    vice versa\n   </em>\n   ? ? ? ? ? ... [and] iii. its status as the\n   <em>\n    developer\n   </em>\n   of the resort\". So the\n   <em>\n    developer\n   </em>\n   , not the\n   <em>\n    owners\n   </em>\n   , of a resort now has status to forever control the board of directors. Maybe they can cite some legal authority for that one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In practice, what happens is this: Diamond will endeavor to circulate a number of 'proxy' proposals binding your vote as an owner to elect one of their insiders to the board. This they can do, even with ownership of a single interval. Invariably Diamond's stooges will then appoint Diamond's \"U.S. Collections\" arm to manage the resort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Unlike Diamond, you the owner of a resort interval are 'out of the loop'. You don't have a roster of other owners, and thus no way to communicate with them. Thus, there is no[ ] way to galvanize opposition to the status quo. And the cycle repeats itself year after year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   If any of this resonates with you, please call free of charge. We will discuss your legal options.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Doc. 132-2.) This post has been on the Firm Website since 2015. (Doc. 132, \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   From January 1, 2013 to August 22, 2018, the Homepage had 69,027 visits, the \"How It Works\" page 12,923 visits, and the \"Diamond Resorts Timeshare Cancellation\" page 3,330 visits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Representation of Diamond Clients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   About 258 Diamond timeshare owners have retained Defendants to cancel their Timeshare Contracts. (Doc. 133, \u00b6 19; Doc. 133-1; Doc. 115-2, p. 8.) Diamond members find Defendants in various ways, including through internet searches, the Firm Website, online forums, and referrals from other individuals. (Doc. 115-5, pp. 34-40.) For about eighty of Defendants' client matters involving Diamond members, the Diamond members became clients through the Firm Website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-9.) And almost half of Defendants' Diamond Clients have delinquent\n   Diamond accounts based on the members' failure to pay money owed under their Timeshare Contracts, including mortgage payments, interest payments, and maintenance or other fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 133, \u00b6 2; Doc. 115-2, p. 8; Doc. 115-15, pp. 9-10.) According to Diamond, as of July 31, 2018 these delinquencies totaled $ 4,578,838. (Doc. 115-15, p. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In representing Diamond Clients, Defendants have started over thirty arbitrations against Diamond asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, conflicts of interest, and mishandling and misappropriation of maintenance fees-consistent with the allegations in the Subject Advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-13.) Yet no arbitrations provided relief in Defendants' clients' favor on those asserted claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 115-5, 115-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-14.) Multiple times, the arbitrator found that the claims lacked good faith. (Doc. 115-5, pp. 11, 14, 34, 45, 62.) And in some, the arbitrator ruled in Diamond's favor on counterclaims for breach of the Timeshare Contracts over Defendants' clients' failure to make payments on their promissory notes. (Doc. 115-5, pp. 11-18, 32, 37, 44-45, 62; Doc. 115-6, pp. 83, 95, 134-35.) The Court highlights two Diamond Clients' stories to illustrate Defendants' approach to representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Hardistys\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   First, the Court addresses the experience of Ms. Hardisty, who purchased Diamond timeshare points for the first time in July 2015. (Doc. 115-19, pp. 11, 16, 29, 143.) After purchasing additional points in November 2015, she had second thoughts because she could not afford the payments and felt she had been lied to by Diamond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-56, 61-64, 79, 100-01). This led her to conduct an internet search on how, if at all, she could get out of the Timeshare Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There, she came across Mr. Aaronson's name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She clicked on the Firm Website and watched the video \"talking about maintenance fees, how [Mr. Aaronson] can get you out of your timeshare, that kind of thing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) The information in the video was the same as that in the Subject Advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-86.) While on the Firm Website, she submitted information about her situation and live chatted someone from the Aaronson Law Firm who gave her information about the process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56, 64, 100.) Following this online exchange, the Hardistys retained Mr. Aaronson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   During his representation of the Hardistys, Mr. Aaronson sent a demand letter to Diamond and began arbitration proceedings against Diamond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-25.) But according to Ms. Hardisty, the claims Mr. Aaronson filed did not reflect her perception of Diamond's wrongdoing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-25, 129-43.) The claims in the letter and the statement of claim included claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Nevada statutes, fraud in the inducement, conversion, quantum meruit, and rescission and an allegation that Diamond had misappropriated funds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-13, pp. 1-24.) Yet Ms. Hardisty found some facts asserted to be untrue, and she didn't even know what some claims meant. (Doc. 115-19, pp. 116-25, 129-43.) Plus, none of the asserted claims seemed \"obvious\" or \"easy to prove\" as marketed by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128, 150.) And when Ms. Hardisty asked Mr. Aaronson\n   for his advice about continuing to pay Diamond, he told her she \"could probably stop paying them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144, 154.) Perceiving this \"advice\" as permission, she ceased making payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Aaronson then terminated his representation before the arbitration hearing took place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65, 138, 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Feldmans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second are the Feldmans. They bought Diamond timeshare points for the first time in 2014. (Doc. 115-20, p. 40.) After Diamond increased their maintenance fees following their purchase of additional points in May 2015, they wanted to terminate their Timeshare Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-51.) So Mr. Feldman looked for attorneys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, 55.) He found Mr. Aaronson online and watched \"a video [on his website] that seemed okay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, 55, 91-92.) He then reviewed the Firm Website and looked into whether Mr. Aaronson had any malpractice or disciplinary issues from the Florida Bar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-56.) Finding none, Mr. Feldman called Mr. Aaronson because he was the only attorney he could find. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Feldman found Mr. Aaronson to be \"positive about being able to help,\" so Mr. Feldman retained him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58, 93.) And although Mr. Aaronson made no guarantee about the outcome, according to Mr. Feldman, \"[h]e was pretty certain\" he could deliver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Near the beginning of the representation, Mr. Feldman expressed that he did not want to keep paying Diamond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.) Mr. Aaronson responded by telling him that \"it would not be to [his] benefit to make any more payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115, 123.) Mr. Feldman said they \"were instructed to stop payment on the promissory note\"-\"[Mr. Aaronson] agreed that we shouldn't continue the note payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16, 124-25.) Mr. Aaronson later sent a demand letter to Diamond and filed a statement of claim on behalf of the Feldmans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-115.) The claims Mr. Aaronson asserted were almost identical to the claims he asserted for the Hardistys. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-13, pp. 141-47.) According to Mr. Feldman, the statement contained information he did not understand and other information he did not find accurate or know about. (Doc. 115-20, pp. 98-115.) Mr. Aaronson then represented the Feldmans during an arbitration hearing against Diamond, where Mr. Feldman testified about the misrepresentations made by the Diamond salespeople. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-79.) Ultimately, the Feldmans did not prevail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82, 102.) Diamond counter-sued for their unpaid contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Feldman felt that the claims raised by Mr. Aaronson-based on maintenance fees, breaches of fiduciary duty, and conflicts of interest-were not obvious and easy to prove. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121.) They retained a different lawyer to settle the outstanding amounts owed to Diamond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83, 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Instant Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based on the Subject Advertisements and Defendants' representation of Diamond Clients-both of which Diamond contends caused harm to Diamond's reputation and sales-Diamond sued. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.) Following the Court's ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 43), Diamond amended its complaint to allege:\n   <strong>\n    Count I\n   </strong>\n   , false advertising in violation of the Lanham Act;\n   <strong>\n    Count II\n   </strong>\n   , tortious interference with contractual relations;\n   <strong>\n    Count III\n   </strong>\n   , trade libel; and\n   <strong>\n    Count IV\n   </strong>\n   , violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDUTPA\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47.) Now Defendants move for summary judgment, contending that neither the Subject Advertisements nor Mr. Aaronson's conduct during representation of Diamond Clients is unlawful. (Doc. 115.)

Defendants then argue that even if Diamond had \"statutory standing,\" Diamond has failed to show that (1) the Subject Advertisements are false or misleading; (2) the Subject Advertisements deceived anyone in the target audience; and (3) the Subject Advertisements had any material effect on consumers' purchasing decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-17.)

Yet Diamond contends that it has suffered monetary damages from unpaid obligations Diamond members contracted to pay Diamond in exchange for points, which also constitutes a loss of customers associated with these delinquent timeshare accounts.

Starting with the Homepage, the text first stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   But that's not to say that you don't have any leverage, any cards to play. At the Aaronson Firm, we focus on other ways to release your obligation. One in particular: Maintenance. Your developer has a fiduciary duty to manage the resorts in your best interest. Chances are, they're in breach of that duty, in ways that are very obvious and easy to prove.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (Doc. 133-5, p. 4.) It was modified later to say: \"chances are good that your timeshare developer is exposed legally in ways that are relatively straightforward and provable.\" (Doc. 133-5, pp. 6-7.) Defendants' \"How It Works\" page also identified Defendants' approach to other vulnerabilities of timeshare developers: \"But experienced, competent counsel will know how to exploit other points of vulnerability. For example, the developer may well be perpetrating an ongoing conflict of interest. Improper handling of trust funds are [sic] also a major issue. This is where the developer is most vulnerable. This is where your leverage is.\" (Doc. 133-5, p. 8.) Upon review, the Court finds that each advertisement claims that timeshare developers are vulnerable and exposed legally, such as by breaching fiduciary duties in handling maintenance of timeshare properties and perpetuating conflicts of interest. They also communicate that, as a result, there are obvious and provable ways for individuals to get out of their Timeshare Contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Subject Advertisements also attack Diamond specifically. \"Timeshare Traps\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   accuses Diamond of \"endeavor[ing] to 'revoke' ... deeds, a unilateral act utterly without legal authority, and impose a 'points' system conferring greater access based upon amount of points purchased.\" (Doc. 133-23.) In \"Diamond Resorts Timeshare Cancellation,\" Defendants question the legality of Diamond's points system-noting that \"[i]f you've been hoodwinked into 'purchasing' your vacation, please feel free to contact us.\" (Doc. 133-24.) And in the \"Timeshare Conflict of Interest\" blog, Defendants assert that Diamond perpetuates a conflict of interest and acts without legal authority in controlling the management of its resorts. (Doc. 132-2.) Examining each advertisement in its entirety, a message conveyed is that Diamond is engaging in unlawful activity and that readers should contact Defendants to discuss legal options about what they can do about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants seek to sidestep Diamond's claim that the Subject Advertisements are false and misleading by claiming that some advertisements are accurate and by labeling the others as merely \"opinion.\" (Doc. 115, pp. 10-13.) The Court is unpersuaded. As it stands, genuine issues of material fact exist about whether the Subject Advertisements are \"literally false\" or \"literally true but misleading.\" This is in part because the record belies Defendants' claimed messages that vulnerabilities in the Timeshare Contracts exist that are obvious and easy to prove due to timeshare developers' practices. For example, the record reveals that Defendants asserted the specific \"easily provable\" claims identified in the Subject Advertisements against Diamond in over thirty cases-but lost on those claims every time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 115-5, 115-6, 133-13, 133-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-5, pp. 4-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) What is more, the record reveals that Mr. Aaronson could not sufficiently answer questions about how he could prove these \"provable\" claims or any of his accusations against Diamond-and his methods were never accepted by a judge or arbitrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-4, pp.77-78, 90-104, 127-131, 151-56; Doc. 133-15, pp. 178-208, 220-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Beyond this, Defendants' claim that select phrases and statements are opinion, and not actionable, fails when the Court, as it must, views each Subject Advertisement in its full context. Although Defendants use equivocal phrases about timeshare developers' potential unlawful conduct such as \"chances are\" and \"may well be,\" the Subject Advertisements also contain more direct, unequivocal statements about the same conduct-even calling on readers to respond. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 133-5 (stating \"[t]his is where the developer is most vulnerable,\" \"[t]his is where your leverage is,\" \"experienced, competent counsel will know how to exploit other points of vulnerability,\" and \"you owe it to yourself to hire experienced, competent counsel\").) The Subject Advertisements also directly challenge\n   the legality of Diamond's conduct, stating \"By what legal authority can they do anything at all to control the management of the resort?\"; \"maybe they can cite some legal authority for that one\"; and \"No one said that any of this is necessarily lawful.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 132-2, 133-24.) Some of these then end by inviting readers to call to discuss legal options. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) So while there may be individual statements or phrases in the Subject Advertisements that are undeniably opinions or partly true, the Court finds that each Subject Advertisement also conveys a factual basis, not solely opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   With this, the Court simply cannot agree with Defendants that a reasonable jury would find that the Subject Advertisements are mere assertions of opinion or suggestion. Let's not forget these advertisements are authored by a lawyer and appear on his law firm's website-a firm dedicated to timeshare cancellation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 133-5.) They also directly accuse Diamond and other timeshare developers of committing fraud, perpetuating conflicts of interests, breaching fiduciary duties, and other unlawful activity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 133-23, 133-24.) In them, Defendants represent themselves as \"experienced, competent counsel\" and contend there are \"obvious\" and \"easy to prove\" claims that can be raised against timeshare developers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-5, pp. 4-6.) And finally, the Subject Advertisements call on readers to contact Defendants immediately for a free consultation, with an assurance that their legal problems are not insurmountable. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Against this backdrop, the Court cannot find that no genuine issues of material fact exist on the false and misleading nature of the Subject Advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Level of Deception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Next, the Court tackles the second enumerated element: that the statements are deceptive.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-13 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Stewart Survey Report\n   </strong>\n   \").) In synthesizing the results of the surveys, Dr. Stewart concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   The surveys ... produce[ ] a pattern of responses that provides compelling evidence that the Aaronson websites communicate misleading information about the services provided by Aaronson and disparaging content about time share management companies. Across multiple items there are statistically significant\n   differences between the responses offered by survey participants who saw one of the Aaronson websites and a control letter. In addition ... the differences exceed levels that have been used by Courts in actions under the Lanham Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   The results of the surveys make clear that the Aaronson Web pages communicate to a substantial number of consumers that Aaronson can assist them with cancellation of their timeshare property contract. In addition, the Aaronson Web site pages have the effect of diminishing the perception of timeshare companies among a substantial number of consumers and suggest to a substantial number of consumers that many timeshare property companies are engaged in unlawful practices. Finally, the Aaronson Web site pages say or suggest to a substantial number of consumers that they can get out of their timeshare property contract for any reason. Because the results regarding what the material communicated among respondents who saw the Aaronson [Web site pages] differ from the results obtained from respondents who saw a control letter, the results cannot be explained by respondents' pre-existing beliefs. Rather, the Aaronson Web site pages are the cause of the beliefs expressed by a substantial number of respondents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, three items examined in the survey make clear that many respondents, and the consumers they represent, are likely to act on information that suggests they can stop making or withhold payments on their time share properties and that they would be likely to retain the law firm if there was a high probability that their timeshare developer was exposed legally in ways that are relatively straight-forward and provable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Taken as a whole, the results reported here provide strong evidence that the Aaronson Web site pages mislead a substantial number of consumers regarding the services offered by Aaronson, communicate disparaging information to a substantial number of consumers, and will cause a substantial number of consumers to take action based on such misleading and disparaging information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendants challenge the design and results of the Stewart Survey Report to support their argument that Diamond cannot prove this element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 115, pp. 13-17.) First, Defendants argue, without support, that the relevant population Dr. Stewart should have surveyed is \"timeshare owners\n   <em>\n    who want to get out of their timeshares\n   </em>\n   \" rather than the population he defined as \"adult consumers (age 18 years or more) in the United States who own or have ever owned a timeshare property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115, p. 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-13, p. 8.) Yet viewing of the Subject Advertisements and Firm Website is not limited to those who already want to get out of their timeshares. Rather, they appear on the internet-accessible by almost anyone. And, according to Dr. Stewart, the Subject\n   Advertisements tell their viewers how to cancel their Timeshare Contracts when they may not have otherwise known they could or when they did not currently desire to get out of their timeshares. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-19, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.) So because access to the Subject Advertisements and Firm Website is not limited to Defendants' suggested survey audience, the Court finds no reason to discredit the Stewart Survey Report based on the population used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, Defendants challenge the Stewart Survey Report's conclusions about deception because none of the deception rates for relevant questions exceeded Defendants' 20% threshold for deception. (Doc. 115, pp. 14-17.) In support, Defendants pick out the questions they find relevant and assert that the deception rates evinced by the results from those questions are 11%, 14%, 6%, 8%, 4%, 1%, 12%, and 0%-\"after netting out the 'noise.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Defendants then conclude that the Stewart Survey Report shows a lack of deception from the Subject Advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.) But this attack twice fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   First, while Defendants cite several non-binding cases for the proposition that 20% is the threshold deception rate sufficient to show deception (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15), Defendants ignore many cases finding percentages less than 20% sufficient, significant, and meaningful.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharm. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434603\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/578/#p594\">\n    290 F.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing cases finding that 7.5%, 9-10%, and 15-20% deception rates were sufficient and significant for evidence of confusion). Defendants' conclusions about the deception rates from the Stewart Survey Report contradict the conclusions reached by Dr. Stewart-the only consumer behavior expert here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 115-13, 133-19.) According to Dr. Stewart, the results to some questions referenced by Defendants were less than 20% but still \"statistically significant,\" and Defendants improperly calculated results to others that actually exceed 20%. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-13, pp. 27-30; Doc. 133-19, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) Given Dr. Stewart's calculations and conclusions, the Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' interpretation of the survey results-particularly with no expert for Defendants to opine on the accuracy and significance of the Stewart Survey Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Ultimately, while Defendants' challenges may be fodder for attacking Dr. Stewart's calculations or his conclusions about the significance of the results, the Court finds\n   that Diamond has presented sufficient evidence of deception so summary judgment cannot be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Material Effect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Next up is the third enumerated element: that the advertisements had a material effect on consumers' purchasing decisions. \"To succeed on a claim of false advertising, the plaintiff must establish that 'the defendant's deception is likely to influence the purchasing decision.' \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453698\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1242/#p1247\">\n    299 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cashmere &amp; Camel Hair Mfrs.

(Doc. 115, pp. 17-19.) But this assertion overlooks the circumstantial evidence in the record that could show that the Subject Advertisements influenced the \"purchasing decisions\" of people exposed to them-so this element survives summary judgment. For example, Diamond's damages expert's report shows a breakdown of the temporal correlation between when Diamond members retained Defendants and when they stopped making payments owed under their Timeshare Contracts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-15, pp. 15, 48-65.) There is also evidence that many of Defendants' Diamond Clients found Defendants through the Firm Website-where the Subject Advertisements were found. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-9.) So a reasonable jury could find that something in the Subject Advertisements influenced the decision to stop making payments or to pursue arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Evidence also exists that the Subject Advertisements misrepresented the quality of Diamond and other timeshare developers' services and the legality of their conduct in performing those services. There are genuine issues of material fact on the literal falsity or misleading nature of the Subject Advertisements as they relate to these representations (and Defendants' ability to assist timeshare owners in cancelling their contracts).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Subsection III.A.2. The Stewart Survey Report also suggests that the Subject Advertisements \"mislead a substantial number of consumers regarding the services offered by Aaronson, communicate disparaging information to a substantial number of consumers, and will cause a substantial number of consumers to take action based on such misleading and disparaging information.\" (Doc. 115-13, p. 32.) And to the extent a reasonable jury finds that the Subject Advertisements misrepresented the quality of Diamond's timeshares and business practices, they could find the materiality requirement satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453698\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1242/#p1247\">\n    299 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that materiality is shown \"by proving that 'the defendants misrepresented an inherent quality or characteristic of the product.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Basketball Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637910\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/105/841/#p855\">\n    105 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   855 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist so a reasonable jury could find that the Subject Advertisements deceived or are likely to deceive viewers of the Subject Advertisements and this deception influenced or is likely to influence their timeshare purchasing decisions.

Summary judgment is unwarranted on that basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, Defendants' contentions that none of the Subject Advertisements expressly direct viewers to stop making payments to Diamond or to initiate legal action and that no direct evidence exists that Defendants' Diamond Clients stopped payments or began arbitration proceedings based solely on the Subject Advertisements miss the mark on causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115, pp. 7-9.) While direct evidence is lacking, Diamond has competent circumstantial evidence to show that a reasonable jury could find that the Subject Advertisements\n   proximately caused Diamond's alleged injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   First, the Subject Advertisements appear or have appeared on the Firm Website, and there is testimony from some of Defendants' Diamond Clients that they viewed the Firm Website and that, in at least two instances, they watched the videos. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-19, pp. 56, 85-86; Doc. 115-20, pp. 52-55, 91-94;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 115-22, pp. 12-13.) Second, Google Analytics of the Firm Website show that the Subject Advertisements were viewed thousands of times, revealing the widespread exposure to the Subject Advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-7.) Third, for the near eighty client matters associated with Defendants' Diamond Clients who retained Defendants through the Firm Website (and were exposed to the Subject Advertisements), those Diamond Clients ceased paying Diamond within a thirty-day period before retaining Defendants for eleven matters and after retaining Defendants in another twenty matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 133-9-133-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-15.) Last, the Stewart Survey Report states that the Subject Advertisements are likely to cause viewers to hire Defendants and to stop making payments on their Timeshare Contracts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-13, pp. 30-32.) This demonstrates disputed facts exist for a jury to sort out on causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Beyond this, Defendants cite no authority to support their contention that false advertisements must expressly tell viewers to withhold trade from a plaintiff or that the false advertising must be the only reason behind a consumer's actions for a plaintiff to prevail on a false advertising claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115.) Courts have found that causation just requires that the false advertising proximately cause the claimed injury-it need not be the only cause or even the predominant cause of the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; M Turner, Inc. v.

Because Diamond has presented circumstantial evidence raising genuine issues of material fact on causation, particularly when viewed in terms of Diamond's best case, summary judgment cannot be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Counts II-IV: Florida Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Having found that the Lanham Act claim survives summary judgment, the Court turns to Diamond's three Florida law claims. Defendants seek summary judgment on two grounds: (1) Florida's litigation privilege; and (2) Diamond's lack of evidence to satisfy each claim. (Doc. 115, pp. 19-24.)

The first is a procedural error. Defendants' Motion was silent on the statements or acts they claim are protected by the litigation privilege (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115, pp. 19-20), so Defendants tried to supply that information for first time in their reply (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 138, pp. 10-11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   But new facts presented for the first time in a reply fail to provide a proper basis upon which to grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Procaps S.A. v.

Fla. 2015) (\"It is well established that a party cannot for the first time in a reply memorandum ... assert new factual arguments to support a summary judgment motion.\"). And because Defendants failed to argue the application of the litigation privilege to specific statements and acts in their Motion (thereby providing Diamond the opportunity to rebut the application of the privilege), Defendants have failed to prove their entitlement to the privilege. So on that basis alone, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on their assertion of Florida's litigation privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, had Defendants provided the list of statements and acts in their Motion, it is not clear that all the statements listed fall under the litigation privilege. While Defendants' statements made during arbitration proceedings and in documents filed as part of those arbitration proceedings fit within the privilege, there is a factual dispute on when Mr. Aaronson made statements to his clients about continuing payments to Diamond and whether those statements were necessarily preliminary to or sufficiently related to any arbitration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AGM Invs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367926\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/219/920/#p924\">\n    219 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   924 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braxton Techs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011623673\">\n    2010 WL 11623673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47, \u00b6 72.) Defendants attack this by asserting that \"[t]he advertising itself did not cause anyone to discontinue payments to Diamond.\" (Doc. 115, p. 21.) But, as discussed above, there are genuine issues of material fact about whether the Subject Advertisements caused Diamond members to stop paying Diamond.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A. Thus, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the tortious interference claim to the extent that it turns on the Subject Advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Diamond also bases this claim on Mr. Aaronson's advice and instructions to his Diamond Clients to stop making payments to Diamond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47, \u00b6 73.) Mr. Aaronson admits that he advised at least one of his Diamond Clients to discontinue payments to Diamond: Ms. Hardisty. (Doc. 115, p. 21.) But there is also evidence that Mr. Aaronson advised at least one other couple to stop making payments: the Feldmans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-20, pp. 115-16, 124.) So the question that remains for the Court is whether this advice is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   For the Hardistys, Defendants assert Mr. Aaronson was privileged to give this advice because: (1) he was acting as\n   their agent; (2) it was honest; and (3) the advice was in their best interests given the Hardistys' financial situation. (Doc. 115, pp. 21-22.) But whether Mr. Aaronson's claim holds water is questionable because the Hardistys were then sued by Diamond for these delinquent payments-after which Mr. Aaronson withdrew from representing them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-20, pp. 65, 138, 146.) And Mr. Aaronson gave this advice knowing that Diamond had successfully counter-claimed against some of his other Diamond Clients for delinquent payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 133-14, pp. 1-16 (Gutierrez);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-38 (Feldmans);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-61 (Johnson);\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-20.) Mr. Aaronson also failed to explain his motivation behind the advice he gave the Feldmans about ceasing payments-in other words, he has not shown this advice was justified or privileged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court finds that genuine issues of fact exist about Mr. Aaronson's motivation to advise his Diamond Clients to cease paying Diamond. As his privilege claim hinges on these disputed facts, summary judgment cannot be granted on Diamond's tortious interference claim based on Mr. Aaronson's advice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCurdy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7581491\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/508/380/#p383\">\n    508 So.2d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the circumstances surrounding the statement are in dispute, the question of qualified privilege is a factual determination for resolution by the jury.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Count III: Trade Libel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Next, the Court addresses Diamond's trade libel claim. To establish a trade libel claim under Florida law, a plaintiff must show: (1) a falsehood; (2) that has been published or communicated to a third person; (3) when a defendant-publisher knows or reasonably should know that it will likely result in inducing others not to deal with plaintiff; (4) the falsehood plays a material and substantial part in inducing others not to deal with plaintiff; and (5) special damages proximately resulting from the published falsehood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Border Collie Rescue, Inc. v.

(Doc. 115, pp. 22-23.) Defendants contend that Mr. Aaronson's Diamond Clients had their own reasons for stopping payments and that too many intervening steps stand between the Subject Advertisements and the arbitrations to show that the Subject Advertisements proximately caused Diamond's damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Summary judgment on this claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   As Defendants' attack on Diamond's trade libel claim stands on the same evidence and argument about proximate causation that Defendants raised against Diamond's Lanham Act claim, it fails for the same reason.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A. Because\n   genuine issues of material fact exist about whether the Subject Advertisements proximately caused Defendant's Diamond Clients to stop making payments and to pursue arbitration claims against Diamond, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Diamond's trade libel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Count IV: FDUTPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses Diamond's FDUTPA claim. FDUTPA declares unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" committed \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    Fla.

(Doc. 115, pp. 23-24.) But the Court finds that Diamond's FDUTPA claim survives. As for actual damages, Diamond has claimed damages based on the unpaid promissory notes, maintenance fees, and other timeshare fees that Defendants' Diamond Clients contracted to pay in exchange for timeshare ownership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   These are not the speculative damages or future lost profits precluded under FDUTPA.
