This case involves an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), in which Baumiller seeks judicial recognition that his prior conviction does not preclude him from possessing a firearm. The motion is fully briefed and is ripe for decision. The parties filed a joint statement of undisputed material facts. (ECF No. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Baumiller is a legal resident of Pennsylvania (ECF No. 32). He is not prohibited by Pennsylvania state law from possessing a firearm. He has not been convicted of domestic violence or the subject of a restraining order, is not an unlawful drug user, has not been adjudicated a mental defective and was not dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces. The government contends that Baumiller's conduct since 2010 is not fully law-abiding because he attempted to purchase firearms, knowing that he was prohibited from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are recited essentially verbatim from the parties' joint stipulation (ECF No. 32). In the fall of 2008, Baumiller learned that there were two gas-operated saws located in a structure in a driveway at 300 Ridge Road, Washington, Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 24-1 at 39:24-40:18; 41:11-16; 42:16-25; ECF No. 24-2 at 1). Baumiller drove to 300 Ridge Road, with the intention of stealing those two gas-operated saws - a chain saw and a chop saw. (ECF No. 24-1 at 41:21-24 (\"I drove there to take the saws and that was about it.\"); ECF No. 24-2 at 1). When Baumiller arrived, he entered the property that did not belong to him; stole two saws from the unlocked structure; took the saws back home; and retained them in his own shed. (ECF No. 24-1 at 39:24-40:2; 41:1-3; 41:11-24; 43:6-7; 43:13-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The stolen saws belonged to an individual named Michael Hodak (\"Hodak\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:1-4). In or around May 2009, Hodak confronted Baumiller regarding the theft of Hodak's saws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:25-46:6; ECF No. 24-2 at 3). When confronted by Hodak, Baumiller admitted that he had taken Hodak's two saws. (ECF No. 24-1 at 46:5-6). Hodak requested that Baumiller return the stolen saws, and Baumiller complied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some time thereafter, but prior to August 31, 2009, Pennsylvania State Trooper Thomas Schuster interviewed Baumiller at his place of employment, Goodyear Auto Service, in McMurray, Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 24-1 at 44:1-45:8; ECF No. 24-2 at 4). During the interview, Baumiller admitted that he had stolen the chain saw and chop saw from Hodak. (ECF No. 24-1 at 44:1-45:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about August 31, 2009, Baumiller was charged in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, at Docket Number CP-63-CR-0002254-2009, with Theft by Unlawful Taking - Movable Property, 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a); Receiving Stolen Property, 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3925(a); and Criminal Mischief - Damage Property, 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3304(a)(5). (ECF No. 17-1 at 9-10; ECF No. 24-3). On or about February 23, 2010, Baumiller pleaded guilty to a violation of 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a) for committing theft by unlawful taking, a first-degree misdemeanor. The receipt of stolen property and criminal mischief charges were withdrawn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 24-1 at 49:13-50:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The maximum possible sentence for a violation of 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a) is a term of incarceration of five years. (ECF No. 24-1 at 49:16-19). Baumiller received a sentence of twelve months of probation and an order to pay restitution in the amount of the value of the stolen saws, $ 1,900, as well as a fine in the amount of $ 1,205.05. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:20-50:1; ECF No. 17-1 at 9-10; ECF No. 24-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Baumiller was around the age of 18 or 19, he purchased two Mossberg 500 firearms. (ECF No. 24-1 at 15:8-19). After being convicted of violating 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a) in 2010, Baumiller was informed that he was no longer allowed to possess those firearms, and he sold them to his brother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:20-16:8). On multiple occasions after Baumiller was convicted of the violation of 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a), he attempted to purchase one or more firearms; each attempt was unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:16-22:20). Specifically, in or around the fall of 2016, years after Baumiller had been convicted of violating 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 3921(a), he attempted to purchase one or more firearms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:15-23). Baumiller was denied the ability to purchase a firearm on each occasion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:15-23:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and judgment is appropriate \"as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In Baumiller's favor, his 2010 crime was classified as a misdemeanor, involved no\n   use of force, and he received a minimal sentence. In addition, Baumiller points out that he voluntarily returned the stolen saws when confronted by Hodak and has been law-abiding since 2010 (a Step Two factor). Weighing against Baumiller at Step One, his crime has a maximum penalty of five years, which is considerably above the one-year limit incorporated into \u00a7 922(g)(1) and the two-year misdemeanor exclusion in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20)(B). The most weighty factor against Baumiller is that there is a strong consensus among the states about the crime's seriousness - the vast majority of states classify theft of $ 1,900 in property as a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , this court recognized that the plaintiff's prior conviction did not preclude him from possessing a firearm. The distinguishing factor between that decision and Baumiller's situation, as explained above, is that there is no consensus among the states that Clark's prior conviction for carrying a firearm without a license is a serious crime. Clark's conviction is not a crime at all in numerous states, in which no specific credential is required to carry a firearm. Baumiller's conviction, by contrast, is viewed as a serious crime (i.e., a felony) by more than 80% of the states. In\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the court commented: \"Were the Challengers unable to show that so many states consider their crimes to be non-serious, it would be difficult for them to carry their burden at step one.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"Not only is the burden on the challenger to rebut the presumptive lawfulness of the exclusion, but the challenger's showing must be strong.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
