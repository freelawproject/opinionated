The respondent has appealed from the judgment of the habeas court granting the petition in part and ordering the respondent to recalculate the petitioner\u2019s sentence as beginning on the date a corrected mittimus was issued, with all prior time in confinement designated as presentence confinement and credits calculated accordingly. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The following stipulated facts are relevant to this appeal. The petitioner, Michael Raucci, is being held by the respondent pursuant to a mittimus issued on May 29, 1990, by the Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CR7-72733. The mittimus provided, in count four, a term of imprisonment of not less than seven and one-half nor more than fifteen years for the crime of larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8, 53a-119 and 53a-122 (a) (2); in count one, a term of imprisonment of not less than seven and one-half nor more than fifteen years for the crime of conspiracy to commit larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-122 (a) (2), to be served consecutively to the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tence imposed in count four; in count three, a term of imprisonment of not less than two and one-half nor more than five years for the crime of burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103, to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed in counts one and four. The petitioner\u2019s total effective sentence is not less than fifteen nor more than thirty years, which he is currently serving.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The petitioner\u2019s sentence was imposed for offenses committed on October 2,1980. He was originally sentenced on November 23,1983, as follows: In count one, a term of imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than twenty years for the crime of conspiracy to commit larceny in the first degree; in count two, a term of imprisonment of not less than two and one-half nor more than five years for the crime of conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree, to be served consecutively to count one; in count three, a term of imprisonment of not less than two and one-half nor more than five years for the crime of burglary in the third degree, to be served consecutively to counts one, two and four; in count four, a term of imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than twenty years for the crime of larceny in the first degree, to be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>concurrently with count one. The total effective sentence imposed was not less than fifteen nor more than thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The petitioner was not delivered to the custody of the respondent after his November 23, 1983 sentencing. Instead, the petitioner posted an appeal bond and was released from custody pending appeal. On June 26, 1984, the appeal bond was revoked, a mittimus issued and, on May 17,1985, the petitioner was first received into the respondent\u2019s custody to begin serving the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On June 28,1989, pursuant to the petitioner\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence, and in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Stellato, </em>10 Conn. App. 447, 456-57, 523 A.2d 1345 (1987), the Superior Court vacated the judgment in Docket No. CR7-72733 as to count two (conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree) and resentenced the petitioner on the remaining three counts, as described earlier, for a total effective sentence of not less than fifteen nor more than thirty years. A corrected mittimus reflecting this resentencing was not issued on June 28, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The petitioner later appealed from the judgment resentencing him on counts one, three and four. On May 22, 1990, we affirmed the sentencing scheme imposed by the Superior Court, holding that the court had the authority to restructure the sentence plan imposed pursuant to the multicount conviction to conform to its original sentencing intent. See <em>State </em>v. Raucci, 21 Conn. App. 557, 558, 575 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 817, 576 A.2d 546 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">On May 29, 1990, the Superior Court issued a corrected mittimus, reflecting a fifteen to thirty year sentence beginning on May 17,1985, the day the petitioner was originally received into custody. The respondent thereafter credited the petitioner\u2019s sentence as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(1) 2400 days of statutory good conduct credit, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a), on the minimum sentence of fifteen years; (2) 5100 days of statutory good conduct credit, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a), on the maximum sentence of thirty years; (3) ninety-two days of presentence confinement credit, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 18-97, representing the petitioner\u2019s time in confinement prior to imposition of the first sentence on November 23,1983; and (4) thirty days of presentence confinement good conduct credit, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 18-98c, also representing the petitioner\u2019s time in confinement prior to imposition of the first sentence on November 23, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The respondent has not treated any time between May 17, 1985, when the petitioner was first confined pursuant to the judgment of conviction on counts one, three and four, and May 29,1990, when the corrected mittimus reflecting the revised sentence was issued, as presentence confinement and has not credited the petitioner with respect to such time with either presentence confinement credit, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-97<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or presentence confinement good conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>credit, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-98c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the respondent has credited the petitioner with \u201ctime served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether the petitioner, as a sentenced prisoner, is entitled to \u201cpresentence credit\u201d from May 17,1985, the date he began serving his \u201cillegal\u201d sentence, to May 29, 1990, the date on which the corrected mittimus was issued, or is entitled only to \u201ctime served\u201d credits as the respondent contends. We conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner was entitled to presentence credit for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>202 Conn. 343, 348-49, 521 A.2d 147 (1987), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) provides: \u2018When a sentence of imprisonment that has been imposed on a person is vacated and a new sentence is imposed on such a person for the same offense or for an offense based on the same act, the new sentence shall be calculated as if it had commenced at the time the vacated sentence commenced, and all time served under or credited against the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence.\u2019 It is well established that \u2018[c]redit for time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>previously served is constitutionally mandated by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment of the United States constitution which is enforceable in state courts through the fourteenth amendment. . . .\u2019 <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>[185 Conn. 124, 126-27, 440 A.2d 848 (1981)]. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) ... is a general statutory provision which requires that a prisoner be given full credit for time served on a vacated sentence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201cAlthough we did not directly address in <em>Moscone </em>whether time spent in custody pursuant to a sentence which is later vacated is subject to \u2018time served\u2019 credit or \u2018presentence credit,\u2019 we did indicate that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) requires only that some form of credit for time served be awarded, and that it is irrelevant to any other statutory credit. <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 131-32. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) does not bar crediting the time period in question as presentence confinement.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>215 Conn. 695, 577 A.2d 1051 (1990), our Supreme Court clarified the <em>Sutton </em>holding. In <em>Casey, </em>the trial court had specifically determined that <em>Sutton </em>mandated that \u201ctime served on a vacated sentence must be treated as presentence credit on any subsequent sentence for the same offense or offense based on the same act.\u201d <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>Supreme Court Records and Briefs, May Term 1990, Record p. 26. The trial court had indicated that \u201c[w]hen an original sentence is vacated and declared void, the slate has been wiped clean. The petitioner is then in the same situation he would have been in if there never had been a sentence imposed for the purpose of calculating presentence credit. Time that is spent in jail prior to the date a sentence is imposed is treated as jail time under [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 18-97, 18-98, 18-98d. Similarly, time that is spent in jail under a conviction that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>been wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean is time that is spent awaiting a valid sentencing and therefore must be treated as jail time and calculated [in the same fashion].\u201dId., pp. 26-27. The Supreme Court agreed, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s order that the commissioner treat the defendant\u2019s sentence as having commenced on the date it was imposed and credit the time served prior thereto as presentence time. <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Here, the habeas court found that under the rule of <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, as clarified in <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, the application of <em>presentence credit </em>is mandatory for time served under a vacated illegal sentence. The court, therefore, ordered the respondent to credit the petitioner with presentence credits for the time the petitioner served between May 17, 1985, and May 29, 1990, under the vacated sentence. We agree with the habeas court that the rule in <em>Sutton </em>and <em>Casey </em>is mandatory rather than permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The respondent argues that we should distinguish <em>Sutton </em>and <em>Casey </em>because in those cases, as in <em>Moscone </em>and even <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), the defendants successfully challenged their <em>convictions, </em>whereas the petitioner here successfully challenged only his illegal <em>sentence, </em>which did not subject him to double jeopardy. We disagree that the <em>Sutton-Casey </em>rule applies only when the finding of criminal liability is vacated and not when the sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The parties agree that double jeopardy is not, and never was, an issue in the present case. Our careful reading of the habeas court\u2019s memorandum of decision shows that it was not based on double jeopardy concerns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the court relied on the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>applicable statutes, all of which refer to <em>presentence credit. </em>Further, both <em>Sutton </em>and <em>Casey </em>specifically refer to the application of presentence credit when time has been served on a vacated <em>sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In this case, when the petitioner\u2019s original sentence on the second count was vacated, his original sentences on the remaining three counts were also vacated to allow a restructured effective sentence of not less than fifteen nor more than thirty years.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These new sentences were preconditioned upon the prior sentences being vacated. The habeas court specifically found that the original sentences were vacated, and the respondent has not challenged this finding. The petitioner therefore cannot be said to be serving the original sentences imposed in 1983.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The petitioner\u2019s sentence must be recalculated \u201cas commencing on the date the valid sentence was imposed.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>216 Conn. 220, 224, 578 A.2d 1071 (1990). Although the petitioner was resentenced on June 28,1989, the corrected mittimus was not issued until May 29,1990. The trial court therefore correctly determined that the new sentence must be recalculated as beginning on May 29, 1990. See <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 346 n.6. The petitioner is entitled to presentence credit for time served between May 17, 1985, and May 29, 1990, under the vacated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\"> The petitioner is also subject to additional sentences as follows: (1) pursuant to a mittimus issued March 21,1986, by the Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CR6-203590, a term of imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than twenty years for the crime of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54 (a), to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed in Docket No. CR7-72733; (2) pursuant to a mittimus issued March 21, 1986, by the Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CR6-243748, a term of imprisonment of five years for the crime of failure to appear in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in Docket No. CR6-203590 and consecutively to the sentence imposed in Docket No. CR7-72733. The sentences have not yet been executed and have no bearing on the issues raised by this petition.
