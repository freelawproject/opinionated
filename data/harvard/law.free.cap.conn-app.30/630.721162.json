The issue presented in this appeal is whether the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The plaintiff alleged that while attempting to clean a plastics molding machine, he caught his right hand in a \u201cfeed chamber.\u201d As a result, his fingers were partially amputated. He filed a claim with the workers\u2019 compensation commission, and the commission approved a voluntary agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant in March, 1988. The plaintiff also filed a complaint with the Superior Court claiming that the defendant\u2019s \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d caused the injury. In response, the defendant raised a special defense asserting that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, again raising the issue of exclusivity under \u00a7 31-284. The defendant also argued that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the exception to exclusivity set forth in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). In support of the motion, the defendant filed the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s president, Richard Scalise. In that affidavit, Scalise stated that he \u201cdid not intend for the plaintiff to be injured.\u201d The defendant also filed a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony which included the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\u201cQ: Do you believe that your employer intended for you to be injured?</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">\u201cA: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The plaintiff responded to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with the affidavit of Michael Shanok, a registered professional engineer. In his affidavit, Shanok explained that \u201crequiring an employee to place his hands or hand into the energized machine\u2019s feed chute is knowingly calling upon him to perform an extremely dangerous act.\u201d Shanok concluded that \u201c[t]he exercise of ordinary common sense was all that was necessary to determine that the combination of events which resulted in Mr. Suarez\u2019s injury would be, sooner or later, a predictable and probable event.\u201d Ultimately, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court misapplied the exclusivity of remedy provision embodied in \u00a7 31-284. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We initially note that a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment must comport with well established standards. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d While the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing the nonexistence of any material fact, it is nevertheless \u201cincumbent upon the party opposing summary judgment to establish a factual predicate from which it can be determined, as a matter of law, that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>224 Conn. 240, 247, 618 A.2d 506 (1992); <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 251, 571 A.2d 116 (1990). The mere presence of an adverse claim, however, will not in itself defeat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>motion. <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>supra; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 Conn. 34, 39, 438 A.2d 415 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Section 31-284 (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as provided under this chapter . . . . All rights and claims between employer and employees . . . arising out of personal injury . . . sustained in the course of employment are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter . . . .\u201d This court and our Supreme Court have consistently held that \u201cthe exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act operate as a total bar to actions brought by employees against employers for job related injuries. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Kimberly Clark Corporation, </em>28 Conn. App. 660, 666, 613 A.2d 838 (1992); see, e.g., <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 66, 546 A.2d 846 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Our Supreme Court, however, has carved out a narrow exception to exclusivity for cases in which an employer has committed an intentional tort. The decision in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, represents the genesis of this exception. There, the court stated: \u201cWhere such wilful or serious misconduct is engaged in by an employer . . . then a plaintiff may pursue common-law remedies.\u201d Id., 221. The scope of this common law action, known as the <em>Jett </em>exception, was further delineated in <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 102, 491 A.2d 368 (1985), where the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]o bypass the exclusivity of the act, the intentional or deliberate act or conduct must have been <em>designed </em>to cause the injury that resulted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>In discussing the critical element of intent, the court in <em>Mingadlos </em>held that \u201c[t]he word \u2018intent\u2019 . . . denote[s] that the actor <em>desires </em>to cause [the] consequences of his act, or that he <em>believes </em>that the consequences are substantially certain to follow from it.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 101. Further, the court in <em>Mingadlos </em>refused to. extend the <em>Jett </em>exception to include \u201c \u2018accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct of the employer short of <em>genuine intentional injury.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 108, quoting 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) \u00a7 68.13, p. 13-8; see also <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>221 Conn. 768, 775-77, 607 A.2d 418 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The defendant supported its motion for summary judgment with affidavits clearly establishing the nonexistence of \u201cintent\u201d as defined in <em>Mingadlos. </em>The defendant\u2019s president explained that he did not intend to injure the plaintiff. Moreover, the plaintiff, in his deposition testimony, unequivocally admitted that he did <em>not </em>believe that his employer had intended to harm him. Through this evidence, the defendant met its burden of establishing the absence of \u201cintent\u201d \u2014 the prerequisite to liability under the <em>Jett </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">It was incumbent on the plaintiff, therefore, to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the applicability of the <em>Jett </em>exception. In response to the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff primarily relied on the affidavit of Shanok. The strongest portions of the Shanok affidavit state that the defendant must have known of the extreme danger involved in cleaning the plastic molding machine and that sooner or later injury was likely to occur. With this evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the plaintiff contends that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is predicated on the notion that, at a minimum, his employer\u2019s conduct \u201ccreated a situation in which the employee-appellant\u2019s injuries were substantially likely to occur.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s argument and evidence focuses on the <em>likelihood </em>of injury, rather than the defendant\u2019s intent to harm the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence failed to establish that the defendant\u2019s intentional acts were <em>designed </em>to cause injury. Nor did the plaintiff offer evidence establishing that the defendant <em>believed </em>the plaintiff\u2019s injury was substantially certain to follow from his employer\u2019s conduct. \u201c \u2018Unless the employer has commanded or expressly authorized the assault, it cannot be said to be intentional from his standpoint any more than from the standpoint of any third person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 535, 494 A.2d 555 (1985), quoting A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 68.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The plaintiff also posits that the trial court misapplied the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test for establishing the intent element of the <em>Jett </em>exception. This argument is unpersuasive. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court explained the substantial certainty test at some length, relying on precedent from our Supreme Court. It then concluded that \u201csubstantial certainty is not tantamount to a high probability of harm.\u201d See <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Kimberly Clark Corporation, </em>supra, 667 (\u201c \u2018high risk or probability of harm is not equivalent to the substantial certainty without which an actor cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results\u2019 \u201d). We agree with the trial court that \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d as defined in <em>Mingadlos </em>centers on whether the employer <em>believed </em>the injury was substantially certain to follow the employer\u2019s acts or conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>As previously stated, it is the nonaccidental nature of the injury that ultimately triggers the <em>Jett </em>exception. <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Because the plaintiff failed to offer evidence supporting the application of the <em>Jett </em>exception, he has not established a factual predicate from which we can conclude, as a matter of law, that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>supra, 247. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We note that the <em>Jett </em>exception is necessarily extremely limited. Our Supreme Court has \u201crecognize[d] that over the years the legislature has worked out a complex statutory scheme in promulgating workers\u2019 compensation statutes and that [a]n integral part of this complex structure is the accepted proposition that an employee surrenders other claims for the certainly of the exclusive workers\u2019 compensation remedy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 760, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992). Thus, while the plaintiff\u2019s evidence may indeed be sufficient to support a common law negligence action, it falls short of establishing a genuine intentional injury. See <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>supra, 534 (while employer may have been negligent, none of plaintiff\u2019s allegations, fairly read, indicated employer genuinely intended occurrence of resulting injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
