We reverse the judgment in part and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The following facts are not in dispute. The state charged the defendant with forty-five counts of criminal activity (thirty-six felonies and nine misdemeanors). The counts included varying degrees of robbery, burglary, larceny, assault, risk of injury to a child, reckless endangerment, and criminal mischief. The incidents giving rise to the charges allegedly occurred in the spring of 1987 in various areas of Hartford county.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The prosecution and the defendant entered into plea negotiations. By the filing of substitute informations, the state offered to abandon prosecution of thirty of the forty-five charges but add two new charges in exchange for the defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty. The parties submitted their proposed plea agreement to the trial court when they appeared in court on May 19, 1988. The defendant expressed his willingness to accept the state\u2019s offer by pleading guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. Before accepting the pleas, the trial court canvassed the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">During the canvass, the trial court explained to the defendant the maximum possible sentence for each of the seventeen charges contained in the substitute information. Regarding the charge of burglary in the first degree, the court failed to recite the five year mandatory minimum sentence provided in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also miscalculated the cumulative effect of all seventeen charges as potentially result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ing in a sentence of 150 years of incarceration and $90,000 in fines. The correct figures were 155 years of incarceration and $100,000 in fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The defendant assured the court that he understood the terms and implications of the agreement and that he voluntarily accepted them. See Practice Book \u00a7 712. With that accomplished, the court accepted his pleas, found the defendant guilty, and scheduled a sentencing hearing. The sentencing hearing took place on June 2, 1988, at which time the court sentenced the defendant in accordance with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Under the agreement, three of the seventeen charges and their accompanying sentences (the primary sentences) formed the basis of the penalty. The first charge, robbery in the first degree, carried a sentence of twenty years of incarceration, suspended after ten years with five years of probation. The second charge, burglary in the third degree, carried a sentence of five years of incarceration, consecutive to the first charge. The third charge, robbery in the second degree, involved ten years of incarceration, suspended after five years. The sentence on the third charge was stated to be consecutive to the first charge but <em>the court did not </em>expressly state that it was consecutive to the second one. Pursuant to the agreement, the sentences on the remaining fourteen charges against the defendant ran concurrently, in practical effect having no bearing on the defendant\u2019s period of incarceration and subsequent probation. Nearly four years later, the defendant filed this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The defendant asserts that for several reasons his sentencing was illegal and violated his right to due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cess. He claims further that the asserted constitutional defects entitle him to withdraw his guilty pleas. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">At the outset, we note that the defendant did not preserve any of the claims that he now asserts in this appeal. Recognizingthis deficiency, the defendant seeks appellate review via the <em>Evans-Golding </em>bypass. See <em>State </em>v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973); <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We therefore review each of the defendant\u2019s claims within the framework that our Supreme Court established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. \u201c[A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. In this case, the defendant\u2019s claims do not pass muster under the third prong, because the alleged constitutional violations do not clearly exist and did not deprive the defendant of his right to due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that in order for the acceptance of a defendant's plea of guilty to comport with due process, the plea must be voluntarily and knowingly entered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Conn. 635, 639, 605 A.2d 1381 (1992); <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>29 Conn. App. 359, 363, 614 A.2d 864 (1992). \u201cThe essence of due process is fundamental fairness. <em>United States ex rel. Crist </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>745 F.2d 476, 482 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1068, 105 S. Ct. 2146, 85 L. Ed. 2d 503 (1985). Due process is an element that, when absent, produces [a reaction] which is shocking to the universal sense of justice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S. Ct. 1637, 36 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1973).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Paulino, </em>223 Conn. 461, 479-80, 613 A.2d 720 (1992). Additionally, in several different contexts our courts have required a showing of prejudice to establish a deprivation of due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims in this appeal. The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the sentence and plea agreement are illegal and, therefore, null and void. The gravamen of this contention is that the sentence accompanying the third charge is improper because it failed to provide a period of probation or conditional discharge in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>articulated any reason, however, why the allegedly illegal sentence is \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d or \u201cshocking to the universal sense of justice.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra. As such, we conclude that, irrespective of the alleged deficiency, the defendant has failed to demonstrate a clear deprivation of a constitutional right, i.e., his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Furthermore, the noncompliance with \u00a7 52a-28 by the trial court has minimal eff\u00e9ct under the circumstances of this particular case. Although the trial court did fail to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 53a-28 as to one of the primary sentences, the fact that the total effective sentence did include a five year period of probation is significant. In fact, the trial court could <em>not </em>have imposed an additional period of probation, since in this state the maximum possible probationary period is five years. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-29.* *<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, viewing the cumulative effect of the sentences imposed, we conclude that the action of the trial court in failing to annex a period of probation to the crime of robbery in the second degree does not constitute a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The defendant relies heavily on <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). There, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the crime of arson, conditional on his right to take an appeal. Id., 97-99. The statute under which the defendant entered his plea did not, however, authorize an appeal as to those issues raised by the defendant. Id. Accordingly, the court declined to review his claims. The court held that \u201c[bjecause the defendant is foreclosed from raising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>reserved issues before this court, and because the plea was given in reliance on his ability to pursue his appellate remedy, the judgment of conviction must be set aside and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.\u201d Id., 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The defendant argues, by analogy to <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, that because his sentence is not in compliance with \u00a7 53a-28, his acceptance of the sentence is unenforceable. Unlike the defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>however, the defendant in this case has not relied to his detriment on the trial court\u2019s asserted noncompliance with the applicable statute. This difference is particularly significant since the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. The alleged noncompliance with \u00a7 53a-28 on the part of the trial court did not result in any unfairness to the defendant nor did it render the defendant\u2019s plea unknowing and involuntary. Thus, we do not discern a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the third primary sentence was confused, ambiguous and illegal. This claim is predicated on the fact that the third primary sentence expressly stated that it ran consecutively to the first one, but not the second. As such, the defendant claims that he could not decipher whether his period of unsuspended incarceration would be for fifteen or twenty years.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the ambiguity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>troubling, again, we find this claim insufficient to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Even accepting the defendant\u2019s claim that the interrelationship of the three primary sentences is ambiguous, the trial court dispelled the confusion during the course of the plea hearing. Before accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the trial court asked the defendant, \u201c[YJou\u2019re telling this court that you understood when you entered this plea, that the total effective sentence ... to be imposed by the court, would be thirty years suspended after twenty, with five years probation? Was that your understanding?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cYes, it was.\u201d Having assured the court that he understood the cumulative effect of the sentences in the plea agreement, it is disingenuous for the defendant to claim now that his plea was involuntary and unknowing in violation of his right to due process. The defendant\u2019s second claim, therefore, fails to establish a clear infringement of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court misstated his sentencing alternatives. Specifically, the defendant points out two instances of inaccuracy. First, the trial court did not state that the charge of burglary in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101, carries with it a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. Second, the court miscalculated the maximum cumulative effect of the seventeen separate charges against him: the court stated that the defendant faced a possible 150 years of imprisonment and $90,000 in fines, when he actually faced 155 years of imprisonment and $100,000 in fines. We are not persuaded that these inaccuracies deprived the defendant of his right to due process enabling him to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The defendant relies on the Federal District Court decision in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Docket No. 2:91-CV0005 (PCD) (D. Conn. 1992). At issue in <em>Coleman, </em>as here, was \u201cwhether the defendant was aware of actual sentencing possibilities, and, <em>if not, </em>whether accurate information would have made any difference in his decision to enter a plea.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 4, citing <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>616 F.2d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 1980). The sentencing court in <em>Coleman </em>explained to the defendant that he faced a <em>thirty </em>year mandatory minimum when in .reality he faced only a <em>five </em>year mandatory minimum. That inaccuracy created a false incentive for him to accept the plea agreement. There, the court was convinced that the defendant would not have pleaded guilty had the sentencing court properly apprised him of the sentencing options.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Applying the analysis in <em>Coleman </em>to the present case, we conclude that the inaccuracies at issue logically had no bearing on the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the plea bargain. Unlike in <em>Coleman, </em>the trial court in this case <em>understated </em>the possible sentences. The court omitted the fact that burglary in the first degree carries a five year mandatory minimum sentence and downsized the cumulative effect of the seventeen charges against the defendant. Thus, the trial court did not create an additional incentive for the defendant to accept the plea agreement. If anything, the trial court\u2019s action decreased the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s accepting the plea. It is readily apparent, therefore, that \u201caccurate information would [not] have made any difference in his decision to enter a plea.\u201d <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra. We conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate any fundamental unfairness resulting from the actions of the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 289, 542 A.2d 299 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>19 Conn. App. 640, 643, 563 A.2d 1379, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 821, 565 A.2d 540 (1989). Accordingly, he cannot prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Although the claims raised by the defendant do not entitle him to withdraw his guilty pleas, several defects in the sentencing do necessitate a resentencing by the trial court. It is axiomatic that this court is vested with the authority to remand a case for resentencing. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>210 Conn. 519, 556 A.2d 1007 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>19 Conn. App. 48, 562 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 804, 567 A.2d 834 (1989). In doing so, however, it is not this court\u2019s function to prescribe the new sentence. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>29 Conn. App. 773, 780, 617 A.2d 933 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>5 Conn. App. <em>378, </em>390, 498 A.2d 134 (1985). The appropriate disposition is a remand to the trial court with direction to resentence the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In this case, two possible interpretations of the sentences exist, neither of which can be squared with the sentence agreed on. First, if each of the three primary sentences runs consecutively with the other, the cumulative effect would be thirty-five years of incarceration, suspended after twenty years. We reject this interpretation because it imposes a maximum (thirty-five years) exceeding that to which the defendant expressly agreed (thirty years). The second interpretation is that the second and third primary sentences run concurrently with each other and consecutively with the first sentence. Under this interpretation, the cumulative effect would be thirty years of incarceration suspended after fifteen years. We also reject this interpretation because, despite offering a lesser period of incarceration, this is not the essence of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The defendant has not asserted this matter in support of his request to withdraw his guilty pleas and, therefore, has abandoned it insofar as his due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>claim is concerned. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 586, 606 A.2d 693 (1992). This defect does, however, necessitate a resentencing. On remand, the trial court may restructure the sentences on the seventeen remaining convictions to reach the sentence that was originally agreed on, namely thirty years of imprisonment suspended after twenty years with five years of probation. The trial court should also correct its failure to prescribe a period of probation in the sentence accompanying the charge for robbery in the second degree. See part I, supra. \u201cThe guiding principle is that the [trial] court may resentence the defendant \u2018to achieve a rational, coherent [sentence] in light of the remaining convictions/ as long as the revised total effective sentence does not exceed the original.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Raucci, </em>21 Conn. App. 557, 563, 575 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 817, 576 A.2d 546 (1990) (resentencing after trial court vacated one of several criminal convictions), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>850 F.2d 327, 328-29 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 970, 109 S. Ct. 501, 102 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1988).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The defendant has not asserted any constitutional defect in this case that would warrant a withdrawal of his guilty pleas. The trial court must resentence the defendant, however, to alleviate the sentencing defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
