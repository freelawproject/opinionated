That certificate permitted a proposed facility to be located at 54 East Ramsdell Street, New Haven, to be used for those convalescing from drug and substance abuse. On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly found that the intended use of the facility was for the treatment of those recovering from a medical disorder or disease, which would be permitted as a continuation of the \u201cconvalescent home\u201d use previously granted. Because we conclude that the appeal to the board of appeals was not timely, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. In May, 1965, a special exception was granted by the zoning board of appeals permitting the establishment of a convalescent home on the subject premises. On May 9, 1989, a certificate of zoning compliance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>issued by the zoning enforcement officer to permit the use of this facility for those convalescing from drug and substance abuse. On August 15,1989, an appeal of the decision granting the certificate was taken to the board of appeals. The current property owners objected to the hearing on the ground that the appeal was untimely. The board of appeals, however, held a hearing on September 19, 1989, and, by publication dated September 25, 1989, upheld the decision of the zoning enforcement officer. On October 13, 1989, the plaintiffs appealed the decision of the board of appeals to the Superior Court. That court determined that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was untimely and that the board of appeals could have dismissed the appeal on that ground, but that, \u201cby hearing the appeal from the issuance of the certificate, the zoning board of appeals knowingly relinquished its right to argue that the appeal to it was untimely.\u201d The trial court then addressed the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and remanded the case to the board of appeals to consider whether the defendant\u2019s proposed used was in conformance with the zoning regulations. The defendants then petitioned for certification to appeal the issue of timeliness to this court, which was granted. We subsequently dismissed that appeal, suo motu, for lack of a final judgment. On June 25,1991, the board of appeals considered the trial court\u2019s remand and determined that the proposed use was permitted pursuant to the special exception granted in 1965. The board of appeals informed the trial court of its decision by letter dated October 29, 1991. On January 13, 1992, the trial court issued a supplemental decision sustaining the board of appeals\u2019 decision that the proposed use was permitted. The present appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of any municipality aggrieved and shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>be taken within such time as is prescribed by a rule adopted by said board, or, if no such rule is adopted by the board, within thirty days . . . .\u201d We recently addressed this very issue in <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 395, 398, 620 A.2d 811 (1993), where we held that \u201cthe thirty day limit of General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 is mandatory in nature and . . . any appeal not taken within thirty days is invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">There is no question but that the appeal was taken ninety-eight days after the decision of the zoning enforcement officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The New Haven zoning board of appeals had not adopted a rule regarding the time in which to appeal a decision of the zoning enforcement officer. Because the board of appeals has not adopted a specific period within which to appeal, and because the thirty day limit stated in General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 is mandatory in nature, the appeal taken by the plaintiffs from the decision of the zoning enforcement officer was untimely and the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\"> The plaintiffs, Helen Bosley and Ivy Gordon, are the owners of property at 24 Ramsdell Place and 53 East Ramsdell Street, New Haven, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> The thirty day period began to run at the time of the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s May 9, 1989 decision. See <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 395, 402-403, 620 A.2d 811 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\"> Time limitations imposed by statute are jurisdictional; <em>Harwinton Drilling &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>188 Conn. 90, 488 A.2d 210 (1982); and the failure to initiate proceedings within this time limited by statute results in loss of the right to review. <em>Country Lands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swinnerton, </em>151 Conn. 27, 193 A.2d 483 (1963). Because the right to be heard was extinguished by the passage of time, the trial court improperly reached the issue of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The trial court\u2019s decision is correct, but not for the reason stated. \u201cThis court is not required to reverse a ruling of the trial court which reached a correct result, albeit for a wrong reason.\u201d <em>Herrmann </em>v. <em>Summer Plaza Corporation, </em>201 Conn. 263, 274, 513 A.2d 1211 (1986); <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>30 Conn.
