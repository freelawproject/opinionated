We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the morning of June 24,1990, the victim was attending a party at a friend\u2019s house. The victim was accompanied by two friends, Tanya Phillips and Byron Campbell. Shortly before 4:30 a.m., the victim went to the bar to ask someone for a light for his marihuana cigarette. One of the persons he asked was the defendant\u2019s girl friend, Catherine Hammie. He eventually obtained a light from a person named Kunta and returned to talk with his friends. The defendant went over to Hammie and asked her what the victim wanted. Hammie told the defendant that the victim had asked her for a light and to dance, but she refused. The defendant then bumped the victim, and an argument ensued. The defendant pulled out a handgun, but was restrained by Kunta. The defendant, however, got his hand free, raised the gun and shot the victim in the face. The defendant and Hammie then left the party. The bullet lodged against the victim\u2019s spine, breaking his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a speedy trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary to the resolution of this claim. The defendant was arrested on November 6, 1990. On November 21, 1990, the defendant filed seven pretrial motions, which were ruled on on November 29,1990. On December 4,1990, the defendant filed a motion for reduction of bond, which was denied on December 12,1990. On January 8, 1991, the defendant filed another motion for reduction of bond, which was denied on January 23, 1991. On January 25, 1991, the defendant filed nine pro se motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These motions were scheduled for hearing on February 13,1991, but were not heard because the defendant was not present. On February 20,1991, the defendant withdrew these motions, but the withdrawal did not appear on the docket sheet. The defendant, on May 8, 1991, requested that these pro se motions be marked off. On May 21,1991, the defendant filed three additional motions. These were a motion to suppress, a motion for reduction of bond, and his first motion for a speedy trial. On May 29,1991, the motion to suppress was marked off and the motions for reduction of bond and a speedy trial were denied. On July 12, 1991, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss counsel, and a second motion for a speedy trial. On July 24, 1991, the motion to dismiss counsel was denied and the motion for a speedy trial was granted. Later that day, however, the court reconsidered the speedy trial motion and then denied it. The court reversed itself because it had not taken into account substantial excludable time due to the withdrawal of the January 25,1991 pro se motions that were not indicated on the docket sheet. The defendant filed additional motions to dismiss counsel and for a speedy trial, which were denied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>August 7, 1991. On October 10, 1991, the defendant filed another motion for reduction of bond. On October 21,1991, the defendant again filed a motion for a speedy trial. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court ruled on the motions filed on October 10 and October 21. Jury selection began on October 31, 1991, and evidence was first heard on November 6, 1991, exactly one year from the date of the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Almgren, </em>12 Conn. App. 364, 368, 530 A.2d 1089 (1987). This right is also guaranteed in article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. Id. The time limitations that govern this right are found in Practice Book \u00a7 956B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was arrested on November 6, 1990, and the information was filed on November 8, 1990. Therefore, the date on which calculation begins is November 9, 1990; <em>Lamberti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>131 Conn. 396, 397-98, 40 A.2d 190 (1944); and the earliest possible date for the filing of the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, without taking into consideration the excludable time periods, is July 8, 1991. Id. The periods of time that are excludable from this calculation are found in Practice Book \u00a7 956C.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The defendant argues that only the days on which the actual hearings take place are excluded under this section. Our cases clearly demonstrate otherwise. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>14 Conn. App. 493, 499, 542 A.2d 734 (1988), we unequivocally held that \u201cthere is nothing in the rules that limits delays resulting from a hearing to the hearing time itself.\u201d The computation period will begin on the day following the filing of the motion; see <em>Lamberti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra; and will run until and including the day the motion is heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The defendant further argues that the time delays resulting from the defendant\u2019s \u201cgarden-variety,\u201d pro se motions are not excluded. This argument is equally unavailing. \u201cThe rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules. ... A basic tenet of statutory construction is that when a statute [or rule of practice] is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Infante </em>v. <em>Porath, </em>29 Conn. App. 465, 467, 615 A.2d 1073 (1992). The words contained in \u00a7 956C (a) (4) are clear and unambiguous. It states that the \u201cdelay resulting from the hearing on <em>any </em>pretrial motion\u201d is excluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Therefore, we include the pro se motions in the calculation of excludable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As noted earlier, without considering the excludable time, the earliest that the defendant could have filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is July 8, 1991. We calculate the excludable time to arrive at the actual date when a motion to dismiss would be timely as follows: The defendant\u2019s motions filed November 21, 1990, and acted on November 29,1990 \u2014 eight days; the defendant\u2019s motions filed December 4,1990, and acted on December 12, 1990 \u2014 eight days; the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>motions filed January 8,1991, and acted on January 23, 1991 \u2014 fifteen days; the defendant\u2019s pro se motions filed January 25,1991, and withdrawn February 20,1991\u2014 twenty-six days;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s pro se motions filed May 21, 1991, and either withdrawn or acted on May 29, 1991 \u2014 eight days; the defendant\u2019s pro se motions filed July 12, 1991, and acted on July 24, 1991 \u2014 twelve days; and the defendant\u2019s pro se motions filed July 29,1991, and acted on August 7,1991 \u2014 nine days. Therefore, the total excludable time amounts to eighty-six days. Adding this time to the July 8, 1991 date brings us to October 2, 1991, which is the earliest day on which a motion to dismiss would be timely. Therefore, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s speedy trial motions of May 21, 1991, July 12, 1991, and July 29, 1991. The defendant\u2019s motion for a speedy trial filed on October 21, 1991, was timely. Jury selection in this case began on October 31,1991, and evidence was heard beginning on November 6, 1991. Therefore, the trial was commenced within the thirty days required under \u00a7 956D.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claims, therefore, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly limited his questioning of potential jurors on voir dire. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Before voir dire, the defendant proposed that he be allowed to ask potential jurors \u201cwhether they are more inclined to find someone guilty as compared to not guilty.\u201d The trial court stated that: \u201cNo, that could not, given the amount of information that they have, would not present any type of information. . . . My ruling is based on the fact that you could not intelligently ask that question in a vacuum.\u201d The defendant properly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u201cThe right to a voir dire examination of each prospective juror in a criminal action is provided by \u00a7 54-82f of the General Statutes. This right was established as a constitutional one in 1972 by including in article IV of the amendments to the state constitution the provision that \u2018[t]he right to question each juror individually by counsel shall be inviolate.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 6, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992). The trial court is vested with broad discretion to determine the extent and form of the voir dire examination. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 381, 528 A.2d 794 (1987). \u201cThe exercise of the court\u2019s discretion, however, must be tempered to comport with the goals of the voir dire examination. We have recognized that the purpose of examining members of the venire is twofold: first, to provide information upon which the trial court may decide which prospective jurors, if any, should be excused for cause; and second, to provide information to counsel which may aid them in the exercise of their right to peremptory challenge. . . . \u2018[T]he court should grant such latitude as is reasonably necessary to fairly accomplish the purposes of the voir dire. Clearly, therefore, if there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice. This is par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ticularly true with reference to the defendant in a criminal case.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 512, 525 A.2d 509 (1987). We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling unless the court has clearly abused its discretion such that prejudice to one of the parties has resulted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 6-7; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dahlgren, </em>200 Conn. 586, 601, 512 A.2d 906 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, this case is very similar to <em>Smith. </em>In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant attempted to ask the same question of jurors and the trial court did not allow it. In that case, however, the trial court suggested ways in which the defendant could rephrase the question that would make it unobjectionable. The defendant here seems to suggest that the trial court\u2019s failure to suggest ways to rephrase the question prevented him from a meaningful opportunity to inquire into a prospective juror\u2019s predisposition to convict. We cannot impose on a trial court the burden of suggesting to parties how they should conduct their cases. Furthermore, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to delve into the predispositions of jurors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n determining whether members of the venire were predisposed to convict his client, defense counsel [had an opportunity to consider] the answers he had received to questions about the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which the court did not restrict in any way.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 9 n.7. Indeed, the defendant inquired as to the possible predispositions of the jurors in great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>detail and had sufficient information to aid him in the exercise of his right of peremptory challenge. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his request for a specific instruction concerning the effect of alcohol and marihuana on a witness\u2019 credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In this case, the defendant argues generally that \u201cwhere there is evidentiary support for specific instructions regarding credibility factors, the court is obligated upon proper request to include those factors in its instructions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mancinone, </em>15 Conn. App. 251, 280, 545 A.2d 1131, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 818, 551 A.2d 757 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1017, 109 S. Ct. 1132, 103 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1989). As we held <em>in Mancinone, </em>we disagree with that premise. \u201cWhether jury instructions on credibility should specifically address any of the factors urged here by the defendant is a determination best left to the discretion of the trial court, and the refusal to give such an instruction is erroneous only if, under all the circumstances of the case, it was an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. We find no abuse of discretion. We have reviewed the court\u2019s charge on the credibility of witnesses and, considering the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tion in its entirety, \u201cwithout critical dissection, and from the standpoint of whether it gave adequate guidance to the jury in reaching a proper verdict ... we conclude that the instruction sufficiently covered the issue of credibility of witnesses, and that the failure of the trial court to address specifically [the effect of marihuana and alcohol on the credibility of witnesses] was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Id., 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly prohibited him from presenting a closing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that drew attention to the fact that the state failed to call an eyewitness to the crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The missing witness rule was stated in <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). That rule provides that \u201c[t]he failure of a party to produce a witness who is in his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u201d Id., 675. Two requirements must be fulfilled before a party is entitled to a <em>Secondino </em>charge: the witness must be available, and he must be a witness whom the party would naturally produce. Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 41, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). \u201cTo take advantage of this rule permitting an adverse inference, the party claiming the benefit must show that he is entitled to it. . . . When a witness is equally available to both parties no inference unfavorable to either party may be drawn.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>170 Conn. 417, 431, 365 A.2d 1135, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 845, 97 S. Ct. 126, 50 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>supra, our Supreme Court held that where the defendant could not show that he is entitled to benefit of the rule, he is not entitled to the requested charge <em>or </em>\u201can opportunity to argue to the jury that an unfavorable inference may be drawn from the failure of the state to produce [the] witness.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In this case, the defendant did not request a <em>Secondino </em>instruction from the trial court. Indeed, the defendant conceded that he \u201cprobably didn\u2019t meet the standard for a <em>[Secondino] </em>instruction.\u201d Nevertheless, the defendant argues that he should be allowed to argue a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version in his closing argument. This argument has no merit. The standards of the <em>Secondino </em>charge are clear. Unless the party fulfills the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>requirements of a <em>Seeondino </em>charge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra; he will not be allowed to argue it to the jury in any form, full or \u201cwatered-down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-15\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...

Failure of the defendant to file a motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of trial shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under these rules.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> The record contains only the questioning of the first three venirepersons. It is the defendant\u2019s burden to ensure that an adequate record exists for appellate review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>27 Conn. App. 643, 609 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 912, 612 A.2d 59 (1992). The limited record that does exist regarding the voir dire shows that the defendant had a meaningful opportunity to question jurors about a possible predisposition to convict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> The record indicates that the trial court accorded the defendant great latitude in this area. On the day of the jury instruction, the court allowed the defendant to reopen his case to present evidence of the effects of marihuana and alcohol. The court stated to the jury that it was \u201cgoing to allow at the defendant\u2019s request their case to be reopened and one exhibit to be introduced. . . . It\u2019s defendant\u2019s Exhibit Number 1, it\u2019s the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. There is no mental disorder claimed here, but a portion of that learned text, and the DSM-III-R is recognized as a learned text, it\u2019s used by doctors who deal with the effect of alcohol on a person and also the effect of marihuana on a person. It\u2019s probably within your common knowledge, but Mr. Mandanici has asked me to allow this to be presented as an exhibit so that he could argue from this what he feels the marihuana and alcohol, what role they played in this case. So, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>you could attach whatever weight you want to this, it\u2019s offered solely for the purpose of explaining to you something you already know, the effect of marihuana and the effect of alcohol on a person. He is going to argue from that. The weight you give this, the importance you give this is completely and totally up to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> The court charged as follows: \u201cYou heard the lawyers talk a lot about the credibility of witnesses. Let me say this about that subject. In deciding what the facts are, you must consider all the evidence in doing this. You must decide which testimony to believe, and which testimony not to believe. You may disbelieve all or any part of any witness\u2019 testimony. In making that decision, you may take into account a number of factors including the following, and I\u2019ll give you a list of six factors that bear on the credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cOne, was the witness able to see or hear or know the things about which that witness testified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201cTwo, how well was the witness able to recall and describe those things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201cThree, what was the witness\u2019 manner while testifying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">\u201cFour, did the witness have an interest in the outcome of this case or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201cFive, how reasonable was the witness\u2019 testimony considered in light of all the evidence in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">\u201cSix, was the witness\u2019 testimony contradicted by what that witness has said or done at another time or by the testimony of other witnesses or by other evidence. If you should think that a witness has deliberately testified falsely in some respects, you should carefully consider whether you should rely upon any of that witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">\u201cIn deciding whether or not to believe a witness, keep in mind that people sometimes forget things. You need to consider, therefore, whether a contradiction is an innocent lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or only with a small detail.
