We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At approximately 4 p.m. on January 29, 1990, the defendant was severely burned in an explosion and fire at a house formerly owned by his father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A neighbor described a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and an \u201corangey glow\u201d in the house followed seconds later by the defendant in flames running out of the front door. The defendant then ran down an embankment and jumped into a nearby river. The neighbor observed that the defendant\u2019s face was \u201call burned,\u201d his pant leg was ripped open and his hands were so badly burned that they appeared as if \u201che almost had gloves on.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The East Haven fire department arrived shortly thereafter and one of the firefighters, who was also a trained paramedic, observed the defendant standing waist deep in the river. The firefighter, Charles Licata, helped him out of the water and noticed that he had severe burns over a large portion of his body.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the suppression hearing, Licata described the defendant\u2019s clothing as charred and \u201cmostly burned off his body in all the areas where he had the third and second degree burns.\u201d Licata also remarked that the defendant\u2019s clothes were still smoldering and warm to the touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">To facilitate treatment, Licata cut off all of the defendant\u2019s clothing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What remained of the clothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was then left in a wet pile on the roadside.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Licata testified that the defendant did not resist treatment. After approximately ten or fifteen minutes of emergency treatment at the scene, the defendant was taken to the hospital by ambulance. A detective secured the defendant\u2019s clothing and wallet from the roadside, placed them in the trunk of his car, and brought them to the East Haven police department. The detective testified that he took them \u201c[a]s a safekeeping process so they wouldn\u2019t be stolen or lost.\u201d The police did not consider the defendant to be a suspect at that time. At the police station, the clothes were hung to dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Later the same day, due to some concern that the defendant might be close to death, a police detective questioned him at the hospital. The detective explained that the questioning was initiated because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know who he was and to find out what transpired at the fire scene.\u201d The defendant was coherent and responsive to the detective\u2019s questioning. The detective also spoke to the defendant\u2019s wife and advised her that she could come to the station house and retrieve the clothing. Although his wallet was returned the next day, neither the defendant nor his wife made any attempt to retrieve the clothing in the several months between the time of the fire and the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The state claims, as a result of ongoing investigation, that by the day after the fire the police had probable cause to believe that it had been started by the defendant. At that time, the clothing was transported to the state forensic laboratory in Meriden for analysis. Gas chromatography revealed the presence of either gaso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>line or a petroleum distillate similar to gasoline on some of the clothing. Thereafter, the clothing was returned to the East Haven police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">After an extended period of hospitalization, the defendant was charged with one count of arson in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (3) and one count under \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (4). He was tried before a jury in November, 1990, and acquitted on the first charge but convicted on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Additional facts will be set forth where they are relevant to each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The defendant first claims that the test performed on his clothing constituted an illegal search and seizure in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We start by recognizing that the first clause of the fourth amendment protects two different types of expectations: freedom from unreasonable searches and freedom from unreasonable seizures. \u201cA \u2018search\u2019 occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed. A \u2018seizure\u2019 of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 133, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984). Accordingly, the two concepts must be analyzed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We first analyze the defendant\u2019s claim that his clothes were illegally seized. He does not appear to contend that the manner in which the clothes initially came into police custody was unconstitutional. The clothing was taken from the scene to protect it from possible loss or theft. Federal and state law both recognize that the police have a caretaking function relating to property exposed to possible loss, damage or theft. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S. Ct. 2535, 37 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>166 Conn. 126, 136-38, 348 A.2d 603 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The defendant contends that the illegal seizure occurred at the moment the clothes were transferred to the police laboratory for analysis. The gravamen of his argument is that, although the police needed no warrant when the clothing was drying in the detective division or when it was transferred to another area for storage, they did need a warrant to transfer the clothing temporarily to the laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">By analogy to the cases dealing with seizure of persons, the clothing could not be considered seized absent some indication that the police, by a show of authority, restricted the defendant\u2019s right to exercise his dominion and control over it. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1980). There is no indication in the record that transferring the defendant\u2019s clothing to the laboratory provided any additional interference with the defendant\u2019s possessory interest. There is no evidence that the defendant was denied access to the clothing either before, during or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>after the testing. Indeed, neither he nor his family made any attempt to retrieve the clothing, although they were free to do so at any time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The defendant\u2019s theory would mean that, whenever property is lawfully in the possession of the police, a seizure would arise each time something happens to that property thereby requiring a new warrant. For example, if the police legally seized a pistol during a search incident to an arrest, the pistol could not be taken to the police shooting range and fired for a ballistic test without a warrant being issued. According to the defendant\u2019s argument, the transporting and firing of the pistol would constitute an additional and distinct seizure. We are not persuaded that the unwieldy burden placed on the police and the courts by this theory is justified by any concomitant benefit to the owner of the property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Notwithstanding the absence of an illegal seizure, we proceed with our analysis to determine whether the scientific examination of the clothes constituted a search. In order to take advantage of the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches, the defendant has the burden of showing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the item searched and that his expectation was one that society would recognize as reasonable. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>104-105, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>209 Conn. 596, 601, 553 A.2d 155 (1989). We emphasize that although the burden is on the state to prove that a search falls within an exception to the warrant requirement; <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 424, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986); it is the defendant who must show that he had an actual subjective expectation of privacy. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 104; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 356, 503 A.2d 566 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Whether the defendant has established a reasonable expectation of privacy is determined on a case by case basis; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 94, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991); by a factual inquiry into all of the relevant circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 331, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988). The trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the clothing may not be overturned on appeal \u201cunless it is legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or involves an erroneous rule of law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Although often referred to as a subjective expectation of privacy, the defendant must demonstrate an <em>\u201cexhibition </em>of an actual expectation of privacy.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 137 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>supra, 361; 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 2.1 (b), pp. 308-309. Mere ownership of property while it is in the custody of the police does not demonstrate a reasonable expectation of privacy. \u201c[I]t is possible for a person to retain a property interest in an item, but nonetheless to relinquish his or her reasonable expectation of privacy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the object.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 107, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>864 F.2d 843, 845 (D.C. Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The constitution protects what one \u201cseeks to preserve as private.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We recognize, generally, that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in clothing. The singular facts of this case demonstrate, however, that any reasonable expectation of privacy the defendant may have had in his clothing prior to the fire had diminished after the fire to a point beyond the shelter of the fourth amendment. First, the defendant failed to exhibit any expectation of privacy in his clothing after the police took it into custody for safekeeping. Such an exhibition is a sine qua non to successfully invoking the protection of the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Neither the defendant nor anyone on his behalf requested the return of the clothing nor in any other way contacted the police in relation to it. Second, the clothing was burned and torn to the extent that, in the view of the trial court, it was no longer usable as clothing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Third, the clothing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>removed without resistance from the defendant as a lifesaving measure and then left in a pile on a public street where it was lawfully secured and held by the police. In that situation, an erosion of privacy is inevitable. See, e.g., <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Hedrick, </em>383 S.E.2d 286 (W. Va. 1989) (accident victim taken to hospital emergency room had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his removed clothing because the area was freely accessible to police officers and others); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>88 Wash. 2d 127, 559 P.2d 970, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 876, 98 S. Ct. 226, 54 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1977) (defendant in hospital had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his clothing because it was in a semipublic area and hospital had control of the clothes).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As a result, the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his clothing was adequately supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Assuming arguendo that there had been a seizure and that the defendant had demonstrated an expectation of privacy, we next consider whether the laboratory examination of the clothes constituted a search. The state argues that the limited nature of the testing does not make it a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment. In numerous cases, the courts have held that various minimally intrusive examinations were not unreasonable constitutional searches. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra (no search in field test for cocaine); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1983) (no search in uncovering drugs through a canine sniff); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>902 F.2d 678, 680 (8th Cir. 1990) (no search in use of ultraviolet light to detect residue).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, the court considered whether a field test for cocaine infringed on a legitimate expectation of privacy. In recognizing the remoteness of the possibility that chemical testing would compromise a legitimate expectation of privacy, the court held that there was no fourth amendment violation. The court explained that a \u201cchemical test that merely discloses whether or not a particular substance is cocaine does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy.\u201d Id., 123. The reason is that such a narrowly focused test will uncover only the presence of contraband, not a \u201cprivate\u201d fact. Similarly, in the present case, the purpose of the testing was to uncover the presence of an accelerant, not a \u201cprivate\u201d fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Particularly relevant to this case is <em>State </em>v. <em>Chesney, </em>166 Conn. 630, 353 A.2d 783, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1004, 95 S. Ct. 324, 42 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1974), in which the police, acting without a warrant, applied paraffin to the defendant\u2019s hands to determine whether they would show gunpowder residue. The defendant was not under arrest at that point but, like the defendant in the present case, was merely a suspect. The <em>Chesney </em>court held that \u201capplying paraffin casts to the accused\u2019s hands did not violate the fourth and fifth amendments anymore than fingerprinting.\u201d Id., 640; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chin Lung, </em>106 Conn. 701, 723, 139 A. 91 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We conclude that the minimally intrusive examination of the remnants of the defendant\u2019s clothing to determine whether it contained an accelerant was not a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ingly, the trial court correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the analysis of the defendant\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The defendant next claims that his state and federal due process rights were violated when the trial court refused to admit evidence concerning the culpability of David Thomas in the arson. The defendant\u2019s theory of exculpation has its genesis in the will of his father, Lawrence Joyce. The beneficiaries of the will included the defendant, his sisters, Barbara Larson, Lauren Bowers, Joan Hubbard, Judith Corso and Patricia Haroskewicz, and the defendant\u2019s nephew, David Thomas. The will provided that the defendant and his sisters were to take equal shares of the residual estate. The will also provided that one sister, Barbara Larson, and the nephew, David Thomas, were to receive a life tenancy in the house with the remainder in the residual estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Sometime after the death of Lawrence Joyce, Barbara Larson announced her intention to move from California to Connecticut and occupy the house. Larson\u2019s decision was apparently supported by most of the family. As a result, the defendant posits that Thomas had been effectively ousted from his life estate and could gain economic value from the will only through the destruction of the house.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>To that end, the defendant offered evidence, out of the presence of the jury, that included the testimony of the defendant\u2019s sisters, Lauren Bowers and Joan Hubbard, as well as the testimony of Thomas. Lauren Bowers testified that when Lawrence Joyce was a patient at Yale-New Haven Hospital, she, her sister Patricia Haroskewicz, and Thomas were in the emergency room. At that time, she testified that Thomas \u201csaid to me that if there were any arguments about anything at the house, that he would burn the f______house down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Thomas admitted that he made one inculpatory statement. He testified that three or four months before Lawrence Joyce\u2019s death and approximately eight months before the house burned he had said to Judy Corso, \u201cit would be pretty hard to fight over [the contents of the house] if I burnt it to the ground.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He denied making a similar statement at any subsequent time. Thomas further stated that, at the time of the fire, his mother, Patricia Haroskewicz, lived about a mile from Jimmie\u2019s Savin Rock Restaurant in West Haven. The defense elicited this statement in an attempt to connect Thomas to a book of matches, labeled with the restaurant\u2019s name, that was found on the floor of the house after the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Joan Hubbard testified that the night Lawrence Joyce was dying, Thomas was in the hospital room with a group of his friends. When Hubbard asked him to leave, he said \u201cI\u2019ll TNT that God damn place.\u201d She further testified that, when Thomas\u2019 friends said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to trash it and torch it,\u201d Thomas responded, \u201cI\u2019ll burn the mother f_____down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>After hearing the proffered testimony and counsel\u2019s argument, the court ruled that neither the evidence attempting to link Thomas to the matchbook nor the three witnesses\u2019 testimony was admissible to exculpate the defendant. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to connect Thomas directly to the arson. Moreover, the court stated that \u201cit is collateral in nature, does not sufficiently assist the jury in its task, and, accordingly, the court deems it to be irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The admission of third party exculpatory evidence is governed by well established rules. \u201cBoth this state and other jurisdictions have recognized that a defendant may introduce evidence which indicates that a third party, and not the defendant, committed the crime with which the defendant is charged. . . . The defendant, however, must show some evidence which directly connects a third party to the crime with which the defendant is charged. ... It is not enough to show that another had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 548-49, 613 A.2d 770 (1992). \u201cThe admissibility of evidence of third party culpability is governed by the rules relating to relevancy.\u201d Id., 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In determining the admissibility of evidence, \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevancy and remoteness of evidence.\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 324, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987). \u201cEvidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 114, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Furthermore, the court\u2019s determination of relevancy-will ordinarily not implicate due process concerns. \u201cRelevancy is an evidentiary question and [ejvery evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error. . . . The defendant\u2019s rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present a defense do not give him the right to have admitted any evidence he chooses. ... In the exercise of his rights, the defendant, as well as the state, must comply with the established rules of evidence and procedure. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>supra, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The trial court had the opportunity to hear the witnesses and evaluate the probative value of their testimony. In determining relevancy, \u201c[t]he court must determine whether the proffered evidence is corroborative or coincidental, whether it is probative or tends to obfuscate, and whether it clarifies or obscures. In arriving at its conclusion, the trial court is in the best position to view the evidence in the context of the entire case, and we will not intervene unless there is a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aspinall, </em>6 Conn. App. 546, 554, 506 A.2d 1063 (1986). Accordingly, we limit our review \u201cto a determination of whether, under the circumstances of the case, in exercising its broad discretion, the trial court could legally act as it did, and not whether we, under the same circumstances, would make the same ruling.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Although the evidence might have presented a possible motive or ground for suspicion of Thomas, that by itself, is insufficient to establish relevancy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>supra, 549-50. The evidence must <em>directly </em>connect Thomas to the crime. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in concluding that the proffered evidence was either too remote or otherwise insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>cient to connect Thomas directly to the crime.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is particularly true where, as here, the defendant made no attempt to introduce any evidence as to Thomas\u2019 whereabouts at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling that the proffered evidence did not directly connect Thomas to the crime was not an abuse of discretion nor did it result in substantial prejudice to the defendant. Further, because the evidentiary ruling was properly within the court\u2019s discretion, we hold that the defendant\u2019s state and federal due process rights were not violated by the exclusion of evidence that Thomas might have committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The defendant also argues that the state failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, he claims that (1) the state failed to prove the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator, and (2) the state failed to prove, as required under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (4), that any firefighter or peace officer was subjected to a substantial risk of bodily injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we employ a two part inquiry. \u201cFirst, we review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. Second, we determine whether, on the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jupin, </em>26 Conn. App. 331, 337, 602 A.2d 12, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 914, 603 A.2d 404 (1992); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>v. <em>Gray, </em>221 Conn. 713, 720, 607 A.2d 391, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 207, 121 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 306 (1991). \u201cIn this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . Findings of fact that are consistent with guilt are afforded great deference unless they are improbable and unconvincing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">There is no dispute that the defendant was at the scene of the fire both before and after its ignition. The defendant claimed that he was at the house because his truck had broken down and he wanted to use the phone. He testified that, upon walking the approximate one quarter of a mile to the house, he noticed that the pantry window unexpectedly was open. We presume that this caused him to suspect that someone had broken into the house. He then ran to the front of the house, deactivated the burglar alarm, opened the door, hit the light switch and was immediately struck by a blast of fire. In support of that claim, the defendant presented the testimony of a retired fire marshal-fire scene analyst, who stated his belief that a faulty light switch ignited the blaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The state presented extensive testimony of the investigating fire marshal, Frederic Brow. He testified that, in his opinion, the fire was deliberately set and that the point of ignition was no more than one foot off the floor. He also opined that, although there were two timing devices discovered during the investigation, the fire had erupted prematurely. He further testified that the severe burning or \u201cdegloving\u201d of the defendant\u2019s hands was consistent with the injury he would have received if his hands were \u201cin or at the point of ignition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The state also presented the testimony of an eyewitness, who contradicted the defendant\u2019s claim that the explosion occurred as he opened the door. The eyewitness, a neighbor who lived directly across the street, testified that he had noticed that the interior front door of the Joyce house was partially open. He continued to observe the house for two or three minutes, at which time he heard a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and saw an \u201corangey glow\u201d behind the front window of the house. Seconds later, the neighbor saw the defendant rush out of the front door in flames.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Moreover, there was no evidence that other persons were anywhere near the house that day. In addition, the investigating police detective and Brow testified that there were no signs of a forced entry. Nor was there any evidence that the house\u2019s burglar alarm had sounded.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As a result, \u201c[t]he jury might have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that no one other than the defendant had the opportunity to start the fire.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Other testimony was also consistent with a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence was adduced that contradicted the defendant\u2019s claim that he wanted to use the phone at the house because his truck had experienced mechanical difficulties. First, the state submitted evidence that there was a pay phone located between the parking lot and the house, approximately four hundred feet from where the truck was parked. Second, several days after the fire, the truck was towed to a garage for a mechanical inspection. The service technician who conducted the inspection testified that he could find no mechanical problems and that the truck ran well.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The defendant\u2019s explanation of how his clothing had become imbrued with a gasoline type substance was also challenged. On direct examination, the defendant stated that, on the day of the fire, he had used paint thinner to clean his hands after painting a house in Clinton. On cross-examination, he testified that, although he had been doing various odd jobs at the house in Clinton, he could recall painting only sporadically during the two weeks before the fire for a total of approximately three hours. He also stated that he was using a water based paint, which requires only water for cleanup. On redirect, however, he asserted that he cleaned other brushes with paint thinner on that day to prepare them for use the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Accordingly, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established that the defendant was the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">There was also sufficient evidence for the jury to have concluded that there was a risk of substantial injury to the firefighters. The first firefighter on the scene testified that when he entered the house, flames were on his right and his left and that multiple fires had started in various locations in the house. He also testified that he had found firearms in the house, thus prompting him to call the fire marshal. He further stated that after he had removed the breathing mask of his air tank, he detected a chemical odor, but could not identify it due to a sinus problem. Another firefighter testified that he observed a puddle and a gasoline can on the floor of the cellar.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">When fire marshal Brow arrived and entered the house, he smelled an odor similar to that of gasoline. He continued his investigation and, upon proceeding to the basement, encountered a \u201cheavy concentration\u201d of gasoline odor and observed that water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>seeping down from the first floor appeared to be mixed with \u201csome petroleum product.\u201d Fearing an explosion, he ordered the firefighters to vacate the premises until the vapors could be purged. Brow also testified that he felt the fire had resulted from instantaneous ignition that consumed the entire first floor of the house in \u201ca large flash fire.\u201d Brow\u2019s investigation revealed that the entire living room had been covered with gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The statute does not require that firefighters have actually been seriously injured. \u201cThe statute requires proof of a risk of substantial injury, not serious injury in fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 615. In the present case, there was ample testimony as to the severity of the fire and the risk of explosion. Indeed, the defendant himself claimed that his substantial injuries were caused by an explosion when he opened the door of the house. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the firefighters were exposed to a risk of substantial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In this opinion Daly, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of arson in the first degree when, with intent to destroy or damage a building, as defined in section 53a-100, he starts a fire or causes an explosion, and ...

Neither case, however, holds that property, <em>already </em>lawfully in police custody pursuant to the police caretaking function, cannot be moved without a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\"> The quotation from <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 107, 588 A.2d 145 (1991), refers to abandonment of property.

The dissent views the court\u2019s opinion on this point to be \u201cOrwellian\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous\u201d because the defendant\u2019s smoldering clothing was removed by a firefighter and not by himself. The dissent further reasons that the defendant could not have exhibited an expectation of privacy while \u201che clung to life at the hospital.\u201d Although the defendant\u2019s failure to request his clothing is only one factor in our reasonable expectation analysis, a note of clarification is necessary. First, we see no reason why an expectation of privacy would exist if the defendant had removed his clothing, but would not exist because a firefighter came to his rescue and peeled the smoldering remains of the clothing off his body. Second, the defendant did not have to exhibit an expectation of privacy <em>only </em>immediately after the fire in order to have it suppressed several months later at the time of trial. There was ample opportunity for such an exhibition before the defendant moved to suppress the clothing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> See footnote 6, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> We do not reach the second prong of the privacy test \u2014 that the expectation of privacy was one that society would recognize as reasonable.

Indeed, shortly after counsel acknowledged that there was a search, he proceeded to argue, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L.

I disagree, however, with its disposition of the first issue raised by the defendant that challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of a test performed on his clothing. The narrow question presented by this first issue is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the warrantless seizure and search of the defendant\u2019s clothing violated his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Although the court correctly determined that the police could lawfully protect the defendant\u2019s clothing under their caretaking function, it failed to recognize that the transportation of the clothing to the state forensic laboratory constituted an unlawful seizure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to their caretaking function, the police could lawfully possess the defendant\u2019s clothing and safeguard it from possible theft, loss or damage. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>browski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.

This caretaking function, however, cannot be used as a ruse or as a substitute for obtaining a warrant in order to seize an item for investigatory purposes. See <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>supra, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The cases cited by the state supporting the warrant-less seizure are distinguishable from the facts of this case. The cases cited by the state fall within two categories: those that involve defendants who were already lawfully in custody or under arrest and whose personal effects were seized and subjected to laboratory analysis; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 94 S. Ct. 1234, 39 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1974); and those that involve exigent circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Murphey, </em>412 U.S. 291, 93 S. Ct. 2000, 36 L. Ed. 2d 900 (1973) (court upheld warrantless seizure of fingernail scrapings of a person who the police had probable cause to believe had strangled another, and who was not lawfully arrested and was free to leave the police station); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>141 Vt. 430, 446, 450 A.2d 336 (1982) (court upheld warrantless seizure of a boy\u2019s bloody sneakers by the police, who had both probable cause to believe that the sneakers were incriminating evidence and an exigent circumstance in that the boy was not under arrest and could easily have destroyed the sneakers or removed the blood from them). Once the state turned the property over to the forensic laboratory, the police shed their lawful caretaking function. A seizure occurred because there was some meaningful interference with the defendant\u2019s possessory interest in his property. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984). The seizure became one for investigative purposes and interfered with the defendant\u2019s possessory interest in the clothing. The seizure was neither supported by war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>rant nor was it within any recognized exception to the warrant requirement. The warrantless seizure for investigative purposes thus violated the fourth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The court also fails to distinguish adequately a search from a seizure. \u201cUnlike a seizure, which involves state interference with a person\u2019s possessory interest, a search constitutes state interference with a person\u2019s privacy interest. . . . Although an improper seizure can be undone by returning the seized property, privacy, once invaded, cannot be restored. Thus, the invasion of privacy occasioned by an illegal search cannot be remedied satisfactorily, even if a judge subsequently determines that the search was not supported by probable cause.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Conn. App. 207, 220, 614 A.2d 1229, cert. granted, 224 Conn. 914, 617 A.2d 170 (1992). I disagree with the majority\u2019s statement that no search occurred<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, even if a search had occurred, subsequent to the testing the defendant\u2019s clothing \u201cstill may have been valuable to him for purposes of his own testing to counter the results of the state\u2019s examination.\u201d Once violated, his privacy interest in his clothing could not be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is \u201ca cardinal principle that \u2018searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per <em>se </em>unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 385, 98 S.

Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 609, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991). The warrant requirement \u201c \u2018reflects the sound policy judgment that, absent exceptional circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>stances, the decision to invade the privacy of an individual's personal effects should be made by a neutral magistrate rather than an agent of the Executive.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 219, quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1982, 1994-95, 114 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting). The warrant requirement is also \u201c \u2018intended to eliminate altogether searches not based on probable cause. The premise here is that <em>any </em>intrusion in the way of a search or seizure is an evil, so that no intrusion at all is justified without a careful prior determination of necessity.\u2019 (Emphasis in original.)\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, quoting <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 467, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971). The police failed to obtain a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s clothing. The state also failed to identify any exigent circumstance that would excuse or justify a warrantless search.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, the search of the defendant\u2019s clothing violated the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Even if the police had probable cause to believe that the defendant caused the fire, they still required a warrant to conduct the search. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 61, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting). In that dissent, Justice Harlan stated that \u201c[t]he Court has long read the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of unreasonable searches as imposing a general principle that <em>a search without a warrant is not justified by the mere knowledge by the searching officers of facts showing probable cause. </em>The general requirement that a search warrant be obtained is basic to the Amendment\u2019s protection of privacy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the burden is on those seeking [an] exemption . . . to show the need for it.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Probable cause is not a substitute or excuse for not obtaining a warrant when exigent circumstances or other exceptions to the warrant requirement are not present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. The police, thus, could not search the defendant\u2019s clothing without first obtaining a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Even if the search did not violate federal constitutional requirements, our inquiry does not end. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ephraim, </em>28 Conn. App. 306, 309, 610 A.2d 1320, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 925, 614 A.2d 828 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>25 Conn.

Although the defendant asserts that his rights under both the state and federal constitutions were violated, he does not provide a separate analysis of his state constitutional claim. Both this court and our Supreme Court have declined to review a defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim, deeming it to have been abandoned, when the defendant has not briefed and analyzed that claim separately. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 394 n.9, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>27 Conn. App. 643, 652 n.2, 609 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 912, 612 A.2d 59 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Redente, </em>19 Conn. App. 521, 531 n.5, 563 A.2d 1365 (1989). That declination, however, does not mean that we are foreclosed from reviewing a claim if we choose to do so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The defendant claims that the search violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Our courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>have noted that in some instances, \u201cthe protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . [I]n the area of fundamental civil liberties \u2014 which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution \u2014 we sit . . . subject only to the qualification that our interpretations [neither] restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter [nor conflict with the pronouncements of our state Supreme Court]. In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut residents have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 221-22. \u201cAlthough our state constitutional decisional law is in its infancy, some distinct, principled jurisprudential theories are emerging for determining when it is appropriate to invoke our state constitution and to afford greater protections to Connecticut residents than those supplied by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of consonant provisions of the federal constitution. . . . [0]ur courts have in some instances interpreted our state constitutional provisions more broadly than their federal counterparts even where, as is the case with the search and seizure provisions of the two documents, there is no material difference between either the texts or the historical backgrounds of the two provisions.\u201d Id., 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Our state constitution has a \u201cmanifest preference\u201d for warrants. Id., 225. Failure to obtain a warrant, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>if not violative of the federal constitution, receives a more exacting scrutiny under our state constitution. Id., 224-25. In this case, however, the police were required to obtain a warrant under both federal and state constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Although the majority correctly determined that no seizure occurred when the police took custody of the defendant\u2019s clothing for safekeeping, a search and seizure did occur when the police opted to relinquish their caretaking function and investigate the defendant\u2019s clothing for traces of accelerant. That warrantless search and seizure violated the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights protected by the United States constitution and his rights under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Accordingly, since I would reverse and remand with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and order a new trial, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> The fourth amendment to the United States constitution, which was made applicable to the states in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>338 U.S. 25, 27-28, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949), provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\"> Article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> The court correctly determined that in order to assert that his fourth amendment rights have been violated, the defendant must demonstrate that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his clothing and that this expectation was one that society would recognize as reasonable. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104-105, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>209 Conn. 596, 601, 553 A.2d 155 (1989). To satisfy this requirement, the defendant would have to show that he had an actual or subjective expectation of privacy in the clothing. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 104; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 356, 503 A.2d 566 (1986). There is a somewhat disingenuous and Orwellian quality to a claim that the defendant relinquished his expectation of privacy when it was the police and medical personnel who removed the defendant\u2019s clothing. It is also circular reasoning to argue that the defendant never exhibited an expectation of privacy in that clothing. The defendant did not have to reassert his expectation of privacy in the clothing nor was it feasible for him to do so while he clung to life at the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> The state conceded during oral argument that a warrantless search had in fact occurred. While not technically bound by concessions of counsel, we should not ignore them when a different result might be attained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> The state failed to demonstrate that exigent circumstances were present to justify the warrantless search conducted at the state forensic laboratory. There was no finding by the trial court that any accelerant was visible on the clothing or that the clothing had an odor suggestive of the presence of an accelerant. The state also failed to introduce testimony that the evaporative nature of the accelerant or its evanescence required an immediate search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> In this case, the state has not demonstrated that exigent circumstances or other exceptions to the warrant requirement existed. Although they mention in their brief that both state and defense forensic experts testified to the evaporative quality of gasoline, the trial court never found that this evanescence existed and would permit a warrantless search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
