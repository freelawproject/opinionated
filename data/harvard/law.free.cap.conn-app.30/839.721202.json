Appeal 10511 is an appeal by the commissioner from the trial court\u2019s decision not to terminate Gail M.\u2019s parental rights with respect to the child Romance.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">We will discuss each appeal separately, but the common factual underpinning to both appeals is the trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning Gail M., the mother of the four children. The termination proceedings brought against Gail M. by the commissioner concerning all four children were heard at the same time, and all four petitions were decided by the trial court in one thoughtful and well reasoned memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">On July 15, 1991, the trial court terminated the parental rights of Gail M. as to three of the children because they were found to be neglected and uncared for and because Gail M. had failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of each child, she could assume a reasonable position in the life of each child. The trial court found that Romance was a neglected and uncared for child, and committed him to the department of children and youth services (DCYS) for eighteen months. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>trial court refused to waive the one year period provided in General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-43a (c), now General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before a termination proceeding can be brought after adjudication of a child as neglected and uncared for, and, therefore, did not reach the ground alleged for termination of parental rights regarding Romance.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The following essential facts are common to both appeals. Gail M., born on July 5, 1958, is the mother of four sons bom between February, 1981, and November, 1988. Gail M. has been an alcoholic since the age of fourteen. She is a high school graduate who attended community college for a period of time. After graduation from high school, Gail M. worked for three years as a clerical aid, and subsequently worked at night at a public library. She has a long history of active alcohol abuse during the lives of all of the children. In August of 1981, she entered a fourteen day inpatient treatment program conducted by SCADD,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but she left prematurely. She was found at a gas station heavily intoxicated, and had to be returned to the detoxification unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In April, 1985, Gail M. asked DCYS to place her children in foster care because she was undergoing stress. She entered Pond House, a psychiatric facility, then returned to the SCADD program and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Her children were returned to her in July, 1985. In March, 1986, she again asked DCYS to take her children, and she entered Norwich Hospital because she was experiencing auditory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>hallucinations. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic, undifferentiated type with alcohol problems. She was released to outpatient care at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, assigned a psychiatric visiting nurse, and again began going to AA. Her children were returned to her in early 1987. On April 30, 1987, she requested DCYS to place the children in foster care, again citing stress. When the social worker for the agency arrived, she changed her mind and stated that she could handle the children. On the next day, May 1, 1987, she called DCYS and placed the children with the department. Since that date, the three oldest children have been in foster care. On the evening of May 1,1987, she was taken by the police to Lawrence and Memorial Hospital because she was exhibiting suicidal tendencies, and she was transferred to Norwich Hospital where she received medication and counseling. She was released to outpatient care on June 1, 1987. In July, 1987, she discontinued her outpatient counseling at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, her medication and her participation in AA. In the same month, she was arrested for fighting. On October 31, 1987, she was admitted to Norwich Hospital due to her drinking and hallucinations. On November 4, 1987, she was discharged from the hospital because she would not cooperate in the required treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On November 5,1987, DCYS brought Gail M. to Willie J. Coleman, a psychologist, for a psychological evaluation with her three children; she left during the evaluation. On December 1, 1987, the three children were committed to DCYS by judicial order. Gail M. set up a visitation schedule with her sons\u2019 foster mothers. She refused both counseling and medication and was, therefore, denied unsupervised and overnight visitations with her children by DCYS. She agreed in July, 1988, to weekly counseling sessions with James J. Connelly, a psychologist. In August, 1988, Gail M. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>allowed to take the three children for an unsupervised visit to a park for the day. In September, 1988, she was allowed to take the children for another unsupervised day visit. In October, 1988, Gail M. and the three children began biweekly family therapy sessions with Connelly. Concurrently, Gail M. continued her weekly sessions with him. In October, 1988, Gail M. informed DCYS that she was pregnant. She was allowed an overnight visit with the three children on November 4,1988. Gail M. gave birth to Romance on November 11,1988. On November 18,1988, Gail M. had an overnight visit with the three older children, and again diming the Thanksgiving holiday from November 23 to November 26, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">On December 2,1988, Gail M. was intoxicated when she arrived to pick up the three older children for the weekend. She had brought Romance with her. Romance was not properly dressed for the winter weather. When Romance\u2019s inadequate attire was brought to Gail M.\u2019s attention, she angrily threw the baby to a thirteen year old. Gail M. and the four children were brought by the foster family to Gail M\u2019s apartment where she passed out. The police were summoned and Gail M. was arrested. The four children were turned over to DCYS, who then brought the termination and coterminus petitions which are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In re Jason M. et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The respondent first claims that the trial court incorrectly found by clear and convincing evidence that she had failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the ages and needs of her children, she could assume a responsible position in their lives. General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>\u00a7 17-43a (b) (3), now General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The findings of the trial court will be disturbed only if they are not supported by the evidence and are, in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous. <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 166, 554 A.2d 722 (1989). The statute in question requires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d <em>In re Luis C., </em>supra, 167. In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings, which are supported by the record, show, in addition to the previously recited facts, that the court had the benefit of testimony from psychologists Robert D. Meier, Coleman, and Connelly, and from Michael A. Nelken, a psychiatrist. The court accepted as factual the following conclusions and recommendation of Meier in his report of July 12,1989. \u201cIt is expected that Gail M. will continue to show periods of relative stability followed by significant deterioration of the kind leading to placement of her children. The children are likely to experience disruption in their care and environment over the next several years. The prognosis for mother is very guarded with respect to any significant changes within the next two to three years, although periods of stability may be present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The trial court carefully analyzed and made findings based on substantial evidence in the record of the needs of the three older boys. The findings show that each has deeply rooted problems that require immediate attention, and that the respondent\u2019s alcohol addiction is severe, impairing her ability to parent her children and exacerbating her psychiatric problems, and that she would be unable to care for her children in the next several years. We have reviewed the record, transcript, exhibits and briefs and are unable to conclude that the facts found by the trial court as set out in the memorandum of decision are clearly erroneous. We conclude that the trial court considered the relevant statutory criteria and that its findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The respondent next claims that the petitioner did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the best interest of the children pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-43a (d), now \u00a7 17a-112 (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, made specific findings regarding the six statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>tory factors necessary in the adjudicatory phase for consideration in a proceeding to terminate parental rights. See footnote 4, supra. The trial court found that DCYS offered and provided many services to the respondent mother. The respondent violated court orders on several occasions by drinking during her visits with the children. The children have good relations with their foster mothers and are responsive to their mother, Gail M., and regard her as an authority figure. The children were born in 1981, 1984 and 1985. The mother has maintained contact with and interest in the children, but her severe addiction to alcohol, the poor prognosis for her successful rehabilitation, and her failure to recognize the problem and rehabilitate herself make it improbable that she will be able to take the children in the foreseeable future. Finally, up until 1988, DCYS\u2019s goal was reunification of the family; the foster parents did not hinder Gail M.\u2019s relationship with the children. It was not economic circumstances that prevented the respondent from maintaining a meaningful relationship with her children, but, rather, the respondent\u2019s severe addiction to alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The trial court considered the relevant statutory criteria and its findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-43a (d). The trial court\u2019s factual findings and conclusion are supported by the evidence in the record and are not clearly erroneous. The record unambiguously shows that DCYS gave Gail M. every opportunity available to rehabilitate herself so that she could regain custody of the three older children. The respondent challenged the trial court\u2019s findings of five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>of the six statutorily established factors. We conclude that the findings of the trial court are supported by the evidence and we will not disturb them as they are not clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The third claim of the respondent is that the trial court should not have admitted evidence of her treatment at a Connecticut alcohol and drug abuse commission (CADAC) facility in violation of her right to confidentiality under General Statutes \u00a7 17-155b and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290. It is pertinent to a discussion of this claim to note that during the termination proceedings on April 27,1990, Gail M.\u2019s physical condition was such that the trial court asked Coleman, who was in the courtroom, to testify as to her condition then and there. Coleman concluded that Gail M. was intoxicated in the courtroom. The trial court found her in contempt and ordered her to enter a detoxification program for the full twenty-eight days. She entered the Boneski Treatment Center, which is a licensed public treatment facility as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-621 (17), and is administered by CADAC. Pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 290dd-3 (b), (c) and (d) and the applicable federal regulations, the trial court held a thorough and lengthy hearing in which it weighed the public interest in favor of disclosure against the potential injury to Gail M., to the physician-patient relationship and to the treatment services. After the hearing, the trial court ordered disclosure of some of the records, which Gail M. claims was improper. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-630 (c), formerly \u00a7 17-155b (b), which addresses the issue of confidentiality of records, prohibits: \u201cdisclosure of the identity, diagnosis or treatment of any such patient that would constitute a violation of federal statutes concerning confidentiality of alcohol or drug patient records and any regulations pursuant thereto, or as they may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>amended from time to time, The commission shall adopt regulations to protect the confidentiality of information obtained by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The applicable federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290 dd-3, sets out <em>only </em>three circumstances under which the records of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of any patient that are maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to alcoholism or alcohol abuse, education, training, treatment, rehabilitation or research can be involuntarily disclosed. In <em>all </em>other instances, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290 dd-3 mandates that information concerning identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patient must remain confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Paragraphs A and B of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290 dd-3 (b) (2) are inapplicable. The applicable paragraph, paragraph C as hereinafter set forth, requires a finding of good cause: \u201c(C). If authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor. In assessing good cause the court shall weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the patient, to the physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment services. Upon the granting of such order, the court, in determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.63a (a) (2) states that the court may authorize disclosure if it is \u201cnecessary to protect against . . . child abuse and neglect . . . .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 656, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987), our Supreme Court held that: \u201cThe privilege which the defendant seeks to attach to his statements at the detoxification unit is a statutory privilege and not a constitutional one. Under the circumstances, the scope of our review of the ruling of the trial court is limited. The trial court\u2019s ruling is analogous to the exercise of discretion that is required whenever the state seeks to introduce a defendant\u2019s prior criminal behavior into evidence. When a trial court, recognizing the general rule excluding such evidence, determines nonetheless that in a particular case the probative value of prior crimes evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect, we reverse such a decision \u2018only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In this case, the trial court admitted only a small part of the Boneski treatment records after a review of all the documents in the record. The critical issue in this case is whether Gail M. has failed to achieve such a certain degree of \u201cpersonal rehabilitation.\u201d Her active alcoholism is a key element. The trial court ruled that Gail M.\u2019s privilege must give way to the best interest of the children. The trial court determined that there was good cause for disclosure of the treatment information and that it was highly relevant to the issue of the respondent\u2019s mental health, an issue that the respondent herself raised when she testified that she was capable of responsibly parenting her children. Under the applicable federal regulations, 42 C.F.R. 2.63 (a) (3), disclosure is allowed when \u201cthe patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>offers testimony or other evidence pertaining to the content of the confidential communication.\u201d We do not find that in weighing the relevant statutory criteria and making its determination that there was good cause for limited disclosure of confidential information, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of Gail M.\u2019s treatment at the Boneski Treatment Center. See <em>In the Matter of Dwayne G., </em>97 Misc. 2d 333, 336, 411 N.Y.S.2d 180 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In addition, Gail M. claims that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were violated since she was interviewed at Boneski by a psychiatrist. We find this claim to be without merit. An exception to the confiden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>tiality statute is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f (5), which provides that \u201c(5) Communications or records may be disclosed in a civil proceeding in which the patient introduces his mental condition as an element of his claim or defense .... and the court or judge finds that it is more important to the interests of justice that the communications be disclosed than that the relationship between patient and psychiatrist be protected.\u201d We conclude that when the mental health of a parent in a termination of parental rights case is an issue, as it is in this case, the best interest of the child requires that the privilege between psychiatrist and patient give way once it is shown to the trier of fact that the \u201ccommunications and records\u201d are relevant to the issues in the case. We further conclude that the trial court carefully reviewed the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>ords and admitted only those relevant, and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Gail M. next claims that the trial court should not have admitted two service agreements dating back to 1981 because they are remote in time and not relevant. A review of the record shows that the agreements were relevant, and were not too remote in time, since Gail M.\u2019s longstanding active alcoholism is a central issue in this case. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Gail M.\u2019s final claim is that certain police reports were erroneously admitted. A review of the reports and the transcript shows that what was in the reports was the observation of the officers making the entries and that the entries in every aspect conformed to the business records statutory exception to the hearsay rule, contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In re Romance</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">This is an appeal by the commissioner of children and youth services from the denial by the trial court of the termination petition of the parental rights of Gail M. regarding the child Romance pursuant to a coterminus proceeding brought under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-43a (e), now \u00a7 17a-112 (e). The commissioner claims that the trial court (1) improperly refused to waive the one year waiting period by ignoring the totality of the circumstances up to the last day of trial and in failing to consider the best interests of the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>(2) should have first determined whether grounds for termination existed before reaching the issue of waiving the one year waiting period, (3) incorrectly failed to find that the commissioner met her burden of proof, and that the petition should have been granted, and (4) should not have considered the question of waiver because the amendment of the petition on March 29, 1990, takes it outside the operation of \u00a7 17a-112 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">There are additional facts relevant to this appeal. Romance was born to Gail M. on November 11, 1988. After his birth, he remained in her custody even though his three siblings had been adjudicated neglected and uncared for and committed to DCYS. Romance was removed from Gail M.\u2019s custody on December 2,1988, as the result of an incident in which Gail M., while intoxicated, threw Romance, who was caught by a thirteen year old child. Shortly thereafter, Gail M. and her four children were brought back to her apartment, where she passed out. On January 5,1989, a coterminus petition was brought under General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (e), now \u00a7 17a-112 (e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The first claim of the commissioner is that because General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) empowers the court to waive the one year requirement of \u00a7 17a-112 (b) upon finding that such waiver is necessary to promote the best interest of the child, that statute raises a disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>tive rather than an adjudicatory issue, and requires the court to consider the facts up to and including the last day of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The court found in its refusal to waive the one year requirement that up until the December 2, 1988 incident, DCYS had no plans to remove Romance from Gail M. When DCYS and Gail M. had met on November 21, 1988, for a treatment review, Romance was dressed appropriately. The court took into account all of the facts of the case, including a report from Coleman. The court especially took into account Meier\u2019s report of March 31, 1989, an evaluation that was requested by DCYS to assist with decisions regarding Romance. The court set forth, verbatim, recommendations four and five of Meier\u2019s report in its memorandum: \u201c4. Since this evaluation was directed to address only her behavior with respect to Romance, her ability to care for this child has only been assessed during a limited period of time. It is therefore recommended that a service agreement be established with Gail M., spelling out clearly her responsibilities in terms of visiting the child, gaining greater responsibility for the care of the child, following through with alcohol and substance abuse treatment, and continuing in psychotherapy for a period of at least six months. If at the end of that time she has shown an inability to rehabilitate herself, it is recommended that consideration be given to placing Romance in a permanent home other than that of Gail M.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201c5. It is recommended that a psychiatric consult be scheduled for Gail M. in order to assess the appropriateness of medication. If such a treatment is recommended, this should also be addressed by the service agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The trial court further found that the mother\u2019s ongoing progress of treatment, as shown in DCYS\u2019s treatment plans of May 1, 1988, and November 1, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>deteriorated following the filing of the eoterminus petition. The court implied in its memorandum that the commissioner should have withdrawn her petition to terminate, and followed Meier\u2019s recommendations set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The procedure for termination of parental rights is statutory and must be strictly followed because it affects a constitutional liberty interest of the parent. The one year rule appears twice in the statutory scheme of termination, in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and again in \u00a7 17a-112 (c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It first appears in \u00a7 17a-112 (b) \u201cwith respect to any nonconsenting parent, over an extended period of time, which, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall not be less than one year ... (3) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being.\u201d The court must find that statutory grounds as alleged were met by clear and convincing evidence, and a condition precedent to finding that the grounds for termination as alleged exist is a finding that \u201cwith respect to any non-consenting parent over an extended period of time, which .... shall not be less than one year,\u201d one or more of the four listed statutory criteria have been met. The decision of the court that the condition as to Romance did not exist for at least a year is an adjudicatory one. There is nothing, however, either in the statutory scheme or in the case law to prevent the trial court, once it comes to the conclusion that the ground alleged did not exist for a period of at least one year, from deciding under \u00a7 17a-112 (c) whether, under the totality of the circumstances, it is in the child\u2019s best interest to waive the one year requirement. \u201cBecause the statute entrusts the decision concerning waiver to the discretion of the trial court, the only issue on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>is whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 301, 618 A.2d 1 (1992). We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. <em>In re Cynthia A., </em>8 Conn. App. 656, 660, 514 A.2d 360 (1986). The trial court, with great specificity, taking into account both Coleman\u2019s and Meier\u2019s reports, as well as all of the facts of the case, as they relate to both Romance and his three siblings, found from the totality of the circumstances that a waiver is not necessary to promote the best interest of <em>the </em>child. We find no basis for a conclusion of abuse of discretion on the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">DCYS next claims that the trial court should have determined whether the grounds alleged existed before reaching the issue of waiving the one year waiting period. We have already covered this issue and find no merit to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The commissioner next claims that the trial court\u2019s findings support a conclusion that she met her burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, and the petition should have been granted. This claim also is without merit. The only ground alleged is General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3): \u201c[T]he child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance, or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being.\u201d This ground was also alleged concerning Gail M.\u2019s three older children. The trial court found the following on this allegation with regard to the three older children. \u201cThe children have remained in placement since the respondent voluntarily requested placement of the children on May 1,1987. Counsel was not appointed to represent her until October 14, 1987. Psychological evaluations to assist in determining what services should be implemented on behalf of the respondent and her children were not concluded until November of 1987. The fact that the respondent saw fit to attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>to work with DCYS towards the return of her children cannot be characterized as a failure to challenge the foster care placements. There is no clear and convincing evidence that the respondent failed to provide the proper care, guidance or control necessary for the physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being of her children during the periods of time that they were with her. The court concludes that DCYS has failed to prove this ground by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The trial court\u2019s decision regarding Romance M. is consistent with its decision concerning Gail M.\u2019s older children. The trial court did not \u201cmisapply the facts to the statutory requirements,\u201d nor were the conclusions drawn \u201cinconsistent with the findings of fact\u201d as alleged by the commissioner. The trial court did not reach a determination of whether the commissioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that Romance M. was denied, by acts of commission or omission, the care and control necessary to his well-being in light of its finding that a waiver was unnecessary. The statute <em>mandates </em>that the conditions exist for a minimum of one year. In the absence of a discretionary waiver of that one year requirement, the court could have found (a) that the grounds for termination were not proven by clear and convincing evidence or (b) that the grounds for termination had been proven but that they had not been in existence \u201cover an extended period of time, which . . . shall not be less than one year.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b). \u201cWhether the grounds for termination [of parental rights] exist for not less than one year is a question of fact to be determined by the [trial] court from the facts and circumstances in any given case.\u201d <em>In re Saba P., </em>13 Conn. App. 605, 610, 538 A.2d 711, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 811, 541 A.2d 1241 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The trial court made the decision that the grounds existed for less than one year, and in its discretion did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>not waive the one year precondition of the existence of one of the four conditions. There was no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The commissioner\u2019s final claim is that the March 29, 1990 amendment to the petition, made during the trial, took the case out of the one year statute. The amendment was offered by the commissioner and granted by the trial court over the objection of Gail M.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The amendment is as follows: \u201c(1) On or about March 6, 1990, the respondent Gail M. was admitted to the Boneski Treatment Center and underwent alcohol detoxification.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">\u201c(2) On March 15, 1990, the respondent was scheduled to have a visit with two of her children at the office of DCYS. Even though the respondent confirmed with DCYS social worker on March 14,1990 that she [would] attend, she nonetheless failed to show or give an advance notice of her nonattendance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The amendment alleged additional facts, not additional grounds, and thus relates back to the date of the petition. \u201cIt is well settled that amendments, unless they allege a new cause of action, relate back to the date of the complaint.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>166 Conn. 476, 486, 352 A.2d 277 (1974), and cases cited therein, overruled on other grounds, <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>171 Conn. 433, 441, 370 A.2d 990 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">In the adjudicatory phase of termination proceedings, the court determines the validity of the grounds alleged in the petition, and therefore is limited to events preceding the filing date of the petition. In the disposition phase, the court is concerned with what action should be taken in the best interests of the child, and in that phase the court is entitled to consider facts occurring until the end of the trial. <em>In re Shannon S., </em>41 Conn. Sup. 145, 562 A.2d 79, aff\u2019d, 19 Conn. App. 20, 560 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>A.2d 993 (1988). The facts alleged in the amended petition could not be considered in the adjudicatory phase, and the trial court correctly considered the waiver question. It must also be noted that, since the amendment applied to all four siblings, the court could use it in the dispositive phase of Romance\u2019s three siblings. This was a joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17\u00e1-112 (c), formerly \u00a7 17-43a (c), provides: \u201cThe court may waive the requirement that one year expire prior to the termination of parental rights if it finds from the totality of the circumstances surrounding the child that such a waiver is necessary to promote the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\"> SCADD, a program funded by the Connecticut alcohol and drug abuse commission, is the southeastern council on alcoholism and drug dependency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-132 (b), formerly \u00a7 17-43a(b), provides: \u201cThe superior court upon hearing and notice, as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant such petition [for termination] if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence, that the termination is in the best interest of the child and that, with respect to any consenting parent, such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of his parental rights with respect to such child or that, with respect to any nonconsenting parent, over an extended period of time, which, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall not be less that one year ...
