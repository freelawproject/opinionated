We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 2,1990, two Manchester police detectives advised the defendant that they were placing him under arrest on a burglary charge. As the detectives began to handcuff him, he broke free, pushed one of the detectives off balance and jumped on the other, causing him to fall to the floor. The altercation continued and, before the detectives were able to subdue the defendant, he had briefly choked one of them and had thrust his finger into the eye socket of the other apparently in an attempt to gouge out his eye. As a result of the confrontation, the detective\u2019s eye became \u201cblood-red\u201d and he was transported to the hospital for emergency care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The defendant was charged by way of a six count information and convicted on four of the counts. After the jury returned the guilty verdicts, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the count charging him with attempted assault in the first degree. He claimed that his conviction on that count in conjunction with his conviction on the count charging him with assault of a peace officer violated his fifth amendment protection against double jeopardy. The motion was denied and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d The fifth amendment thus prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense in the same trial (simultaneous double jeop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ardy), as well as in multiple trials (sequential double jeopardy). <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 35, 561 A.2d 897 (1989); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim implicates the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>25 Conn. App. 243, 250, 594 A.2d 1000, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 338 (1991). To prevail on this claim, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating (1) that the charges arise out of the same act or transaction and (2) that the crimes are the same offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 52, 536 A.2d 936 (1988). Both conditions must be met. Id. Because there is no dispute in this case that the charges arose out of the same transaction, the sole issue is whether the crimes are the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">To determine whether the crimes are the same offense, we employ the test articulated in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), wherein the emphasis is placed on the elements of the crimes; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 424, 423 A.2d 114 (1979); and the essential inquiry is \u201cwhether each [statutory] provision requires proof of a fact the other does not . . . .\u201d <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. In our evaluation, we look to the statutes, the information and any bill of particulars, but not to the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 495, 594 A.2d 906 (1991). The <em>Blockburger </em>test is a rule of statutory construction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>may be rebutted by a showing of clear legislative intent that the two statutes are to be treated as one for double jeopardy purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 665-66, 539 A.2d 133 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>20 Conn. App. 193, 197, 565 A.2d 549, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 810, 568 A.2d 794 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In the present cas\u00e9, the defendant concedes that the two statutes each require proof of an element that the other crime does not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant has made no showing that the legislature intended the two crimes to be treated as one. The defendant contends, however, that even though the two crimes as described by statute are separate offenses, they are not separate offenses as charged by the long form information in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>He argues that on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>allegations of the information the offense of attempted assault in the first degree is in this particular case a lesser included offense of assault of a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">For double jeopardy purposes, a lesser included offense and the greater offense are considered to be one offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>supra, 425. \u201cThe test for determining whether one violation is a lesser included offense in another violation is whether it is possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information . . . without having first committed the lesser.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 426; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). The defendant argues that he could not commit the offense of assault of a peace officer without committing the offense of attempted assault in the first degree because the conduct and intent of both crimes as alleged in the information are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The plain language of the information demonstrates the lack of merit in this claim. The third count of the information alleges that the defendant acted with the intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable police officer from performing his duty. The fourth count alleges that the defendant acted with the intent to disable the eye of the detective permanently. Both counts refer to the detective who sustained the eye injury. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the two intents are really \u201csubintents\u201d of the overarching intent to avoid being taken into custody and are, therefore, the same intent, we are satisfied that the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>mation alleges two different intents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the intent elements are different, the two offenses are not the same offense for purposes of the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The defendant also claims that the conduct elements of the two offenses are identical. We do not reach this claim because our resolution of the intent issue is dis-positive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">General Statues \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when . . .

Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). In addition, even though our state constitution does not contain a similar clause, its due process clause and personal liberty guarantees, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, have been held to encompass the double jeopardy prohibition.
