They claim that the trial court (1) misapplied the standard of proof in determining whether their special defense was proven and (2) improperly rendered judgment of foreclosure without evidence of the judgment lien. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The trial court reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants based on nonpayment of a loan and, in 1974, obtained a judgment against them in the amount of $4526.50. The plaintiff subsequently filed a judgment lien against the defendants\u2019 real estate. The defendants made ten payments totaling $1660 toward the balance owing on the judgment. They made six of the payments directly to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. A sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>collected the four other payments and turned them over to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Neither the plaintiff nor its counsel received any further payments from the defendants. As a result, the defendants failed to satisfy the debt owed on the 1974 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In 1988, the plaintiff brought the current foreclosure action against the defendants. In response, the defendants filed a special defense asserting that they had discharged the debt owed on the 1974 judgment pursuant to a wage execution involving the named defendant\u2019s former employer, Pitney Bowes. After a hearing on the matter, the trial court in an oral decision rejected the defendants\u2019 special defense and rendered judgment of foreclosure by sale. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The defendants claim that the trial court misapplied the correct standard of proof when assessing the viability of their special defense. The defendants concede that the trial court properly recited the applicable standard of proof, namely proof by a preponderance of the evidence. They insist, however, that the trial court in effect held them to a higher standard. The defendants claim, therefore, is tantamount to a challenge to the findings underlying the trial court\u2019s judgment, specifically the finding that they failed to establish their special defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We note at the outset that the trial court orally rendered its decision after hearing evidence on the matter. The trial court neither issued a written memorandum nor signed a transcipt of its oral decision. Although not fully complying with Practice Book \u00a7 4059,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>aid issue a detailed statement of its findings and conclusions in connection with its decision. Because the court\u2019s decision is sufficiently detailed and concise we will review the defendants\u2019 claim so as not to \u201cexalt form over substance . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>30 Conn. App. 712, 714, 622 A.2d 618 (1993); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>30 Conn. App. 224, 225 n.1, 619 A.2d 1146 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The viability of the defendants\u2019 first claim hinges on the application of the clearly erroneous standard. A reviewing court \u201cmay reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>197 Conn. 101, 105, 495 A.2d 1074 (1985). It is axiomatic that it is not the function of a reviewing court to retry the facts and gauge the credibility of witnesses. <em>Kelman </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>24 Conn. App. 398, 401, 588 A.2d 667 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In this case, the trial court found that the defendants failed to sustain their burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence the full payment of an outstanding debt. This finding was adequately supported by the record as a whole. The defendants argue that their evidence conclusively established that a wage execution discharged the debt. This position is unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">First, the defendants never established that the wage execution was actually served on the employer. While there was evidence of a letter directing the sheriff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>serve a wage execution on the employer, a personnel manager from the employer testified that \u201cthere is no evidence in our payroll or personnel files to say that any kind of wage garnishment was ever issued on Dewey Browder.\u201d The record thus amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the employer had not relinquished sufficient funds to discharge the outstanding debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The second flaw in the defendants\u2019 argument is that, even if we assume that the wage execution was served on the employer, the evidence failed to establish that the execution fully discharged the debt. In fact, the only evidence suggesting that the entire debt was satisfied came from the testimony of the defendant Dewey Browder who testified that his wages were garnished for four or five years. On the other hand, the payment history as set forth by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence reveals that funds were received in ten installments over a two and one-half year period totaling $1660. It is clear that the trial court was entitled to discredit the defendants\u2019 testimony and rely on the more detailed evidence submitted by the plaintiff. See <em>Kelman </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>supra. Thus, the court, applying the correct standard of proof, properly found that the defendants\u2019 special defense was not proven. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were adequately supported by the record and that the court\u2019s decision was not erroneous in law. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The defendants next claim that the trial court improperly rendered judgment of foreclosure without proof of the existence of the underlying judgment lien. The defendants\u2019 contention is predicated on the fact that the plaintiff failed to enter the judgment lien into evidence during the course of the hearing. We find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>While testifying, the defendant Dewey Browder clearly admitted the existence of the judgment lien. The following colloquy between Dewey Browder and his attorney reveals the admission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201cMr. Pearson: And you discovered that you couldn\u2019t get a loan because <em>there was a lien on your </em>property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">\u201cMr. Browder: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">\u201cMr. Pearson: And Mr. Krasnow [plaintiff attorney\u2019s] name showed up on the land records as the person who had placed the lien on the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">\u201cMr. Browder: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">\u201cMr. Pearson: And that was in 1988 or 1989. Did you then have discussions with Mr. Krasnow\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">\u201cMr. Browder: Yes, I did. I wanted him to take, you know, like why wasn\u2019t <em>that lien </em>off now, out of the records. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-11\">\u201cMr. Pearson: Did you get any indication from Mr. Krasnow as to why the lien had not been removed, did he discuss that with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\">\u201cMr. Browder: Well, he said that he didn\u2019t get all his money, all of the money. He only received like $1,600.00. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">\u201cA judicial admission dispenses with the production of evidence by the opposing party as to the fact admitted, and is conclusive upon the party making it. It may take the shape of a formal stipulation, or may be informal, as where a party upon the witness stand unequivocally concedes a fact for the purpose of the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Real Estate Auctions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Senie, </em>28 Conn. App. 563, 572, 611 A.2d 452 (1992). An admission operates to bind real parties in interest whose interests are similar to those of the declarant. <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Eager, </em>129 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>62, 65, 26 A.2d 352 (1942); 2 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1988) \u00a7 101b.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In the course of testimony, the defendants acknowledged the existence of a judgment lien on their real property. Furthermore, the reference to the name of the plaintiffs attorney as appearing on the land records adequately established the existence of the specific lien now at issue. It is thus disingenuous for the defendants to contend now that a judgment lien never existed. We conclude that the testimony of the defendant Dewey Browder conceding the existence of the lien at issue dispensed with the necessity for production of evidence by the plaintiff as to the fact admitted and is conclusive upon the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\"> Only the defendant property owners are involved in this appeal. We will refer to them in this opinion as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4059 provides in pertinent part: \u201c[W]hen rendering judgments in trials to the court . . . the court shall, either orally or in writing, state its decision on the issues in the case and, if there are factual issues, the factual basis of its decision. The court shall include in its decision its conclusion as to each claim of law raised by the parties. If oral, the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>sion shall be recorded by a court reporter and, if there is an appeal, the trial judge shall order the decision transcribed and the transcript of the decision shall be signed by the trial judge and filed in the trial court within ten days of the filing of the appeal. If written, the decision shall be stated in a memorandum of decision, which shall be filed with the clerk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Additionally, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sought to have the trial court take judicial notice of the judgment lien. At the conclusion of the hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel presented the court with a certified copy of the lien and the following interaction between counsel and the court ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">\u201cMr. Krasnow: I have a certified copy of our judgment lien which I don\u2019t believe is in the file\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 All right\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">\u201cMr. Krasnow: \u2014 which would require\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">\u201cThe Court \u2014 I think it was in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">\u201cMr. Krasnow: Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">In fact, the plaintiff had filed a copy of the lien along with its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">There is no question that the better course would have been for plaintiff\u2019s counsel to introduce the judgment lien into evidence. Still, the claim asserted by the defendants is that no lien existed. This assertion finds no support in the record and squarely contradicts the defendant Dewey Browder\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we find no merit in the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiff failed to establish the existence of the judgment lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
