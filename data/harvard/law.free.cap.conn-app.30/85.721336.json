Green and the Torrington Inland Wetlands Commission (commission), appeal from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a decision of the commission. The dispositive issues are (1) whether the plaintiff was entitled to party status before the commission under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 (8)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 4-177a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), and (2) whether the commission was required to hold a new public hearing upon remand from the previous trial court decision concerning this matter. We hold that the UAPA does not apply to proceedings before the commission, and, further, that the commission was not required to conduct an additional public hearing in order to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We, therefore, remand this case to the trial court with direction to remand to the commission for further proceedings in order to comply with the directive of \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The facts, which are essentially undisputed, involve an earlier appeal to this court as well as several proceedings before the commission. <em>Klug </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands </em>Commission, 19 Conn. App. 713, 563 A.2d 755 (1989) (hereinafter <em>Klug I). </em>In November, 1987, Eugene F. Green applied to the commission for a permit to conduct certain regulated activities in a wetlands area in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Torrington. On March 22,1988, after a public hearing, the commission granted Green\u2019s application and published notice of its decision in a local newspaper. In April, 1988, the plaintiff, an abutting landowner, appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the trial court, naming and serving as defendants the commission and the state department of environmental protection. That appeal was taken pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 22a-43, as amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-338,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which governed the appeal to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The commission moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on the basis of her failure to name and serve Green as a defendant. The court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and the first appeal to this court followed. We held that the trial court improperly ruled that General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, rather than \u00a7 22a-43, governed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. <em>Klug I, </em>supra. We further held that a UAPA agency is statutorily defined as a state agency, concluding that the commission was a local agency not acting as an agent of the state when it granted the challenged permit. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>heard the case on remand and, by decision dated September 4, 1990, rendered judgment remanding the application to the commission for \u201cfurther proceedings addressing each and every one of the criteria in terms of declaring a finding on the mandate of no feasible and prudent alternative in accordance with \u00a7 22a-41 (b) of the General Statutes.\u201d After Judge Moraghan\u2019s remand, the commission held several meetings at which it discussed the Green application. At the meeting on December 18,1990, the plaintiff presented several petitions to the commission, including a petition for party status made pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a74-166 (8) and 4-177a (a) and a petition for permission to present additional evidence. The commission did not act as a whole on the petitions or on the matter of whether a new public hearing should be held. The chair of the commission indicated, however, that the commission declined to entertain the Klug petitions, neither granting nor denying them. Acting on the advice of its counsel that the commission was not empowered to hold a further public hearing on the matter, the chair further indicated that the commission would not take any additional evidence on the Green application.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On March 27, 1991, the commission granted the Green application in part and denied it in part. Regarding the portions of the application that were granted, the commission indicated that \u201cno prudent and feasible alternatives\u201d exist. The commission, however, neither specified the reasons for those findings nor addressed the criteria specified in \u00a7 22a-41, as ordered by Judge Moraghan. The decision of March 27, 1991, was appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 22a-43 and 4-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">On appeal, the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>rendered judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, holding that the commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>discretion (1) in failing to grant the plaintiff party status or to consider the petitions that she had filed, and (2) in failing to hold a public hearing as it understood Judge Moraghan had directed on September 4, 1992. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The defendants raise two principal claims in this appeal: (1) that the trial court improperly held that the commission should have granted party status to the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 (8) and 4-177a (a); and (2) that the trial court improperly found that, on remand following Judge Moraghan\u2019s decision, the commission was required to hold a new public hearing. We find the defendants\u2019 arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The defendants correctly assert that the UAPA does not govern procedures <em>before </em>an inland wetlands commission. Rather the UAPA applies only to appealsjrom the commission to the Superior Court. As such, the plaintiff was not entitled to party status pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 (8) and 4-177a of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We are mindful that in analyzing legislative action our goal is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987). In doing so, \u201c[w]e look first to the plain, unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Arway </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>29 Conn. App. 469, 473, 615 A.2d 1075 (1992), <em>citing Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). Absent any ambiguity, we cannot properly engage in an analysis of the history underlying a governing statute. <em>Arway </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In this case, the relevant language of the Inland Wetlands Act then in effect is plain and unambiguous. General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 22a-43 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-338, provides in pertinent part that \u201cany person owning or occupying land which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>abuts any portion of land . . . involved in any regulation, order, decision or action made pursuant to [the Inland Wetlands Act] may appeal to the superior court ... in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\u201d This language on its face indicates that the legislature intended to do no more than provide a procedural framework for appeals taken from the commission to the Superior Court. A plain reading of that statutory language leaves no room for doubt as to this limited legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Indeed, in <em>Klug I, </em>supra, we held that the commission was a local board and not subject to the provisions of the UAPA. Although the legislature has amended \u00a7 4-183 since our decision in <em>Klug I, </em>supra, this change does not affect the issue of whether the UAPA governs the commission\u2019s actions prior to an appeal to the Superior Court. While expanding its application to all appeals from the commission rather than merely to \u201ccontested cases,\u201d the amendment to \u00a7 4-183 did not operate to make the UAPA applicable to proceedings of the commission itself. In short, we conclude that the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 22a-43 (a) governs, not proceedings <em>before </em>the commission, but rather appeals <em>from </em>the commission to the Superior Court. The trial court, therefore, improperly determined that the plaintiff was entitled to party status before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The defendants next claim that the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>improperly interpreted Judge Moraghan\u2019s prior remand order as requiring the commission to conduct a public hearing. We agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The following additional aspects of the record are relevant to the disposition of this claim. As noted above, the record reveals that Judge Moraghan ordered \u201cthe application . . . remanded to the commission for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ther proceedings addressing each and every one of the criteria in terms of declaring a finding on the mandate of no feasible and prudent alternative in accordance with \u00a7 22a-41 (b) of the General Statutes.\u201d Earlier in his decision, Judge Moraghan indicated that \u201c[t]his court is satisfied that a commission is obligated to make a finding with regard to \u2018feasible and prudent alternatives.\u2019 \u201d The court further noted that \u201c[a] review of the record discloses that while alternatives to certain aspects of the regulated activities <em>were considered </em>by the commission, the commission failed to make the \u2018no feasible and prudent alternative\u2019 finding as required by the statute. This court is constrained by the commission\u2019s failure to make the subject finding to order a remand/or <em>that specific purpose.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See <em>A.D.A.M. Land Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>21 Conn. App. 122, 572 A.2d 364 (1990). Judge Moraghan further observed that \u201ca commission is obligated to make a finding with regard to \u2018feasible and prudent alternatives.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Our interpretation of Judge Moraghan\u2019s remand order must comport with established guidelines for the interpretation of judgments. As an issue of law, \u201c \u2018[t]he interpretation of a judgment may involve the circumstances surrounding the making of the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nauss </em>v. <em>Pinkes, </em>2 Conn App. 400, 411, 480 A.2d 568, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 808, 483 A.2d 612 (1984). \u201cThe determinative factor is the intention of the court as gathered from all parts of the judgment. . . . Effect must be given to that which is clearly implied as well as to that which is expressed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>197 Conn. 189, 196-97, 496 A.2d 491 (1985). Mindful of these principles, we do not read Judge Moraghan\u2019s remand order as requiring the commission to conduct an additional public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>In this case, the commission had already conducted a public hearing, at which time citizens, including the plaintiff, were afforded an opportunity to be heard. Upon this hearing, the commission rendered its decision by granting the disputed application. As Judge Moraghan made clear in his decision, the commission \u201cconsidered\u201d alternatives to the regulated activities. The agency granted the application, however, without expressly stating its findings as to prudent and feasible alternatives. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41. It was this deficiency that Judge Moraghan sought to rectify when ordering the case remanded to the commission. His order is devoid of any reference to the need for an additional public hearing in order for the commission to comply with \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Established definitions of the term \u201cproceeding\u201d also bear out this interpretation of Judge Moraghan\u2019s remand order. For example, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cproceeding\u201d as, inter alia, \u201cany action, hearing, investigation, inquest or inquiry (whether conducted by a court, administrative agency ... or any other person authorized by law) in which, pursuant to law, testimony can be compelled to be given.\u201d This definition is premised on the notion that \u201chearing\u201d is a subset of \u201cproceeding.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201cproceeding\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d are synonymous is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Moreover, the applicable enabling statute makes clear that for each application the commission may only conduct one public hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-39. \u201c \u2018An administrative agency can act only within the bounds of authority granted to it by its enabling statute and within constitutional limitations. It is wholly without power to modify, dilute or change in any way the statutory provisions from which it derives its authority . . . .\u2019 <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Insurance Department, </em>9 Conn. App. 622, 626, 520 A.2d 1038 (1987).\u201d <em>Nelseco </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>27 Conn. App. 614, 620, 608 A.2d 707 (1992). Here, \u00a7 22a-39 provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall . . . [cjonduct <em>a </em>public hearing . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no provision in the Inland Wetlands Act that authorizes multiple public hearings for a single application.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of similar enabling statutes supports this reading of \u00a7 22a-39. For instance, in <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>184 Conn. 450, 452-54, 440 A.2d 163 (1981), the court addressed the public hearing provision of General Statutes \u00a7 8-26, which governs the approval of subdivisions. This statute provided, inter alia, that \u201cthe commission may hold <em>a </em>public hearing regarding any subdivision proposal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court specifically stated that \u201c\u00a7 8-26 does not authorize multiple public hearings in connection with a single subdivision proposal.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not interpret Judge Moraghan\u2019s decision as suggesting that the commission conduct itself in such a way as to exceed the scope of the enabling statute. The remand order simply requested the commission to articulate its findings regarding the issue of feasible and prudent alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We conclude that the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>misinterpreted Judge Moraghan\u2019s remand order when ordering the commission to conduct a second public hearing. Judge Moraghan\u2019s order appropriately remanded the case to the commission for an articulation of its basis for granting Green\u2019s application in accordance with \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment remanding the case to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion in order to comply with the directive of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (8) provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Party\u2019 means each person . . .
