We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 3,1990, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the defendant, Michael J. Gilbert, left Hank\u2019s Restaurant on Route 6 in Brooklyn, Connecticut. He had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>there for a few hours and had consumed some alcoholic drinks and pizza. Outside the restaurant, he smelled of alcohol, his speech was slurred and his balance was unsteady. He shuffled when walking and faltered getting into his vehicle, a 1981 Ford Escort. He slumped out of the driver\u2019s window and dropped his keys. His eyes were bloodshot and watery. He was upset and planned to drive to another bar located in another town.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Some time before 9 p.m., the defendant, driving in the westbound lane on Route 6 with his headlights off, collided with a vehicle being operated in the eastbound lane. Route 6 is a two lane road, with one lane in each direction; the posted speed limit is forty-five miles per hour. The weather at the time was clear, and the road conditions were dry. The driver of the other vehicle, a 1980 Toyota Corolla, died as a result of injuries she received in the accident. The defendant was found unconscious in the driver\u2019s seat of his car. He smelled of alcohol, and there were several open and empty beer cans in the vehicle, as well as a number of unopened cans of beer. The point of impact appeared to be in the the eastbound lane, in which the victim was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The defendant was taken to Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, where, as part of the hospital\u2019s regular course of diagnosis and treatment of trauma patients, a blood sample was taken. The test revealed that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level per deciliter was 0.226, which translates to a 0.194 percent alcohol ratio. As a result of the accident, the defendant suffered a traumatic brain injury which resulted in temporary paralysis and coma. In addition, the defendant suffered some loss of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The defendant contends that he suffers from amnesia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a result of the accident and cannot recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the events in his life from two weeks before the accident until five weeks afterward. This condition, he claims, prevented him from exercising his constitutional right to due process of law as provided by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution. Specifically, the defendant claims that he did not receive a fair trial because he could not testify on his own behalf, confront witnesses, call witnesses, establish a defense, and have effective assistance of counsel. Since his amnesia is permanent, the defendant claims that he can never be tried because he can never obtain a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We note initially that the defendant does not claim on appeal that he was incompetent to stand trial, as defined under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While he acknowledges that he understands the nature of the proceedings, he claims that, as a matter of law, his amnesia precludes him from ever receiving a fair trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As part of this claim, he contends that the trial court improperly denied his motion in limine, in which he sought to prevent two witnesses from testifying about conversations they had with him outside Hank\u2019s Res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>taurant before the accident because he could not \u201cconfront\u201d them, having no memory of the encounters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We do not agree that amnesia was a bar to trial of the defendant under the facts of this case. The defendant concedes, and we agree, that amnesia is not a per se bar to criminal prosecution. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>406 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F.2d 460, 462-63 (D.C. Cir. 1968). The defendant urges us to adopt, as did the <em>Wilson </em>court, a multifactor approach to the question of whether a defendant\u2019s loss of memory precludes his prosecution. Under the <em>Wilson </em>approach, he claims, he should never be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the court framed the due process inquiry as whether a defendant could, in light of his amnesia, \u201c \u2018perform the functions essential to the fairness and accuracy of the particular proceedings in which he is personally involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 463. The <em>Wilson </em>court chose to resolve this question by requiring the trial court to conduct both a pretrial competency hearing and a posttrial determination that the defendant had been able to perform these essential functions. The court listed six factors for the trial court to consider in determining the effect of the amnesia on the trial\u2019s fairness: (1) the extent to which the amnesia affected the defendant\u2019s ability to consult with or assist his attorney; (2) the extent to which the amnesia affected his ability to testify in his own behalf; (3) the extent to which the evidence could be extrinsically reconstructed in view of the defendant\u2019s amnesia, including evidence relating to the crime itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>any reasonably possible alibi defense; (4) the extent to which the government assisted the defendant and his counsel in that reconstruction; (5) the strength of the government\u2019s case; and (6) any other relevant factors regarding a fair trial. Id., 463-64. \u201cAfter finding all the facts relevant to the fairness of the trial, considering the amnesia, the [trial] court will then make a judgment whether, under applicable principles of due process, the conviction should stand.\u201d Id., 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In rendering its decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court, <em>Sferrazza, J., </em>carefully considered the arguments of counsel regarding <em>Wilson </em>and, recognizing that there are no Connecticut cases addressing this issue, stated: \u201cWhile the court finds that the case by case approach of <em>Wilson </em>is applicable the court feels [that] the specific findings required by that case are impractical and unnecessary to a determination of whether a defendant would be denied due process of law if forced to stand trial.\u201d The court stated that it favored the approach employed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the defendant also claimed amnesia regarding the events surrounding the charges. At the time of trial, however, he was able to understand the charges and assist in the conduct of the trial. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s lack of memory would not be \u201ca bar to his conviction if he was at the time of the offense capable of forming the requisite criminal intent, and at the time of trial competent to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and consult rationally with counsel.\u201d Id., 186. The <em>Sullivan </em>court focused heavily on whether the defendant\u2019s amnesia prevented him from forming the requisite intent for the offenses charged. The <em>Sullivan </em>majority concluded that, despite his amnesia, the defendant was not without gen\u2019eral criminal intent because he did not \u201c[lack] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or conform it to the requirements of law at the time of such conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The trial court in this case agreed with <em>Sullivan </em>that the starting point of its analysis must be \u201cwhether [a defendant] has a sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 185. The trial court then meticulously placed on the record facts to support its conclusion that \u201cbased on the present ability of the defendant to consult rationally with his attorney and the ample opportunity for the defense to reconstruct the events of August 3,1990, independent of the defendant\u2019s recollections, a fair trial can be had in this case . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The defendant contends that <em>Sullivan </em>is not applicable here because it was not decided on due process grounds. While <em>Sullivan </em>did not involve a constitutional claim, we do not view this as a reason for rejecting its analytical insights. Moreover, while the trial court found it unnecessary to employ the more rigid, six-factor approach espoused in <em>Wilson, </em>the trial court did perform a case by case analysis, examining all of the facts and circumstances and properly addressing the basic due process inquiry posed in <em>Wilson: </em>Whether a defendant suffering from amnesia could perform the functions essential to the fairness and accuracy of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">First, the trial court found that the defendant could \u201ccommunicate and consult rationally with his attorney. He has the ability to provide his counsel with the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>mation concerning the charges that he does recall.\u201d Second, the court found that because the offenses did not require a specific intent or knowledge, they were \u201cparticularly amenable to reconstruction, despite the defendant\u2019s memory loss, because the defendant\u2019s contemporaneous mental state is immaterial.\u201d Third, the trial court noted that the state had provided the defense with open discovery to assist the defendant and his counsel in reconstructing events.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the trial court noted that the defendant\u2019s mental impairment did \u201cnot place him in any worse position than any one of the myriad defendants involved in accidents who have no memory of the event because of inebriation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In so stating, the trial court implicitly recognized that it is \u201cthe probability of prejudice, not lack of memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>per se, [that is] controlling.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 464 n.4. We conclude that on the basis of this analysis, the trial court properly found that the defendant\u2019s prosecution, despite his amnesia, did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Our underlying task in reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings is first to review the evidence presented, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court, and then to decide whether, on the basis of the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court could have concluded as it did. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>223 Conn. 41, 49, 612 A.2d 749 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Our review of the record in this case discloses that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant possessed a \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and . . . a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960); and that the defense had an ample opportunity to reconstruct the events of the evening in question and to cross-examine witnesses, even without the defendant\u2019s specific recollection of events. There was no probability of prejudice. Viewing the trial record in its entirety, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that as a result of his amnesia he could not and did not receive a fair trial. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and his motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of his blood alcohol level at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>time of the accident. The defendant asserts that the evidence should have been excluded because the blood alcohol analysis was admitted in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (d) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (c), as amended by No. 86-345 of the 1986 Public Acts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The facts relevant to this claim are as follows. On the night of the accident, the defendant was transported by ambulance to Day Kimball Hospital. As part of the hospital\u2019s regular course of diagnosis and treatment of trauma victims, a certified medical technologist took a blood sample from the defendant. A number of tests were performed on the sample, including a test of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. State police officers later obtained the results of this blood test by means of a search and seizure warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The defendant claims that the blood test results should not have been admitted into evidence because he was charged with a violation of subsection (a) (1), the \u201cbehavioral\u201d subsection, of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than a violation of subsection (a) (2), the \u201cper se\u201d subsection, and because subsection (d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of \u00a7 14-227a specifies that blood test results, even those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>taken at a hospital for diagnosis and treatment, are admissible only at the defendant\u2019s request. It is undisputed that the defendant made no such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s reading of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. We conclude that even when a defendant is charged under \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1), the \u201cbehavioral\u201d subsection, blood test results may be admitted, without his request, when the blood has been drawn in the regular course of hospital business for the diagnosis and treatment of the defendant\u2019s physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The admissibility of chemical analyses is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which lists six fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tors that must be met before such evidence is deemed admissible and competent. One of those factors is the requirement that \u201cthe test was performed by or at the direction of a police officer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (3). Section 14-227a (d) very clearly states that a chemical analysis that is <em>\u201cotherwise admissible under subsection (c) of this section, </em>shall be admissible only at the request of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (d) does not refer to subsection (l) of \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The latter makes admissible as evidence, for the prosecution of a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>under \u00a7 14-227a (a), any chemical analysis of the defendant\u2019s blood that is taken at a hospital. Such chemical analyses are therefore admissible under \u00a7 14-227a <em>(l) </em>\u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c)\u201d for both behavioral and per se violations under \u00a7 14-227a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The blood test results in question were obtained from a test performed as part of the defendant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment at Day Kimball Hospital, not from a test performed by or at the direction of a police officer. Section 14-227a (c) is therefore inapplicable. Because this evidence was not \u201cotherwise admissible under [\u00a7 14-227a (c)],\u201d the defendant\u2019s request pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a (d) was not a necessary predicate to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendant contends that our analysis here requires a review of the legislative history of Public Acts 1986, No. 86-345, codified as General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a <em>(l) </em>and passed as an amendment to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (c), to determine the legislative intent regarding admissibility of hospital performed blood tests. We decline to do so, however, as the statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 336, 593 A.2d 478 (1991). Where the words of a statute are clear, our duty is to apply the legislature\u2019s directive. \u201c[WJhere the wording [of a statute] is plain, courts will not speculate as to any supposed intention because the question . . . is not what the legislature actually intended, but what intention it expressed by the words that it used.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Alternatively, the defendant contends that the blood alcohol test should not have been admitted because the witness and taker of the sample was not a \u201cperson licensed to practice medicine in this state, a resident physician or intern in any hospital in this state, a quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>fied laboratory technician, an emergency technician II or a registered nurse\u201d as required by General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a <em>(l) </em>(2). We disagree. The trial court found that a certified medical technologist is at least a qualified laboratory technician, in that the medical technologist\u2019s training encompasses and exceeds that of a laboratory technician. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. Harris, 188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly refused to instruct the jury using the exact language he requested.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that the separate charges given on both manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle and misconduct with a motor vehicle \u201cwere correct statements of the law.\u201d He does not claim that the instructions as given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>were incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent or confusing. Rather, he claims that his request would have been \u201cespecially important regarding the mental element [of criminal negligence] which must be proven\u201d on the misconduct with a motor vehicle count. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The purpose of a jury instruction is to give jurors a clear understanding of the elements of the crimes charged and to afford them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present. <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 316, 533 A.2d 212 (1987). In determining whether the trial court\u2019s instructions were adequate, we view the charge \u201cas a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 667, 588 A.2d 127 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The trial court in a criminal proceeding is under no duty to charge in the identical language requested if its charge is accurate, adequate and, in substance, properly includes material portions of the requested charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 789, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). The court\u2019s responsibility is performed when it instructs the jury in a manner calculated to give them a clear understanding of the issues presented for their consideration under the crimes charged and on the evidence, and when those instructions are suited to guide them in their determination of those issues. <em>State </em>v. <em>Watlington, </em>216 Conn. 188, 199, 579 A.2d 490 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Our review of the charge as a whole leads inescapably to the conclusion that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. It is clear after reading the charge that the jury was adequately informed of all the applicable law. The defendant\u2019s request to charge was unnecessary, given the court\u2019s thorough and clear instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> The defendant was sentenced on the first count to a term of imprisonment of ten years, with execution of that sentence suspended after five years, followed by five years of probation. On the second count, the defendant was sentenced to a term of five years, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first count. The court took no action on the third count, and did not impose a sentence, determining that it was a lesser included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\"> The trial court, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him, specifically found that \u201cthe defendant cannot recall the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of his life from two weeks before the accident until five weeks afterward. It is very unlikely that his amnesia relative to this period will ever abate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d provides in pertinent part that a \u201cdefendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. . . . [A] defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 229, 511 A.2d 310 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\"> On May 1, 1991, the trial court held a competency hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d, and found the defendant competent to stand trial. The defendant did not claim incompetency under \u00a7 54-56d at the time of trial in November, 1991, and is precluded from raising this issue on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>28 Conn. App. 360, 368-69, 610 A.2d 1328, cert. granted, 223 Conn. 923, 614 A.2d 827 (1992). The defendant did raise, by motion to dismiss, his present due process claim that he cannot receive a fair trial because he suffers from the mental defect of amnesia. The motion was denied on May 31, 1991, and presented again at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> After the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, both witnesses testified. The defendant did not cross-examine Delana O\u2019Neill. He briefly cross-examined Henry Hewig about the direction in which the defendant was walking when Hewig saw him outside the restaurant, the appearance of the defendant\u2019s eyes, and the statement Hewig voluntarily gave to state police two days after the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> The court stated: \u201cBoth the Norwich Court Clinic report and the Fairlawn Rehabilitation Hospital report conclude that this defendant can communicate and consult rationally with his attorney. He has the ability to provide his counsel with the information concerning the charges that he does recall. For instance, the defendant is able to recall that the insurance on his vehicle had lapsed and was not renewed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\"> The trial court found that: \u201cThe state has provided the defense with open discovery including a copy of a twenty-two page accident investigation report. This report provides specific information, including the names and addresses of witnesses, detailing the activities of the defendant and the victim in the days and hours preceding the collision. It discloses the names and statements of the employees of the restaurant who observed the defendant and served liquor to the defendant shortly before the incident. It provides the names and statements of the defendant\u2019s friends who talked with him and observed his physical condition as he exited the restaurant, entered his vehicle, and drove off onto Route 6. It provides the names and statements of witnesses who came upon the accident scene shortly after impact. It discloses a wealth of physical evidence obtained at the scene and thereafter, including debris dispersal analysis, diagrams, measurements, an inventory of the contents of the vehicles, and other material pertinent to accident reconstruction. It comprises medical information regarding the cause of death of the victim and the medical condition of the defendant, including the blood-alcohol ratio for both parties. It reveals that photographs of the accident scene and the vehicles on the date of the accident and at later times were taken.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> The trial court noted: \u201cThis is not a case where the defenses of alibi or mistaken identification apply. Even the question of operation appears uncontrovertible given the evidence that the defendant was found alone in his own vehicle after the crash and witnesses observed him driving onto Route 6 just before the crash. The significant remaining issues appear to be inebriation and causation. Proof of these matters frequently relies on physical evidence and independent witnesses rather than the recollection of the drivers involved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides: \u201coperation while under the influence.

We do not agree that such a distinction is irrational. The legislature could rationally have determined that the more complex procedural safeguards are necessary when such tests are performed as part of a police investigation. These additional protections against government intrusion are not warranted when such tests are performed by a hospital, which requires a blood analysis not as a means of obtaining evidence for the purpose of criminal prosecution, but as part of its routine course of treating and diagnosing accident victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> The defendant submitted the following request to charge: \u201cIt is possible to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, resulting in the death of another, without failing to perceive the risk involved in driving in that condition.
