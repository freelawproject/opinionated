While the claimant was in possession of said office, prior and up to the 27th of May, 1869, he gave his personal attention to the business thereof to the entire satisfaction of the Post-office Department and of the people of Nashville, and punctually and promptly rendered to the Sixth Auditor of the Treasury his accounts of all moneys collected and disbursed by him during that period, and promptly paid over to the United States all balances due from him to them, and his account was satisfactorily settled and adjusted on the\u2019 books of the said auditor\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-12\">6. During the whole period from May 27, 1866, to July 25, 1870, and afterward, the.salary of said office was fixed by the Postmaster-General at the rate of $4,000 per annum; and the same amounted for that period to $4,645.47, which was paid to said Hopkins, and refused to the claimant, who applied to the Postmaster-General for payment of the same to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-13\">. Upon the foregoing facts the court found as a conclusion of law that the claimant was not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-14\">Judgment having been rendered for the United States, Embry appealed, and here assigns the following errors: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The Court of Claims erred in holding as matter of law upon the facts found that the claimant was not entitled to the salary of the office during the time he was suspended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-5\">The court erred in holding that the claimant was. not entitled to the said salary from the end of the next session of the Senate, after his suspension, even if not entitled to it during the time he was suspended,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b705-6\"><em>Mr. Matt. H. Carpenter </em>and <em>Mr. J. II. Embry </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-7\">1. An act of Congress which provides that a suspended officer shall not receive the salary and emoluments of the office is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-8\">The appointment gives the officer a legal right to the salary by law attached to the office, until he is removed, resigns, dies, or his term expires. <em>Marbury </em>v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-9\">The Constitution provides that the President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint, all officers of the United States. The power of removal is an incident to the power to appoint, and must be exercised by the President and Senate together. An act of Congress cannot vest the power of removal elsewhere. . From this it follows that the claimant never was removed from the office, and, consequently, that he is entitled to the salary for the whole term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b705-10\">2. Conceding the act of Congress in question to be constitutional, and that the claimant was not entitled to the salary during the period of his suspension, still, that period being fixed by the statute to expire on the termination of the next session of the Senate, it follows that from that day he was entitled to the salary. The judgment of the Court of Claims is erroneous to this extent, even should the act be held constitutional.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b705-11\"><em>The Attorney- </em>Creneral, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b705-12\">Mr. Chief Justice Waite</author>\n<p id=\"As8\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">By the tenure-of-office apt, passed March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 430), it was enacted that every person appointed to a civil office by and with the advice and consent of the Senate should hold his office until his successor should be in like manner appointed and duly' qualified, except as therein otherwise provided; but the President was authorized during the recess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of the Senate to suspend an officer for misconduct, crime, or incapacity. In case of suspension, the President could designate some suitable person to perform temporarily the duties of the office until the matter should be acted on by the Senate when in session. If the Senate concurred in the suspension, and advised and consented to the removal, the President might remove and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint another person to the. office. If, however, the Senate refused to concur, the officer suspended might resume the functions of his office, but his salary and emoluments during the suspension went to the person who performed his duties,- and not to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On the 20th of April, 1867, while this law was in force, Embry, the appellant, was, by and- with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed and commissioned postmaster at Nashville, Tenn., the salary being at the rate of $4,000 a year. By his commission, he was to hold his office for four years, \u201csubject to the conditions prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On the 5th of April, 1869, the original tenure-of-office act was amended, so as to authorize the President in the recess of the Senate to suspend an officer at his discretion until the end of the then next session of tlie Senate, and to designate some person to perform the duties of the office in the mean time, who should be entitled to the salary and emoluments while he served, instead of the officer suspended. 16 Stat. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Under the authority of this act, Embry was suspended from office on the 5th of May, 1869, during a recess of the Senate, and Enos Hopkins designated to perform his duties. Embry, however, remained in the office until May 27. The Senate did not advise or consent to the appointment of any one to fill the place of Embry during its next session, which terminated July 15, 1870, and he was, on the 21st of July, notified to resume the charge of his office, which he did on the 25th of that month. The salary from May 27, 1869, to July 25, 1870, was paid to Hopkins. This suit was brought by Embry to recover for the- same time. The Court of Claims decided against him, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">We have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the appellant is not entitled to recover. The important constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tional question which has at times occupied the attention of the political department of the government ever since its organization, and which was brought to our attention in the argument, is not, as we think, involved. The question here presented is not one of office, but of salary. Wherever the power of removal from office may rest, all agree that Congress has full control of salaries, except those of the President and the judges of the courts of the United States. The amount fixed at any one time may be added to or taken from at will. No officer except the President or a judge of a court of the United States can claim, a contract right to any particular amount of unearned compensation. If an officer is not satisfied with what the law gives him for his services, he may resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">When Embry was appointed, the \"President had power to suspend him for cause. The law also provided that if suspended he should draw no salary so long as another person was performing his duties. While he was in office, further power of-suspension was given the.President, with a like provision as to pay. He was suspended. ' The Senate did not see fit to advise or consent to the appointment of another person in his' place, and consequently, on the 15th of July, 1870, when, the next session of '\u25a0\u2018the Senate ended, he became entitled to enter again on the' performance of the duties which pertained to his office. This he did on the 27th of July, but not before. His present claim rests not on any contract with the government, either express or implied, but upon the acts of Congress which provide for his salary. Wago held in <em>United States </em>v. McLean, 95 U. S. 750. T.o adjudge in his favor would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. Although he was lawfully jrffiffice, he was not entitled to pay or emolument while not performing its duties because of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">It is true his lawful suspension ended on the 15th of .July, but he did not resume possession until ten days afterwards. In the mean time, the person designated for that purpose performed his duties. Under these circumstances, the law gave the salary to the actual incumbent and not to him. The delay was an incident to the'suspension, and does not seem to have, been unreasonable. No more time elapsed than was necessary to give the proper notices and transfer the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><em>judgment </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
