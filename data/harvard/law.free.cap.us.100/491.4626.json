The assessment was by reason of his ownership, during those years, of certain bonds, executed in Chicago, and made payable to him, his executor, administrators, or assigns in that city, at such place as he or they should, by writing appoint, and, in default of such appointment, at the Manufacturers\u2019 National Bank of Chicago. Each bond declared that \u201c it is made under, and is, in all respects, to be construed by the laws of Illinois, and is given for an actual loan of money, made at the city of Chicago, by the said Charles W. Kirtland to the said Edwin A. Cummins,, on the day of the date hereof.\u201d They were secured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>deeds of trust, executed by the obligor to one Perkins, of that city, upon real estate there situated, the trustee having power by the terms of the deed to sell and convey the property and apply the proceeds in payment of the loan, in case of default on the part of the obligor to perform the stipulations of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">The statute of Connecticut, under which the assessment was made, declares, among other things, that personal property in that State \u201c or elsewhere \u201d should be deemed, for purposes of taxation, to include all moneys, credits, choses in action, bonds, notes, stocks (except United States stocks), chattels, or effects, or any interest thereon; and that such personal property or interest thereon, being the property of any person resident in the State, should be valued and assessed at its just and true value in the tax-list of the town where the owner resides. The statute expressly exempts from its operation money or property actually invested in the business of merchandizing or manufacturing, when located out of the State. Conn.

The power to impose discriminating burdens upon property is a power to prohibit or destroy. The plaintiff in error was burdened on account of the foreign origin of his bonds and mortgages, and was therefore unconstitutionally taxed. <em>Welton </em>v. <em>State of </em>Missouri, 91 U.

If it be constitutional, that State could, so fat as loaning money is concerned, prescribe non-intercourse between her citizens and those of other States. For the purposes of taxation, no deduction from the assessed valuation of his real estate is permitted to a party in Illinois, by reason of his mortgage indebtedness. Connecticut attempts to regulate commerce among the several States, inasmuch as her statutes discriminate in taxation against resident mortgagees who loan in Illinois, where no such deduction is permitted, in favor of her own residents, making similar loans on lands within her own limits.

Those acts of business have an exclusive <em>situs </em>for taxation in Illinois, whose jurisdiction alone protects them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">IV. They\" are repugnant to the exclusive sovereignty of Illinois over property and acts of business within her borders, and hence are void under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. 1. The laws of Connecticut should not be allowed to affect'property and business whose <em>situs </em>is in Illinois. The power of Illinois to tax money within -her limits, or an act of loaning and borrowing money there, must, under our form of government, exclude the power of another State \"from-taxing Illinois money, or an act of loaning and borrowing in Illinois.. <em>Mager v.

The tax laws of Illinois are, and those of Connecticut are not,' a part of the contracts evidenced by plaintiff\u2019s bonds. \u2022 Taxation of them by Connecticut lays a greater burden upon the contracts than Illinois has declared they shall bear. The. statutes in question fail to give \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d to the \u201cpublic acts\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Illinois. Const. U.

They deprive the plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law. Fourteenth Amendment, Const. U. S. 1. The advertisement of sale by the defendant in error of plaintiff\u2019s land is the first step of a \u201c taking \u201d of his land. 2. Such advertisement was without \u201c due process of law,\u201d because the statutes conferring the power to advertise being unconstitutional conferred no jurisdiction upon any person to tax or to sell the land. There can be no \u201c due process of law,\u201d even in attempted taxation, without jurisdiction of the subject of taxation, and such jurisdiction does not exist in the absence of protection of that subject by the taxing power. <em>United States </em>v. Rice, 4 Wheat. 246; <em>Wicks </em>v. Dinyee, 7 Cranch, 481; <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Ferry Co., </em>11 Wall. 430; <em>State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, supra; Tappan </em>v. <em>Merchants' Bank, </em>19 id. 490; <em>Railroad Tax, </em>18 id. 229; <em>Loan Association </em>v. <em>Topeka, </em>20 id. 655.

The business of loaning money is thus guaranteed to a citizen of another State upon the same footing as to taxation with the citizens of the State within which the business is carried on. <em>Corfield </em>v. <em>Corzell, </em>4 Wash. 371; <em>Paul v.

Seymour, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-7\">Mr. Justice Hablan,</author>\n<p id=\"AlS\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We will not follow the interesting argument of counsel by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>entering upon an extended discussion of the principles upon which the power of taxation rests under our system of constitutional government. Nor is it at all necessary that we should now attempt to state all limitations which exist upon the exercise of that power, whether they arise from the essential principles of free government or from express constitutional provisions. We restrict our remarks to a single question, the precise import of which will appear from the preceding statement of the more important facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>State of Maryland </em>(4 Wheat. 428), this court considered very fully the nature and extent of the original right of taxation which remained with the States after the adoption of the Federal Constitution. It was there said \u201c that the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to cany it.\u201d Tracing tbe right of taxation to the source from which it was derived, the court further said: \u201c It is obvious that it is an incident of sovereignty, and is coextensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a State extends are objects of taxation, but those over which it does not extend are, upon the soundest principles, exempt from taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201c This vital power,\u201d said this -court in <em>Providence Bank </em>v. <em>Billings </em>(4 Pet. 568), \u201c may be abused; but the Constitution of the United States was not intended to furnish the corrective for every abuse of power which may be committed by the State governments. The interest, wisdom, and justice of the representative body, and its relations with its constituents, furnish the only security, when there is no express contract, against unjust and excessive taxation, as well as against unwise legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>The Perry Company </em>(11 Wall. 423), and in <em>State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds </em>(15 id. 300), the language of the court was equally emphatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In the last-named case we said that, \u201c unless restrained by provisions of the Federal Constitution, the power of the State as to the mode, form, and extent of taxation is unlimited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>where the subjects to which it applies are within her juris-, diction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We perceive no reason to modify the principles 'announced in these cases or to question their soundness. They are fundament\u00e1l and vital in the relations which, under the Constitution-, exist between the United States and the several States. Upon their strict observance depends, in no small degree, the harmonious and successful working of our complex system of government, Federal and State. It may, therefore, be regarded as the established doctrine of this court, that so long as the State, by its laws, prescribing the mode and subjects of taxation, does not entrench upon the legitimate authority of the Union, or violate any right recognized, or secured, by the Constitution of, the United States, this court, as between the State and its citizen, can afford him no relief against State taxation, however unjust, oppressive, or onerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Plainly, therefore,- our only duty is to. inquire whether the Constitution prohibits' \u00e1 State from taxing, in the hands of one' of its resident citizens, a debt held by him upon a resident of another State, and evidenced by the bond of the debtor, secured by deed of trust or mortgage upon real estate situated in the State in which the debtor- resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The question does not seem to us to be very difficult of solution. The creditor, it is conceded, is a permanent resident within the jurisdiction of the State imposing the tax. The debt is property in his hands constituting a portion of his wealth, from which he is under the highest obligation, in common with his fellow-citizens of the same State, to contribute for the support of' the government whose protection he enjoys.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">That debt, although a species of intangible property, may, for purposes'of taxation, if not for all others, be regarded as situated at the domicile of the creditor. It is none the less property because its amount and maturity are set forth in a bond. That bond, wherever actually held or deposited, is only evidence of the debt, and if destroyed, the debt \u2014 the right to demand payment of the money loaned, with the stipulated interest \u2014 remains. Nor is the debt, for the purposes of taxation, affected by the fact that .it is secured by mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>upon real estate situated in Illinois. The mortgage is but a security for the debt, and, as held in <em>State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds </em>(supra), the right of the creditor \u201c to proceed against \u2022the property mortgaged, upon a given contingency, to enforce by it&amp; sale the payment of his demand, . . has no locality independent of the party in whom it resides. It may undoubtedly be taxed by the State when held by a resident therein,\u201d &amp;c. Cooley on Taxation, 15, 63, 134, 270. The debt, then, having its <em>situs </em>at the creditor\u2019s residence, both he and it are, for the purposes of taxation, within the jurisdiction of the State. It is; consequently, for the State to determine, consistently with its own fundamental law, whether such property owned by one of its residents shall contribute, by way of taxation, to maintain its government. Its discretion in that regard cannot be supervised or controlled by any department of the. Federal government, for the reason, too obvious to require argument in its support, that such taxation violates no provision of the Federal Constitution. Manifestly it does not, as is supposed by counsel, interfere in any true sense with the exercise by Congress of the power to regulate commerce among the several States. <em>Nathan </em>v. <em>Lousiana, </em>8 How. 73; Cooley on Taxation, 62. Nor does it, as is further supposed, abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, or deprive the citizen of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or violate the constitutional guaranty, that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges of citizens in the several States.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Whether the State of Connecticut shall measure the contribution which persons resident within its jurisdiction' shall make by way of taxes, in return for the protection it affords them, by the value of the credits, choses in action, bonds, or stocks' which they may own (other than such as are exempted or protected from taxation under the Constitution and laws of the United States), is a matter which concerns only the people of that State, with which the Federal government cannot rightly interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
