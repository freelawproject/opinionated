The court proceeded to revise it, and, after revoking it, substituted another, which he approved, inflicting upon A. a severer punishment. A., who was imprisoned pursuant thereto, alleging that it was illegal and void, and that he was thereby unlawfully deprived of his liberty, prayed for a writ of <em>habeas corpus..

In an ordinary judicial tribunal, nothing, therefore, is to be presumed in their favor. <em>Brooks </em>v. Adams, 11 Pick. (Mass.) 442; <em>Dynes </em>v. Hoover, 20 How. 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">' Paymasters\u2019 clerks are only recognized indirectly in the chapter on the organization of the navy. By sects. 1386, 1387, 1388, Rev. Stat., paymasters and assistant paymasters are, under certain circumstances, allowed clerks. By sect. 1556 their pay is fixed. For the same reason, by sect. 1367, the admiral and vice-admiral are each allowed a secretary to aid in the discharge of their respective duties. Sect. 1866 provides that \u201c the active list of the pay corps of the navy shall consist of thirteen pay directors, thirteen pay inspectors, fifty paymasters, thirty passed assistant paymasters, and twenty assistant paymasters.\u201d' Sect. 1383 requires every paymaster, passed assistant paymaster, and assistant paymaster to give bonds for the faithful performance of his duties. No such obligation is laid upon paymasters\u2019 clerks, nor are they officers holding either commissions or warrants, nor are they deemed petty officers. Sect. 1410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-10\">If a reasonable doubt exists whether paymasters\u2019 clerks are of the naval force and subject to the jurisdiction of a court-martial, the petitioner is entitled to the writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>II.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">1. There is no common law of the United States. <em>Wheaton </em>v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591. As the existence, jurisdiction, and powers of courts-martial are exceptional, with stronger reason it can be maintained that such courts have no common law, and hence any reference to the usages or laws of Great Britain is inapplicable to this case. In one particular, by the statute of 1799 (1 Stat. 715), the common law of nations, which 'was the law of Great Britain, was incorporated in our naval code. The statute was in these words: \u201c All faults, disorders, and misdemeanors which shall be committed- on board any ship belonging to the United States, and which are not herein mentioned, shall be punished according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea.\u201d It was superseded by art. 22, sect. 1624, Rev. Stat., which provides that \u201c all offences committed by persons belonging to the navy which are not specified in the foregoing articles shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">The adoption, however, of one common-la^v rule by statute excludes the idea that, by virtue of the Constitution, the naval usages and laws of Great Britain became a part of our naval code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">As Reed was tried upon the charge of malfeasance and misdemeanors prohibited specifically in the rules and articles for the government of the navy, his case did not fall under art. 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">2. Sect. 1624, Rev. Stat., provides a system for the organization and conduct of naval courts-martial, and their proceedings are valid only when the statutes are followed and obeyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\">3. As the case of the government is now understood by the counsel for the petitioner, the act of Rear-Admiral Nichols, in sending the sentence of the 17th of July to the court for revision, is justified under art. 54 of sect. 1624 of the Revised Statutes, which declares that \u201cevery officer who is authorized to convene a court-martial shall have power, on revision of its proceedings, to remit or mitigate, but not to commute, the sentence of any such court which he is authorized to approve and confirm; \u201d and by sect. 262 of the rules and regulations for the administration of law and justice in the navy, as au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>thorized or confirmed by sect. 1547 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that \u201c the authority who ordered the court is competent to direct it to reconsider its proceedings and sentence, for the purpose of correcting- any mistake which may have been committed.\u201d Regulations for the Administration of Raw and Justice in the U. S. Navy, 1870, p. 49. Sect. 1547, Rev. Stat., is as follows: \u201c The orders, regulations, and instructions issued by the Secretary of the Navy prior to'-July 14, 1862, with such alterations as he may since have adopted, with the approval of the President, shall be recognized as the regulations of the navy, subject to alterations adopted in the same manner.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-5\">Sect. 5 of the statute of July 14, 1862 (12 Stat. 565), provides \u201c that the orders, regulations, and instructions heretofore issued by the Secretaay of the Navy be, and they are hereby, recognized as the regulations of the Navy Department, subject, however, to such alterations as the Secretary of the Navy may adopt, with the approbation of the President of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">The position of the government is not tenable, and for these reasons: \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-7\"><em>a. </em>If the regulation of the department had, in precise words, been enacted in a statute, Rear-Admiral Nichols' would have had no lawful authority for doing what was done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">He could then have directed the court -to reconsider its sentence only for the purpose of correcting a mistake in matter of law or in matter of fact. \u2022 What he alleged as having happened in the court was neither, being only, in his opinion, an error of judgment within the limits of the discretion conferred by law upon courts-martiaL</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\"><em>b. </em>But if it were otherwise,,and the regulation of the department be construed as giving him authority to direct the court to reconsider its sentence for any reason that seemed to him sufficient, that regulation would be valid only so far-as it conformed to the Constitution and -laws. If in' any respect it exceeded the limits which they impose,\u2019 it would not bind even the officers and men of the navy, and with stronger reason it could not be invoked to deprive a citizen of his right to be \u2022tried -according to the laws of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Art. 54 of sect. 1624, Rev. Stat., specifically limits the authority which the officer convening a court-martial has to revise its proceedings. He may confirm, remit, or mitigate .the sentence, but cannot increase it either directly or indirectly, or even transmit it to any one except his superior in office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\"><em>c. </em>The sole power of revision was in the admiral himself, and the manner of its exercise was prescribed in that article. When the sentence was signed and transmitted, th\u00e9 power of the court over it ended; and neither by any original action on its own part, nor by delegation from another, could that power be revived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">It is claimed on behalf of the petitioner that when, on the 17th of July, the sentence was made, signed by the several members of the court, recorded, and transmitted to the admiral, not only were the powers of the court exhausted, but the court itself ceased to exist. His action was equivalent to a formal dissolution of the court, and the members who had composed it were thereafter utterly incapable of lawfully doing any act or thing touching or affecting the rights or the liberty of Reed. It follows that on the 22d of July, 1878, when the so-called sentence, whose validity is now under consideration, was pronounced and recorded, a legally constituted court-martial for his trial did not exist. He has therefore been twice put in peril for the same offence, or he is now deprived of his liberty without due process of law. In either case, his imprisonment is contrary to the guaranty contained in art. 5 of the amendments to the Constitution. <em>Osborn </em>v. Nicholson, 13 Wall. 654, 662.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-7\"><em>The </em>Attorney-General, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-8\">Mr. Justice Swayne</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">There is no controversy in this case about the facts. The questions.we are called on to'consider are all questions of law. A byief summary of the facts will therefore be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The petitioner, Reed, was the clerk of a paymaster in the navy of the United States. He was duly appointed, and had accepted by a letter, wherein, as required, he bound himself \u201c to be subject to the laws and regulations for the government of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the navy and the discipline of the vessel.\u201d His name was placed oh the proper muster-roll, and he entered upon the discharge of his duties. While serving in this capacity, charges of malfeasance were preferred against him, and on the 26th of June, 1878, he was directed by Rear-Admiral Nichols to appear and answer before a general court-martial, convened pursuant to the order of that officer on board the United States ship \u201c Essex,\u201d then stationed at Rio Janeiro, in Brazil. The court found the petitioner guilty, and sentenced him accordingly. The admiral declined to approve the sentence, and remitted the proceedings back to the court, that the sentence might be revised. The court thereupon pronounced the following sentence in substitution for the former one : \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201c That the said Alyin R. Reed, paymaster\u2019s clerk, 'U. S. Navy, be imprisoned in such place as the honorable Secretary of the Navy may designate, for the term of two years; to lose all pay which may become due him during such confinement, excepting the sum of $10 per. month, this loss amounting to $1,960 ; to be fined in the sum of $500, which fine must be paid before or at the end of the term of confinement.Should such fine not be paid at end of the term of confinement, to be detained in confinement without pay until such fine be paid, and at the expiration of the term of confinement to be dishonorably dismissed from the naval service of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">This, sentence was different from the preceding one in two particulars, and in both it was more severe. It was approved by the admiral, and ordered to be carried out. The court was subsequently dissolved. While in confinement, under the sentence, on board a naval vessel at Boston, the petitioner sued \u25a0out a writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus, and brought his case before the Circuit Court of the United States for .the District of Massachusetts. . After a full hearing, that court adjudged- against him, and ordered him back into the custody of the naval officer to whom the writ was addressed. The petitioner thereupon made' this application in order that the conclusions reached by the Circuit Cqurt may be reviewed by this tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">It is supposed that'courts-martial were intended originally to be a partial substitute for the court of chivalry of former times. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>3 Christian's Bl. 68, 108; Bouv.

The common law . . . knew no distinction between citizen and soldier; so that if a life-guardsman deserted, he could only be sued for a breach of contract; and if he struck his officer, he was only liable to an indictment or an action of battery.\u201d 3 Campbell\u2019s Lives of Chief Justices, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The constitutionality of the acts of Congress touching army and navy courts-martial in this country, if there could ever have been a doubt about it, is no longer an open question in this court. Const., art. 1, sect. 8, and amendment 5. In <em>Dynes </em>v. <em>Hoover </em>(20 How. 65), the subject was fully considered and their validity affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The regularity of the original organization of the court here in question is not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">- Three points in support of the petition have been brought to our attention. It is insisted \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> That the court had no jurisdiction to try a paymaster\u2019s clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> That when the first sentence was pronounced, the power of the court was exhausted, and that the second sentence was, therefore, a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> That the court could revise its former sentence only on the ground of mistake, and that there was no mistake, and consequently no power of revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">The first of these propositions is clearly not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">Where the punishment is death, or fine and imprisonment, the jurisdiction in question is extended to all persons \u201c in the naval\u2019sefvice of the United States\u201d (Rev. Stat., sect. 1624, arts. 4, 14); and it embraces, besides the frauds enumerated; \u201c any other fraud against the United States.\u201d Id., art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">In case of conviction, adequate punishment is required to be adjudged.

Their appointment must be approved by the commander of the ship. Their acceptance and agreement to submit to the laws and regulations for the government and discipline of the navy must be in writing, and filed in the department. They must take an oath, and bind themselves to serve until discharged. The discharge must be by the appointing power, and approved in the same manner as the appointment. They are required to wear the uniform of the service; they have a fixed rank; they are upon the payroll, and are paid accordingly. They may also become entitled to a pension and to bounty land.

Stat., sect. 1547. Such \u201cRegulations for the Administration of Law and Justice <em>\u201d </em>were issued' on the 15th of April, 1870. Thereby it is declared as follows: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201c The authority who ordered the court is competent to direct it to reconsider its proceedings and sentence for the purpose of correcting any mistake which may have been committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201c It is not the power of the revising authority to compel a court to change its sentence, where, upon being reconvened by him, they have refused to modify it, nor directly or indirectly to enlarge the measure of punishment imposed by sentence of a court-martial.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201c The proceedings must be sent back for revision before the court shall have been dissolved.\u201d Reg., c. 5, sects. 262-264,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Such regulations have the force of law. <em>Gratiot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>4 How. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">The proceedings with respect to the revision of the second sentence were in conformity to these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">It is clear that the court was not dissolved until after the approval of the second sentence by the admiral.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The court had jurisdiction over the person and the case. It is the organism provided by law and clothed with the' duty of administering justice in this class of cases.

Its judgments, when approved as required, rest on the same basis, and are surrounded by the same considerations which give conclusiveness to the judgments of other legal tribunals, including as well the lowest as the highest, under like circumstances. The exercise of discretion, within authorized limits, cannot be assigned for error and made the subject of review by an appellate court. -</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We do not overlook the point that there must be jurisdiction to give the judgment rendered, as well as to hear and determine the cause. If a' magistrate having authority to fine for assault and battery should sentence the offender to be imprisoned in the penitentiary, or to suffer the punishment prescribed for homicide,, his judgment would be as much a nullity as if the preliminary jurisdiction to hear and determine had not existed. Every act of a court beyond its jurisdiction is void. <em>Cornett </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 Wall. 226; <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>93 U. S. 274; 7 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defences, 181. Here there was no defect Of jurisdiction &gt;as to any thing that was done. Beyond this we need not look into the record;. Whatever was done, that the court could do under any circumstances, we must presume was properly done. If error was committed in the rightful exercise of authority, we cannot correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">A writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be made to perform the functions of a writ of error. To warrant the discharge of the petitioner, the sentence'under which he is held must be, not merely erroneous and voidable, but absolutely void. <em>Ex parte Kearney, </em>7 Wheat. 38; <em>Ex parte Watkins, </em>3 Pet. 193; <em>Ex parte Milligan, </em>4 Wall. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The application of the petitioner is, therefore, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
