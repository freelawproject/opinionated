California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). That brief, <em>inter alia: </em>addresses the two issues identified in our court\u2019s prior order; and alleges no prejudice. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>No. 07-40880 (5th Cir.19 Aug.2008) (denying counsel\u2019s previous motion to withdraw and directing counsel to file a brief addressing concerns related to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(2) and 11(b)(1)(E)). Miller has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-22\">Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief disclose no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-16\"> Pursuant to 5tu Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
