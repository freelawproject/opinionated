Branca, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal with prejudice of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>complaint alleging the imposition of a fraudulent federal tax lien on his property, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 713.31(2)(b) and 713.901(4), and demanding relief in the form of a declaratory judgment cancelling the lien and awarding punitive damages in accordance with Fla. Stat. \u00a7 713.31(2)(b) &amp; (c). Branca originally filed the complaint in the Circuit Court, Orange County, Florida, but the government removed the case, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441, 1442, and 1444, to the district court, where it was subsequently dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, Branca argues that removal of the case was improper, and argues that the district court erred by dismissing the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction instead of remanding the case to the Orange County Circuit Court where it was originally filed. He also asserts that pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, although federal courts are prohibited from granting declaratory relief with respect to federal taxes, Florida circuit courts retain the power to adjudicate his claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The United States may remove any case in which it is named a party to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a). Branca named the United States a party to the instant suit, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(a). \u201cAny action brought under \u00a7 2410 of this title against the United States in any State court may be removed by the United States to the district court of the United States for the district and division in which the action is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1444. In his complaint, Branca sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. Notably, the Act <em>prohibits </em>federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments in federal tax cases, with certain exceptions not applicable here. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (excepting cases \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes\u201d from Act\u2019s coverage). Finally, under \u00a7 2410, Congress has waived the United States\u2019 immunity from suit <em>only </em>to the extent of a procedural challenge, but not to a suit concerning the underlying merits of a tax assessment. <em>Stoecklin v. United States, </em>943 F.2d 42, 43 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Because Congress has explicitly provided for removal to federal court lor suits brought under \u00a7 2410, the district court did not err in removing the case to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1444. The district court also did not err by dismissing, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, Branca\u2019s claims challenging the underlying merits of his federal tax lien and seeking declaratory relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). Finally, the district court did not err by finding that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity for suits challenging the underlying merits of a federal tax lien under \u00a7 2410. Thus, its dismissal, with prejudice, of the remaining portions of the suit was proper. We are unpersuaded by Branca\u2019s other arguments. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
