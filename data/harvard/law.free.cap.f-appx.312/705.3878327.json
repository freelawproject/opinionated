Prather has appealed his sentence, contending that the district court erred by denying the Government\u2019s motion to reduce his offense level by one level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Prather contends that the district court did not have the discretion to deny the reduction under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-24\">Because Prather\u2019s arguments in the district court were not sufficient to put the district court on notice of the basis of the argument he has raised on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008). Although we have concluded that the district court committed a clear or obvious error, see <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705-09 (5th Cir.2003), <em>and United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1123-28 (5th Cir.1993), and that Prather\u2019s substantial rights were affected, <em>see United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 289 (5th Cir.2008), we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the error because the error did not affect the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings in light of Prather\u2019s obstruction of justice. <em>See Du-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>hon, </em>541 F.3d at 396. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>dan </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5m Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
