The grant of a motion to continue lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant the motion for good cause shown. <em>Masih v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Olanrewaju has failed to show good cause for a continuance because receipt of the pending 1-130 petition was only the first step in the long and discretionary process of obtaining an adjustment of status. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Olanrewaju also argues that the BIA erred in denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, reiterating his claim that his former attorney\u2019s bad advice coerced him into his \u201cbad behavior\u201d and set him \u201con a- trail of misrepresentations.\u201d The BIA\u2019s finding that Olanrewaju willingly and actively participated in the scheme to misrepresent himself during his immigration proceedings is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, Olanrewaju\u2019s argument in support of his claim of ineffectiveness is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
