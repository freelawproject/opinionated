Nearly eight months after the district court accepted Barksdale\u2019s plea and about two and a half months after issuance of his presentence report, Barks-dale moved to withdraw his guilty plea as to Count 3. The district court heard the motion immediately before Barksdale\u2019s sentencing and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">Barksdale argues that his guilty plea was involuntary due to ineffective assistance by his trial counsel and that his trial counsel also provided ineffective assistance during the hearing on Barksdale\u2019s motion to withdraw his, guilty plea. Barksdale\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver of appeal, but Barksdale contends that the waiver does not bar review of his instant claims. A defendant may always avoid a waiver of appeal on the limited grounds that the waiver or guilty plea itself was tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 339, 343 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>72 F.3d 463, 465 (5th Cir.1995)). However, because Barksdale did not raise these ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the district court, we decline to consider them without prejudice to any right Barksdale may have to raise them in a subsequent proceeding. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>nied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 116 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Barksdale also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gaitan, </em>954 F.2d 1005, 1011 (5th Cir.1992). District courts should consider seven factors when ruling on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea: \u201c(1) whether the defendant asserted his innocence, (2) whether withdrawal would prejudice the government, (3) whether the defendant delayed in filing the motion, (4) whether withdrawal would inconvenience the court, (5) whether adequate assistance of counsel was available to the defendant, (6) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary, and (7) whether withdrawal would waste judicial resources.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>72 F.3d at 465 (citing <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984)). The district court\u2019s determination should be made based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Badger, </em>925 F.2d 101, 104 (5th Cir.1991). \u201cNo single factor or combination of factors mandates a particular result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Factors raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Allen, </em>No. 93-3563, 1994 WL 93560, at *2 (5th Cir. Mar.18, 1994) (unpublished); 5th Cir. R. 47.5.3 (providing that unpublished opinions issued before January 1,1996, are precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">For the first time on appeal, Barksdale contends that the Government would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the plea, the burden on the district court would be minimal, any delay in the filing of his motion to withdraw his plea was due to his trial counsel, and ineffective assistance by his trial counsel rendered his guilty plea involuntary and uninformed. These new contentions are not considered here. <em>See Allen, </em>1994 WL 93560, at *2; <em>Badger, </em>925 F.2d at 104. Barksdale also argues that the district court erred in considering his assertion of innocence and explanation for why he pleaded guilty, namely that he was under the belief that he was pleading guilty to his original indictment rather than the superseding bill of information. These arguments are unavailing in light of the record, which reflects that the district court made clear to Barksdale that he was pleading guilty to the offenses in his superseding bill of information. Barksdale made no assertions of his innocence when entering his plea, and he instead indicated that he was pleading guilty because he was indeed guilty. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Barksdale\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
