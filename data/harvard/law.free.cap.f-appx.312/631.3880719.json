Dretke, 507 </em>F.3d 898, 904 (5th Cir.2007). We also have rejected an argument that TDCJ\u2019s grooming policies violate male prisoners\u2019 equal protection rights because female prisoners are allowed to grow longer hair than male prisoners are. <em>See id. </em>at 904-05. Moreover, Bisby does not indicate how prisoners in other state systems and the federal system are similarly situated to Texas prisoners, nor does he indicate how Texas prisoners are singled out by Texas authorities for treatment different from prisoners in other states and the federal system. Thus, Bisby cannot prevail on his equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Based upon the analysis above, Bisby\u2019s appeal is \u2022 without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. the dismissal of this appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as did the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bisby previously accumulated one strike in <em>Bisby v. Woods, </em>No. 7:00-CV-00253-R (N.D.Tex. Jan. 5, 2001). Because Bisby thus has accumulated three strikes, effective with the decision herein, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Whether the imposition of the section 1915(g) bar herein affects Bisby\u2019s appeal or IFP status in the pending appeal in <em>Bisby v. Garza, </em>appeal no. 08-40876, we determine under these particular circumstances, is a matter which is best decided by the panel deciding said case no. 08-40876.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">. The dismissal was based on his complaint, the amended complaint and the hearing under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice, having adopted die magistrate's recommendation to dismiss with prejudice for failure to stale a claim and as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915(A)(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
