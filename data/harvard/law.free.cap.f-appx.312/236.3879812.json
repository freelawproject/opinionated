The district court denied his motion because Slater had previously received a substantial assistance downward departure that greatly reduced his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">On appeal, Slater argues that the district court committed a procedural error because there is no evidence that, in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion, it calculated his amended guideline range and considered the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by our decision in <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Slater adds that he attached to his motion a number of documents indicating his rehabilitation since his imprisonment, but the district court gave no indication that it considered those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). Under \u00a7 3582, a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuI\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the <em>extent that they </em>are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008) (listing Amendment 706 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as a retroactively applicable amendment). The Commission also included a policy statement indicating that, if a defendant originally was sentenced to a below-guideline term of imprisonment, a proportional reduction in his sentence may be appropriate if his applicable guideline range was reduced by an amendment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, under \u00a7 3582, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. First the district court must calculate the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed under this amended range. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must decide, after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to impose the amended sentence on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 781. The district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern that there is reversible error. Because the district court did not calculate Slater\u2019s amended guideline range (or the sentence that it would have imposed under the amended guideline range), and it is unclear, from the record, whether it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we hereby vacate and remand this case back to the district court to comply with <em>Bravo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
