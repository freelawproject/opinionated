The district court denied Martin\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, finding that her appeal was not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). The district court also denied Martin\u2019s motion for transcripts at government expense. Martin has filed three motions with this court: to proceed IFP on appeal, for transcripts at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>government expense, and for appointment of appellate counsel. In her IFP motion, Martin argues that (1) the defendants perjured themselves during the trial, (2) the City of San Antonio was not entitled to summary judgment, (3) the defendants\u2019 internal affairs files should have been admitted as evidence, and (4) the district court clearly erred in overruling her challenge pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">\u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), a federal court may refuse to certify an appeal for in forma pauperis status if it is not taken in good faith.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Martin\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge of the certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). The court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220 (quotation marks omitted). Martin has failed to show that the district court erred in concluding that her appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied. Because Martin\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Martin\u2019s motions for transcripts at government expense and for appointment of appellate counsel are likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">IFP DENIED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; TRANSCRIPTS AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
