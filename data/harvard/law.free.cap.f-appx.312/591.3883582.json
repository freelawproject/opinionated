Bejko argues that he is entitled to asylum because he suffered past persecution by the politically powerful Dishi family, whom he believed would be protected by the Albanian government. He contends that he is entitled to withholding of removal because he would be subject to persecution on account of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">When, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe agency\u2019s administrative \u2018findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">The IJ determined that Bejko\u2019s alleged persecution was not based on one of the five statutorily enumerated grounds, i.e., race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). Rather, the IJ determined that the persecution alleged by Bejko was motivated by the Dishi family\u2019s desire to inflict retribution on Bejko, whom they held responsible for the plight of a family member who was sentenced to imprisonment for an act committed at a vehicle repair station managed by Bejko.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-23\">Bejko has not met his burden to show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ concerning Bejko\u2019s application for asylum and for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Accordingly, we will not disturb the IJ\u2019s denial of relief as to these claims. <em>See id.; Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 350 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-24\">Bejko also argues that he is entitled to relief under the CAT. He contends that the evidence shows that he will be tortured by members of the politically powerful Dishi family and that the Albanian government will acquiesce in the torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">A claim under the CAT is a separate claim for relief from asylum or withholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of removal. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 139 (5th Cir.2004). The torture need not be inflicted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">' The IJ determined that Bejko had not shown that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Albania. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Bejko has failed to meet his burden to show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Bejko\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
