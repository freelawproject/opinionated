He contends that the sentence was greater than. necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. Valenzuela-Morales concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because the 16-level enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Valenzuela-Morales points out that the instant offense did not involve violent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>duct, did not pose a danger to others, and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He also contends that the guideline range did not account for his motivation for reentering the United States which was to check on his pregnant wife who was ill. Because Valenzuela-Morales did not raise these arguments in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, 531 F.3d </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado. </em>The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The district court considered Valenzuela-Morales\u2019s request for a sentence within the applicable guideline range, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the top of that range was appropriate. Valenzuela-Morales\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, 523 </em>F.3d at 565-66. Because Valenzuela-Morales has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, 531 F.3d </em>at 339. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ai_\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
