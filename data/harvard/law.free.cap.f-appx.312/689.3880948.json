This court has now reviewed everything in this record and, contrary to the unsupported statements of counsel, we find no evidence that would raise an issue to support any claim of plaintiff for relief. No prima facie case of age or gender discrimination is made. No issue of causal connection between defendant\u2019s employment action and his prior EEO complaint against the Army is shown. The defendant presented evidence to explain that plaintiffs failure of training and performance was the reason for denial of his position at Fort Polk. Plaintiff presented no evidence of pretext or discriminatory motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
