For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. .</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In 2005, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Hale, charging him with: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (Count 1); and 4 counts of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii) (Counts 2-5). The government filed an information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, notifying the court that Hale had been convicted of a felony drug offense in Georgia in 2003, which would enhance Hale\u2019s sentence. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Hale pled guilty to Count One in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and calculated Hale\u2019s applicable guideline range as follows. The probation officer found that Hale was responsible for 108.8 grams of crack cocaine, which gave him a base offense level of 82 under the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4). The probation officer awarded Hale a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, thus giving him a total offense level of 29. The probation officer determined that Hale had a criminal history category of III, which was based in part on his 2003 conviction for possession of cocaine. An offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of III gave Hale an applicable guideline range of 108-135 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the probation officer found that Hale was subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Before sentencing, the government filed a motion for a downward departure based on Hale\u2019s substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI, granted the government\u2019s substantial-assistance motion, and sentenced Hale to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hale did not appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">On April 17, 2008, Hale filed the instant pro <em>se </em>motion for a reduced sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Hale argued that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced his base offense level, thereby rendering him eligible for a sentencing reduction. Hale also requested the district court to reconsider the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining his reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The district court denied Hale\u2019s motion, finding that he was ineligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Specifically, the court found that Hale\u2019s sentence was not based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by Amendment 706 because \u201cit was based' on the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence\u201d and \u201cthe value and extent of his cooperation....\u201d In this respect, the court found that reducing Hale\u2019s sentence would contradict Application Note 1(A) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which prohibited reductions where the defendant\u2019s sentence was not subsequently lowered due to the application of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">Section 3582(c) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered </em>by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s recently revised policy statement on retroactive amendments to the Guidelines similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712). This policy statement emphasizes that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) if ... [a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). In this regard, Application Note 1(A) to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized if the \u201camendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706. The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713 (listing Amendment 706 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as a retroactively applicable amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">In this case, the application of Amendment 706 would result in a two-level reduction in Hale\u2019s base offense level. This is so because the sentencing court held Hale accountable for 108.8 grams of crack cocaine, which gave him a base offense level of 32 under the version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) in effect at the time of sentencing. However, under the amended version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), a drug quantity of 108.8 grams of crack cocaine would give Hale a new base offense level of 30. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(5). After re-applying the 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Hale would have a new total offense level of 27 which, coupled with his criminal history category of III, would give him an amended guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>line range of 87-108 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">However, despite Amendment 706, Hale would remain subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) as a result of his prior felony ' drug conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(iii) (providing for a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment where the defendant\u2019s offense involved 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and the defendant had a prior conviction for a felony drug offense). Critically, because the high-end of Hale\u2019s would-be amended guideline range (108 months) remains lower than the statutory minimum sentence (240 months), Hale\u2019s final applicable guideline range would again become the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). In other words, while Amendment 706 would retroactively reduce Hale\u2019s offense level, it would not ultimately affect his guideline range under \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), as that range is determined by the statutory minimum sentence, not the applicable base offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">For that reason, we have recently concluded that a defendant in Hale\u2019s position \u2014 who is sentenced based on the statutory mandatory minimum, rather than \u00a7 2D1.1, and who receives a downward departure \u2014 is ineligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, under <em>Williams, </em>Hale was not eligible for a sentencing reduction. As Hale was not eligible for a reduction, the district court was not required to re-calculate his amended guideline range or consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Hale does not dispute that he had a prior felony drug conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
