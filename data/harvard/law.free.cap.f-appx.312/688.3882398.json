Luis Manuel Aguilar pleaded guilty to one charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and the district court sentenced him to serve 120 months in prison. Aguilar appeals his sentence. He argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making certain remarks at \u25a0sentencing. He also argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court made no findings in support of its conclusion that a four-level sentencing adjustment should be applied and because no evidence pertaining to this adjustment was offered at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">The Government argues that the appeal should be dismissed because Aguilar waived his right to appeal and because the waiver is valid and enforceable. The Government also asserts that Aguilar\u2019s prose-cutorial misconduct claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">This court reviews the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>See United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). Our review of the record shows that Aguilar\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Aguilar\u2019s claims concerning the disputed sentencing adjustment fall within the scope of the waiver. We thus decline to consider these claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ4\">The appellate waiver clause found in Aguilar\u2019s plea agreement contains an explicit exception for claims concerning pros-ecutorial misconduct. Consequently, consideration of his claim concerning the prosecutor\u2019s alleged improper statements at sentencing is not barred by the waiver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Nevertheless, Aguilar\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim lacks merit. Our review of the record shows that the disputed statements were not improper and caused no prejudice to Aguilar. <em>See United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 574 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
