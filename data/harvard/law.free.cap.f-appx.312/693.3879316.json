We dismiss the petition in part for lack of jurisdiction and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the decision of the immigration judge (IJ) influences the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We may review the IJ\u2019s decision in the instant case because the BIA adopted it. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Zavala-Morales failed to demonstrate the \u201cexceptional and exti-emely unusual hardship\u201d required for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). We reject Zavala-Morales\u2019s attempt to classify her disagreement with the weighing and consideration of the relevant factors by the IJ as an issue of constitutional dimension. <em>See Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent that Zavala-Morales challenges the discretionary denial of her request for cancellation of removal, we dismiss her petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Zavala-Morales\u2019s claim that her due process rights were violated because the IJ exhibited bias against her is unavailing. Our review of the record does not show that the IJ held a \u201cpersonal bias\u201d against Zavala-Morales that arose from an \u201cextrajudicial source\u201d or that the IJ\u2019s conduct demonstrated \u201cpervasive bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>See Matter of Exame, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982). Zavala-Morales\u2019s bias claim lacks merit, and we deny her petition for review on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
