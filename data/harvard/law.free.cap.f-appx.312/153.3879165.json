On appeal, Maya-Linares argues that, in light of the' Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and its progeny, his sentence, enhanced from a maximum of 2 years in \u00a7 1326(a) to 20 years in \u00a7 1326(b)(2), is unconstitutional because the government failed to allege in the indictment or prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the prior conviction upon which the district court based the enhancement. Maya-Linares further argues that the district court erred when it made findings of fact with regard to his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-24\">First, Maya-Linares argues. that any sentence enhancement that extends beyond the two-year statutory maximum in \u00a7 1326(a) based upon prior convictions not alleged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, violates his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">Because Maya-Linares raised his objection to the enhancement of his sentence before the district court, we review the sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will only reverse for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. U.S., </em>the Supreme Court held that recidivism was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>an element of the offense of illegal reentry into the United States. 523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1233, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Accordingly, under <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>prior convictions can be considered and used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence without being alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 244-46, 118 S.Ct. at 1231-32. Subsequent decisions, namely, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), have not disturbed the holding of <em>Almendarez-Toms. See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAlthough recent decisions, including <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Toms\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Toms. </em>As a result, [this Court] must follow <em>Almendarez-Toms.\u201d United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 951, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Second, Maya-Linares argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in light of <em>Shepard </em>because it made findings of fact <em>about </em>his prior conviction. We review issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Under the plain error standard, we will not correct an error raised for the first time on appeal unless we find (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">We conclude that the district court did not err when enhancing Maya-Linares\u2019s maximum sentence and sentencing him to 36 months\u2019 incarceration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based upon the reasoning set forth above, the government was not required to allege the prior conviction in the indictment nor prove the same beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, Maya-Linares failed to object to the characterization of his prior conviction being an aggravated felony. In fact, at the time of sentencing, defense counsel confirmed to the court that no factual matters in the PSI were in need of discussion. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007) (holding that failing to object to facts contained in the PSI admits them for sentencing purposes). Because the first prong of the plain error test is not satisfied, the inquiry stops there.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Upon review of the record, transcripts, and the presentence investigation report, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. To the extent Maya-Linares also seeks to challenge the guideline enhancement based on the use of a prior conviction, that challenge would be foreclosed because the district court understood the Guidelines to be advisory. See <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (holding there is no constitutional error in the district court\u2019s use of extra-verdict enhancements where it applied the guidelines as advisory).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-15\">. Maya-Linares\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
