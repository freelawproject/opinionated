Farris argues that the district court plainly erred when it applied the career offender enhancement because his prior Arkansas aggravated robbery conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence, the sentence is unreasonable because the district court relied exclusively upon Farris\u2019 arrest record when sentencing Farris to 188 months of imprisonment, which was within the Guidelines range, and the district court plainly erred by ordering that Farris\u2019 sentence run consecutive to state sentences that were not yet imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Although the district court relied solely upon the presentence report and thus did not rely upon the proper documentation when determining that Farris\u2019 prior offense was a crime of violence, <em>see United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005), the Government has supplemented the record with the charging document and the judgment of conviction. Farris\u2019 argument that this court does not have authority to supplement the record is without merit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 386-87 (5th Cir.2006). Far-ris\u2019 conviction under the Arkansas aggravated robbery statute, A.C.A. \u00a7 5-12-103, qualifies as a crime of violence because the Arkansas aggravated robbery statute, like the Arkansas robbery statute, corresponds to the generic, contemporary meaning of robbery as it involves misappropriation of property under circumstances involving danger to another person. <em>See United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-82 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813, 814-15 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 170, 172 L.Ed.2d 122 (2008). The district court therefore did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>not err when it applied the career offender enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.l (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Also, Fanis\u2019 assertion that the district court \u201cexclusively\u201d relied upon his prior arrest record to determine his sentence mischaracterizes the record. Regardless whether an arrest record is an irrelevant or improper factor to consider when determining where within a properly calculated guidelines range a sentence should fall, in this case the district court provided extensive reasons explaining, its sentencing decision. Our reading of the record indicates that, although the district court mentioned Farris\u2019 arrest record, the district court did not exclusively rely upon the arrest record and did not give significant weight to the arrest record. Farris has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Finally, as Farris concedes, his argument that the district court plainly erred by ordering that his sentence run consecutive to state sentences that were not yet imposed is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
