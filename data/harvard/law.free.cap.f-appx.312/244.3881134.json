The following February, a jury found him guilty as charged, and on June 10, 1997, the district court sentenced him to a prison term of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-26\">On March 3, 2008, Harris, relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, and the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), moved the district court pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce his sentence. The court denied his motion, concluding (1) that Amendment 706 did not operated to lower his Guidelines sentence range because, at sentencing, the court had held him accountable for 20 kilograms of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 38 (for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine), and that the amended Drug Quantity Table still assigned a base offense level of 38 for 4.5 kilograms or more of the drug, and (2) that <em>Booker </em>was inapplicable. Harris now appeals the court\u2019s ruling, claiming that the court should have reconsidered his original sentence and imposed a new sentence in light of Amendment 706 and <em>United States v. Booker </em>and in consideration of the fact that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred the court\u2019s application of U.S. S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) of the United States Code grants the district courts discretion to reduce a term of imprisonment if the \u201cterm of imprisonment [was] based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the term of the sentence after considering the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the \u201camendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u25a0 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that only retroactively applicable amendments \u201cthat have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Accordingly, a sentence reduction is not authorized where an amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant ... but ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.ga statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d ' U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. A defendant who was held accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 because his base offense level remains at 38, and, thus, his Guidelines sentence range has not been reduced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366 (11th Cir.2008); <em>accord United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 985-86 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that defendant was not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction when, based on the amount of crack and powder cocaine he was responsible for and an intervening change in the Guidelines, his offense level was higher under Amendment 706 than when he was sentenced). Specifically, because the defendant in <em>Jones </em>was responsible for at least 12 kilograms of crack cocaine, his sentence range was not lowered; hence, was not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In denying Harris\u2019s \u00a7 3583(c)(6) motion, the district court properly adopted the findings of fact and Guidelines calculations it made when it imposed Harris\u2019s sentence, including the finding that Harris was responsible for distributing in excess of 20 kilograms of crack cocaine. Accordingly, the court committed no error in concluding that he is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Contrary to Harris\u2019s view of thelaw, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the court with the authority to reconsider the sentence it previously imposed and to impose a new sentence. That is, the section does not provide a vehicle for resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000). <em>\u201c[A]ll </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has <em>been </em>amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Assuming that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not empower a district court to resentence a defendant, Harris turns to <em>Booker </em>for such authority. His problem is that <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable in the Guidelines amendment context or in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. In short, \u201cneither \u00a7 3582(c)(2) nor <em>Booker </em>provide[ ] a jurisdictional basis to reduce [a defendant\u2019s] sentence based on his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1221 (reviewing the <em>Booker </em>argument for plain error).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Booker </em>argument affords Harris no help, so we turn to his Ex Post Facto Clause argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o ex post facto Law shall be passed\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. This clause prohibits the enactment of laws that make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission. <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1270 (11th Cir.2008). To prevail on an ex post facto claim, a party must demonstrate that (1) the law was retrospective, in that it applied to events occurring before its enactment, and (2) he was disadvantaged by it. <em>United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1038 (11th Cir.2004). It is clear that the guidance the Sentencing Commission provides in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 does not constitute a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Harris\u2019s argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">.
