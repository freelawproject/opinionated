Valencia-Vergara first argues that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to provide adequate reasons for the imposed, sentence. The record and the context show that the sentencing court considered the evidence and Valencia-Ver-gara\u2019s arguments and based the sentence on the facts and arguments. The district court did not commit a procedural error in this regard. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-29\">Valencia-Vergai-a also contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Valencia-Vergara concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>guideline sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Valencia-Vergara points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct, and he contends that the guidelines range did not take into account that he reentered the United States to visit and help his dying brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The district court considered Valencia-Vergara\u2019s request for leniency in light of his personal circumstances, but it ultimately determined that a sentence below the advisory guidelines range was not appropriate. We note that the 41-month sentence was at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. Valencia-Vergara\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Because Valencia-Vergara has failed to make a showing sufficient to rebut that presumption, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
