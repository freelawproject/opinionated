Berry argues that the district court erred in applying the policy statements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 in a mandatory fashion, as <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. Berry argues that the district court, therefore, had authority to reduce his sentence even though he was held responsible for too great a quantity of crack cocaine and was sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Berry pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was held accountable for 16 kilograms of crack cocaine. Initially, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, the statutory mandatory minimum term <em>of </em>imprisonment <em>for </em>his offense, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Later, however, the district court reduced his sentence to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to the government\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) substantial assistance motion. On March 19, 2008, Berry filed a motion for modification of sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), citing Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. The district court denied the motion on the grounds that Amendment 706 did not affect Berry\u2019s guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), when an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced, the district court may reduce the sentence, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and if such a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10, a reduction is not consistent with its policy statements, if the retroactive amendment in question does not have the effect <em>of </em>lowering defendant\u2019s applicable guideline imprisonment range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In a recent case, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), we held that Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline imprisonment range of a defendant who was held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">Under Amendment 706, the guidelines now provide a base offense level of 36 for defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. However, a base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>or more. Accordingly, the distinction between 12 and 50 kilograms of crack cocaine that did not matter in 1994 still does not matter in 2008, and the base offense level for that quantity range has not decreased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The district court did not err in determining that Berry was not eligible for a reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. Berry was not sentenced using a guideline imprisonment range that retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 did not alter Berry\u2019s base offense level because he was held responsible for 16 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. Berry\u2019s arguments concerning the mandatory application of \u00a7 IB 1.10 do not affect this conclusion. Berry suggests that the district court had the discretion not to follow \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s instruction that a reduction is inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s policies, and, therefore, should not be made, if Amendment 706 does not actually lower the applicable guideline imprisonment range. However, the controlling statute, \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which Berry does not argue is advisory, itself instructs that the reduction is limited to \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Given that Amendment 706 did not lower his base offense level, Berry was not sentenced to a range that was subsequently lowered, as required by the controlling statute. Likewise, Berry\u2019s arguments concerning the application of the statutory mandatory minimum do not alter the conclusion that he was not eligible for a reduction, as the existence of a statutory mandatory minimum merely was an alternative reason to deny Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. To the extent that Berry suggests that <em>Booker </em>gave the district court authority to re-open his sentencing proceedings, his argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, when the defendant was denied a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction pursuant to an Amendment, <em>Booker </em>could not serve as the sole basis to re-open proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce the defendant's sentence because Amendment 706 did not lower the defendant's base offense level and because <em>Booker </em>was not a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
