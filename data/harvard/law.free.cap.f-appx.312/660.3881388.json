The district court denied IFP and certified that Larry\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Larry is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). However, Larry has not demonstrated any non-frivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-20\">Larry argues that the district court should have credited his time in state custody to his federal sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Because Larry\u2019s petition challenges errors that occurred at sentencing and does not satisfy the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, it should not have been brought as a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, Larry\u2019s challenge to the application of the Guidelines is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d 1106, 1109 (5th Cir.1998). Larry\u2019s petition was an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Larry\u2019s appeal is from the denial of an unauthorized motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-21\">Larry\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits, and it is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
