California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). This court previously issued an order identifying a nonfrivolous issue regarding whether the district court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Aldaco-Torres, </em>No. 08-40224, slip op. at 1-2 (5th Cir. Nov.4, 2008). The court denied counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and ordered counsel to brief the nonfrivolous issue and any other meritorious issues. <em>Id. </em>The FPD moved for reconsideration, explaining-why the issue that the court identified was without merit. The FPD also requested that this court grant the previously-filed <em>Anders </em>motion. On December 1, 2008, this court issued an order granting the motion for reconsideration and granting the motion to withdraw. <em>United States v. Aldaco-Torres, </em>No. 08-40224, slip op. (5th Cir. Dec.l, 2008). As this appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues, the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
