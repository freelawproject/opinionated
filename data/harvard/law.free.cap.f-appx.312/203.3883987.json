Ardley contends that the district court erroneously failed to apply <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), at his resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its authority to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">In this case, Ardle/s original offense level was 38 and his criminal history category was I, giving him a guidelines range of 235 to 293 months. He was sentenced to 293 months. After Amendment 706 became retroactive, Ardley\u2019s offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>dropped to 36 and his guidelines range became 188 to 235 months. In resentenc-ing Ardley under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court noted that \u201c[ijmposing a similar high-end sentence under the revised guidelines would result in a sentence of 235 months.\u201d . Without' elaboration the district court then stated its intention to resen-tence Ardley to 235 months. Ardley objected because he wanted a sentence <em>below </em>the amended guidelines range, and he argued that under <em>Booker </em>the court had the authority to give him such a sentence. Ardley asked the district court to apply <em>Booker, </em>or at least to clarify whether it believed that <em>Booker </em>applied and if not, to state why not. The district court did not respond to that request, but instead entered its order sentencing Ardley to 235 months. Therefore, it is not entirely clear whether the district court believed that it <em>coulcl </em>use <em>Booker </em>to deviate below the amended guidelines range and simply declined to, or whether the district court believed that <em>Booker </em>was entirely inapplicable to resentencings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Ardley asks us to presume that the district court believed that <em>Booker </em>was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Ardley argues only that the district court erred in failing to apply <em>Booker </em>at his \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing. Recently this circuit joined the Eighth, Fourth, and Tenth Circuits in holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v, Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Starks, </em>551 F.3d 839 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247 (4th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833 (10th Cir.2008). There was no error at the resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
