He was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment, 240 months of imprisonment, and life imprisonment, respectively, to be served consecutively for an aggregate term of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">Johnston argues that the district court abused its discretion in upwardly departing from the guidelines sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 based on an inadequate criminal history category because the district court did not follow the proper procedures for doing so. He further contends that the district court improperly took into account dismissed counts when it sentenced him because such consideration \u201ceviscerates the plea bargain.\u201d He asserts that a person who pleads guilty is entitled to expect a guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">These arguments and the facts underlying them differ completely from the facts contained in the record. The district court explicitly imposed an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3), rather than \u00a7 4A1.3, as Johnston asserts. Additionally, neither the district court\u2019s stated reasons for its sentence nor anything contained in the record indicate that the district court took dismissed counts into consideration when it sentenced Johnston. Furthermore, there was no plea bargain in this case and Johnston received a within-guidelines sentence for the only charge to which he pleaded guilty. Because Johnston\u2019s attorney-briefed arguments concerning the district court\u2019s upward departure do not address either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>district court\u2019s stated reasons for the departure or, the law underlying those reasons, he has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s upward departure. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Johnston also asserts that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) in explaining its reasons for imposing an upward departure. However, Johnston does not show how the district court failed to provide specific reasons as required under \u00a7 3553(c), and thus has not demonstrated the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Additionally Johnston asserts that his life sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. However, when compared with the benchmark established in <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980), Johnston\u2019s aggregate life sentence for possession of a firearm by a felon, attempted first degree murder of a federal officer, and carrying and using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence was not grossly disproportionate. <em>See Rummel, </em>445 U.S. at 265-66, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in imposing Johnston\u2019s life sentence. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
