Fannin appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-23\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\">Fannin contends that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709. He asserts that application of this amendment would dramatically lower his sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-25\">The Sentencing Commission has stated that unless an amendment is listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u00a7 IB 1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) (May 2008). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission Policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Fannin argues that Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment that should be applied retroactively even though it is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). This court has held, however, that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(e). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fannin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
