Hernandez argued for a below-guidelines sentence. The district court considered his situation and sentenced him to 70 months. We review for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-25\">Hernandez first argues that the sentencing guidelines for illegal reentry are not supported by empirical data and national experience and therefore the presumption of reasonableness which we ordinarily apply to within-guideline sentences should not apply. While we agree that a sixteen-level enhancement for a prior alien smuggling offense is harsh, we have twice rejected challenges that sentences that result from the application of the enhancement should not, on appeal, be given a presumption of reasonableness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore apply the appellate presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-26\">The district court heard Hernandez\u2019s argument for a below-guideline sentence, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>eluding Hernandez\u2019s family ties in the United States, his attempts at working in Mexico, and his son\u2019s medical condition in the United States. Hernandez also stated his family\u2019s intentions to \u201cleave this country as soon as possible.\u201d The district court, however, was concerned by Hernandez\u2019s multiple previous illegal entry charges. On this basis, the court sentenced him to the low range recommended by the guidelines. We cannot find that this was an abuse of discretion. Hernandez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court lias determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The Government argues that Hernandez\u2019s first contention \u2014 that the sentencing guideline at issue is not supported by empirical data \u2014 was not specifically raised in the district court, thus limiting our review to plain error. We need not decide the appropriate level of review because our case law has rejected Hernandez\u2019s argument under both abuse of discretion and plain error standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-28\"><em>.
