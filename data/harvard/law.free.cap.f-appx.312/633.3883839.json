He argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence that was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). He further argues that this court should not afford the sentence a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical research upon which the Sentencing Commission typically promulgates Guidelines. He cites <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in support of this argument. Although Avila argued in the district court that the enhancement of his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 was unconstitutional, he did not argue that \u00a7 2L1.2 itself was flawed. Avila\u2019s empirical argument is thus reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-24\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court determined that a district court reasonably could conclude that the disparity between crack and powder cocaine resulted in a sentence that was too harsh. <em>Kimbrough, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>128 S.Ct. at 574. The Court held that because the crack cocaine Guidelines did not take into account empirical data and were not formulated in the manner ordinarily undertaken by the Commission, \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. However, the Court said nothing of the applicability of the appellate presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-89 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Avila has provided this court with no authority in support of his contention that his 30-month sentence was too harsh. The statutory maximum penalty that Avila was facing was 20 years of imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The district court considered Avila\u2019s personal circumstances, including his motive for illegally returning to the United States, in selecting a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range. Avila has failed to overcome the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. <em>Campos-Maldonado, 531 F.3d </em>at 338-39. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
