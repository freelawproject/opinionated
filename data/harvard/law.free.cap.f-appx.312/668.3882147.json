Taylor, 117 </em>F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Caves argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because he can prove that the court was working in \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the medical department and because the district court failed to appoint him an attorney. Caves, however, fails to address the district court\u2019s findings, following a <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing at which Caves testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>that his claim that he was denied proper medical treatment was not cognizable because he had not argued that the appellees demonstrated deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Caves has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP on appeal. <em>See Brinkmunn v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Accordingly, we deny Caves\u2019s IFP motion, as well as his concurrent motion for the appointment for counsel on appeal, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Caves\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Caves is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
