Mendoza was ordered deported <em>in absentia </em>in February 1996, after he failed to appear for his deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-25\">Because Mendoza\u2019s deportation proceeding was instituted before the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRI-RA), 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), his motion to reopen is governed by the law predating IIRIRA, particularly 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b (repealed 1996). <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 473-74 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004); <em>DeLeon-Holguin v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 811, 814-15 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-26\">Where, as here, the IJ\u2019s decision affects the BIA\u2019s decision, we may review both. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Denials of mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>tions to reopen are reviewed under \u201ca <em>highly </em>deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision must stand as long as it \u201cis not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Mendoza claims: he did not receive notice of his deportation hearing; the person he retained to represent him failed to provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) with an address where notice of the deportation hearing could be sent; this failure constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, which qualified as an exceptional circumstance and a basis for reopening his proceeding; and his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness warranted application of the doctrine of equitable tolling of the temporal limitation on his motion to reopen. Mendoza\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The order to show cause (OSC) issued to Mendoza in November 1995 met all statutory requirements. Additionally, the BIA\u2019s factual finding that Mendoza understood the OSC and the consequences of not providing an address is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 679 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">When Mendoza\u2019s proceeding commenced, a deportation order entered <em>in absentia </em>was subject to rescission on a motion to reopen filed at any time \u201cif the alien demonstrate [d] that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B) (repealed); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2). The statute, however, specifically obviated the necessity of notice of the time and place of a deportation proceeding if the alien failed to provide a written record of an address where he might be contacted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252b(e)(2), (3)(B) (both repealed). Accordingly, as Mendoza did not provide an address, he is not entitled to relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B). <em>See United States v. Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that the \u201cultimate fault\u201d lay with the petitioner for failing to comply with a law that required him to provide an address that was \u201cessential to the administration of the INS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">When Mendoza\u2019s proceeding commenced, an alien could also move to reopen an <em>in abstentia </em>deportation order within 180 days after its date on the basis \u201cthat the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B)(repealed); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(l) (\u201cexceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien\u201d). To the extent that Mendoza attempts to demonstrate that his claimed lack of effective counsel was an exceptional cireumst\u00e1nce within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A), the effort fails because his motion was not filed within 180 days of the February 1996 deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Nor can Mendoza prevail on an equitable-tolling claim. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[A] request for equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is\u201d essentially a contention that the BIA, or the IJ, should have <em>sua sponte </em>reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling. <em>Id. </em>at 220. But we are without jurisdiction to review a deportation proceeding reopened by the IJ or the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>because we have \u201cno legal standard by which to judge the IJ\u2019s ruling\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Mendoza\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303. The petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
