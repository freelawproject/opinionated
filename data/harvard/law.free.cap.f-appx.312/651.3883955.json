This action concerns post-Hurricane Katrina emergency repairs by Hallmark to Appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-22\">Appellant contends the district court erred by finding no contract existed between the parties. In the alternative, it contends the district court erred by awarding Hallmark compensation under the equitable doctrine of <em>actio de in rem verso </em>(a Louisiana-law term for unjust enrichment) in the absence of sufficiently detailed proof of Hallmark\u2019s expenses and in an amount greater than the benefit Appellant derived from Hallmark\u2019s work. In that regard, the district court awarded far less in damages than the amount sought by Hallmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment after a bench trial, we review the findings of fact for clear error and the legal issues de novo.\u201d <em>Houston Exploration Co. v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., </em>359 F.3d 777, 779 (5th Cir.2004). Essentially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s detailed and well-reasoned Order and Reasons of 20 March 2008, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
