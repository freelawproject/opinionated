The district court sentenced him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>serve concurrent 121-month terms of imprisonment. Guzman now appeals his sentence. He argues that the district court erred by rejecting his argument that he was a minor participant in the offense and by denying him a two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Guzman was not entitled to the minor participant adjustment simply because his role in the offense was limited to transporting drugs. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1485 (5th Cir.1993). Rather, such a role is \u201can indispensable part\u201d of drug related offenses. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The district court determined that the cocaine transported by Guzman was a dangerous drug and that the value of the contraband would be substantially increased by its transportation farther into the United States. The district court\u2019s determination concerning Guzman\u2019s role in the offense is plausible in light of the entire record and thus is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under .the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
