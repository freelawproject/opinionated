Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>367, 877 A.2d 1218 (2005); <em>In re Keri, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>50, 853 A.2d 909 (2004); <em>J.P. v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 920 A.2d 707 (App.Div.2007); <em>W.T. v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 916 A.2d 1066 (App.Div.2007); <em>In re Labis, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 714 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1998). Here, B.D., a seventy-seven-year-old woman, conveyed her $259,917 home to her grandson for $10,191.70 in cash, the discharge of a $67,374.89 mortgage, and a lease of part of the home \u201cfor life.\u201d In focusing on the lease, the Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services concluded that B.D. did not receive fair market value and, therefore, imposed a Medicaid eligibility penalty period. Because the otherwise unambiguous phrase \u201cfor life,\u201d which significantly bears on the lease\u2019s value, is clouded by its context, and because the lease\u2019s true scope cannot be wrung solely from the lease itself, we remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The record reveals that B.D. was deemed eligible to participate in the Caregiver Assistanee/NJEASE Homecare Program. This program was designed to provide services for individuals, who are at risk of nursing home placement, with the opportunity to remain in their homes. Upon learning that B.D. had transferred her home to M.D., her grandson, the Hudson County Board of Social Services reviewed her eligibility to remain in the program and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>later concluded, because B.D. had \u201creceived $10,191.70 for property worth $238,191.70 in net value,\u201d that the transfer of her home required the imposition of a thirty-seven-month penalty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">A hearing was requested and the matter forwarded to the Office of Administrative Law for the development of a record. The parties stipulated to the facts they deemed relevant, provided the administrative law judge (ALJ) with exhibits, and filed briefs. No evidentiary hearing was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The parties stipulated that, on January 22, 2004, B.D. was a seventy-seven-year-old woman, who owned and had lived in a two-family house in Kearny for many years. The home had been appraised in October 2003 as having a value of $259,917. At that time, $67,374.98 was due on a mortgage encumbering the property. B.D. was also then receiving $1,180 per month in rent for the first floor apartment and $200 per month for rent on part of the second floor from J.D., her granddaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On January 22,2004, B.D. contracted to transfer the property to her grandson, M.D., for $255,000. To consummate the transaction, M.D. obtained an $80,000 mortgage loan, from which the debt on the existing mortgage and other minor settlement charges were paid; the remainder of the mortgage proceeds, $10,191.71, was given to B.D. As part of this transaction, B.D. also received what has been referred to as a \u201clifetime lease\u201d for the second floor/attic apartment (the apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The lease stated that the compensation received by M.D. for giving B.D. a \u201clifetime lease\u201d was $175,000, which purports to represent the remaining value of the property transferred to M.D. The lease defined its duration as \u201c[f]or the life of [B.D.],\u201d but also, within the same sentence, referred to an actuarial table. Although the record on appeal does not contain this actuarial table, the parties\u2019 stipulation indicates that B.D.\u2019s life expectancy was then 10.83 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The meaning and significance of the lease term rested at the heart of the contested matter before the ALJ. In finding that the transfer was for fair market value, the ALJ provided the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>analysis of B.D.\u2019s prepayment of $175,000 in rent for the term of the lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">At the time of the sale, [B.D.\u2019s] life expectancy, according to the actuarial tables contained in HCFA Transmittal # 64, was 10.83 years. As such, if [B.D.] were to live for that amount of time, and rent the apartment for its fair rental value, she would have paid out a total of $194,940 in rent.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] So in effect, the value of her lifetime leasehold, plus the $80,000 cash she received, earned [B.D.] approximately $20,000 more than the property\u2019s fair market value. In conclusion, this court cannot find that the sale of [B.D.\u2019s] home was for less than fair market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">As a result, the ALJ set aside the board\u2019s imposition of a penalty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Director reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding that B.D. failed to demonstrate that she. received fair market value in exchange for conveying her home to her grandson. Proceeding on an assumption that the lease would terminate upon B.D.\u2019s death or her departure from the premises, the Director concluded that the prepayment of so much rent by a woman of such age and health did not fall within the bounds of fair market value. In other words, the Director concluded that a finding that B.D. received fair market value required an assumption that B.D. would make use of the premises for a ten-year period, but failed to consider that any lesser duration of the lease \u2014 which seemed likely in the circumstances \u2014 would render the prepayment of ten years\u2019 worth of rent unconscionable. For example, if B.D. obtained the benefit of the lease for a period of ten years, then the prepayment of $175,000 \u2014 without presently considering the additional value to M.D. of receiving so much rent in advance \u2014 extrapolates to a monthly rent of slightly less than $1,500 per month. Accepting as reliable B.D.\u2019s expert report \u2014 as to which the Director was correctly dismissive<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 it could be concluded that B.D.\u2019s retention of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>full ten-year term for $175,000 might have merit since that would extrapolate to a rent payment of $1,458.33 per month. On the other hand, if B.D.\u2019s death one year after the transfer caused a termination of the lease, she would have actually paid rent to her grandson at the rate of more than $14,500 per month \u2014 an amount no one would equate with fair market value. In light of these considerations, and the fact that B.D. was \u201cwheelchair bound\u201d and already in need of services through the program, the Director concluded that B.D. did not receive fair value for the lifetime lease because she would not likely occupy the premises for anywhere near 10.83 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Director reached this same conclusion by analyzing the transaction from the point of view of B.D.\u2019s grandson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">[B.D.] ... attempts to argue that this is such a terrible deal for the grandson as \u201che is taking on the responsibility of the owner without having the complete freedom to use the property.\u201d The property was worth over a quarter of a million dollars two years ago. The grandson only had to come up with an $80,000 mortgage to take title. The property contains two apartments, the other of which is rented for $1,180 and alone would cover the mortgage with additional funds left over to pay taxes and upkeep. The responsibility of ownership/lack of freedom dichotomy is more aptly described as rental property, an investment vehicle which was acquired at a rock bottom price and provides income to pay the monthly expenses and will increase in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">[Footnote deleted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In relying upon her own interpretation of the lease, the Director viewed the lease as having a limited duration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">Here, [B.D.\u2019s] death or removal to a nursing home terminates her right to occupy the apartment. There is no guarantee that the lump sum pre-payment of rent will equate to valuable consideration, namely shelter for [B.D.] for the rest of her life. Her institutionalization or death prior to actuarially set life expectancy would result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>in a windfall to her grandson, the landlord, who can then rent out or occupy the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The Director also found that an early departure from the leasehold was likely because of B.D.\u2019s status at the time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">[When] she entered into the agreement she was in a wheelchair and, by virtue of eligibility in the home and community based waiver, needed nursing home level care. As noted in the [ALJ\u2019s] [i]nitial [decision, this waiver program[] is \u201cdesigned to provide an array of supports and services that enable the individual at risk of placement in a nursing facility to remain in\u201d the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In essence, in the Director\u2019s view, B.D. prepaid for \u201c[a] debt she has not incurred and may not incur.\u201d The Director also concluded that B.D. would have no \u201crecourse to recover her funds\u201d should she be unable to utilize the premises for the alleged lifetime expectancy of 10.83 years. And implicit in the decision is the Director\u2019s determination that, but for the intent to insulate this asset through this unusual attempt at Medicaid planning, the transaction made no economic sense because B.D. had transferred fee simple for little more than something she already had: the right to reside on the property for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">If the Director\u2019s assumptions about the meaning of the lease are accurate, then we would be satisfied with her conclusion that B.D. failed to demonstrate that her receipt of a lifetime lease, the discharge of her obligation on a $67,374.98 mortgage, and an additional $10,191.70 in cash, constituted fair value when considering she gave up a home worth $259,917, and the right to $1,180 per month in other rental income generated by the property. If this constituted a proper understanding of the transaction, then we would apply the \u201cstrong presumption of reasonableness,\u201d which \u201cattaches to the actions of administrative agencies,\u201d <em>In re Vey, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 205, 639 A.2d 724 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>306, 639 A.2d 718 (1994), and we would not be able to conclude, as B.D. urges, that the Director\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">However, B.D. argues that the possibility she may die or leave the premises for a nursing home before the fulfillment of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>life expectancy \u2014 an assumption upon which the Director\u2019s decision relies \u2014 is irrelevant. She claims the lease allows her to either use or sublet the premises during her life regardless of whether she is willing or able to personally occupy the premises. Moreover, B.D. claims that the lease does not terminate with her death. She argues that the lease must be interpreted as creating in her estate \u2014 should she die short of her 10.83-year life expectancy\u2014 the right to use or sublet the premises until the life expectancy period terminates. In short, B.D. argues that she and her grandson did not agree that the lease terminated on her death, but instead that it terminated upon her death or at the conclusion of 10.83 years, whichever comes later. In considering this contention and in attempting to understand the parties\u2019 agreement, we turn to what they wrote and our familiar policy that, absent more than one plausible interpretation, we enforce contracts as they are written. <em>Kampf v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>36, 43, 161 A.2d 717 (1960); <em>Schor v. FMS Fin. Corp., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 191, 814 A.2d 1108 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Considering the interests at stake, we find it surprising that the lease teims are neither elaborate nor clear. This lease, which is undated, indicates that in exchange for $175,000 M.D. agreed to \u201cgive possession\u201d of the apartment to B.D. \u201cfor the Term.\u201d The \u201cTerm\u201d is described as being:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">For the life of [B.D.], presently age 77, actuarial life expectancy pursuant to the IRS Actuarial tables attached herewith and made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">What the parties meant by this language is not entirely clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Certainly, the use of a phrase such as \u201cfor the life of\u201d in an instrument typically symbolizes a grantor\u2019s intent to create a life estate. <em>Restatement of Property </em>\u00a7 107 comment e (1936). Thus, the phrase \u201c[f]or the life of [B.D.]\u201d \u2014 standing alone \u2014 would unambiguously express that the lease would last for B.D.\u2019s life and terminate on her death. However, other aspects of the lease tend to suggest an intent to convey some different interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">For example, the lease transferred to B.D. only a possessory interest; B.D. did not obtain any of the rights or obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>normally associated with the creation of a life estate in property, such as the right to receive income derived from the property, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 119. Here, B.D.\u2019s right to receive rent on the first floor apartment was not retained by her after the transfer to her grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Another notable provision that might suggest the conveyance may have been for something less than a life estate is the subordination clause. There it is declared that the lease \u201cshall be subordinate to all present and future mortgages\u201d on the property, which is not of particular moment. But this provision also states that if the property is sold as a result of foreclosure \u201cthe holder of a mortgage on the [b]uilding <em>may end, this Lease\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the lease contemplates that future circumstances could bring an end to the term of the lease during B.D.\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We also observe that the record does not indicate what compensation B.D. would obtain if she could not occupy the premises through no fault of her own. For example, there is no evidence to suggest that B.D. has been named as a beneficiary of any policy of insurance providing coverage for the destruction or damage of the premises, <em>see, e.g., id., </em>\u00a7 123, and the lease imposes no such obligation on the landlord. This constitutes yet additional evidence that the parties may have intended to create something less than a life term for the leased apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">It is additionally uncertain whether the parties meant to create a life estate in the leased premises or merely a right to possession for life or for so long as B.D. continued to reside there. Generally, the conveyance of a life estate provides the grantee with the right to possess the property until death, and the grantee\u2019s decision to cease residing on the property is not normally relevant in determining when the life estate terminates. <em>See, e.g., Fabianski v. Boutin, </em>117 <em>N.H. </em>232, 371 A.2d 1166, 1167 (1977); 28 <em>Am.Jur.2d Estates </em>\u00a7 72 (2007). But, when the instrument can be construed to confer a right to possession only for so long as the grantee continues to use the premises as a home or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>residence, a cessation of occupancy may terminate the interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that circumstance, it is said that the grantor has conveyed to the grantee a life estate, which is subject to either a power of termination or a limitation on its use, such as if the conveyance was to B.D. so long as she wishes to live there, or to B.D. on the condition that she reside thereon. <em>Restatement of Property, supra, </em>\u00a7 112, Illustrations 2 and 3. If such clear expressions were contained in the lease, the Director\u2019s concern that B.D.\u2019s departure from the leasehold would terminate her interest in the property would have merit. <em>IcL, </em>\u00a7 152(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Here, the lease contains none of the clarity expressed in the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>examples, and portions of the lease are suggestive of a limitation on B.D.\u2019s interest or M.D.\u2019s retention of the power to terminate if B.D. no longer resided there. As revealed by the parties\u2019 stipulation, the property had been B.D.\u2019s home for many years, and it is conceivable that the parties intended that she would continue to reside there. Moreover, the provision of the lease entitled \u201cPossession and Use,\u201d states that M.D. conveyed to B.D. \u201cpossession of the [ajpartment ... for the Term <em>and </em>[B.D.] shall <em>take possession of and use </em>the [ajpartment only as a private resident\u201d (emphasis added). This provision suggests at least two plausible interpretations. The portion we have emphasized could be interpreted as requiring B.D.\u2019s occupation and use of the apartment to avoid a cessation of the term. This language could also have been included to bar B.D. from putting the leased premises to a non-residential use, although nothing in the record would support a suggestion that B.D. intended to operate a commercial business on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In the absence of evidence that might further illuminate the meaning of the lease\u2019s language, we hazard no guess as to its impact on B.D.\u2019s continued retention of an interest in the leasehold if she were to cease residing there. The point is that, until the matter is fully explored at an evidentiary hearing, the Director\u2019s construction of the lease \u2014 and her holding that the lease would terminate if B.D. were to move to a nursing home or elsewhere\u2014 can neither be upheld nor rejected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In addition, the reference to the IRS actuarial table in defining the lease\u2019s duration, without explanation in the document about its relevance, only adds to the ambiguity. Certainly, this ambiguity might be resolvable if the reason for its inclusion was known. For example, the reference to the actuarial table might have been incorporated to suggest the agreement\u2019s fairness to an interested reader, i.e., the agency charged with examining the transaction for Medicaid purposes. That is, its addition may have been added to explain the <em>potential </em>and not the <em>actual </em>life of the lease term and, thus, to show that the lease is a legitimate exercise in Medicaid planning. Or, as now urged by B.D., the lease\u2019s reference to her life expectancy could have been an inartful way of defining the lease\u2019s term as enduring for <em>at least </em>10.83 years <em>regardless </em>of the length of her life.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We question, but cannot decide on the limited factual record, whether there is merit in either of these possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Certainly, if the parties intended to agree upon a lease term as presently described by B.D. in this appeal \u2014 a term that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>end with B.D.\u2019s death \u2014 there is nothing in the lease other than the citation to an actuarial table that would provide support. We are mindful of a provision in the lease which indicates that the lease is \u201cbinding on the Landlord and the Tenant and all parties who lawfully succeed to their rights or take their places.\u201d However, this provision, like most other things about this lease, is unclear. If the parties meant to memorialize what B.D. now contends, it seems odd they would not have indicated that the lease would survive B.D.\u2019s death and that her interest would succeed to her \u201cheirs or assigns.\u201d That phrase is notably absent from this provision or the rest of the lease, and its absence suggests that the tenant\u2019s right to possession would not survive the life of the tenant. In light of the surrounding circumstances and B.D.\u2019s stage of life, it seems more likely that the parties had in mind the possibility that B.D.\u2019s rights might succeed, by operation of law, to a guardian. Such a guardian would gain title to the ward\u2019s property, but the ward\u2019s death would terminate that interest and any property held by the guardian would pass to the ward\u2019s estate. If that was what the parties intended, the succession clause would not necessarily support the claim that the lease term would survive B.D.\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">And lastly, the Director would be entitled to reject B.D.\u2019s contention because the parties failed to describe in plain language what she now claims was the actual lease term. In other words, if it truly was the parties\u2019 intention, it would have been a simple thing for them to express that the lease would terminate in 10.83 years or upon B.D.\u2019s death, whichever came last. Their failure to state that which can be simply and easily stated might be rather persuasive evidence that they possessed no such intention at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In our exploration of the language of the lease and the parties\u2019 various contentions, it has not been our intention to intimate any view as to how the document\u2019s ambiguities should be resolved. Our intent has been to reveal the document\u2019s ambiguities in order to provide guidance for the undertaking to follow. The fact is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>in light of the lease\u2019s ambiguities and uncertainties, and in light of the absence of extrinsic evidence or evidence about the surrounding circumstances in the existing record, we cannot conclude that the Director\u2019s interpretation is either correct or incorrect. The matter requires deeper analysis only available after all relevant evidence is explored at a plenary hearing. <em>See Conway v. 287 Corporate Ctr. </em>Assocs., 187 N.J. 259, 268-70, 901 A.2d 341 (2006); <em>Atlantic N. Airlines, Inc. v. Schwimmer, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>293, 301-02, 96 A.2d 652 (1953).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We are satisfied, however, that if the duration of the lease is determined, after remand, as being consistent with the Director\u2019s prior assumption that the lease would terminate upon B.D.\u2019s departure from the premises or upon her death, then we would have no cause to second-guess the Director\u2019s conclusion that fair market value was not given when B.D. prepaid $175,000 for that interest. In short, upon such a finding, the Director would be entitled to conclude that the purchase by a seventy-seven-year-old woman, who has required the program\u2019s services since 2003, of a life interest in the leased premises in exchange for the prepayment of approximately ten years\u2019 worth of rent would not constitute a fair exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On the other hand, if the lease\u2019s term is found to be no less than 10.83 years from its inception regardless of when B.D. dies and regardless of how long B.D. may actually reside in the premises, then the prepayment of $175,000 for that interest may possibly constitute fair market value. Support for a finding of fair market value, however, has yet to be presented. There is no evidence in the record that would shed light on the fair market value of a 10.83-year lease term for these premises. The only evidence presented on this point was a realtor\u2019s summary opinion that $1,500 per month constituted a fair rental for a three-bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>apartment in Kearny. The Director\u2019s conclusion that this net opinion was inadequate was correct On remand, if the evidence supports B.D.\u2019s contention as to the term of the lease, then she will be obligated to present additional evidence as to whether the pre-purchase of a lease of these premises for the property interest conveyed constituted fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Lastly, we reject B.D.\u2019s contention that, through her decision in this matter, the Director engaged in rule-making without taking the appropriate administrative steps. We find there is insufficient merit in this argument to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e) (1) (E). The Director\u2019s decision was not based upon her adoption of a new rule but upon her interpretation of the stipulated facts in this novel setting in light of existing rules and regulations. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10. The Director has the expertise to determine the significance and sufficiency of various types of asset transfers, such as that presented in this case, and when her findings are supported by credible evidence and correct legal principles, they are entitled to our deference. <em>See H.K., supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 877 A.2d 1218. We reverse the Director\u2019s decision not because we believe she lacked the power to make such a determination \u2014 she clearly possessed that power \u2014 but because her determination was based upon a factual record that failed to provide sufficient clarity and merely begged the question posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">To summarize, we conclude that whether $175,000 constituted fair market value for the leasehold interest cannot be answered until the actual term of the lease is ascertained. This question requires a plenary hearing at which extrinsic evidence as to the parties\u2019 true intentions in entering into this transaction, and any other relevant evidence about the surrounding circumstances, should be presented. We, thus, reverse the final agency decision and remand the matter to the Director for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We, of course, do not foreclose the Director from referring the matter to the ALJ for purposes of developing the record that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> This calculation was based on an expert\u2019s one-sentence written opinion, which asserted that the fair market rental of \"a three bedroom apartment in Kearny\u201d was $1,500 per month. Crediting this expert's opinion, the ALJ concluded that B.D. had prepaid $18,000 in yearly rent for a 10.83-year period, i.e., $194,940.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> We share the Director\u2019s doubts about the value of the expert opinion relied on by the ALJ. The expert stated only that it was his opinion that \"$1,500.00 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>month is the suggested rental for a three bedroom apartment in Kearny, NJ.\u201d Without further explanation as to how this conclusion was reached, and, moreover, without any assertion as to the value of <em>this </em>lease, which was not a month-to-month lease but a lease for the life of a particular person, the Director correctly found it unreliable. Moreover, the evidence in the record does not suggest that the apartment leased by B.D. had three bedrooms \u2014 one of the few factual premises for the expert\u2019s opinion. Instead, comments in the record suggest that the apartment in question had either one or two bedrooms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> <em>See Battin v.
