Eisenberg and his former law firm, Post <em>&amp; </em>Schell, P.C., appeal from a final judgment awarding their former clients, plaintiffs Carbis Sales, Inc. (Carbis or plaintiff) and Safe Step Reinsurance, Inc. (Safe Step) $704,405.20 in damages. On appeal, defendants contend that the trial court erred in admitting the net opinion of plaintiffs\u2019 expert and in refusing them discovery of a memo prepared by an investigator retained by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in denying them a new trial on damages or additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice claim arose out of their representation by defendants in an underlying products liability cause of action filed by Dennis Carr, who alleged that the ladder from which he fell was defectively altered by Carbis, a ladder distribution company. The facts adduced during that trial established that at the time of the accident on April 7,1990, Carr was working as a poly-seal foam insulator for Red Lion Insulation (Red Lion) inside one of the homes under construction in a residential development (Carriage Park) being built by U.S. Homes. He had used a six-foot ladder manufactured by R.D. Werner (Werner), which he had positioned in the foyer in front of the main entry door, with a canister of Polycel on his back, in order to spray insulation around the seams of the door and the second-story window above. As he was descending the ladder, Carr heard a cracking noise and felt the ladder twist. He immediately jumped off to the left from a height of two or three feet and landed in a cut-out heating/air conditioning vent. Experiencing terrible back pain, Carr loaded the ladder onto his truck and left the development for home.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Carr was ultimately diagnosed with herniated discs at L4 and L5 and underwent a laminectomy in August 1990. He was out of work for almost a year-and-a-half, and thereafter, due to residual pain and numbness, claimed he was unable to return to work as an insulator. Instead, he found work as a truck driver at a reduced salary. Carr also maintained that his condition contributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>demise of his marriage and rendered him unable to enjoy many recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">When Carr did not return to work on April 9,1990, he was fired from his job by Dave Ryan, Red Lion\u2019s president. Ryan also retrieved the company truck and ladder from Carr\u2019s home. Sometime later, Carr called a fellow employee, Steve McMichael, who supposedly returned the ladder to Carr. According to Carr\u2019s expert\u2019s inspection, the ladder had been cut down from twelve feet to six feet by Carbis prior to the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Carr filed his original complaint on January 3, 1992, alleging that U.S. Homes\u2019 structure where he fell was in a defective condition and that the defect was a proximate cause of his fall and injuries. Carr also asserted a strict liability claim against Werner, manufacturer of the ladder, and included as defendants \u201cJohn Does 7-10\u201d who, Carr claimed, \u201cmarketed, sold, distributed, shipped, and/or delivered the defective ladder, or were otherwise involved in placing the ladder into the stream of commerce.\u201d U.S. Homes joined Tempeon Corp., the HVAC subcontractor at Carriage Park, and Red Lion as third-party defendants. In October 1994, Carr amended his complaint substituting for John Doe 7, Carbis, who Red Lion claimed exclusively repaired all its ladders, alleging that Carbis was negligent in altering the twelve-foot ladder by cutting it down to six feet and then placing it in the stream of commerce by selling it to Red Lion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">U.S. Homes moved for summary judgment, arguing that the \u201csole basis\u201d for being named a party defendant was Carr\u2019s \u201cunsubstantiated assertion that the accident took place <em>somewhere </em>in Carriage Park,\u201d the development being built by U.S. Homes. U.S. Homes pointed out that Carr was unable to give an address or an exact location of the house where the accident occurred. It also noted that when Carr went to the development and identified two houses where the accident might have occurred, neither house had a vent cut out next to a stairway where, according to Carr, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>fell from the ladder. The trial court granted U.S. Homes summary judgment on April 29,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Following suit, Carbis filed a two-prong motion for summary judgment, arguing: (1) the grant of summary judgment in favor of U.S. Homes constituted a finding that, as a matter of law, Carr was unable to prove how, when, and where his accident occurred and that no rational factfinder could resolve the disputed evidence in Carr\u2019s favor; and (2) Carr was unable to establish a reliable chain of custody regarding the alleged ladder, and was unable to identify the ladder as the one he was using on the date of the accident. In opposition, Carr submitted an affidavit stating that the ladder he fell from on April 7, 1990 was the same ladder he turned over to his attorney and was the same ladder retrieved for him by McMichael, who was employed by Red Lion at the time. In light of Carr\u2019s affidavit, the trial court denied Carbis\u2019 motion, concluding there were genuine fact issues as to product identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">At the close of Carr\u2019s case, the complaint against Werner was dismissed. On its case-in-chief, Eisenberg, Carbis\u2019 trial attorney, presented evidence to the jury that: (1) Carbis, an experienced and reputable ladder repair company, could not possibly have repaired the ladder that Carr fell from; and (2) Carr could not establish the chain of custody for the ladder placed in evidence. However, despite the fact that the central fact issue was whether Carr had properly identified the ladder that was defective, Eisenberg failed to produce McMichael to ascertain whether he would corroborate Carr\u2019s account of the ladder\u2019s retrieval \u2014 a version belied by a June 29, 1990 letter from Carr\u2019s attorney to Red Lion requesting production of the ladder. Eisenberg also did not offer into evidence photos depicting the height of the Carriage Park foyer windows, suggesting that a six-foot ladder would have been insufficient for the work allegedly performed by Carr, or proof that there was a twelve-foot ladder on Carr\u2019s truck. Nor did he call the engineering experts, Nicholas Colanzi and Raymond Sams, who had been instrumental to the other defendants\u2019 successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>disposition based on Carr\u2019s description of his fall.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, Eisenberg did not produce a defense medical expert to testify about the effects of Carr\u2019s several subsequent accidents; about his statement in an unrelated 1992 deposition that his back was f\u00edne; or about the fact that he had not sought any medical treatment for his back since 1994. Eisenberg also chose not to call an economist to counter Carr\u2019s testimony on lost income.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">At the close of Carr\u2019s case, the complaint against Werner was dismissed. The jury thereafter returned a verdict in favor of Carr and against Carbis, assessing damages in favor of Carr in the amount of $600,000 and damages to his wife in the amount of $100,000 on her consortium claim. Including prejudgment interest and counsel fees, judgment was entered in the amount of $1,005,842.27. Of this, Carbis actually only paid its $15,000 deductible, while Safe Step, its primary insurer, contributed its full policy amount of $500,000 ($395,000 of which went to Carr). Lexington Insurance Company, Carbis\u2019 secondary insurer, paid the remaining $500,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Subsequently, in April 2001, plaintiffs Carbis and Safe Step sued Eisenberg and his firm Post &amp; Schell for legal malpractice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the jury trial, it was established that the law firm was hired to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>defend Carbis in the products liability action and Beth Wright, a member of the firm, was initially assigned to handle the matter. She proceeded to investigate the case and retained an expert, Johnson, who was prepared to testify that the ladder was unusable prior to the accident and could not have been repaired by Carbis. Wright, however, left the firm on June 16, 1997 and the Carbis file, which included 2400 pages of depositions, nine expert reports and various summary judgment motions, was reassigned to Eisenberg. Although Eisenberg claimed to have immediately commenced reviewing the file, he could not quantify any such time spent. Moreover, his timesheets prior to September 11, 1997, do not reflect any billable hours charged Carbis, and instead document that during this same time he was billing other clients an average of 56 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Eisenberg\u2019s time records do document that he began preparing the case on September 11, 1997, five days before the ten-day trial began. He spent a recorded total of 20.8 hours in preparation, which did not include meeting or speaking with Samuel Cramer, who headed Carbis, or Paul Junius, a principal in the firm hired to manage all claims against Carbis. During this time, Eisenberg did not prepare any witnesses or any deposition summaries. His file contained no memos or notes other than eight \u201cstickies\u201d that he claimed constituted his deposition review system. He was unaware of, and consequently did not review, a surveillance tape of Carr obtained by another defendant that might have suggested that Carr was not as debilitated as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">McMichael testified at the malpractice trial that he had never been asked by Carr to retrieve a ladder and that he did not do so. George Repko, who worked as Carbis\u2019 principal ladder repairer at the time of Carr\u2019s accident, reported that he could have been located in 1997 and that he would have testified at the trial had he been asked. He denied repairing the ladder in question, which was probably returned to Red Lion in a damaged condition because Red Lion refused to pay disposal fees for unsalvageable ladders. Repko followed an inspection list when repairing lad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ders, including ensuring that all required warning labels were in place, and that the absence of warning labels on the subject ladder indicated that he had not repaired it.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Sams, the engineering expert, explained that not only did Carr\u2019s description of the house in which he fell not match any of the homes in Carriage Park, but also it was physically impossible for Carr to have used a six-foot ladder to perform his job or to have fallen in the manner he claimed. Specifically, Sams noted that the top of the foyer windows in the Carriage Park homes most similar to the home Carr described measured twenty feet high. Further, the vent Carr claimed to have stepped into would have been five to six feet from the ladder and ten feet from the door. Sams attempted to recreate the accident and found that it would have been \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for the accident to have happened as Carr alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice expert, Bennett Wasserman, opined that Eisenberg did not comply with the standard of care for properly preparing a ease for trial. He faulted Eisenberg for numerous lapses including: (1) not putting in enough time on the file; (2) failing to meet and prepare his witnesses; (3) not contacting McMichael; (4) failing to locate the two \u201ckids\u201d who were present at the time of the alleged accident; (5) failing to call Colanzi and Sams to describe the physical impossibility of the accident as described by Carr; (6) failing to call an orthopedist and economic expert; (7) failing to rely upon Carr\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter seeking the return of the ladder from Red Lion; and (8) failing to call Repko. Wasserman noted that, in his experience, cases involving surgical herniated discs were usually worth $50,000 to $150,000, and that, in his opinion, the Carr jury reached its verdict because of a wholly avoidable lack of evidence on behalf of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In contrast, Eisenberg testified he had had no evidence to contradict Carr\u2019s version of the fall and that Carr\u2019s story was \u201ccompelling\u201d. Also, he did not believe that Carr\u2019s medical condition was an \u201copen\u201d issue. He insisted that his decision not to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>McMichael or the various experts retained by co-defendants was an appropriate judgment call. He further claimed that the Carbis ladder repairers were not available as witnesses for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Warren Faulk testified as a defense expert that Eisenberg\u2019s representation of Carbis exceeded the standard of care, and that he exercised proper judgment in deciding not to attack plaintiffs credibility. Faulk further maintained that Eisenberg was under no obligation to present an expert to counter every expert presented by the plaintiff. Faulk conceded, though, that in reaching his opinion he had not been aware that Eisenberg never met with any witness prior to trial, and further acknowledged that defendant should have spent many more hours reviewing the case and preparing for trial. Lastly, Faulk admitted that he would have looked for McMichael and that he had no idea why McMichael was never deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The jury ultimately returned a general verdict, finding defendants negligent in their representation of plaintiffs and awarding plaintiffs $362,561.70 in damages. Defendants moved for a new trial as did plaintiffs who, in the alternative, moved for additur, and in either case for an award of legal fees and costs. On April 17, 2006, the trial court entered an order denying both new trial motions but awarding plaintiffs an additional $253,517.51 in costs and fees for a total judgment of $704,405.20, including prejudgment interest. This appeal and cross-appeal follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">(I)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">On appeal, defendants argue the trial court erred in admitting the net opinion of plaintiffs\u2019 expert. Actually, this contention was first made below in a pre-trial motion to bar Wasserman\u2019s testimony. The motion judge denied relief, determining that Wasserman had provided the \u201cwhy[s] and wherefore[s]\u201d and \u201ccould sit before a jury, ... [and] tell them I think this case would have gone a different way, and it is based on factual data, and legal conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>sions.\u201d Then, at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendants moved for a directed verdict based on the same grounds. The trial judge rejected this argument as well, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">I took very copious notes because one of the concerns I had was whether there was actually a standard of care or a personal opinion as to what should be done. And I\u2019m satisfied that there was testimony that took it out of ... personal opinion____ Wasserman testified about the standard that he teaches, that there\u2019s a standard of care ... that has been enumerated so I thought he went sufficiently beyond a personal opinion of a standard of care, that he established that there\u2019s a standard of care. Whether the jury puts any weight on it or not will be summation. And there was cross-examination by you on that. And on the facts upon which the opinion is predicated there was cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">But I thought he got through the standard of care. It was close but I thought he established that there was a standard of care that had been deviated from and then a couple of times he said had it been done appropriately, the jury would have or the verdict would have been different____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">Based on the ... notes I\u2019ve taken and the standard, I\u2019m going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">We agree with these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Legal malpractice is a variation on the tort of negligence. <em>McGrogan v. Till, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>414, 425, 771 A.2d 1187 (2001). To establish legal malpractice, a plaintiff must show: \u201c \u2018(1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship creating a duty of care upon the attorney; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) proximate causation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, P.C., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 416, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996) (quoting <em>Lovett v. Estate of Lovett, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 87, 593 A.2d 382 (Ch.Div.1991)); <em>see also Jerista v. Murray, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>175, 190-91, 883 A.2d 350 (2005). As \u201cthe duties a lawyer owes to his client are not known by the average juror,\u201d expert testimony must necessarily set forth that duty and explain the breach. <em>Stoeckel v. Twp. of Knowlton, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 14, 902 A.2d 930 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>489, 909 A.2d 724 (2006); <em>Sommers v. McKinney, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 10, 670 A.2d 99 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, an expert\u2019s opinion must be based on \u201cfacts, data, or another expert\u2019s opinion, either perceived by or made known to the expert, at or before trial.\u201d <em>Rosenberg v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Tavorath, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 401, 800 A.2d 216 (App.Div.2002). Under the \u201cnet opinion\u201d rule, an opinion lacking in such foundation and consisting of \u201c \u2018bare conclusions, unsupported by factual evidence\u2019 \u201d is inadmissible. <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 91, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984) (quoting <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981)). The rule requires an expert \u201cto give the why and wherefore\u201d of his or her opinion, rather than a mere conclusion. <em>Jimenez v. GNOC, Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super </em>533, 540, 670 A.2d 24 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>374, 678 A.2d 714 (1996). In the context of legal malpractice, an expert must base his or her opinion on standards accepted by the legal community and not merely on the expert\u2019s personally held views. <em>Kaplan v. Skoloff &amp; Wolfe, P.C., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super </em>97, 103, 770 A.2d 1258 (App.Div.2001); <em>Stoeckel, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 14, 902 A.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Defendants contend that Wasserman\u2019s opinion was nothing more than a net opinion because he \u201cfailed to reference, in either his report or at trial, any written document or unwritten custom accepted by the legal community recognizing the standards that he claimed to exist.\u201d We disagree. In his report, Wasserman specifically referenced extensive case law, as well as <em>R.P.C. </em>1.3, establishing that an attorney has an obligation to carefully investigate his case and diligently pursue his or her client\u2019s claims before formulating legal strategies. He also cited to cases and treatises indicating that an attorney cannot be held liable for an erroneous judgment call unless that judgment was not properly informed. As previously detailed, Wasserman then went on to identify the deficiencies he perceived in Eisenberg\u2019s preparation of the case and the resulting ill-informed judgments defendant made as to the presentation of Carbis\u2019 defense to the jury. Such deviations, he opined, constitute a violation of the tenets of the Rules of Professional Responsibility and of the general duty to exercise that degree of care, knowledge, judgment and skill that a reasonably prudent lawyer of ordinary ability would have exercised in the same or similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>We are satisfied that Wasserman\u2019s opinion is clearly based on factual evidence of record, to which he applied generally accepted standards of care as reflected in both our case law and Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>St. Pius X House of Retreats v. Diocese of Camden, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>571, 588, 448 A.2d 1052 (1982). As such, and contrary to defendants\u2019 next contention, we find the expert opinion as to defendants\u2019 violation of these rules to be competent evidence of legal malpractice, sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">CB)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Defendants\u2019 last argument is that the trial court erred in denying their motion, made for the first time at trial, for discovery of the memo prepared by plaintiffs\u2019 investigator who had interviewed McMichael. We find no merit to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Prior to the <em>Carr </em>trial, none of the parties made any effort to interview or depose McMichael, and he was never called upon to testify. However, plaintiffs in the legal malpractice case sent an investigator to interview McMichael and thereafter deposed him on April 21, 2005. Both in deposition, and later at trial, McMichael consistently denied ever retrieving a ladder at Carr\u2019s request. At deposition, however, he testified that he had no recollection of telling plaintiffs\u2019 investigator anything to the contrary, a suggestion perhaps implicit in the very nature of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s question to the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In any event, just before McMichael testified at trial some nine months after his deposition, defense counsel moved for the first time to compel discovery of the statement given by McMichael to plaintiffs\u2019 investigator. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel produced for the court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review the memo prepared by the investigator which, notably, did not contain any statement signed by McMichael, but rather consisted simply of the investigator\u2019s notes as to what McMichael supposedly had told him. After reviewing the document, the judge reserved decision until after MeMichael\u2019s direct testimony, and thereafter denied the request, reasoning that: (1) the memo was not an actual witness statement but rather the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>investigator\u2019s impressions of what McMichael said along with the investigator\u2019s own interpretation; (2) there was no inconsistency between McMichael\u2019s deposition testimony and trial testimony; and (3) no showing had been made that any effort had been made to obtain the equivalent of the information by other means prior to trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In the first place, defendants\u2019 motion was grossly out of time. The discovery period had closed months before trial without defense counsel ever filing a pretrial motion to compel the production of the investigator\u2019s memo despite knowing of its existence since at least McMichael\u2019s deposition. <em>Cf. R. </em>4:24-2 (\u201c[MJotions to compel discovery ... must be made returnable prior to the expiration of the discovery period.\u201d). No explanation to date has been offered for this failure to act. For this reason alone, we are satisfied that there was no abuse of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion in denying defendants\u2019 motion to compel discovery in the midst of trial. <em>Terrell v. Schweitzer-Mauduit Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 115, 799 A.2d 667 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Moreover, production of the memo was unlikely to have led to the discovery of competent, admissible evidence. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a) and 4:18-1(a). As evident in the trial judge\u2019s description, the memo may not properly be characterized as McMichael\u2019s statement. Unlike formal witness statements taken by an insurance carrier after the inception of litigation, <em>see, e.g., Medford v. Duggan, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 130-31, 732 A.2d 533 (App.Div.1999), the investigator\u2019s memo was neither a transcription of the interview of McMichael nor a signed writing containing questions and answers, but merely the investigator\u2019s impressions of what McMichael purportedly said. As such, the memo could not have been used by defense counsel under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607 for impeachment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See Pfender v. Torres, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 391-92, 765 A.2d 208 (App.Div.) (granting new trial based on trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs pre-trial motion to compel production of tape-recorded statements made by the defendant to insurance investigator describing happening of an accident where those descriptions were contrary to the defendant\u2019s trial testimony), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>637, 772 A.2d 938 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">And finally, defense counsel never demonstrated \u201can inability, without undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent of the [memo] by other means.\u201d <em>Medford, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133, 732 A.2d 533; <em>Pfender, supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 391, 765 A.2d 208. Defense counsel could have separately interviewed McMichael or questioned him about his interview with plaintiffs\u2019 investigator during the April 2005 deposition, but opted to do neither. Instead, defense counsel cross-examined McMichael on other matters at the deposition. In sum, under the circumstances, we discern no abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in denying defendants\u2019 much belated discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On their cross-appeal, plaintiffs urge a new trial on damages because the award was grossly disproportionate to the loss suffered. We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument that there is no reasonable basis to account for the damage verdict returned by the jury. However, we part company with plaintiffs\u2019 further assertion that the verdict for less than the full amount is reflective of the jury being misled by introduction of evidence that Lexington did not participate in the case. While such an explanation is certainly plausible, it is equally plausible that the jury based its damage verdict on a determination that but for defendant\u2019s negligence Carr would have received a lesser monetary verdict. The problem is that because of the manner in which the verdict was presented, it is impossible to ascertain whether the jury\u2019s damage verdict was tied to a finding that defendant was negligent in the liability phase or the damage phase of the underlying case or both. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>fore conclude that on remand the entire matter must be retried to resolve plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. In so doing, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 remaining argument that the judgment should have been increased by the court to reflect disgorgement of legal fees and costs paid for the work of Eisenberg\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">At trial, plaintiffs presented an exhibit detailing their damages, which they claimed totaled $1,005,842.27, including not only the monies paid to Carr but: (1) $55,191.10 paid to Post &amp; Schell for Wright\u2019s work and pre-trial litigation expenses and expert fees; (2) $27,575.97 paid to Post &amp; Schell for trial and post-trial costs and expert fees; and (3) $25,127.81 paid to Stahl &amp; DeLaurentis for post-trial and Carr appeal legal fees. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, in his summation, urged the jury to award this full amount. In arguing otherwise, defense counsel, in summation, and contrary to the court\u2019s earlier ruling, mentioned Lexington\u2019s assignment in the context of the excess insurer\u2019s decision not to participate in the malpractice litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel voiced objection at the end of defendants\u2019 closing, the judge instructed the jury not to consider the offending remark, but failed to mention that the validity of the assignment was not in dispute or, for that matter, its putative effect on plaintiffs\u2019 damage claim. In his final charge to the jury, the judge simply instructed that it was solely in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>jury\u2019s discretion what, if anything, to award plaintiffs. As noted, the jury returned a verdict of $362,561.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">At the new trial motion, plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to a new trial on damages or additur in view of the jury\u2019s inexplicable failure to award plaintiffs the full $1,005,842.27 awarded to Carr, given the jury\u2019s general finding of legal malpractice and proximate cause, and consequently that the $362,561.70 awarded must have been the result of jury confusion created by defense counsel on the assignment issue. The trial judge denied the motion, concluding that the jury could have reached its award in a variety of ways based upon the evidence, and that he did not find the award shocking. As to plaintiffs\u2019 other argument that defendants had to disgorge the $107,894.88 paid by plaintiffs for legal services performed prior to Eisenberg\u2019s involvement, the judge noted, in part, that plaintiffs conceded at trial they had no problem paying for Beth Wright\u2019s pre-trial work.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In determining the adequacy of a damages award, the trial judge must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for relief. <em>Caldwell v. Haynes, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>422, 432, 643 A.2d 564 (1994). A trial court may not disturb a compensatory damages award in the absence of finding that it is plainly wrong or shocking to the conscience of the court. <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 596, 379 A.2d 225 (1977). Where the claimant\u2019s right to relief is clear and the verdict was not the result of compromise or otherwise tainted, the techniques of additur and remittitur should be employed to avoid the unnecessary expense and delay of a new trial. <em>Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 38-39, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004). However, a new trial on damages is the appropriate remedy where the jury\u2019s verdict mandates that an omitted item of damages be awarded. <em>Love v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 533, 841 A.2d 931 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>355, 851 A.2d 649 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The purpose of a legal malpractice claim is to put the \u201c \u2018plaintiff in as good a position as he [or she] would have been had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the [attorney] kept his [or her] contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saffer v. Willoughby, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>256, 271, 670 A.2d 527 (1996) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Lieberman v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>325, 341, 419 A.2d 417 (1980)). Thus, \u201cthe measure of damages is ordinarily the amount that the client would have received [or would not have had to pay] but for his attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Gautam v. DeLuca, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 397, 521 A.2d 1343 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>39, 532 A.2d 1107 (1987). Specifically, in the context of legal malpractice in the <em>prosecution </em>of a client\u2019s cause, resulting in dismissal of the client\u2019s complaint, \u201cthe measure of damages is ordinarily the amount that the client would have received but for [the] attorney\u2019s negligence,\u201d and is \u201cgenerally shown by ... evidence establishing [liability] and worth of the claim that was irredeemably lost.\u201d <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397, 521 A.2d 1343; <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 419 A.2d 417; <em>Hoppe v. Ranzini, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 164, 385 A.2d 913 (App.Div.1978). By parity of reasoning, the measure of damages for legal malpractice in the <em>defense </em>of a client\u2019s cause is ordinarily fixed at the amount of the adverse judgment, or that portion thereof, that would not have been obtained against the client but for the attorney\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u201cThe most common way to prove the harm inflicted by [legal] malpractice is to proceed by way of a \u2018suit within a suit\u2019 in which a plaintiff presents the evidence that would have been submitted at trial had no malpractice occurred.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Kozlov, Seaton, Romanini &amp; Brooks, P.C., </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>343, 358, 845 A.2d 602 (2004). At such a trial, the plaintiff, who typically was the plaintiff in the underlying case, must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence that: \u201c \u2018(1) he [or she] would have recovered a judgment in the action against the main defendant, (2) the amount of that judgment, and (3) the degree of collectibility of such judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Hoppe, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 165, 385 A.2d 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">However, depending on the circumstances, a legal malpractice case may proceed in other ways, including a modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201csuit -within a suit\u201d or a suit employing expert testimony as to what, as a matter of reasonable probability, would have transpired at the original trial. <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 343-44, 419 A.2d 417. A flexible approach is particularly warranted in the more unusual cases where the aggrieved plaintiff in the malpractice action was the defendant in the original underlying action. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 419 A.2d 417. In such instances, it is likely to be \u201cawkward and impracticable\u201d for the plaintiff to proceed \u201cwith direct proofs, as though he [or she] were the erstwhile claimant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Ultimately it is \u201cwithin the discretion of the trial judge as to the manner in which the plaintiff may proceed to prove his claim for damages.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 329, 419 A.2d 417, where, as here, the plaintiff in the malpractice action was the defendant at the original trial, the attorney retained by the plaintiff neurosurgeon\u2019s professional liability insurer disregarded the plaintiff\u2019s express wishes and settled a medical malpractice action which had been brought against the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 419 A.2d 417. Because of the amount of that settlement, the claim was deemed a \u201cchargeable claim\u201d by plaintiff\u2019s insurance company, and plaintiffs annual malpractice insurance premiums were increased substantially. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff subsequently sued the attorney for legal malpractice. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Although the plaintiff prevailed at trial, an appellate panel, while not disturbing the finding of liability, reversed and remanded for a new trial on damages. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 419 A.2d 417. The Supreme Court affirmed these rulings. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 344, 419 A.2d 417. In affirming, the Lieberman Court emphasized that Lieberman was only entitled to recover for losses which were proximately caused by the attorney\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 419 A.2d 417. The <em>Lieberman </em>Court instructed that, in order to demonstrate his entitlement to reimbursement for his enhanced premiums, Lieberman was required to show: \u201c(1) that he would have received in the [original] suit a verdict in his favor or a verdict against him [in an amount that would not have resulted in the claim being deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>chargeable], or (2) that his insurer would have settled the claim [at a non-chargeable amount].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 419 A.2d 417. According to the <em>Lieberman </em>Court, because the trial court did not fix damages in this manner, a remand for a new trial on damages was required. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Governed by these principles, we discern no reasonable basis in the evidence for the jury\u2019s damage award. The amount of the adverse products liability verdict \u2014 $1,005,842.27\u2014was undisputed as was apparently the validity of the assignment of Lexington\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ordinarily, as already noted, where attorney negligence is proven in the defense of a claim, the measure of damages would be fixed by the adverse judgment. However, as suggested by the jury\u2019s lesser verdict in this case, defense counsel\u2019s express references in summation to Lexington\u2019s assignment had the very real capacity to mislead or confuse the jury by suggesting that either Lexington considered the case without merit in choosing not to litigate, or worse yet, an award encompassing the $500,000 paid by Lexington would constitute a windfall to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Either way, the injection of such considerations extrinsic to the matter had the potential to prejudice plaintiffs and taint the jury verdict. For this reason alone, the damage award, disproportionate as it is to the adverse judgments against plaintiffs, is fatally suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Ordinarily, the remedy would be additur or, if not accepted, a new trial on damages only, as was the case in <em>Lieberman. </em>Indeed, this is what plaintiffs urge. However, because of the manner in which the legal malpractice case was tried, the jury charged, and the verdict sheet drafted, we are at a loss as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>whether the jury found that Carr\u2019s underlying products liability action, if properly defended, would have been altogether no-caused or simply deserving of only a portion of the total damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">More to the point, the evidence permitted the jury to reach two different conclusions as to the effect of Eisenberg\u2019s negligence: (1) that but for Eisenberg\u2019s malpractice, Carr would have received nothing in the underlying case; or (2) that but for Eisenberg\u2019s malpractice, Carr would have received a lesser verdict. Notably, although plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not, in his summation, urge the jury to reach the latter conclusion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there was a reasonable basis, from plaintiffs\u2019 own expert witness, for the jury to find that defendant\u2019s failure to call an orthopedist and/or economist resulted in an excessive damage verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">However, the trial judge\u2019s charge did not discuss these two possibilities nor did the verdict sheet require the jury to specify which conclusion they had drawn. To compound the matter, the trial judge did not provide the jury with any instruction as to damages, other than to simply state that it was in the jury\u2019s discretion what, if anything, to award plaintiffs. Yet, plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>request for a limited remand only on damages assumes, without basis, a jury finding that defendants committed legal malpractice in the liability phase which resulted in the adverse judgment against plaintiffs. In other words, plaintiffs ask us to assume the jury concluded that, but for Eisenberg\u2019s negligence, Carr would have received nothing in the products liability case. But, as noted, it is equally plausible that the jury instead found Carr would have prevailed regardless, but that his recovery was greater due to attorney negligence in the damages phase of trial. Because of this uncertainty, plaintiffs are not entitled, in effect, to a directed verdict on liability as would result if remand were limited, as urged by plaintiffs, to a damages-only new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">It has been acknowledged, in the context of legal malpractice cases, that \u201c \u2018[a] charge is a road map to guide the jury, and without an appropriate charge a jury can take a wrong turn in its deliberations.\u2019\u201d <em>Froom v. Perel, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 312, 872 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Das v. Thani, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>518, 527, 795 A.2d 876 (2002)), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>267, 883 A.2d 1063 (2005). Likewise, our Supreme Court has encouraged the use of special interrogatories that elicit jury findings with \u201cprecision\u201d in legal malpractice cases. <em>Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 411-12, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996). \u201cIn the end the judge has the ultimate responsibility for insuring the correctness of the verdict sheet.\u201d <em>Benson v. Brown, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 565, 648 A.2d 499 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We are convinced that neither the jury charge nor verdict sheet in this case assured against a \u201cwrong turn\u201d in jury deliberations. Nor do they provide a basis for remanding for a new trial on damages without disturbing the findings of liability. Indeed, the only way for a jury on remand to determine what losses were proximately caused by which facets of Eisenberg\u2019s malpractice is for them to hear what that malpractice consisted of. That is, they would have to essentially hear the entire case on liability. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ingly, the remedy on plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is a remand for a new trial as to all issues and all parties. <em>R. </em>4:49-l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We fully realize that by so ordering, defendants are given a second chance to disprove their liability. Yet, that is a risk plaintiffs advised us at oral argument that they are willing to assume as a consequence of prosecuting their cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Accordingly, the matter is remanded for a new trial on all issues. Although this disposition moots plaintiffs\u2019 related claim of entitlement to legal fees and costs paid for the legal services of Beth Wright, we nevertheless address the issue because of the need for a retrial occasioned by plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">As part of their new trial motion, plaintiffs broadly argued that they were entitled to be reimbursed for the $107,894.88 they had previously paid to Post &amp; Schell for Wright\u2019s work, all pre- and post-trial expenses, and the Carr appeal. The trial judge, however, believed that plaintiffs had conceded at trial that they had no problem with Wright\u2019s work, and that, in any event, under <em>Saffer, supra, </em>disgorgement of an entire fee is not required where there is no proven malpractice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Plaintiffs now contend that, while Wright\u2019s work may not have violated the standard of care, they should nonetheless be reimbursed for her legal fees because the law firm was hired to defend the Carr ease competently and, in the final analysis, failed to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>so. We disagree. Plaintiffs concede that Wright\u2019s work was not deficient and likely not the basis for the general verdict rendered by the jury. Moreover, the legal bills in this case were clearly differentiated. Under the circumstances, <em>Saffer </em>does not require disgorgement of legal fees and costs expended for the services of an attorney who is not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\"> Eisenberg did challenge Carr's credibility to some extent by entering into evidence, during <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>testimony.

Carbis appealed the judgment against it in <em>Carr, </em>incurring legal fees of $25,127.81, but the judgment was affirmed in an unpublished opinion dated July 13, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-11\"> Lexington elected not to participate in the litigation but assigned its right to any recovery to plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> At defendants' behest, however, defense counsel was allowed to ask McMichael if he had ever made a statement contrary to his trial testimony, but that if the witness denied making any such statement, no further inquiry would be permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\"> Thus, <em>in summation, </em>defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">The insurance company is the plaintiff.
