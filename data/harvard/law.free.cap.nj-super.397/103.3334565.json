Mohrmann sold Maguire a brown and white English Springer Spaniel puppy for $1,000 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>August 11, 2006. The puppy died five days later. Prior to instituting legal action, Maguire informed Mohrmann of the dog\u2019s death and obtained a veterinary certification that the puppy had been certified \u201cunfit for sale.\u201d The puppy was suspected to have an \u201cunderlying infectious parasite, metabolic, congenital disorder.\u201d Maguire did not deliver the veterinarian\u2019s certification to Mohrmann; she attached it to her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">At trial, after presentation of plaintiffs evidence, Mohrmann moved to dismiss the complaint because Maguire failed to provide her with the veterinarian\u2019s certification, thus preventing Mohrmann from securing an autopsy. The trial judge denied the motion because Maguire had provided oral notice. The trial judge then voided the contract based upon mutual mistake and awarded plaintiff the purchase price of the dog and the veterinary expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On appeal, Mohrmann asserts the trial judge erred by applying contract principles in light of the specific regulations that control the rights and responsibilities of the parties. Mohrmann maintains that plaintiffs recovery was specifically conditioned on the delivery of the certification that the animal was unfit for sale. Maguire\u2019s noncompliance eliminated her ability to obtain relief. We disagree and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">When Maguire purchased the puppy, Mohrmann gave her a statement entitled \u201cKNOW YOUR RIGHTS \u2014 A STATEMENT OF NEW JERSEY LAW GOVERNING THE SALE OF DOGS AND CATS.\u201d The document, executed by both purchaser and seller, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">The sale of dogs and cats is subject to a regulation of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. In the event that a licensed Veterinarian certifies your animal to be unfit for purchase within 14 days following the receipt of your animal or within six months in the case of a congenital or hereditary cause or condition, you may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">I. Return your animal and receive a refund of the purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">II. Keep you[r] animal and attempt to cure it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">III. Return your animal and receive an animal of your choice of equivalent value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">Further, in the event of your animal\u2019s death within this 14-day period, except where death occurs by accident or as a result of injuries sustained after delivery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>you may choose to receive either a full refund of the purchase price or an animal of your choice of equivalent value. In addition, veterinary fees limited to two times the purchase price of the animal must be paid by the pet dealer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">In order to exercise these rights, you must present to the pet dealer a written veterinary certification that the animal is unfit for purchase and an itemized bill of all veterinary fees incurred prior to your receipt of the certification. Both of these items must be presented no later than 7 days after you have received the certification of unfitness. In the event that the pet dealer wishes to contest the certification of the bill, he may request a hearing at the Division of Consumer Affairs. If the pet dealer does not contest the matter, he must make the refund or reimbursement no later than ten days after receiving the veterinary certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Mohrmann also gave Maguire a health certificate from Lawrence Wolf, V.M.D. certifying that \u201ca black and white English Springer Spaniel\u201d had been examined by him on August 8, 2006, and was found to be \u201cfree from infectious or contagious diseases.\u201d The veterinary records introduced into evidence reflect treatment for worms on August 2 and 7, 2006. The trial judge noted that it was not clear if Dr. Wolf had examined the brown and white puppy purchased by Maguire.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Four days after purchase, Maguire\u2019s puppy became limp and would not eat. As Maguire drove to the veterinarian\u2019s office, she called Mohrmann to tell her of the puppy\u2019s condition. Maguire learned from Mohrmann that the dog had been ill approximately two weeks prior, and Mohrmann had \u201cnursed him back to health.\u201d Maguire left the pet with her veterinarian for treatment. Unfortunately, the dog passed away during the night. The veterinarian issued a certificate of unfitness and a bill, totaling $399.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Maguire notified Mohrmann that the puppy had died. Mohrmann acknowledged she had spoken to the veterinarian\u2019s office and told Maguire she was going away for the weekend and would call on August 21, 2006. Beginning that Monday, Maguire spent almost a week attempting to contact Mohrmann by telephone, email, and online messages. In an email dated Sunday, August 27,2006, Maguire stated that unless she heard from Mohrmann by August 30, 2006, she would accept only reimbursement of her expenses. Thereafter, Mohrmann instructed Maguire to contact her attorney. Maguire then filed her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The Pet Purchase Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-92 to -97 (PPPA) is a consumer protection statute that governs the sale of dogs and cats sold by pet shops. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-95(a) through (f). The statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">No provision of this act shall be construed in any way to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFq\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-94.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Prior to enactment of the PPPA, regulations governing the sale of cats and dogs were adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -166(CFA). <em>Pet Dealers Ass\u2019n v. Div. of Consumer Affairs, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 237, 373 A.2d 688 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>16, 379 A.2d 247 (1977). Effective December 4, 1995, specialized regulations governing dog and cat sales by pet dealers were implemented by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs (DCA). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.1 to -12.3. Because Mohrmann was a pet dealer, that is, \u201cany person engaged in ... the sale of animals for profit to the public or any person who sells ... more than five animals per year,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-93 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.1, she is subject to the DCA regulations, not the PPPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">As authorized by the CFA, the DCA regulates pet dealers to prevent deceptive sale practices, and requires that prior to the pet sale, the seller afford notice of the rights and responsibilities of the purchaser of an animal. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12-45A-12.1 to -12.3. The regulations provide an alternative remedy to consumers who purchase a dog or eat from a \u201cpet dealer\u201d that is later discovered to be \u201cunfit for purchase.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.1. The notice of rights required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.3(a)10, generally provides an overview of the regulatory provisions. This is the notice Mohrmann gave Maguire.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A dog is \u201cunfit for purchase\u201d if the animal dies \u201cwithin 14 days of its delivery to the consumer, except by death by accident or as a result of injuries sustained during that period.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.1. A consumer who obtains a veterinarian\u2019s certification that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the animal was \u201cunfit for purchase,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.3(a)6, may elect one of four options for relief, including a return of the purchase price and reimbursement of veterinary costs, not to exceed the cost of the pet. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.3(a)6(iv). If a consumer delivers the veterinary certificate and the statement of charges to the pet dealer within five days of receipt, the pet dealer must record and comply with the consumer\u2019s elected remedy within ten days. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.2(a)7 through 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The regulations also provide a procedure for the pet dealer to contest the consumer\u2019s election of relief by notifying \u201cthe consumer and the Director of the [DCA] in writing within five days following the receipt of the veterinarian\u2019s certification, and he may require the consumer to produce the animal for examination by a veterinarian of the dealer\u2019s choice at a mutually convenient time and place.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C </em>13:45A-12.3(a)9.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Mohrmann maintains that Maguire\u2019s failure to timely present the veterinary certification of unfitness results in the dismissal of her claim. We reject such a rigid interpretation of the regulatory procedures, which would undercut Maguire\u2019s consumer claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The CFA protects consumers against fraud and misleading practices in the sale of goods and services. <em>Daaleman v. Elizabethtown Gas Co., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>267, 270, 390 A.02d 566 (1978); <em>Pet Dealers, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 373 A.2d 688. To accomplish the CFA\u2019s remedial purposes, and its deterrent and protective objectives, its provisions must be interpreted broadly. <em>Lettenmaier v. Lube Connection, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>134, 139, 741 A.2d 591 (1999); <em>Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt., </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>255, 264, 696 A.2d 546 (1997). The intent of the regulations at hand is to safeguard consumers from sharp practices in the sale of dogs and cats by pet dealers. The regulations assure \u201ca remedy for the consumer who seeks to purchase a healthy pet but instead receives an unhealthy or otherwise defective animal.\u201d <em>Pet Dealers, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 373 A.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>In her decision, the trial judge determined that plaintiff had conveyed notice to defendant of the dog\u2019s death, finding that \u201cthe spirit of this regulation ... has been met.\u201d We understand that the trial judge applied the doctrine of substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Substantial compliance \u201cis a doctrine based on justice and fairness, designed to avoid technical rejection of legitimate claims,\u201d <em>Galik v. Clara Maass Med. Ctr., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>341, 352, 771 A.2d 1141 (2001) (citing <em>Zamel v. Port of N.Y. Auth., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 264 A.2d 201 (1970)); <em>Ferreira v. Rancocas Orthopedic Assocs., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>144, 151, 836 A.2d 779 (2003), and \u201cavoid the harsh consequences that flow from technically inadequate actions that nonetheless meet a statute\u2019s underlying purpose.\u201d <em>Sprenger v. Trout, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>120, 139, 866 A.2d 1035 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201cThe doctrine requires the moving party to show: \u2018(1) the lack of prejudice to the defending party; (2) a series of steps taken to comply with the statute involved; (3) a general compliance with the purpose of the statute; (4) a reasonable notice of petitioner\u2019s claim; and (5) a reasonable explanation why there was not strict compliance with the statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Ferreira, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>144, 151, 836 A.2d 779 (2003) (quoting <em>Galik, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 353, 347-48, 771 A.2d 1141). Although no specific case was found applying the doctrine to regulatory provisions, we conclude that, in the absence of language foreclosing that possibility, no impediment to application is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Here, defendant was informed of the dog\u2019s illness, was told of the veterinarian\u2019s examination, and was advised that the animal had died. Maguire complied with Mohrmann\u2019s request to call when she returned from her weekend trip to discuss the matter further. Mohrmann then avoided plaintiffs numerous telephone calls and ignored the emails she sent requesting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We find disingenuous Mohrmann\u2019s position that she was waiting for the written confirmation from the veterinarian before taking action. Mohrmann was well-versed in her obligations and rights under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.3(a)9. She spoke to plaintiffs veteri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>narian and learned of the suspected cause of death, yet she did not request presentation of the dog for her independent examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Defendant\u2019s proposed rigid construction of the regulations strains the broad protections afforded to consumers by the CFA. We conclude that based upon the facts presented, Mohrmann chose not to exercise her right to autopsy the animal after Maguire substantially complied with the requirements of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-12.3(a)(7). Plaintiff was entitled to the relief granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
