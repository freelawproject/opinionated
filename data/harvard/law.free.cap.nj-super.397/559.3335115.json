We remand for further proceedings, as modified by us, to determine whether Franeine\u2019s allegations establish an implied contractual right to the proceeds of Robert\u2019s estate, as set forth in <em>In re Estate of Roccamonte, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>381, 808 A.2d 838 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The following are the undisputed facts presented to the Chancery judge on stipulation by the parties. Barbara and Robert were married on September 29, 1956. On December 24, 1957, Barbara gave birth to twins, Robert and Patricia Quarg. Barbara and Robert lived together until October 1958, when Barbara took the children and left the marital residence. Barbara and Robert never again lived as husband and wife but they never divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The only legal proceedings that took place between them were for visitation and child support, which occurred in New York in 1959-1960. When Robert visited the children, Barbara made herself scarce to avoid having words with him. Robert\u2019s visitations with the children ended by 1968. From 1969 to 2004, the only contact Barbara had with Robert was one meeting to discuss an issue regarding their son. They also had three brief unplanned encounters. Barbara visited Robert in hospice nine days before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Francine met Robert in 1961. They began a relationship shortly thereafter and Robert moved in with Francine. On November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>13, 1962, a son, Jonathan, was born to the couple. Both Francine and Jonathan took Robert\u2019s surname. The couple lived together continuously from 1961 until Robert entered a hospital in 2004, just weeks before his death. During that time period, they bought a home together, which was deeded to them as husband and wife. They also listed themselves as husband and wife on health insurance applications and also in all other respects held themselves out as husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Robert died intestate on December 8, 2004. His estate was valued at $345,568.63, of which $226,068.63 was personal property and $119,500 was real property. Letters of Administration were initially granted to Robert\u2019s daughter, Patricia. On June 29, 2005, Jonathan and Francine filed a Verified Complaint and Order to Show Cause seeking to establish a legal parent-child relationship between Jonathan and Robert.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In the first count of the complaint, Francine alleged that DNA testing established Jonathan as Robert\u2019s son. The second count sought to have Patricia\u2019s Letters <em>of </em>Administration set aside for failing to list Jonathan as a surviving son. In the third count, Francine asserted that she and Robert lived as unmarried cohabitants for more than four decades, during which they had formed an \u201cintimate relationship founded on mutual trust, dependence and raised expectations.\u201d She sought to share in Robert\u2019s estate, claiming that if Barbara is permitted to inherit as surviving spouse, Francine would be \u201cunjustly impoverished\u201d and Barbara \u201cunjustly enriched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">On September 8, 2005, the Chancery judge entered an order revoking Patricia as administrator and appointing a substitute administrator. A consent order was entered on October 25, 2005, establishing a legal parent-child relationship between Robert and Jonathan.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">On December 19, 2006, the judge issued her opinion from the bench. She found that the intestacy statutes create a \u201cstatutory will ... case law ... militate[d] against [Barbara\u2019s] entitlement to any interest, either by way of intestacy taking or elective-share.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The judge relied, in part, on the decision in <em>Carr v. Carr, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>336, 576 A.2d 872 (1990), for the principle that spouses may acquire an interest in marital property by virtue of their mutual efforts during marriage that contribute to the creation, acquisition, and preservation of such property. She then reasoned that Barbara did not play a role in the joint enterprise with Robert nor did she establish that the assets accumulated were for her benefit. As to Francine, the judge recognized that, while not qualifying as Robert\u2019s statutory wife or registered domestic partner, Francine was his \u201cpartner, caregiver, builder of dreams and assets,\u201d thus entitling her the equitable remedy of a constructive trust establishing her share in Robert\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On appeal, Barbara argues that she is entitled to receive one-half of Robert\u2019s estate under the applicable provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-3d, which sets the intestate share of a surviving spouse at one-half if there is surviving issue, one or more of whom are not issue of the surviving spouse. Barbara also argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 does not apply because the elective share statute protects spouses who are disinherited by will by providing for an elective share. She maintains that the judge erred in fashioning a constructive trust. She asserts that the facts in <em>Carr </em>are not analogous because the plaintiff in <em>Carr, </em>although in the process of obtaining a divorce, was still married to the decedent and seeking equitable distribution at the time of his death. Barbara further argues that the cases that permit unmarried cohabitants to collect equitable distribution deal with the palimony rights between unmarried couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We agree with Barbara that the probate statutes do not afford Francine a remedy under the circumstances of this case. However, we part company with her contention that Francine\u2019s factual allegations do not warrant judicial intervention. We do so for slightly different reasons than those expressed by the Chancery judge. <em>See Isko v. Plan. Bd. of Livingston Twp., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>162, 175, 238 A.2d 457 (1968). Viewing Francine\u2019s allegations together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the circumstances presented we are compelled to remand for further proceedings based upon implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We begin our analysis with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>378, 390-91, 403 A.2d 902 (1979). <em>Kozlowski </em>dealt with a non-married plaintiff seeking palimony from the defendant, her male partner. <em>Kozlowski, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 380, 403 A.2d 902. In <em>Kozlowski, </em>the defendant expressly promised to support his female partner for the rest of her life. However, the Court noted that it is of \u201cno legal consequence\u201d whether the promise is expressed or implied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">The only difference is in the nature of the proof of the agreement. Parties entering this type of relationship usually do not record their understanding in specific legalese. Rather, as here, the terms of their agreement are to be found in their respective versions of the agreement, and their acts and conduct in the light of the subject matter and the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 384, 403 A.2d 902.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Pashman agreed with the majority that a promise to provide for a life partner may be expressed or implied, with intent being discernable from the couple\u2019s \u201cconduct and actions interpreted in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 403 A.2d <em>902 </em>(Pashman, J., concurring). However, he went one step further, pointing out that in the absence of agreement a court could look to quantum meruit or its equitable remedies, including constructive and resulting trusts, to ensure that one party to a relationship is not unjustly enriched and the other unjustly impoverished. <em>Id. </em>at 390-91, 403 A.2d 902 (Pashman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">In <em>Carr, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 339-40, 576 A.2d 872, the husband died while the wife\u2019s divorce case was pending. The Court fashioned an equitable constructive trust remedy for the wife because her husband\u2019s death extinguished her divorce case along with her claim for equitable distribution, and she was not afforded a remedy under the elective share provision of the probate code. <em>Id. </em>at 351, 576 A.2d 872. The Court recognized that the wife\u2019s seventeen-year marriage was a joint enterprise, which contributed to the acquisition of marital property that would otherwise entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>her to equitable distribution had her husband not died. <em>Id. </em>at 347-50, 576 A.2d 872. The Court remanded the matter to permit an evidential showing \u201cto avoid ... unjust enrichment that would occur if the marital property devolving to Mr. Carr\u2019s estate included the share beneficially belonging to Mrs. Carr.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 576 A.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Quoting from Justice Pashman\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Kozlowski, </em>the <em>Carr </em>Court noted that a constructive trust was an appropriate remedy because \u201ccourts may presume that the parties \u2018intended to deal fairly with one another [and will] employ the doctrine of <em>quantum meruit, </em>or equitable remedies such as constructive or resulting trusts\u2019 in order to ensure that one party has not been unjustly enriched, and the other unjustly impoverished, on account of their dealings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 576 A.2d 872 (quoting <em>Kozlowski, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 390-91, 403 A.2d 902 (Pashman, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The circumstances in <em>In re Estate of Roccamonte, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>381, 808 A.2d 838 (2002), are somewhat similar to those before us. In <em>Roccamonte, </em>the plaintiff brought suit against her partner\u2019s estate, seeking a lump-sum award for her lifetime. The couple had lived together for more than twenty-five years even though the decedent never divorced his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 808 A.2d 838. The decedent had promised the plaintiff that he would see to it that she was provided for during her life. He died without a will. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 808 A.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Applying the same rationale to a probate action as it did in <em>Kozlowski, </em>the <em>Roccamonte </em>Court reaffirmed the principle that where an unmarried adult partner is induced to cohabit in a marital-like relationship by a promise of support, that promise will be enforced by the court whether it is oral or written, implied or express, or inferable from the parties\u2019 acts and conduct rather than by what they said. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 808 A.2d 838. Noting the right to support does not come from the relationship, but instead from contract, the court fashioned the same contractual remedy, as it did in <em>Kozlowski, </em>namely, a one-time lump sum in an amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>equal to the present value of the reasonable future support the decedent has promised to provide. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 808 A.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The <em>Roccamonte </em>Court pointed out that the decedent\u2019s concern for the plaintiffs well being was evidenced by his providing for her lavishly for the twenty-five years they were together. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 808 A.2d 838.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">In the circumstances and in view of the proofs, it appears highly unlikely that [the decedent] intended to leave [plaintiff] to an impoverished old age----The promise, elear-ly implied, if not expressed], that he would see to it that she was adequately provided for during her lifetime ... seems to us to [be] ... the corollary for and the condition of their relationship____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 395, 808 A.2d 838.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Resolving the novel issue of whether an implied promise of lifetime support was enforceable against the decedent\u2019s estate, the Court concluded that it was no different from the enforcement of any other contract made by a decedent during his lifetime. <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the Court determined that because the decedent\u2019s duty to fulfill his obligation to the partner was \u201cnot discharged by his death[, it] consequently [is to] be discharged by his estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97, 808 A.2d 838. \u201c[I]t is not the promisor\u2019s death that triggers [plaintiffs] entitlement, but rather his failure, during his lifetime, to have made adequate provision for the promisee, an obligation whose fulfillment does not depend solely or exclusively on testamentary disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 808 A.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">The Court in <em>Roccamonte </em>reached its decision based upon concepts of implied contract, despite the previous reference in <em>Carr </em>to Justice Pashman\u2019s concurrence in <em>Kozlowski. </em>It did not adopt the use of quantum meruit (a quasi contract imposed by law without reference to the parties\u2019 intent; <em>see, e.g., Kopin v. Orange Prods., Inc., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 366, 688 A.2d 130 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>409, 694 A.2d 194 (1997)) nor apply equitable concepts of constructive trust used by the Chancery judge in rendering her decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Although the decision in <em>Roccamonte </em>is not cited in either party\u2019s appellate brief, we note that Barbara argues that Francine submitted no proof that Robert intended to leave his estate to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>rather than to Barbara. She also asserts that Franeine\u2019s only theory rests upon unjust enrichment. Inferentially, we assume she would also argue that Francine presented no proofs that Robert impliedly promised to provide for Francine during her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As previously pointed out, one of the components of Francine\u2019s complaint alleged that she would become unjustly impoverished if she did not share in Robert\u2019s estate. More importantly, as the surviving partner, after more than forty years of living with Robert as married, Francine asserts that the relationship was \u201cfounded on mutual trust, dependency and raised expectations.\u201d In our view, such allegations bespeak an implied promise by Robert not to leave Francine impoverished, but rather, to see to it, as best he could, that she survived with adequate provisions during the remainder of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Because such a promise can be reasonably inferred from Robert\u2019s and Francine\u2019s conduct and actions, when viewed together with the lengthy period of living as husband and wife, we remand the. matter to the Chancery Division for a plenary hearing, if necessary, to determine whether Francine can establish an enforceable implied promise as detailed in <em>Roccamonte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We need not address Barbara\u2019s Point II argument, apparently raised for the first time on appeal, that, because Robert and Francine were not legally married, the deed to the real property taken by them as husband and wife cannot confer a survivorship interest as either joint tenants or tenants by the entirety. Francine concedes that the real property, which has been listed for sale, is being treated as held in tenancy in common with one-half belonging to Robert\u2019s estate. Consequently, the value of the real property belonging to the estate may be considered as part of any lump sum amount Francine may be entitled to if she successfully prevails in establishing an implied promise from Robert.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
