Judge Robert O\u2019Hagan rejected defendant insurer\u2019s disclaimer and effort to rescind its \u201cBusiness Overhead Expense\u201d disability policy issued to Shore as owner, with respect to Dr. Michael Absatz, as insured, and granted summary judgment on coverage to Shore, for which there is no cross-appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge also denied Shore\u2019s post-judgment motion for counsel fees, concluding this was neither a \u201cfirst party\u201d action nor a frivolous claim. However, by order of June 30, 2005, the judge awarded Shore $50,000 as a sanction for a discovery violation, from which defendant (\u201cEquitable\u201d) cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Plaintiff asserts that <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6) applies because this case dealt with a third party claim on \u201ca liability or indemnity policy of insurance,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1 applies because Equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201cknew or should have known that its counterclaims were merit-less,\u201d and that it is therefore entitled to counsel fees. On its cross-appeal from that part of the April 1, 2005 and June 30, 2005 orders awarding $50,000 in fees and costs as a sanction, Equitable asserts that Shore had \u201calready [been] compensated for all of the fees and costs incurred as a result of the delay\u201d and the discovery motion for which it had been awarded $3,000 in fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Equitable also claims that there was no rational basis for the award nor \u201cscruti[ny]\u201d of the fee application which included time for the discovery motion which had already been the subject of an award and conferences by attorneys in the plaintiffs firm who duplicated review of the same material.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">On November 7,1994, Shore, an orthopedic group of practitioners, applied for a Disability Overhead Expense policy with defendant insurer for coverage in the event that its associate Dr. Michael Absatz became disabled and was unable to pay his share of the overhead expenses of the group. Plaintiff was the owner of the policy and paid all of the premiums, although Dr. Absatz was the \u201cinsured.\u201d The policy provided that all benefits would be paid directly to Shore as \u201cthe owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In November 1994, Shore made an initial premium payment in order to obtain \u201cconditional receipt\u201d coverage pending review of the application and the carrier\u2019s determination that Absatz was \u201ca standard insurable risk.\u201d The application stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">If at least a minimum deposit is made, we will insure the Proposed Insured if s/he is a standard insurable risk on the effective date. The insurance provided will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">i) take effect as of the effective date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ii) be exactly as requested for individual coverage in the application; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">iii) continue until we notify you that the application is accepted, modified or filed, but in no event longer than 60 days from the effective date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On December 12, 1994, Equitable\u2019s underwriting department issued a memorandum to its agent requesting a recheck of Dr. Absatz\u2019s blood pressure. It was known he was under treatment for a dental condition called acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and had high blood pressure. The application was deemed \u201cincomplete\u201d until the recheck of Dr. Absatz\u2019s blood pressure. On January 23, 1995, Equitable sent a letter to Dr. Absatz stating that the file was deemed \u201cincomplete\u201d and that he would need to contact the sales representative to resolve the issues before a policy could be issued. Shore\u2019s original premium check was returned to defendant\u2019s agent who then returned it to Equitable with the new blood pressure readings.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On February 14,1995, Dr. Absatz submitted new blood pressure readings as a result of which it was determined that he was a standard underwriting risk. Equitable asserted that the underwriting department received the new readings on February 27, 1995, and its in-house medical consultant reviewed them on March 7,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">On March 4, 1995, Dr. Absatz had a biopsy performed on the area of his mouth afflicted with the gingivitis. On March 10,1995, Dr. Absatz was diagnosed with palate cancer, but Equitable was not so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">On April 21, 1995, Equitable issued the policy naming Dr. Absatz as insured. The policy was dated April 7, 1995. Upon receipt, Dr. Absatz acknowledged both a \u201cPolicy Issue Information Sheet\u201d and \u201cAmendment to Application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">On July 22, 1998, \u201cdue to the progression of [a] neurologic deficit cause[d] by [the] radiation\u201d for his \u201crecurrent squamous cell cancer,\u201d Dr. Absatz\u2019s medical condition rendered him totally disabled to perform orthopedic surgery. As a result, Shore submitted a claim for benefits under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Equitable denied the claim, informing Shore by letter, dated January 19,1999, that Dr. Absatz did not disclose the diagnosis of cancer which was made during the application process and before the policy was issued. According to Equitable\u2019s claims representative, had it known of the condition, the policy would never have been issued, and it was being \u201crescind[ed].\u201d Shore and Absatz contested the disclaimer, by letter from counsel dated April 15, 1999, which stated, among other things, that because the Conditional Receipt policy was purchased in November 1994, and Absatz had met the standard underwriting criteria on February 14,1995, discovery of the oral cancer in March 1995 did not need to be reported. Shore\u2019s complaint, seeking the policy benefits, was filed on May 25, 2001. In that context the impact of Equitable\u2019s policies and procedure relating to conditional receipt coverage became important.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Starting in August 2001, Shore unsuccessfully requested that Equitable produce its underwriting manual and all other manuals in force at the time that the conditional receipt and policy were issued. After three years of unsuccessfully endeavoring to obtain this discovery, two of Equitable\u2019s sales agents testified in depositions that defendant did, in fact, have extensive libraries of manuals which revealed that its responses to plaintiffs requests for production were not accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Shore thereafter continued unsuccessfully in its attempts to obtain production of the underwriting manuals. Finally, on July 16, 2004, plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of the manuals. On July 20, 2004, defendant produced materials indicating the existence of the relevant underwriting manual, and on August 13, 2004, Judge O\u2019Hagan ordered defendant to provide the underwriting manual and other discovery. He also indicated he would award plaintiff attorney fees for having to pursue the discovery and filing of the motion. Shore subsequently submitted a fee application in the amount of $4,952.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Thereafter, on cross motions for summary judgment, Judge O\u2019Hagan concluded that, particularly because the original premium was not returned to Shore, the policy became effective on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>February 14, 1995. He therefore entered judgment for Shore. As previously noted, Judge O\u2019Hagan also awarded plaintiff $3,000 in connection with the motion which resulted in the production of the manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On or about March 1, 2005, plaintiff filed its motion for attorney fees and costs. It asserted entitlement to counsel fees pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:42 \u2014 9(a)(6) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1 because defendant \u201cknew or should have known from the outset of this litigation that its counterclaim seeking to rescind the policy was frivolous because its asserted basis for its attempted rescission were contrary to the Equitable\u2019s internal written underwriting guidelines.\u201d It also argued that there was \u201cno legitimate basis for denying the claim\u201d and failing to produce documents defendant had, and that if Equitable had \u201cproduced the manual in a timely manner, Shore Orthopaedic would have moved much earlier for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In awarding $50,000 to plaintiff as a discovery sanction against defendant, Judge O\u2019Hagan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">I believe this insurance company knew all along of the existence of this form, this manual as [how] to handle these matters, but Just didn\u2019t, but just was intentionally obfuscating the area. In fact, there was indeed affirmative misstatements that no such manual exists or we\u2019re not aware of any such manual or things of that nature, when as a matter of fact it did exist____ And in fact, sure enough, it did surface. Now, as to the discovery aspect of this, when that first came to light I awarded fees as it concerned that round of motion practice. I think the transgression went so much beyond that on the part of the Equitable____ They didn\u2019t partake in the discovery process in good faith as far as I\u2019m concerned. I think we\u2019re not talking about a frivolous litigation situation. I think it maybe should have been recognized early on by [defendant] in their defense that this manual basically required that judgment be entered in favor of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">But I think they violated their discovery obligations in such a[n] obvious and such an improper way that merely assessing sanctions for the immediate motion then under consideration is inadequate, inappropriate and I think not fair to the plaintiff. Plaintiff never should have had to undergo all of these expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Thus, in his June 30, 2005 order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge awarded fees for the period from the date of the first discovery request for the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>manual through the motion for summary judgment, \u201cless fees incurred for drafting\u201d the summary judgment motion and the fees already awarded and received \u201cin accordance with\u201d the April 1, 2005 order for the discovery motion. Plaintiff thereafter submitted a request totaling $65,263.05 in fees and costs. Defendant opposed the request, arguing that it contained duplicate services for which Shore already received a recovery, and was excessive irrespective of the discovery delay because plaintiff would have had the same expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In entering the June 30, 2005 order awarding plaintiff $50,000 representing what he believed was \u201cfair and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by Shore Orthopaedic,\u201d Judge O\u2019Hagan reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">From [the] Court\u2019s perspective some of [the] services rendered could have been performed by lower level employees or attorneys. However, defendant\u2019s actions in denying existence of documents and thereafter in delaying production of same unduly and unfairly protracted resolution of this matter. Had the documents been produced when requested there <em>may </em>have been a request for fees, however <em>that </em>issue would not have been as complicated as Equitable Life caused here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The decision to award counsel fees rests \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Maudsley v. State, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 590, 816 A.2d 189 (App.Div.2003). <em>See also Packard-Bamberger &amp; Co. v. Collier, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>427, 443-44, 771 A.2d 1194 (2001) (attorney\u2019s fee determination by trial courts is disturbed only upon a clear abuse of discretion); <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 317, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995) (\u201cfee determinations by trial courts will be disturbed only on the rarest of occasions, and then only because of a clear abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>Iafelice v. Arpino, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 590, 726 A.2d 275 (App.Div.1999) (\u201cbroad discretion\u201d to award fees under <em>R. </em>4:42-9 when authorized to grant them); <em>Mandel v. UBS/PaineWebber, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 83-84, 860 A.2d 945 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>213, 871 A.2d 91 (2005) (discretion to deny award of counsel fees under frivolous lawsuit statute). However, absent agreement of the parties, there must be a basis in the court rules or a statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>order for the trial court to exercise its discretion, <em>In re Niles, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>282, 293-95, 823 A.2d 1 (2003); <em>Satellite Gateway Commc\u2019ns v. Musi Dining Car Co., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>280, 285, 540 A.2d 1267 (1988), and that is a question of law. In this case there is no basis for the grant of attorney\u2019s fees under <em>Rule </em>4:42-9 or the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to recover its counsel fees pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6). However, <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6) does not pertain to first party claims, and Judge O\u2019Hagan properly rejected plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Pursuant to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d adhered to by our Supreme Court, the prevailing party is ordinarily not entitled to collect counsel fees from the losing party. <em>In re Niles, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 823 A.2d 1. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9 (Gann 2008) (\u201cthe New Jersey Supreme Court has remained committed to the so-called American rule, that is, that the parties bear their own counsel fees\u201d). The Court reiterated that \u201cthe purposes behind the American Rule are threefold: (1) unrestricted access to the courts for all persons; (2) ensuring equity by not penalizing persons for exercising their right to litigate a dispute, even if they should lose; and (3) administrative convenience.\u201d <em>In re Niles, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 823 A.2d 1 (citing <em>In re Estate of Lash, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>20, 43, 776 A.2d 765 (2001) (Verniero &amp; LaVecchia, JJ., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The Supreme Court, as an exception to the American rule, has authorized trial courts to award reasonable attorney fees in limited circumstances when specifically permitted to do so by rule or statute. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 823 A.2d 1; <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 322, 661 A.2d 1202; <em>Gateway, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 284, 540 A.2d 1267. One such exception can be found in <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6), which permits an award \u201c[i]n an action upon a liability or indemnity policy of insurance, in favor of a successful claimant.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:42-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>9(a)(6). Thus, the rule has been limited to \u201cthird party\u201d claims as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">A \u201cfirst-party\u201d claim against an insurance company is \u201ca suit by an insured against his insurance company because of its failure to settle <em>his </em>claim ... as opposed to a suit based on the insurer\u2019s failure to settle a <em>third party </em>tort claim for a reasonable sum.\u201d <em>Pickett v. Lloyd\u2019s (A Syndicate of Underwriting Members), </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>457, 466, 621 A.2d 445 (1993) (quoting <em>Indus. Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. Romer, </em>432 So.2d 66, 69 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1983) (Hurley, J., concurring)). A third party has no direct relationship with the carrier and looks to it for recovery for injury caused by its insured. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2.6 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9(6) (Gann 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Because the intention of the Rule \u201cis intended to permit an award of counsel fees only where an insurer refused to indemnify or defend in respect of its insured\u2019s third-party liability to another, it has not been extended beyond its express terms in order to authorize a fee award to an insured who brings direct suit against his insurer to enforce casualty or other direct coverage, including UM/UIM coverage.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Cowrt Rules, </em>comment 2.6 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) (Gann 2008). <em>See also Enright v. Lubow, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>306, 311-12, 521 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>193, 528 A.2d 19 (1987) (holding <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) to be inapplicable to direct actions brought by the insured against the carrier to enforce coverage); <em>Giri v. Medical Inter-Ins. Exchange of N.J., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>148, 151, 597 A.2d 561 (App.Div.1991) (observing that rule applies where \u201c\u2018an insurer refuses to indemnify or defend its insured\u2019s third-party liability to another\u2019 and does not authorize an award of counsel fees to an insured \u2018on a direct suit against the insurer to enforce a casualty or other first-party direct coverage\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Guarantee Ins. Co. v. Saltman, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>604, 610-11, 526 A.2d 731 (App.Div. 1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Shore insists that <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(6) applies here because it was a \u201cthird-party\u201d and it filed a \u201cthird-party\u201d claim because Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Absatz was the insured. We also recognize that plaintiff could have sued Dr. Absatz for expenses and that he would have sought a defense or indemnification from the insurer. However, Shore purchased the insurance, paid the premiums, owned the policy and was the beneficiary to be protected when and if Dr. Absatz became disabled and unable to make his share of the expenses of the insured medical group. Hence, Judge O\u2019Hagan correctly found that plaintiff filed a first party claim and the Rule does not authorize an award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Shore also contends that it was entitled to recover its legal fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1, the frivolous litigation statute. <em>See also R. </em>4:42-9(a)(8) (allowing fees where \u201cpermitted by statute\u201d). However, the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that the defense was not \u201cfrivolous\u201d and declining to award fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1(a), the frivolous litigation statute, provides that reasonable litigation costs and counsel fees may be awarded to the prevailing party \u201cif the judge finds at any time during the proceedings or upon judgment that a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense of the non-prevailing person was frivolous.\u201d Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">In order to find that a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense of the nonprevailing party was frivolous, the judge shall find on the basis of the pleadings, discovery, or the evidence presented that either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">(1) The complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense was commenced, used or continued in bad faith, solely for the purpose of harassment, delay or malicious injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">(2) The nonprevailing party knew, or should have known, that the complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or defense was without any reasonable basis in law or equity and could not be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Since its enactment in 1988, the statute has been recognized as serving a dual purpose. <em>Toll Bros., Inc. v. Township of W. Windsor, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>61, 67, 918 A.2d 595 (2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>hand, \u201cthe statute serves a punitive purpose, seeking to deter frivolous litigation.\u201d <em>Deutch &amp; Shur, P.C. v. Roth, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 141, 663 A.2d 1373 (Law Div.1995). On the other hand, the statute serves a compensatory purpose, seeking to reimburse \u201cthe party that has been victimized by the party bringing the frivolous litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Thus, a pleading, case or defense can be deemed \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it \u201cwas filed in bad faith solely for the purpose of harassment, delay or malicious injury,\u201d or filed \u201cwithout any reasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>Lake Lenore Estates, </em>Assocs. <em>v. Twp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills Bd. of Educ., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 424, 712 A.2d 200 (App.Div.1998) (internal citations omitted). A claim will then be found to be \u201cfrivolous\u201d only if it \u201cwas commenced or maintained in bad faith\u201d or the action \u201cwas without any reasonable basis in law or equity and could not be supported by a good faith argument for extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>Savona v. Di Giorgio Corp., </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 62, 821 A.2d 518 (App.Div.2003) (citations omitted). In the context of a claim of bad faith for an insurance company\u2019s failure to pay a valid claim, our Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">To show a claim for bad faith, a plaintiff must show the absence of a reasonable basis for denying benefits of the policy and the defendant\u2019s knowledge or reckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the claim. It is apparent, then, that the tort of bad faith is an intentional one____ [I]mplicit in that test is our conclusion that the knowledge of the lack of a reasonable basis may be inferred and imputed to an insurance company where there is a reckless ... indifference to facts or to proofs submitted by the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\"><em>[Pickett, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 473, 621 A.2d 445.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Neither will false allegations of fact \u201cjustify a fee award unless they are made in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, delay, or malicious injury.\u201d <em>Belfer v.

Thus, the term \u201cfrivolous,\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1, has been \u201cgiven a restrictive interpretation.\u201d Ibid.; <em>see also McKeown-Brand v. Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>546, 561, 626 A.2d 425 (1993); <em>Savona, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 60-61, 821A.2d 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In rejecting plaintiff\u2019s statutory claim, Judge O\u2019Hagan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">I think we\u2019re not talking about a frivolous litigation situation. I think it maybe should have been recognized early on by [ ] Equitable Life ... in their defense that this manual basically required that judgment be entered in favor of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The judge thus did not find that defendant\u2019s actions in declining the claim and defending the action showed intentional bad faith, harassment or malicious injury. The doctor\u2019s medical condition and its timing in connection with issuance of the policy warranted examination of the claim, and we have no basis on which to disturb Judge O\u2019Hagan\u2019s ruling given our public policy concerning the costs of litigation. To the extent bad faith or improper motives were involved once discovery requests were made and denied, the sanctions imposed properly addressed the matter and provided a deterrence. Even if the sanctions do not come within the express wording of <em>Rule </em>1:2-4, or the discovery rules including <em>Rule </em>4:23-2, they certainly come within the spirit, and inherent authority of the court. <em>See Abtrax Pharm., Inc. v. Elkins-Sinn, Inc., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>499, 512, 655 A.2d 1368 (1995); <em>Manorcare Health Services, Inc. v. Osmose Wood Preserving Inc., </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 230, 764 A.2d 475 (App.Div.2001); <em>Summit Trust Co. v. Baxt, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>439, 450, 755 A.2d 1214 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>678, 762 A.2d 658 (2000); <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Imet Mason Contractors, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>358, 365, 707 A.2d 180 (App.Div.1998). On the other hand, the authority to impose a sanction is limited to reimbursement of a party\u2019s counsel fees and expenses \u201cthat would have been avoided by disclosure\u201d of the discovery. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2.2.1 to <em>R. </em>4:5-1 (Gann 2008). <em>See also Wolfe v. Malberg, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>630, 637-38, 760 A.2d 812 (App.Div.2000); <em>Oliviero v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 387, 575 A.2d 50 (App.Div.1990). Judge O\u2019Hagan so limited the sanction, and it is upheld substantially for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>he gave. <em>See Abtrax, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 517-22, 655 A.2d 1368 (scope of review; upholding dismissal of complaint and imposition of counsel fees and expenses as sanction).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Equitable contends on its cross-appeal that: 1) the trial court failed to scrutinize the fee demand; 2) the award includes fees not subject to reimbursement; and 3) the award includes unreasonable and excessive fees. Hence, defendant asks us to vacate or reduce the $50,000 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As we have already noted, the judge recognized the limitations imposed on his inherent authority to award discovery sanctions, and \u201c[sanctions imposed by a trial court will not be disturbed on appeal if they are just and reasonable under the circumstances,\u201d <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 365, 707 A.2d 180; <em>see also Manorcare Health Services, Inc., supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 230, 764 A.2d 475. For purposes of its cross-appeal, Equitable does not now dispute Judge O\u2019Hagan\u2019s inherent authority to award counsel fees for discovery violations. Eather it argues the amount of fees were unreasonably high. We reject the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Judge O\u2019Hagan awarded fees only for the period of time after plaintiff requested the manual, and he deducted the fees already awarded, $3,000 on the discovery motion itself as well as the fees related to the summary judgment motion, reasoning that Shore would have filed the summary judgment motion regardless of the discovery violations and when it formed the basis for doing so. Moreover, as previously discussed, the judge reviewed the application carefully and awarded only a portion of the requested fees, and the judge properly \u201ccalculated [the fees and costs] from the point when compliance [with discovery requirements] was practicable.\u201d Cf<em>. Toll Bros., supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 73, 918 A.2d 595 (regarding fees and costs for \u201cfrivolous litigation\u201d). Furthermore, because the judge specifically excluded the earlier award of $3,000 from the total plaintiff requested, there was no duplicate award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The discovery violation resulted in collateral costs which warranted the sanction, and we can find no abuse of discretion in the $50,000 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The orders under review are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\"> The order requiring defendant insurer to pay \"the amount provided by the policy,\u201d was entered on October 8, 2004, and Equitable paid the policy limits plus prejudgment interest.
