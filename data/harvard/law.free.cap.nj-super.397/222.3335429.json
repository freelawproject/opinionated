Berkery, Sr., appeals from an order entered on October 20, 2006 granting summary judgment in favor of defendants dismissing the complaint with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">This case arises out of two articles written by defendant Monica Yant Kinney and published in the Philadelphia Inquirer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following is a summary of the facts relevant to this appeal. Temple University Professor, Allen Hornblum, authored a book entitled <em>Confessions of a Second Story Man: Junior Kripplebauer and the K &amp; A Gang. </em>The book focused on a criminal gang that operated in the 1950s and early sixties and named plaintiff as a member of the gang who participated in a number of crimes, including the 1959 \u201cPottsville heist,\u201d a robbery allegedly committed by the K &amp; A Gang. The articles written by Kinney addressed plaintiffs attempts to stop Hornblum from publishing the book and his defamation suit against Hornblum.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that (1) the trial court \u201cmade no definitive finding as to whether or not plaintiff was a \u2018first amendment limited-purpose public figure;\u2019 \u201d (2) plaintiff \u201chas been a private individual with a right to privacy and not a public figure, limited-purpose public figure, or so-called \u2018involuntary\u2019 limited-purpose public figure;\u201d (3) the case of <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986), \u201cwas a totally wrong-headed application of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s standards for applying the malice standard;\u201d (4) plaintiff \u201cshunned, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>courted the press;\u201d and (5) defendant Kinney falsely accused plaintiff of being \u201ca thug, thief, burglar, mob associate, lawbreaker, and murderer, statements that are libelous per se.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In his brief, plaintiff acknowledged six criminal convictions, including larceny, passing bogus traveler\u2019s checks, attempted burglary of an unoccupied warehouse, assault and battery, and two drug offenses. He characterized these offenses as \u201cminor scrapes with the law,\u201d and objected to Kinney\u2019s characterization of him as a \u201ccareer criminal.\u201d Plaintiff argues that Hornblum\u2019s book and Kinney\u2019s articles overlook the fact that he has \u201ccompleted college, gone on to obtain a Master\u2019s Degree in English &amp; [sic] Publishing from Rosemont College, a year of law school at Regent University in Virginia Beach, and a post-baccalaureate paralegal degree from Manna College in Jenkintown, Pa.\u201d Plaintiff claims that the two articles written by Kinney and published in the Philadelphia Inquirer contain numerous fallacies, constitute an invasion of his privacy, an intrusion upon his seclusion and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In granting summary judgment, the trial judge found that there was no invasion of privacy because all of the information in the articles was either obtained through observation of plaintiff by Kinney during an interview with plaintiff or through public sources. The court noted that \u201cthere were very few comments [relating] to [plaintiff\u2019s] private life, other than to call [him] a suburban dad.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s opinion, those comments were not defamatory. The trial court further noted that the one word it found problematical was \u201cthug\u201d used in the first sentence of the first article: \u201cJohn Berkery was never a typical street thug.\u201d The court indicated, however, that the word was used in the past tense and referred to plaintiff\u2019s earlier conduct. The judge further indicated that \u201c[ajctual malice is a tough standard to meet. It\u2019s so tough that clearly and convincingly is the standard [rather than] a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>254, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>recovery for defamation is limited by the First Amendment requirement that public officials or public figures prove actual malice to recover damages. A public figure \u201cmay recover for injury to reputation only on clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>323, 342, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2997, 3008, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 807 (1974) (citing <em>New York Times, supra, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>at 279, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 726, 11 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 702).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In <em>Gertz, </em>the United States Supreme Court distinguished between an all-purpose public figure who has achieved \u201csuch pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts\u201d and a limited-purpose public figure who \u201c\u2018voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy.\u2019 \u201d 418 <em>U.S. </em>at 351, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3013, 41 L.Ed.2d at 812. The Supreme Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">It may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own ... those [classified] as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite attention and comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaj\"><em>[Id. </em>at 345, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3009, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 808.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">An individual who engages in criminal conduct does not automatically become a public figure for purposes of comment on a limited range of issues relating to his conviction. <em>Wolston v. Reader\u2019s Digest Assoc., </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>157, 168, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2701, 2708, 61 L.Ed.2d 450, 461 (1979). Rather, certain criteria must be met for one to become a limited-purpose public figure: \u201cThe court must consider (1) whether the alleged defamation involves a public controversy, and (2) the nature and extent of plaintiffs involvement in that controversy.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Paiewonsky, </em>769 F.2d 942, 948 (3d Cir.1985); <em>see also Marcone v. Penthouse Int'l, </em>754 F.2d 1072, 1082 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>864, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>182, 88 L.Ed.2d 151 (1985). A \u201cpublic controversy\u201d is defined as \u201ca real dispute, the outcome of which affects the general public or some segment of it\u201d and the \u201ccontent, form, and context ... as revealed by the whole record\u201d must be considered. <em>McDowell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>supra, </em>769 F.2d at 948 (quoting <em>Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>201 <em>U.S.App.D.C. </em>301, 627 F.2d 1287, 1296 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>898, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>266, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>128 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">An individual\u2019s involvement in publicized criminal activities and associations with organized criminal groups qualifies as a public controversy or issue that gives rise to limited-purpose public figure status. <em>Marcone, supra, </em>754 F.2d at 1086; <em>Rosanova v. Playboy Enterprises, Inc., </em>411 <em>F.Supp. </em>440 (S.D.Ga.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>580 F.2d 859 (5th Cir.1978). In <em>Scottsdale Publishing, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>159 <em>Aria. </em>72, 764 P.2d 1131 (Ct.App.1988), the Arizona Court of Appeals held that a \u201ccareer criminal\u201d who, in return for immunity from prosecution, testified as to his own criminal activities as a member of an organized crime gang was a public figure for purposes of his defamation action against a newspaper that published articles tying him to the murder of a local reporter. While acknowledging that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wolston, supra, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>at 168, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2705, 61 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 461, declined to hold that any person who engaged in criminal conduct automatically became a public figure, the Arizona court found that given the nature, duration and intensity of plaintiffs criminal conduct, he could not complain that the spotlight eventually turned on him years after his crimes. <em>Scottsdale Publishing, supra, </em>764 P.2d at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Plaintiff maintains that he is not a public figure because he now lives a private lifestyle. But, \u201conce a person becomes a public figure in connection with a particular controversy, that person remains a public figure thereafter for purposes of later commentary or treatment of that controversy.\u201d <em>Street v. National Broadcasting Co., </em>645 F.2d 1227, 1235 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>1095, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>667, 70 L.Ed.2d 636 (1981); <em>White v. Berkshire-Hathaway, </em>195 <em>Misc.2d </em>605, 759 N.Y.S.2d 638, 640 (Sup.Ct. Erie County 2003), <em>aff'd, 5 A.D.3d </em>1083, 773 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>664 (4th Dep\u2019t 2004) (holding \u201ca public figure, once established, remains a public figure for later comment on that controversy or subject matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In <em>Sisler, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court adopted the malice standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York Times </em>with respect to public figures. <em>Sisler, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 279, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986). Plaintiff argues, however, that <em>Sisler </em>\u201cwas a totally wrong-headed application of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s standards for applying the malice standard.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The malice standard for a defamation claim involving the public interest is entirely consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rulings. In <em>Sisler, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court considered, but expressly rejected, the negligence standard for a public interest matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">The negligence standard adopted by the courts below is inappropriate in the context of a defamation action that focuses upon published matters of legitimate public concern involving a knowledgeable individual who exposes himself to the risk of possible publicity. The uniqueness, variability and complexity of the tort of defamation suggest the need for a more exacting standard of liability____ [T]he negligence standard, which provides needed flexibility in the area of physical torts, may serve as a tool of censorship in the context of free speech and defamation____ New Jersey\u2019s long-standing expressed concern for free speech likewise advises against the use of the negligence standard in the context of this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">[104 <em>N.J. </em>at 276-77, 516 A.2d 1083.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Articulating a \u201cmore exacting standard of liability,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">We hold that when a private person with sufficient experience, understanding and knowledge enters into a personal transaction or conducts his personal affairs in a manner that one in his position would reasonably expect implicates a legitimate public interest with an attendant risk of publicity, defamatory speech that focuses upon that public interest will not be actionable unless it has been published with actual malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 279, 516 A.2d 1083.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">Since <em>Sisler, </em>the Supreme Court and our court have recognized that even if a plaintiff is a private, rather than a limited- or all-purpose public figure, the plaintiff may only recover in a defamation action concerning the public interest if actual malice is shown. <em>See, e.g., Rocci v. Ecole Secondaire MacDonald-Cartier, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>149, 155-56, 755 A.2d 583 (2000); <em>Murphy v. Implicito, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 256-257, 920 A.2d 678 (App.Div.2007); <em>Verna v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Links at Valleybrook Neighborhood Assoc., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 96, 852 A.2d 202 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Considering plaintiff\u2019s admissions with respect to his prior criminal convictions and the public records regarding his prior criminal involvement, plaintiff clearly qualifies as a limited-purpose public figure who must prove actual malice to recover in a defamation action. Even if he were not a limited-purpose public figure, he is still required to prove actual malice with respect to alleged defamatory statements relating to matters of legitimate public interest. <em>LoBiondo v. Schwartz, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 409, 733 A.2d 516 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>488, 744 A.2d 1211 (1999) (holding \u201cthe actual malice standard applies not only to those having the actual status of a public official or other public figure but also to those whose actions or interests have so involved them in a matter of public interest that for purposes of speech respecting that matter, they must be regarded as public figures.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Plaintiff alleged that defendants, particularly Kinney, operated with actual malice in publishing the newspaper articles about him. He maintains that the articles were intended to pressure and intimidate him to drop his lawsuit against Hornblum, a personal friend of Kinney. He has not presented clear and convincing evidence to support that claim, however. \u201c[T]he appropriate summary judgment question will be whether the evidence in the record could support a reasonable jury finding either that the plaintiff has shown actual malice by clear and convincing evidence or that the plaintiff has not.\u201d <em>Schiavone Constr. Co. v. Time, Inc., </em>847 F.2d 1069, 1089 (3d Cir.1988); <em>and see Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">After considering the record presented, we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence from which a jury could clearly and convincingly conclude that any of the defendants acted with actual malice. The Supreme Court has held that \u201csummary judgment is particularly appropriate for disposing of non-meritorious defamation suits.\u201d <em>Rocci, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>at 158, 755 A.2d 583; <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, </em>136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>N.J. </em>594, 605, 643 A.2d 1012 (1994); <em>and see Sedore v.

We are satisfied that the judgment of the trial court was adequately supported by the evidence and we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Irvin J. Snyder in his decision rendered on the record of October 20, 2006. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-12\"> Defendant Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., publishes the Philadelphia Inquirer and defendant Knight-Ridder, Inc., is its parent company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
