Because the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Preparing and Conducting Photo and Live Lineup Identification Procedures\u201d (the Guidelines)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were materially breached by the investigating officers\u2019 intrusion into an eyewitness\u2019s examination of a photographic array, we conclude that a presumption of impermissible suggestiveness must be imposed, and a new <em>Wade</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The jury heard testimony that in the early morning hours of January 1, 2003, Rodney Harper and James Womble were smoking crack cocaine at Womble\u2019s apartment on Kaighn Avenue in Camden. At approximately 2:45 a.m., there was a knock at the door, which Womble answered. At the door were two men, one of whom was co-defendant Gregory Clark, known in the neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>hood as \u201cBubbles.\u201d Womble later identified defendant as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">According to Womble, defendant pointed a gun at him, saying, \u201c[d]on\u2019t move, you\u2019re not involved.\u201d Clark, according to Womble, went into another room and began arguing with Harper about money. Womble heard Harper say, \u201cdo what you gotta do,\u201d following which Womble heard a gunshot. Womble testified that he entered the other room, where Harper sat bleeding from the chest; Clark was still present. Womble offered to get the money that Harper apparently owed to Clark, and pleaded with Clark not to shoot Harper again. Defendant and Clark departed, and, according to Womble, Clark said to him as he left: \u201c[d]on\u2019t rat me out, I know where you live.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Defendant was charged, along with co-defendant Clark,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with the first-degree murder of Harper on January 1, 2003, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3(a)(l) and (2), as well as: second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a); fourth-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(4); third-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(b); and second-degree being a person not entitled to possess a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Defendant moved to suppress a statement he gave to the police after he was arrested on January 17, 2003. Following a hearing, this motion was denied. The trial judge also conducted a <em>Wade </em>hearing and determined that evidence of Womble\u2019s out-of-court identification of defendant was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">At the conclusion of the trial, defendant was acquitted of murder and aggravated manslaughter, but convicted of second-degree reckless manslaughter and the other remaining charges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Following all appropriate mergers, the trial judge sentenced defendant to: a seven-year prison term, with an 85% period of parole ineligibility, pursuant to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, on the reckless manslaughter conviction; a four-year prison term on the unlawful possession of a weapon conviction to run consecutively to the term imposed on the manslaughter conviction; and a nine-month prison term on the persons not permitted to be in possession of a weapon conviction, to run concurrently with the other weapon conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Defendant appealed. In the brief filed by his appellate counsel, defendant raised the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING [DEFENDANT\u2019S] MOTION TO SUPPRESS HIS STATEMENT, BECAUSE HIS WAIVER OF HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT WAS NOT KNOWING AND INTELLIGENT DUE TO THE STATE\u2019S FAILURE TO INFORM HIM THAT A WARRANT FOR THE MURDER OF RODNEY HARPER HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST HIM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY NOT INSTRUCTING THE JURY, SUA SPONTE, WITH SELF-DEFENSE (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING [DEFENDANT\u2019S] MOTION TO SUPPRESS THE EYEWITNESS\u2019 IDENTIFICATION, BECAUSE THE PRE-TRIAL IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE WAS IMPERMISSIBLY SUGGESTIVE, WHICH CAUSED A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF IRREPARABLE MISIDENTIFICATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">IV. THE SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON [DEFENDANT] IS EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Defendant also filed a pro se brief in which he raised the following arguments, which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">V. DEFENDANT CONTENDS THE STATE VIOLATED HIS SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTfS] AND COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR BY DENYING HIM [THE] RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES AGAINST HIM ... WHICH CREATED [OR] RESULTED IN UNDUE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">VI.

DEFENDANT CONTENDS THAT THE STATE COMMITTED PROSECUTOR[IAL] MISCONDUCT BY POINTING AND CALLING [DEFENDANT] A LIAR IN [THE] PROSECUTOR[\u2019S] SUMMATION TO THE JURY IN WHICH THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ... TO [SUPPORT] THIS BASELESS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ACCUSATION VIOLATING DEFENDANTS EIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">VIII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING DEFENDANT ANY MITIGATING FACTORS THAT [WERE] SUPPORTED BY [THE] RECORD IN DETERMINING HIS SENTENCE ... WHICH WOULD HAVE [GIVEN HIM] A LOWER SENTENCE IN THE RANGE (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We find insufficient merit in the arguments contained in Points II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">For the reasons, to which we hereafter turn, we reject the argument contained in Point I. We do, however, agree with the thrust of Point III and, accordingly, will remand for further proceedings regarding Womble\u2019s out-of-court and in-court identifications of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">According to findings made by the trial judge at a hearing, upon being taken into custody, defendant was told by an officer that the police had a warrant for his arrest and that they were taking him to the homicide unit of the prosecutor\u2019s office. In response, defendant said, \u201cI know what it\u2019s all about. I\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen.\u201d Defendant thereafter waived his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights and gave the police a statement that was used against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Defendant argues that he did not knowingly waive his right to remain silent when interrogated because he was not specifically informed that a warrant for his arrest for the murder of Harper had been issued. He cites in support the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. A.G.D., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, 835 A.2d 291 (2003). There, the Court held that a basic requirement of an accused\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is the right to be informed that a criminal complaint or arrest warrant has issued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 835 A.2d 291. However, the facts of <em>A.G.D. </em>are quite different from the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>A.G.D., </em>an arrest warrant had issued but when the police approached the defendant he was not told that; he was only told that the police wanted to discuss with him certain allegations of sexual abuse. The defendant agreed to accompany the officers to the prosecutor\u2019s office, where he was informed of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Only after he made incriminating statements, did the police inform the defendant in <em>A.G.D. </em>about the arrest warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 835 A.2d 291. The Court held that the defendant had been \u201cdisadvantaged by a lack of critically important information,\u201d explaining that \u201c[w]ithout advising the suspect of his true status when he does not otherwise know it, the State cannot sustain its burden to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that the suspect has exercised an informed waiver of rights, regardless of other factors that might support his confession\u2019s admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 835 A.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Here, the police advised defendant that they had a warrant for his arrest and told him that he was being taken to the homicide unit. Although the police did not tell defendant that he had been arrested for the murder of Harper, defendant responded that he knew \u201cwhat it\u2019s all about.\u201d Accordingly, unlike what occurred in <em>A.G.D., </em>defendant was not disadvantaged. He knew he was being arrested and, thus, his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was fully informed. We decline the invitation to hold that the principles announced in <em>A.G.D. </em>extend to also informing an accused of the basis for the arrest warrant, particularly, as here, when defendant well-understood why he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Because the trial judge\u2019s findings at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing were fully supported by credible evidence and are entitled to our deference, <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999), and because those facts support the judge\u2019s determination that defendant was adequately informed of his status when he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that his incriminating statements should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">When Harper died on January 10, 2003, the investigation was turned over to Investigator Randy McNair and Detective Luis Ruiz. Their investigation led them to speak to Womble, who initially advised that he was inside the Kaighn Avenue apartment when he heard two gunshots outside. He stated that, after hearing the gunshots, he went outside to find Harper, who told him he had been shot by two unknown persons. He later claimed he gave this false version because he was concerned that his involvement could endanger his elderly father.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">According to testimony adduced at a <em>Wade </em>hearing, the next day the investigating officers re-interviewed Womble and confronted him with certain inconsistencies in his story. Womble became upset and said he would tell the truth. He advised that the man who shot Harper was known as \u201cBubbles,\u201d and he indicated where \u201cBubbles\u201d lived. A database search of this address generated a photograph of co-defendant Clark, who Womble positively identified as \u201cBubbles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Womble subsequently gave the police another statement, indicating that the shooting occurred in the Kaighn Avenue apartment, and that he retrieved from the floor a shell casing, which he later threw into the street. The police stopped the interview and had Womble show him where he had discarded the shell casing. Womble took the police to the intersection of Louis and Everett Street, approximately five blocks from the Kaighn Avenue apartment, where the shell casing was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Based on Womble\u2019s identification of Clark as the man who shot Harper, a warrant was issued for Clark\u2019s arrest. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Clark claimed that Harper had pointed a gun at him and that, in the ensuing struggle, Harper was shot with his own weapon. Upon further interrogation, Clark identified defendant as the other gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Investigator McNair then arranged for Womble to view a photographic array. In conformity with that part of the Attorney General\u2019s Guidelines that requires, whenever possible, that the photographic identification procedure be conducted by an officer other than the primary investigator, Officer Weber was called in to present to Womble an array of eight photographs. This array included a photograph of defendant. Womble immediately excluded five of the photographs. He more carefully examined the other three, but was only able to eliminate one, stating he was not 100% sure about the other two. Officer Weber left the room to report to the investigating officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In response to Womble\u2019s inability to select defendant\u2019s photograph from the array, Investigator McNair and Detective Ruiz entered the room and spoke with Womble. Officer Weber was not then present. McNair testified at the <em>Wade </em>hearing that he felt Womble was \u201cholding back from us,\u201d and so he and Ruiz \u201cwanted to go in and to clarify and be clear on what he was saying to us.\u201d He also testified that Womble was concerned about the safety of his elderly father because the second gunman was still at large. McNair testified that, in order to put Womble\u2019s mind at ease, he \u201ctold him to focus, to calm down, to relax and that any type of protection that [he] would need, any threats against [him] would be put to rest by the Police Department.\u201d Womble then responded that he could make an identification. With that, McNair and Ruiz left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Officer Weber re-entered the room and again showed Womble the array. This time, according to Weber, Womble \u201cslammed his hand down on the table and said, \u2018[t]hat\u2019s the mother fucker there,\u2019 \u201d thus positively identifying defendant as one of the men involved in the shooting of Harper.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">At the <em>Wade </em>hearing, Womble testified that the intervening discussion was much as described by McNair. However, he also testified that he \u201cfelt\u201d that a Spanish officer \u2014 who he identified at the hearing as Weber \u2014 was \u201cnudging\u201d him toward selecting defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>dant\u2019s photograph by the way he was moving the photographs around.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">After hearing this testimony, the trial judge concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate that the procedure was impermissibly suggestive or that the identification was unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The due process guarantees of our federal and state constitutions, at their very core, require a criminal justice system designed to generate reliable determinations. As a result, it has long been understood that due process concepts prohibit the use of identification evidence produced by events that are \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 384, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 971, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1247, 1253 (1968), because, ultimately, a conviction that rests \u201con a mistaken identification\u201d constitutes \u201ca gross miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>293, 297, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1967, 1970, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1199, 1204 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The \u201cvagaries of eyewitness identification,\u201d as explained by Justice Brennan in his opinion for the Court in <em>Wade, </em>are \u201cwell-known,\u201d and \u201cthe annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d 388 <em>U.S. </em>at 228, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1158. \u201cA major factor\u201d contributing to mistaken identification has been \u201cthe degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Our Supreme Court has followed a two-step analysis developed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In a series of cases dealing with showups, starting with the <em>United States v. Wade </em>and <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>decisions it rendered the same day in 1967, the Supreme Court crafted a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test as the means for guarding against potentially misleading identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>293, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, the Court considered the suggestiveness of a handcuffed defendant being brought to a hospital room to be viewed by a gravely-injured victim. The Court held that this process was not \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to deny the defendant due process of law, but was necessary because the only person who could exonerate the defendant was in the hospital, the hospital was not far from the jail, and no one knew how long the victim would live. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In 1972, the Court considered whether a showup different from that considered in <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>was unnecessarily suggestive and whether that fact alone warranted exclusion of identification evidence. In <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>188, 198-99, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>375, 382-83, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 411-12 (1972), the station house showup occurred seven months after the crime, unlike the exigent circumstances presented in <em>Stovall v. Denno. </em>The Court in <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>held that this lapse of time \u201cwould be a seriously negative factor in most cases,\u201d 409 <em>U.S. </em>at 201, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 383, 34 L.Ed.2d at 412, but that the test remained \u201cwhether under the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 the identification was reliable even though the confrontation procedure was suggestive,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 199, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 382, 34 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">And, in seeking to resolve the nagging uncertainty in the lower courts about the application of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test since <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>was decided, the Court emphasized in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>98, 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2243, 2253, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>140, 154 (1977), that \u201creliability is the linchpin.\u201d The Court held that the factors to be considered in ascertaining the reliability of an identification \u2014 \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation\u201d \u2014 had to be weighed against \u201cthe corrupting effect of the suggestive identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>itself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This remains the test required by the Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Our Supreme Court has repeatedly adhered to this two-step analysis, <em>see, e.g., State v. Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 902 A.2d 177; <em>State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988), although it has recently evinced a willingness to look further into its ability to preclude mistaken identifications. For example, in <em>State v. Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 500, 902 A.2d 177, the Court was asked to depart from the thirty-year-old rule in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite </em>and hold that the state constitution imposed more stringent limits on the use of identification evidence obtained from a non-exigent showup. The defendant in <em>State v. Herrera </em>urged that the Court confine \u201cthe use of showups to circumstances where they are absolutely necessary and are conducted in a fair manner.\u201d 187 N.J. at <em>500, </em>902 A.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In <em>State v. Herrera, </em>the victim was seated in his car waiting for traffic to pass when approached by a man on a bicycle who asked for money and then assaulted him. When the victim regained consciousness, his ear was gone. The defendant was apprehended, and the police brought the victim to a hospital emergency room where the defendant was present; he entered the emergency room, looked around, and identified the defendant, who was seated on a hospital bed six feet away. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 902 A.2d 177. The only other persons in the room were police officers and nurses. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant argued that \u201cthe fallibility of eyewitness identifications cannot be ignored and that current studies of post-conviction DNA exonerations show that a large majority of those wrongful convictions involved eyewitness error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 902 A.2d 177. In considering whether to adopt a standard that would bar the use of evidence of an out-of-court identification resulting from a non-exigent showup, the Court recognized that other states have deviated from the Supreme Court\u2019s federal jurisprudence regarding showup identifications. <em>Id. </em>at 500-01, 902 A.2d 177. The Court, however, observed that the defendant had failed to present this \u201cscientific evidence\u201d until the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>on appeal, <em>id. </em>at 501, 902 A.2d 177, and concluded that \u201c[u]ntil ... convinced that a different approach is required after a proper record has been made in the trial court,\u201d it would continue to adhere to the federal standard, <em>id. </em>at 504, 902 A.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>State v. Delgado, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>48, 902 A.2d 888 (2006) may portend a more expansive view of the state constitution than the approach adhered to in <em>State v. Herrera </em>the term before. In <em>State v. Delgado, </em>the Court considered the reliability of the results of a police lineup. In exercising its supervisory powers, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. VI, \u00a7 2, 13, the Court required \u201cas a condition to the admissibility of an out-of-court identification\u201d that law enforcement personnel \u201cmake a written record detailing the out-of-court identification procedure, including the place where the procedure was conducted, the dialogue between the witness and the interlocutor, and the results.\u201d <em>State v. Delgado, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 902 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although perhaps signaling a future alteration of the legal landscape,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. Herrera </em>and <em>State v. Delgado </em>hold that our courts remain obligated to apply the federal two-step analysis, which, as we have said, requires that the court first ascertain whether the identification procedure was \u201cimpermissibly suggestive,\u201d <em>State v. Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 902 A.2d 177, and, if so, \u201cwhether the objectionable procedure resulted in a \u2018very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 536 A.2d 254 (quoting <em>Simmons v. United States, supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>at 384, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 971, 19 L.Ed.2d at 1253). We conclude that the trial judge erroneously determined that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>based largely on the investigating officers\u2019 breach of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In 2001, the Attorney General developed and adopted the Guidelines in order to improve police procedures. The Attorney General recognized, in the Guidelines\u2019 preamble, that \u201ccase law and recent studies have called into question the accuracy of some eyewitness identifications.\u201d <em>Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 902 A.2d 177.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Section IA of the Guidelines requires that \u201cwhenever practical\u201d the person conducting the photographic identification procedure \u201cshould be someone other than the primary investigator assigned to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 902 A.2d 177. This particular provision results from the Attorney General\u2019s concern that an officer familiar with the facts of the investigation could inadvertently signal a \u201ccorrect\u201d response to the witness. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Officer Weber, who was not involved in the investigation, was brought in for the very purpose of avoiding the type of suggestiveness that could result from an investigating officer\u2019s involvement in the identification procedure. However, when the process conducted by Officer Weber failed to produce a positive identification, the investigating officers intruded and, following a brief discussion with Womble outside the presence of Officer Weber, Womble was suddenly able to emphatically select defendant\u2019s photograph from the array. Although the Guidelines do not expressly state that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>investigating officer may not intrude into the process, such conduct certainly violates the spirit of the Guidelines in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Because the Guidelines were breached \u2014 and in a material way \u2014 the disposition of this appeal turns on the remedy warranted by that improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u201cThe judicial branch has an overarching constitutional responsibility to guarantee the proper administration of justice, and particularly, the administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>39, 62-63, 459 A.2d 641 (1983). As a result, judges possess inherent power to guarantee the fairness of criminal proceedings. <em>State v. Maisonet, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>9, 23, 763 A.2d 1254 (2001); <em>State v. Abbati, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>418, 428, 493 A.2d 513 (1985). Case law suggests a variety of ways that a court may address missteps in pretrial investigative proceedings, including the granting of a dismissal of an indictment, the imposition of a presumption of impermissible suggestiveness, and the rendering of jury instructions detailing the improper police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Our decision in <em>State v. Peterkin, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 543 A.2d 466 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>295, 554 A.2d 850 (1988) is helpful in considering the broad range of potential remedies. There, a police officer\u2019s negligent misplacement of photographic arrays was followed by the officer\u2019s \u201cbrazen and lawless\u201d attempts to cover-up his negligent conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 543 A.2d 466. Because there was \u201cno evidence in the record suggestive of bad faith or connivance on the part of the police in failing to preserve the photographic arrays,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 42, 543 A.2d 466, just in the cover-up, we held that dismissal of the indictment was too draconian, <em>id. </em>at 38-39, 543 A.2d 466. Dismissal of an indictment should be ordered only on \u201cthe clearest and plainest ground,\u201d <em>State v. Weleck, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>355, 364, 91 A.2d 751 (1952) (internal quotes omitted), and not unless the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial has been \u201cirretrievably lost because of the police misconduct ...,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Peterkin, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39, 543 A.2d 466. However, in <em>Peterkin, </em>we also determined that the out-of-court identification could not \u201creasonably be constructed by testimony,\u201d and, therefore, upheld the trial judge\u2019s suppression of the photographic identification. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 543 A.2d 466. And, with regard to the State\u2019s utilization of an in-court identification of defendant by the same witness, we remanded for a hearing at which the State would be required to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the in-court identification was generated by sources independent of the defective out-of-court identification. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 543 A.2d 466. As to whether the negligent loss of the photographic arrays warranted a presumption that the process was \u201cimpermissibly suggestive,\u201d as held in cases such as <em>Branch v. Estelle, </em>631 <em>F.2d </em>1229, 1234 (5th Cir.1980) and <em>United States v. Sonderup, </em>639 F.2d 294, 298-99 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Sonderup v. United States, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>920, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>3059, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>426 (1981), we held that it was not necessary to adopt \u201can ironclad rule,\u201d <em>Peterkin, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 543 A.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">More recently, we considered a circumstance where the police could not locate the original photographic array but had retained a photocopy. <em>State v. King, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 358-61, 915 A.2d 587 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>394, 921 A.2d 448 (2007). We observed that the trial judge had applied the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, and, in examining the photocopy of the array found no basis for exclusion of either the out-of-court identification or in-court identification. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 915 A.2d 587. However, in <em>King, </em>we also examined the trial judge\u2019s jury charge and concluded that the defendant was entitled to more detailed instructions relating to \u201cthe contested facts relevant to the claim of suggestiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 915 A.2d 587. We relied upon <em>State v. Ledbetter, </em>275 <em>Conn. </em>534, 881 A.2d 290, 318 (Conn.2005), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Ledbetter v. Connecticut, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>1082, 126 S.Ct. 1798, 164 L.Ed.2d 537 (2006), where the witness was not told \u201cthat the perpetrator <em>may or may not </em>be present\u201d in the array, as required. The Connecticut Supreme Court held that the defendant was entitled to have the jury charged on that failure and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tendency to increase the probability of a misidentification. <em>Ibid. </em>In light of the misplaced photo array in <em>King, </em>we held that a charge similar to that described in <em>Ledbetter </em>was warranted. 390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 362-63, 915 A.2d 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">These cases suggest the types of remedies that may be imposed. However, we must also be mindful that these same cases dealt with the <em>negligent </em>loss of a photographic array. Here, unlike the facts in <em>Peterkin </em>and <em>King, </em>the police <em>purposefully </em>contravened the Guidelines; there has been no suggestion, nor could there be, that the police accidentally or negligently encountered Womble during his examination of the photographic array. The facts permit only one conclusion: the investigating officers consciously and deliberately intruded into the process for the purpose of assisting or influencing Womble\u2019s identification of defendant. As a result, we conclude that these circumstances must generate a presumption that the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any lesser remedy would eviscerate the Guidelines and encourage law enforcement officials to engage in the type of charade that occurred here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Consequently, we find that the trial judge\u2019s determination that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive cannot stand. We substitute for that finding a presumption that the procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and we remand for a determination of the second prong of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. As to this latter point, we recognize that the trial judge has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>held that the identification was reliable. However, the judge made that determination at the same time he declared that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. As held in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>evidence relating to the reliability of the identification must be weighed against \u201cthe corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d 432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 154. Because the trial judge did not find or appreciate the impermissible suggestiveness of the process, he never weighed that evidence against the corrupting nature of the process. Defendant is entitled to have the evidence reassessed through application of the proper framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Our holding that this particular breach of the Guidelines warrants a presumption of impermissible suggestiveness is informed by the fact that eyewitness testimony plays an influential role in many criminal prosecutions. This fact requires a deeper concern about suggestive procedures because, as our Supreme Court has observed, empirical studies now suggest that juries \u201ctend to place great weight on eyewitness identifications, often ignoring other exculpatory evidence,\u201d <em>State v. Cromedy, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>112, 121, 727 A.2d 457 (1999), and because the degree to which a witness expresses confidence in an identification tends also to be unduly valued by juries, <em>see Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 524, 902 A.2d 177 (Alb\u00edn, J., dissenting) (citing Elizabeth F. Loftus &amp; James M. Doyle, <em>Eyewitness Testimony: Civil and Criminal </em>141 (3d ed.1997), and 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 7.4(c) at 675 (2d ed.1999)); <em>see also </em>Jessica Lee, Note, <em>No Exigency, No Consent: Protecting Innocent Suspects From the Consequences of Non-Exigent Show-Ups, </em>36 <em>Colum. Hum. Rts. L.Rev. </em>755, 772-74 (2005). As recently summarized by our Supreme Court, \u201c[ejyewitness identification can be the most powerful evidence presented at trial, but it can be the most dangerous too,\u201d causing the Court to conclude that misidentification is now \u201cthe single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this country.\u201d <em>Delgado, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 902 A.2d 888. <em>See also </em>Timothy P. O\u2019Toole &amp; Giovanna Shay, <em>Mam\u00f3n v.

Brathwaite: The Supreme Court\u2019s Misunderstanding of Eyewitness Identification, </em>39 <em>J. Marshall L.Rev. </em>539 (2006). As a result, our courts are obligated to utilize great care in the application of the governing principles in order to prevent an accused from being convicted on the basis of unreliable eyewitness evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence regarding Womble\u2019s out-of-court identification was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Our holding has a number of consequences for the trial court\u2019s future disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">First, in remanding for a new <em>Wade </em>hearing, we feel it necessary to direct that the matter be assigned to a different judge. In fairness to the trial judge, we think it a difficult and uncomfortable task for him to now revisit and re-evaluate the evidence in light of the opinion he has already expressed about that evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Gomez, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 579, 775 A.2d 645 (App.Div.) (holding that, on remand, \u201cit is appropriate to have the case referred to a different trial judge who will be unfettered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>comments on the record [by the original trial judge] which could be interpreted as an advance evidential ruling on admissibility\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>86, 784 A.2d 719 (2001). <em>See also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Fam. Servs. v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 617, 512 A.2d 438 (1986); <em>In re Guardianship of R.G. &amp; F., </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>186, 195, 382 A.2d 654 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Second, we recognize that this change will require a new evidentiary hearing, and not simply the utilization of the record previously created. A mere reading of the transcripts of the relevant testimony will not allow the new judge the opportunity to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Any minor inconvenience to the witnesses and any added work for the trial court and the parties caused by our judgment is well worth the price of guaranteeing to defendant his right to a fair <em>Wade </em>hearing unfettered by previous mistaken findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Third, if the determinations made at the new <em>Wade </em>hearing require the exclusion of the out-of-court identification made by Womble, then the judge should also determine whether Womble is able to make an in-court identification of defendant from an independent source. <em>See Peterkin, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 45, 543 A.2d 466. The State bears the burden of demonstrating this by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Fourth, if the <em>Wade </em>or taint hearings require the suppression of evidence then defendant is entitled to a new trial, but not otherwise. <em>See State v. Herrera, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 500, 897 A.2d 1085 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
