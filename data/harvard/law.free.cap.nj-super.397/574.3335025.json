Despite Hardy\u2019s position that he was unaware of the status of the car, the motion judge granted summary judgment to Liberty Mutual on Hardy\u2019s claim, finding that policy provisions excluded coverage in the circumstances presented. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The record discloses that Hardy was severely injured on the afternoon of October 20, 2004, when a stolen Subaru Imprezza in which he was riding, driven by sixteen-year-old defendant, Hamza Abdul-Matin, was involved in a front-end collision with a Public Service Electric &amp; Gas (PSE &amp; G) Company truck at an intersection in East Orange. As the car burned, all vehicle occupants were pulled from the car by onlookers. Hardy suffered a number of injuries, including a broken leg, a displaced pelvis, fractured facial bones, and cuts and bruises, requiring a hospitalization of approximately one month. The front seat passenger, twenty-four-year-old Alquan Edwards, did not survive his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The driver, Abdul-Matin, although sustaining a compound fracture of the left femur and head lacerations, initially escaped from the scene with the assistance of friends, but later was apprehended when he sought medical assistance, claiming that he had been hit by a car while a pedestrian. Abdul-Matin ultimately pled guilty to one count of second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1), downgraded to a third-degree crime for purposes of sentencing, to one count of third-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(7), and to one count of third-degree receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>stolen property, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7. Hardy was not charged with any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Hardy claims little recollection of the circumstances of the accident. In a deposition conducted after Liberty had moved for summary judgment, Hardy admitted that his girlfriend was the sister of front-seat passenger Edwards, whom Hardy had known for approximately two years. He claimed less knowledge of Abdul-Matin, a friend of Edwards, seen by Hardy \u201caround my ways sometimes.\u201d Hardy denied knowledge of Abdul-Matin\u2019s address, age, family, or school.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hardy also denied knowledge that the vehicle in which he was riding was stolen, and he denied recollection of any of the circumstances of the accident, including its date, time and location. He also denied knowledge of where he had entered the car, and could not explain why he required a car to reach a luncheonette that was located within a block of his house. Hardy testified that he had never been in the car previously, and he had never seen either Abdul-Matin or Edwards in the car before. Hardy did not ask either person who was the owner of the car, and he denied knowledge that either had been arrested previously for stealing cars. Additionally, Hardy denied noticing whether Abdul-Matin had car keys, whether the ignition lock was intact, and whether any car windows were broken. The prosecutor\u2019s office investigatory report indicates that Abdul-Matin and front-seat passenger, Edwards, were known by a witness as car thieves, and that the car was estimated by the PSE &amp; G Company truck\u2019s driver to have been traveling at an excessive rate of speed of approximately eighty miles per hour when the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Liberty Mutual concedes that at the time of the accident, Hardy was insured as a family member under auto coverage issued by it to Hardy\u2019s grandmother, Vera Dowdell, with whom Hardy lived. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The PIP provisions of Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy exclude PIP coverage for any insured: \u201cOperating or \u2018occupying\u2019 an \u2018auto\u2019 without the permission of the: (1) Owner of the \u2018auto\u2019 or (2) Named insured under the policy insuring that \u2018auto.\u2019\u201d The exclusion mirrors the text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7, as it was amended by <em>L. </em>1983, c. 362, \u00a7 10. Read literally, neither requires evidence that the claimant knew or should have known the car to be stolen in order for the exclusion to be triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The policy also provides UM coverage under an insuring agreement that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">We will pay compensatory damages which an \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d ... because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">1. \u201cBodily injury\u201d sustained by an \u201cinsured\u201d and caused by an accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">The owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s liability for these damages must arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">An \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">a land motor vehicle ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">1. To which no liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">5|: ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">3. To which a liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident but the bonding or insuring company:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6_\">a.

Using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that \u2018insured\u2019 is entitled to do so.\u201d The UM exclusion thus contains a scienter element that is missing from the PIP exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">Claims for PIP and UM coverage were submitted to Liberty Mutual on Hardy\u2019s behalf. In a letter dated November 14, 2005, Liberty Mutual denied UM coverage on the ground that it was barred by its exclusion from coverage of persons using a vehicle without a reasonable belief of entitlement to do so. PIP coverage was also denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Suit to compel UM arbitration and PIP pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ments ensued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Shortly after suit was filed, Liberty Mutual moved for summary judgment. In granting that relief, the motion judge held that PIP benefits were barred by the policy\u2019s exclusion from recovery of \u201cany insured operating or occupying an auto without the permission of the owner of the auto,\u201d regardless of whether the claimant had knowledge that permission was lacking. The judge held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Art\">The policy\u2019s clear and unambiguous language provides that there is no coverage if the insured is occupying a vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission. There is no language in the policy that requires knowledge on the insured\u2019s part either that the vehicle was stolen or that the owner did not give permission to the insured to occupy it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">As written the policy clearly provides that PIP coverage will be excluded if the insured is occupying an auto without the owner\u2019s permission. In the present case, since the vehicle plaintiff occupied was stolen, there can be no dispute that he did not have the owner\u2019s permission to occupy it, and a reasonable jury could not find otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Although the judge recognized that, in <em>Hall v. Minder, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 689 A.2d 207 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1997), we had found such benefits to be available to innocent passengers pursuant to virtually identical language found in the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (UCJF) Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(c)(2), the judge found <em>Hall </em>to be inapplicable because it concerned the Fund, not a private insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Addressing Hardy\u2019s UM claim, the judge focused on the policy\u2019s coverage agreement, which provided that Liberty Mutual would pay compensatory damages \u201cwhich an insured is legally entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle\u201d and upon the policy\u2019s exclusion of damages incurred while \u201cusing a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the insured is entitled to do so.\u201d The judge held that coverage was unavailable under the insuring agreement because Hardy was not legally entitled to recover damages from the owner of the vehicle, and was likewise barred by the policy\u2019s exclusionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On appeal from the denial of PIP benefits, Hardy acknowledges that Liberty Mutual\u2019s coverage exclusion tracks <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2), which permits an insurer to exclude from benefits a person sustaining injuries who, at the time of the accident, \u201cwas occupying or operating an automobile without the permission of the owner.\u201d However, he argues that the Legislature did not intend that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2) apply to bar the claims of \u201cunwitting\u201d occupants of stolen cars. In support of this argument, Hardy notes that the Supreme Court held in <em>Lindstrom v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994), and we recognized in <em>Stevenson v. State Farm Indem. Co., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 709 A.2d 1359 (App.Div.1998), that \u201cbecause PIP coverage is considered \u2018a social necessity,\u2019 \u201d it should be given \u201cthe broadest application consistent with the statutory language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 709 A.2d 1359 (quoting <em>Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 649 A.2d 1272).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Concomitantly, Hardy contends that exclusions from coverage must be construed narrowly. <em>See Gambino v. Royal Globe Ins. Cos., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>100, 106-07, 429 A.2d 1039 (1981); <em>Walcott v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 393, 870 A.2d 691 (App.Div. 2005). As an example of the proper approach, Hardy cites our dictum in <em>Martin v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 787 A.2d 948 (App.Div.2002), a case in which we affirmed the denial of PIP and UM benefits to an unlicensed driver who \u201chad to know she was not entitled to drive\u201d a borrowed automobile, <em>id. </em>at 325, 787 A.2d 948, invoking a policy exclusion from coverage for persons \u201c[ujsing a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>person is entitled to do so\u201d and a further policy provision establishing a conclusive presumption that a person operating an insured vehicle without a valid license lacks a reasonable belief in such entitlement. <em>Id. </em>at 323, 787 A.2d 948. However, in reaching this conclusion, we noted that the issue presented was one limited solely to recovery by the culpable, injured driver. We observed that we were \u201cnot confronted with a claim for PIP coverage put forth by an unwitting, injured passenger,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 325, 787 A.2d 948, language that Hardy claims suggests a basis for a favorable result in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Additionally, Hardy relies on our decision in <em>Hall, </em>in which we construed a provision of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(c)(2), which requires an applicant for benefits to affirmatively establish in a summary hearing that he was not \u201coperating or riding in a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner,\u201d to permit a denial of PIP and UM benefits only when the occupant knew the ear\u2019s status. 298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247, 689 A.2d 207. There, in reversing determinations of the trial judge, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Obviously, every use without permission does not constitute theft. In the usual situation passengers assume that they are riding in a vehicle with the owner\u2019s consent. Although here the vehicle was stolen, in many cases the issue of use without the owner\u2019s permission may be indiscernible to the lay person. The Law Division\u2019s decisions preclude recovery to that entire class of innocent injured persons. We perceive that the public policy of providing benefits to those innocent persons is as strong as the public policy to provide insurance coverage to all who use a vehicle with the owner\u2019s permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Hardy claims that the PIP statute, like the UCJF statute, is remedial legislation and should similarly be construed to afford coverage in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">In contrast, Liberty Mutual argues that both the PIP statute and the policy exclusion based upon it should be read literally to preclude PIP coverage for Hardy\u2019s injuries. It asserts that the public policy of providing the broadest possible application of PIP coverage does not preclude the invocation of exclusionary provisions within the insurance contract that are consistent with statutory language. Because the undisputed facts demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Hardy did not have the ear owner\u2019s permission to occupy his vehicle, coverage was appropriately denied. We reject Liberty Mutual\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The permissible exclusion from PIP benefits that we must construe, set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2), was adopted in 1983 in connection with the passage of the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Freedom of Choice and Cost Containment Act of 1984. <em>L. </em>1983, c. 362, \u00a7 10. Although the Introductory Statement to the bill, Assembly No. 3981, provides that \u201cNo Fault and Related Clean-Up Provisions\u201d were \u201cmainly designed to tighten statutory eligibility requirements for personal injury protection coverage so as to comport with the original intent of the no-fault law,\u201d no specific mention is made of this new exclusion, what motivated its passage, or its intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, nothing in the manner in which the 1983 amendments are structured or in their relationship to the already existing exclusions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7a, permits an inference as to the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2). Although the exclusions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7a (covering injuries occurring while committing a high misdemeanor or felony or seeking to avoid lawful apprehension, or while acting with the specific intent of causing injury or damage) both require intent, the exclusion at issue does not appear in that section. It is placed in the succeeding section along with an unrelated exclusion for a person owning a car that was being operated without PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Further, the specific policy and statutory exclusion at issue here has not been construed in factual circumstances like those presented by Hardy that involve injury to a passenger who has alleged he was unaware that the car in which he was riding was stolen. In <em>Martin, </em>we construed language in a Rutgers Casualty Insurance Company policy excluding from PIP and UM coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>persons injured while using a vehicle without a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 of entitlement to be consistent with the exclusion in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2) for injuries sustained by a person \u201coccupying or operating an automobile without the permission of the owner or other named insured.\u201d 346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323-24, 787 A.2d 948. However, in <em>Martin, </em>the policy terms themselves, which included a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 requirement, served to narrow the scope of the statutory exclusion, and our dictum concerning the applicability of the exclusion to an \u201cunwitting, injured passenger,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 325, 787 A.2d 948, must be read in the light of the policy language at issue in that case. Neither the PIP provisions of the present policy nor the statute contains the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 language found in <em>Martin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Hall, </em>we construed the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(c) to require that a UCJF claimant demonstrate that he was not \u201cknowingly\u201d operating or riding in a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner. 298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247, 689 A.2d 207. Because the language of this aspect of the statutorily required proof for a claim against the UCJF is essentially the inverse of the exclusion permitted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2), an argument can be made that the latter statute should also be construed to require knowledge on the part of the injured claimant. However, as the motion judge noted, the UCJF is not a provider of private insurance, as is Liberty Mutual. Moreover, because the UCJF operates as an entity of last resort, affording a measure of financial relief for persons who would otherwise be remediless, <em>id. </em>at 246, 689 A.2d 207, an argument could be made for a more expansive construction of its coverage than that available pursuant to a private contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Nonetheless, we are persuaded that the exclusion permitted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2), and incorporated into the PIP provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy, properly should be construed as requiring knowledge or a reasonable basis for knowledge by the claimant that the vehicle in which he was riding was being operated without the owner\u2019s consent, whether as the result of theft, or for other reasons. As the Court noted in <em>Lindstrom, </em>a case in which payment of PIP benefits to a pedestrian injured in a random, drive-by shooting was mandated, despite a dispute as to the proper construction of pedestrian coverage for injuries \u201ccaused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile,\u201d: \u201cInsureds are entitled to coverage in accordance with their objectively-reasonable expectations that are supported by any fair interpretation of the law.\u201d 138 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 649 A.2d 1272 (citing, among others, <em>Werner Indus. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35, 548 A.2d 188 (1988)). The Court continued: \u201c\u2018Objectively reasonable\u2019 expectations \u2018may govern even in the absence of ambiguity, in recognition of the generally one-sided nature of insurance contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 649 A.2d 1272 (quoting <em>Clegg v. N.J. Auto. Full Underwriting Assoc. ex rel. Cigna Ins. Co., </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>634, 639, 604 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In our view, an exclusion from coverage of persons who did not know or have reason to know that they were riding a car that was being operated without the permission of the car\u2019s owner would be unrealistic and not objectively reasonable for the reasons, stated in <em>Hall, </em>that we previously quoted. In many circumstances, a person may reasonably assume that a car in which he or she is riding is being operated with the consent of the owner. A passenger cannot be expected to inquire, upon entry into a vehicle, as to the status of the car and driver, unless existing facts place the passenger on notice that the use of the car is questionable. An interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7b(2) and the policy language here that would exclude such an unknowing person from coverage, if injured, would unjustifiably narrow the coverage reasonably expected by an insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Moreover, we find the public policy considerations supporting an expansive interpretation of the PIP statute to be substantially similar to those supporting PIP recovery pursuant to the UCJF law, and thus no reasoned basis to distinguish our decision in <em>Hall </em>from our resolution of this matter. New Jersey\u2019s current Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35 requires that the Act, in general, \u201cbe liberally construed so as to effect the purposes thereof.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16. As the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lindstrom </em>reflects, this principle has been specifically employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>in a PIP context as the result of the recognition of PIP as a \u201csocial necessity.\u201d <em>Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 649 A.2d 1272; <em>see also Darel v. Pa. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Ins. Co., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>416, 425, 555 A.2d 570 (1989); <em>Amiano v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>85, 90, 424 A.2d 1179 (1981). The construction that Liberty Mutual espouses for its policy exclusion would unnecessarily undermine that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Because Hardy\u2019s knowledge of the status of the vehicle in which he was riding at the time of the accident raises contested issues of material fact, we reverse summary judgment on his PIP claim and remand the matter for trial of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Hardy additionally seeks reversal of summary judgment in Liberty Mutual\u2019s favor on his claim for UM coverage. We agree with Hardy\u2019s position that, because the car in which he was riding was stolen, coverage under otherwise applicable liability insurance could be disclaimed as the result of the non-permissive use of the vehicle, rendering the vehicle uninsured for purposes of the application of the UM statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1e(2)(a) and (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> R<em>utgers Cas. Ins. Co. v. Collins, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>542, 549, 730 A.2d 833 (1999); <em>Longo v. Mkt. Transition Facility, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 321, 741 A.2d 149 (App.Div.1999). Additionally, we agree with Hardy\u2019s argument that both the UM statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.l1, and Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy extend UM coverage to liability incurred as the result of the tortious conduct of an \u201coperator.\u201d Abdul-Matin was such an operator. Therefore, absent an applicable exclusion, benefits were payable to Hardy pursuant to the insuring agreement contained in Liberty Mutual\u2019s UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>However, the policy, like that in <em>Martin, </em>contains an exclusion from coverage for bodily injury sustained by an insured \u201c[u]sing a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the \u2018insured\u2019 is entitled to do so.\u201d Although \u201cusing\u201d is not defined, we regard the term as sufficiently broad to encompass Hardy\u2019s act of riding in the car. Indeed, we have previously construed the term in a far more expansive manner than is required in the present case. <em>See, e.g., Svenson v. Natn\u2019l Consumer Ins. Co., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 412-16, 731 <em>A.2d 91 </em>(App.Div.1999) (holding that a tow truck passenger\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of his car when that car was being carried on the flat bed truck). Further, we are aware of nothing that would suggest that the exclusion was invalidly included in the policy at issue. In that connection, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1d provides that: \u201cUninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.\u201d There is no suggestion here that such approval did not occur. Because the exclusion requires a finding as to Hardy\u2019s \u201creasonable belief\u201d that he was entitled to occupy the car, and because such a finding requires resolution of contested factual issues, we reverse summary judgment in Liberty Mutual\u2019s favor on this issue, as well, remanding the matter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> Liberty Mutual claims on appeal that an affidavit signed by Hardy\u2019s girlfriend contradicts his statements denying personal knowledge of Abdul-Matin. That affidavit is not a part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\"> The record on appeal does not contain Liberty Mutual's denial letter, and its basis is thus unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\"> Neither the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund nor its administrator, the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association, was made a party to the suit, and the record does not reflect whether a claim for PIP benefits or compensatory damages was submitted to it. However, it does not appear that Hardy is a \"qualified person\" entitled to recover under the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-62, which excludes a person who \"is an insured under a policy provision providing coverage for damages sustained by the insured as a result of the operation of an uninsured motor vehicle in a form authorized to be included in automobile liability policies of insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this State.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> Decisions discussing this amendment do not address this particular provision. <em>See Caviglia v.
