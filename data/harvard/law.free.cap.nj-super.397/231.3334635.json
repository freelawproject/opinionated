Following discovery, Cannici moved for summary judgment on the brothers\u2019 fraud claim, arguing that in depositions and answers to interrogatories, the brothers had stated unequivocally that no fraudulent acts had taken place. The motion judge construed the complaint to set forth a cause of action for tortious interference with an expected inheritance, perpetrated by way of fraud and, ruling in Cannici\u2019s favor, he determined that the brothers were unable to support their claims factually, and that Felix\u2019s self-serving assertions, contained in certifications opposing summary judgment, did not create a question of material fact sufficient to defeat Cannici\u2019s motion. The judge additionally found that the brothers\u2019 \u201ccause of action sounds in the nature of a challenge to the Will by reason of undue influence more properly and appropriately brought before a Probate Court consistent with the rules of court.\u201d The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On appeal, the brothers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> present the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">I. There Is Ample Evidence From Which A Fact Finder Can Conclude That There Has Been A Tortious Interference With An Expected Inheritance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">II. Summary Judgment Should Not Have Been Granted Because Of The Favorable Inferences To Be Drawn From The Evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>In response, Cannici argues that (1) the brothers failed to mount a challenge to the probate proceedings; (2) their challenge to the will by means of a tort action was untimely pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:85-1; (3) the absence of a challenge to the will precludes collateral attack; and (4) no evidence supports the brothers\u2019 claims of fraud, and therefore summary judgment was properly granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We understand from the record that Mary was born in 1943 and died on October 30, 2004. Her parents pre-deceased her, she never married, and she had no children. When she died, her brothers were her next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Mary was a long-time employee of the Internal Revenue Service. Although, at some point, she had acquired a home from a \u201cformer boyfriend,\u201d for fifty-six years Mary maintained a residence with her two brothers in the family home. According to Felix, he and Mary had a close and loving relationship for \u201cat least\u201d fifty-six out of her sixty-two years of life. Also according to Felix, Mary had stated on many occasions that she would leave him approximately twenty percent of her estate. However, the record suggests that, at some point prior to the execution of her will, Mary and her two brothers fiercely argued, and Mary, in Cannici\u2019s words, \u201cwas thrown out\u201d of the family home. Mary\u2019s will was executed on October 31, 2002, in anticipation of a trip to Italy by Mary, a long-time male friend, Cannici, and Canniei\u2019s family. The will did not name Felix as a beneficiary, and provided only a small bequest of $5,000 to Francisco, a brother that Cannici characterized as possessing \u201ca more submissive personality.\u201d A significant part of Mary\u2019s estate passed to Cannici, a woman of the same age as Mary who maintained a close friendship with her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>In August 2003, almost a year after her return from Europe, Mary was diagnosed as suffering from a malignant brain tumor and, although surgery was performed, the cancer had metastasized to her lungs and elsewhere, causing Mary\u2019s death in 2004. In April 2004, prior to her death but during her last illness, Mary gave written instructions to Cannici to transfer $7,000 to Felix and $5,000 to Francisco. Neither claims that she was incompetent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The present suit was instituted on October 11, 2005, approximately one year after Mary\u2019s will had been admitted to probate and letters testamentary had been issued. At that point, no caveats to the will had been filed, and some distributions had been made. Although the suit named Cannici only in her individual capacity, further distributions and payments from the estate were stayed pending resolution of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In Count I of the complaint, the brothers alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">5. It appears from the face of the Will, and the facts known by plaintiffs, that defendant, Lorraine Cannici, caused the decedent, Mary B. Garruto, to sign the Will as the result of fraud upon the said Mary B. Garruto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">6. It appears, on the face of the Will, that there is an unnatural disposition of the Estate of Mary B. Garruto, and that the plaintiffs have been denied a share of the Estate of their sister as the result of fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The allegations of the Second Count of the complaint, which also alleged fraud in very similar terms, are no more specific than those contained in the First Count.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">In support of the brothers\u2019 claims, Felix asserted, essentially, that because Mary lived with the brothers in the family home for fifty-six out of her sixty-two years and owed him both love and respect, he had a reasonable expectation of the twenty percent of Mary\u2019s estate that Mary had promised him, and that he would have received the bequest but for Cannici\u2019s fraud. However, when Felix was asked in a deposition given in the matter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> what was \u201cwrong\u201d with the will, he responded, variously, that he didn\u2019t believe that, in her mental state, Mary was capable of signing it; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that his absence from the disposition of property \u201cwasn\u2019t logical\u201d; and that that Mary \u201cwas not thinking straight when she made that Will.\u201d Yet, Felix acknowledged that he did not know Mary\u2019s mental condition at the time that the will was executed. When asked what was meant by the use of \u201cfraud\u201d in the complaint, Felix responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">A \"... what we are saying is that she was not mentally capable to prepare a Will, so that legal document is not legal. To me, that\u2019s fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Felix stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">A I\u2019m not accusing Lorraine or anyone else. I\u2019m saying my sister (Mary) was not capable. I want to make that clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The deposition continued with the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">Q ... You\u2019ve already said that Lorraine didn\u2019t commit a fraud as far as you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">Q And the complaint says that fraud appears on the face of the Will. Again, we touched upon this and it has nothing to do with Lorraine Cannici____It\u2019s just the mental problems that might have impacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">A Right, and she could have been easily influenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">\u00a1\u00a1s * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">Q ... You\u2019re not alleging a fraud against Lorraine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-17\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-19\">Q [After reading the bequests in the will] Is there any reason why these bequests are improper or wrong or illegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-20\">A I can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-21\">* sjt *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-22\">A I looked the Will over and I guess I disagreed with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-23\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-24\">A Because ... I was the brother and I was entitled to more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-25\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-26\">Q [Referring to the complaint] ... It says that the Will was signed because of fraudulent pressure; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-27\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-28\">Q It says that Lorraine Cannici caused the decedent ... to sign the Will because of fraud. What was that for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-29\">A I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Q And it also says, \u201con the face of the will, there is an unnatural disposition of the estate and the plaintiffs have been denied a share as the result of fraud.\u201d ... There was fraud committed by Lorraine Cannici. What was that fraud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">A I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Q Again, in the Second Count ... you state that there was fraud committed by Lorraine Cannici or that the actions of Lorraine were fraudulent causing damage to the plaintiffs. Do you know what that fraud was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">A No I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">Q Okay, the word \u201cfraud,\u201d what\u2019s the meaning of the word?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">A I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">In answers to interrogatories, Felix replied, \u201cunknown at this time,\u201d when asked whether Lorraine violated any standard and whether she committed an intentional tort. Again, Felix failed to specify any act of fraud on Lorraine\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">However, after Cannici\u2019s motion for summary judgment was filed, Felix submitted a certification that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">14. In my deposition, I was asked whether or not I believed the defendant committed fraud. In hindsight I can see that I was confused in answering this question especially since I was thinking in terms of her Tortious Interference with my expectation of receiving a benefit under my late sister\u2019s will. In [e]ffect, her Tortious Interference, I submit to the court, was in fact perpetrating a fraud on me and was an attempt to defraud me out of an inheritance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">In that certification, Felix additionally reiterated his expectation of a bequest of twenty percent of Mary\u2019s estate; described the love existing between siblings; claimed that Cannici interfered with his expectation, resulting in a will that was \u201cbizarre\u201d; alleged that Cannici\u2019s interference was motivated by her dislike for him and determination that he was \u201coverbearing\u201d; and stated that Cannici developed a confidential relationship with Mary and was instrumental in introducing her to the lawyer who drafted the will.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Felix also stated that, while weakened by her brain tumor and in deteriorating health (a claim that is not supported by medical or other evidence), Cannici exerted unspecified undue influence over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mary, through fraud, to draft the mil as she did, and that another member of the Cannici family had, at an unspecified time, falsely told Mary that Felix had been instrumental in eliminating Mary\u2019s inheritance from her mother \u2014 a statement whose falsity would have been evident to Mary, because she in fact had received approximately $24,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In opposing summary judgment and on appeal, Cannici contends that the brothers\u2019 action for tortious interference with an expectation of an inheritance, allegedly premised upon undue influence by means of fraud, is barred by the brothers\u2019 failure to file a timely challenge the will as required by <em>R. </em>4:85-1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">If a will has been probated by the Surrogate\u2019s Court or letters testamentary ... have been issued, any person aggrieved by that action may, upon the filing of a complaint setting forth the basis for the relief sought, obtain an order requiring the personal representative ... to show cause why the probate should not be set aside or modified or the grant of letters of appointment vacated, provided, however, the complaint is filed within four months after probate____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In argument before the motion judge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded to Cannici\u2019s position by stating that, because of the alleged difficulty Felix experienced in dealing with the \u201cdisrespect\u201d evidenced by his exclusion from Mary\u2019s will, he did not determine to challenge Mary\u2019s testamentary dispositions until the requisite time for filing that challenge to the probate proceeding had passed. Counsel also acknowledged his assistance, after summary judgment had been filed, in reinterpreting plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to suggest tortious interference with an expected inheritance by means of undue influence through acts of fraud, committed upon a weakened testator and accomplished through a confidential relationship, and in focusing the most favorable light upon Felix\u2019s prior denials of any factual basis for claims of fraud on the part of Cannici.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">When asked by the court to explain the difference between the undue influence alleged as a basis for plaintiffs\u2019 tort claim and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>undue influence that would support a caveat to a will, counsel stated that if he had been approached in a timely fashion, \u201ccertainly, I would have filed that caveat,\u201d and that prior to an unreported Chancery Division decision in <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Mechanic, </em>Civil Action No. BER-P-208-03, 2005 <em>WL </em>975763 (Ch.Div.2005), plaintiffs\u2019 claim would have been forfeited. However, counsel argued that <em>Mechanic\u2019s </em>recognition of an independent tort claim served to revive plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to challenge the will\u2019s testamentary dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>Mechanic, </em>the Chancery judge declined to grant summary judgment on a claim of tortious interference with an inheritance that was coupled with will challenges premised upon undue influence. He noted that the viability of the cause of action was \u201cfar more problematic\u201d than the other will challenges, but concluded that the cause of action had been recognized in <em>Casternovia v. Casternovia, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 197 A.2d 406 (App.Div.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In <em>Castemovia, </em>we considered a claim of tortious interference with a prospective inheritance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by means of undue influence, filed during the lifetime of the testator. We affirmed the order of summary judgment entered against plaintiffs in the Chancery Division, noting the recognition, elsewhere, of a cause of action for tortious interference with an expected gift or legacy under a will upon evidence of a \u201cstrong probability\u201d that the expectancy would have been fulfilled but for the wrongful interference, but the absence of any precedent permitting institution of a suit setting forth that cause of action prior to the death of the testator or intestate. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 197 A.2d 406. Determining that death or mental ineompetency constituted a condition precedent to such litigation, we concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 action was legally unsustainable, holding that \u201cif the donor is alive and competent, no such action as asserted here will lie.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Notably, we did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>specifically recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with a prospective bequest, and we did not consider the procedural issue raised in the present ease by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to challenge Mary\u2019s will in the probate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Addressing an issue that is novel in this State, we now determine that, although an independent cause of action for tortious interference with an expected inheritance may be recognized in other circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is barred when, as here, plaintiffs have failed to pursue their adequate remedy<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in probate proceedings of which they received timely notice. We are persuaded that to hold otherwise would \u201cplay havoc with traditional probate law,\u201d James A. Fassold, <em>Tortious Interference with Expectancy of Inheritance: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>New Tort, New Traps, </em>36 <em>Arizona Attorney </em>26, 30-31 (January 2000), without achieving any compensating advantage in the just and timely administration of estates. New Jersey\u2019s probate law recognizes the general authority of the Chancery Division, Probate Part, over \u201call controversies respecting wills, trusts and estates, and full authority over the accounts of fiduciaries, and also authority over all other matters and things as are submitted to its determination under [Title 3B],\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:2-2; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>3B:2-3 (jurisdiction of Superior Court over surrogate\u2019s proceedings), and specifically designates the manner in which challenges to a will shall be instituted. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>3B:2-4 (directing commencement by order to show cause). Probate procedures are further articulated in the New Jersey Court Rules, which enumerate in <em>It. </em>4:82 those matters in which the surrogate\u2019s court may not act, including those instances in which a caveat has been filed and provide, in <em>Rules </em>4:83 to 4:85, the methods of proceeding. By this means, challenges to a will based, as in this case, upon undue influence through fraud can proceed under established precedent setting forth the relevant factors for consideration, as well as the quantum and burdens of proof that pertain specifically to this subject area. <em>See, e.g., Haynes v. First Nat\u2019l State Bank of N.J., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>163, 432 A.2d 890 (1981); <em>In re Estate of Lehner, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>434, 360 A.2d 383 (1976); <em>In re Hopper, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>280, 88 A.2d 193 (1952); <em>In re Probate of Last Will of Catelli, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 825 A.2d 1209 (App.Div.2003); <em>Matter of Will of Liebl, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 617 A.2d 266 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>432, 627 A.2d 1138 (1993). To permit a collateral attack premised upon tortious interference with an expected inheritance would, in these circumstances, unnecessarily prolong the settlement of estates, introduce the possibility of inconsistent judgments, and require consideration of a body of law governed by standards different from those applicable in a probate context. <em>See Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 750-52, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). Moreover, to permit collateral attack on this basis would be inconsistent with established precedent precluding such an attack on a valid probate judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>recognizing the validity of a will. <em>See Pope v. Kingsley, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>168, 172-73, 191 A.2d 33 (1963) (precluding collateral attack on surrogate\u2019s judgment by Acting Director of Division of Taxation); <em>Ryno\u2019s Ex\u2019r v. Ryno\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>27 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>522, 524 (E. &amp; A. 1875) (recognizing principle that the acts of the surrogate cannot be impeached collaterally); <em>Gray v. Cholodenko, </em>34 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 194, 111 A.2d 918 (App.Div.1955) (when decree had been issued by Surrogate\u2019s Court, equitable jurisdiction will not be exercised by the Superior Court \u201cwhere the attack is against a judgment of a court of this State and an adequate remedy can be had in that court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are in accord with a multitude of courts that have held on various grounds that a claim for tortious interference with an anticipated inheritance is unavailable when an adequate probate remedy exists. <em>See generally, </em>George L.

For the reasons that we have previously stated, we decline to permit plaintiffs to avoid the carefully crafted procedures of the Probate Part rules by filing their duplicative tort action in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We are further satisfied, having viewed the evidence presented under the standards established by <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) and <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v.

While plaintiffs have alleged undue influence through fraud on Cannici\u2019s part, they have advanced no facts in support of those claims. Their reliance on the respect due Felix because of his status and on a prior, close sibling relationship, later distanced by anger, does not suffice in this regard, nor does plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the buzz words of probate practice \u2014 undue influence, diminished capacity, and confidential relationship \u2014 in the absence of an evidential foundation for their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Accordingly, the order of summary judgment entered against plaintiffs is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> At oral argument, it was confirmed that appellate counsel represents both brothers. However, the brief submitted on their behalf focuses solely on the relationship between plaintiff, Felix, and decedent, Mary. Proofs in the Law Division appear to have been similarly limited. For that reason, our discussion of the facts will be limited to Felix's view, which is all that has been presented to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> The will provided specific bequests of $1,000 to a niece, Maijorie Shaefer; $1,000 to a nephew Ralph Castellano; $5,000 to a sister, Theresa Castellano; $5,000 to brother Francisco Gamito; and $25,000 to a friend, Joseph DeFrank. Thirty percent of the remainder was bequeathed to Cannici; thirty percent to a niece, Virginia Bonora; fifteen percent to a niece, Janet Rose; fifteen percent to a niece, Marion Bergenfeld; and ten percent to a nephew, Michael Mastriani.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-12\"> The record contains only fragmentary excerpts from Felix's deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-15\"><em> </em>No factual basis for this claim appears in the record. Moreover, Cannici has testified in deposition, without contradiction, that she was unaware of the will until some time after Mary was hospitalized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> Although the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to assert the claim was pending at the time that summary judgment was granted, it was considered by the Chancery Division judge and discussed by us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\"> The tort is recognized in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 774B (1979), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">One who by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">It has been suggested that utilization of the tort remedy may be appropriate when a will contest will not accomplish the purposes of the challenger, such as when (1) an intended beneficiary is not related to the testator or named in a prior instrument; (2) there is no guarantee that the testator\u2019s intended disposition will take the contested will\u2019s place; (3) intestacy prevents an intended disposition; (4) the assets pass to a revocable trust or otherwise outside of the reach of the probate court; or (5) depletion has occurred through <em>inter vivos </em>transfers. <em>See </em>Diane J. Klein, <em>A Disappointed Yankee in Connecticut (or Nearby) Probate Court: Tortious Interference with Expectation of Inheritance </em>\u2014 A <em>Survey with Analysis of State Approaches in the First, Second, and Third Circuits, </em>66 <em>U.Pitt. L.Rev. </em>235, 238-39 (2004). <em>See also DeWitt v. Duce, </em>408 So.2d 216, 219 (Fla.1981) (discussing cases in which tort remedy was allowed because of inadequacy of relief in probate court). Although almost one-half of the states recognize the tort in some form, Klein, <em>supra, </em>66 <em>U.Pitt. L.Rev. </em>at 240 n. 10, the present appeal does not require our delineation of the circumstances, if any, in which the tort should be recognized in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\"> We decline to find the absence of the ability to obtain punitive damages (unsought in the present matter) to present sufficient grounds for allowing an otherwise duplicative tort action, choosing to compare the relief available in the probate court with what the plaintiff reasonably expected prior to the alleged interference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
