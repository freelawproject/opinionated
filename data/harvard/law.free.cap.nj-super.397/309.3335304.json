(PNI), appeals from the May 31, 2006, Final Decision of the Board of Review (Board) that confirmed the October 24, 2005, decision of the Appeal Tribunal, determining claimant Jerry Brooks eligible for unemployment benefits from May 29, 2005 to July 23, 2005. The issue presented on appeal is whether claimant was an independent contractor or an employee of PNI when claimant\u2019s contract as a home delivery newspaper person was terminated by PNI. Because we determine that PNI failed to prove that claimant was an independent contractor, as that exemption to employment is determined under the three prong standard of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21\u2014 19(i)(6)(A)(B)(C) (the ABC Test), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">PNI is the publisher of the Philadelphia Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. In July 2003, PNI engaged claimant\u2019s services to deliver the two newspapers to PNI\u2019s home delivery customers along a designated delivery route in southern New Jersey. When initially engaged by PNI, and for each year thereafter, claimant was required to execute an \u201cIndependent Home Delivery Service Contractor Agreement\u201d (Agreement), an eighteen-paragraph document prepared by PNI. The Agreement designated claimant as an \u201cIndependent Service Contractor\u201d re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>sponsible for delivering various publications of PNI, including The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News \u201cin good condition and on a timely basis to certain of its own delivery subscribers ... [and] to collect amounts owed to PNI by its subscribers and, on behalf of PNI, to solicit new subscriptions to The Inquirer and Daily News.....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Paragraph 1A of the Agreement designated claimant as \u201ca self-employed independent contractor and not an employee of PNI,\u201d who \u201cwas free to engage in any other business activities [claimant] desires (including services for other publications) so long as they do not interfere with the timely delivery of The Inquirer and the [periodicals and [claimant\u2019s] performance of the terms of this Agreement____\u201d Pursuant to that same paragraph, claimant had \u201cthe right to operate [his] business as [he] chooses and shall engage [his] own sub-contractors or employees as [he] considers necessary or desirable ... and [he] shall exercise the sole and exclusive management and or supervision of all such persons or entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Under Paragraph 1C, \u201c[claimant] agrees to maintain at [his] own expense, levels of automobile and general liability insurance, as required by applicable laws, covering all vehicles used in the operation of [his] business and all of [his] operations and premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">As to the deliveries, Paragraph 3 of the Agreement provided that \u201c[claimant] will be responsible for employing and/or contracting with sufficient personnel and providing the equipment necessary to accomplish the delivery services required hereunder.\u201d Although the Agreement provided that claimant was to \u201cuse [his] best efforts to deliver a dry and undamaged newspaper in a location convenient to the reasonable expectations of the subscriber\u201d no later than 6:00 A.M. on weekdays; 7:00 A.M. on Sundays; and 8:00 A.M. on Saturdays for the \u201cSunday Advanced Package,\u201d nothing prohibited claimant from delivering the newspapers earlier than the aforesaid times, except for the \u201cSunday Advanced Package,\u201d which was not to be delivered earlier than 12:01 A.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Saturday. Claimant was free to engage other individuals to assist in the delivery of the newspapers and use any method of transportation that he desired. The only supplies, other than the newspapers, provided by PNI were plastic bags to protect the newspapers from rain.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As to payment for services rendered, Paragraph 7 of the Agreement provided that claimant would not receive a salary, but rather a fixed fee for each newspaper or periodical delivered. In accordance with the Agreement, designating claimant as an independent contractor, Paragraph 1G provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">[Claimant] agrees that [he] shall be solely responsible for the payment of any federal, state, social security, or local income and self[-]employment taxes including, but not limited to, unemployment insurance taxes and workers\u2019 compensation contributions, with respect to the services provided under this Agreement. PNI will not treat [claimant] as an employee for any purpose, including federal tax purposes. PNI will not withhold any taxes or prepare W-2 Forms for [claimant] but will provide [claimant] with a Form 1099, if required by law. [Claimant] agrees that [he] will not receive, or be eligible for, any employee benefits of any type as a result of performing services under this Agreement. By [claimant\u2019s] signature below, [he] waives all rights, if any, to such benefits. The fees payable to [claimant] under this Agreement have been established on the basis that [he] is an independent contractor and is responsible for the payment of all taxes, payments or contributions described above, and as otherwise pertains to the conduct of [his] business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Paragraph 3E of the Agreement provided that claimant\u2019s fulfillment of his contractual obligations would be determined by the number of complaints received in relation to the number of publications delivered. More than two complaints per thousand for Sunday newspapers delivered, and one complaint per thousand for daily newspapers delivered constituted a material breach of the Agreement by claimant. Lastly, Paragraphs 12,13, and 14 of the Agreement prohibited either party from terminating the Agreement without providing thirty days\u2019 written notice to the other party, except in eases of a material breach of the Agreement as defined therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">On April 24, 2005, PNI, through its District Sales and Circulation Manager Ron Clemson, Jr., notified claimant that he was in a material breach of the Agreement for failure to ensure on-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>delivery. The notice placed claimant on a thirty-day probationary period to improve his delivery performance. At the end of that period, Clemson would \u201cthoroughly examine [his] progress, or decline, and reach a determination in regards to [his] future with The Philadelphia Inquirer.\u201d Because Clemson determined that claimant\u2019s failure in delivering the newspapers timely had continued, PNI terminated the Agreement, effective May 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Claimant filed for unemployment benefits on June 24, 2005. A Deputy Director found him eligible for benefits from June 2, 2005. PNI appealed, and the Appeal Tribunal conducted a hearing on July 26, 2005. On July 27, 2005, the Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Deputy\u2019s decision, determining claimant eligible for benefits without disqualification from May 29, 2005. On August 4, 2005, PNI appealed the decision to the Board. On October 7, 2005, the Board remanded the matter for additional testimony \u201cfrom the claimant and the employer regarding whether claimant was employed as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(6) and whether the claimant\u2019s discharge was for misconduct connected with the work.\u201d On October 20, 2005, the Appeal Tribunal conducted a second hearing in accordance with the Board\u2019s remand. On October 24, 2005, the Appeal Tribunal again determined that claimant was an employee of PNI under the three-prong standard of the ABC Test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">In this case, substantial evidence indicates the claimant was under the direction and control of the above employer. The employer\u2019s contention that the claimant was an independent contractor because he deducted his fuel costs and some other expenses on his income tax return is rejected by this Tribunal. The fact that claimant was paid on a 1099 form does not mean he was an independent contractor in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-190(6). The claimant was <em>not </em>engaged in an independently established trade and was in subject employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">PNI again appealed to the Board. On May 31, 2006, the Board issued its final decision affirming the Appeal Tribunal\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Three witnesses testified before the Appeal Tribunal: claimant, Clemson, and Peter Pfiuger, PNI\u2019s Circulation Director of Home Delivery Sales. Claimant testified as follows. Prior to May 29, 2005, claimant had been employed as a contract home delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>newspaper person by PNI. Although employed by PNI to deliver the Philadelphia Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer to approximately 340 of PNI home delivery customers, claimant also delivered copies of the USA Today and The Wall Street Journal newspapers. All four newspapers were supplied to claimant by PNI, and claimant was paid by PNI for delivery of all the newspapers. Claimant confirmed that he was not mandated by PNI concerning what time he had to pick up and bag the newspapers, as long as the newspapers were delivered to the customers by the time specified in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Claimant acknowledged that in lieu of a Federal W-2 Tax Form, he had received a Federal 1099-Tax Form, which he filed with his individual tax returns, stating that he was an independent contractor. When filing his tax returns, claimant claimed automobile expense deductions for using his automobile when delivering the newspapers. While delivering newspapers for PNI, claimant never advertised himself as a newspaper delivery person, nor carried or distributed business cards indicating his employment. Claimant never previously delivered any newspapers before commencing work with PNI; and after termination, he has not delivered newspapers for any other publishers. Concerning the delivery of the newspapers, claimant acknowledged that he was free to deliver the newspapers along the route as he deemed appropriate, not in any particular sequence directed by PNI. Lastly, after receiving the warning letter of April 24, 2005, claimant was terminated by Clemson because PNI had received \u201c[t]oo many customer complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Clemson testified that claimant was an independent contractor for PNI who delivered newspapers published by PNI, as well as The Wall Street Journal and USA Today, to PNI\u2019s home delivery customers pursuant to the Agreement. The papers had to be delivered by 6:30 A.M. on weekdays, Monday through Friday, and by 7:00 A.M. on Saturday and Sunday. Claimant was free to pick up the newspapers from PNI\u2019s distribution center at any time, provided that pickup did not occur earlier than 1:00 A.M. and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the newspapers were delivered timely. Claimant was neither reimbursed by PNI for expenses relating to his automobile, nor provided with any health insurance. Clemson terminated claimant\u2019s employment on May 29, 2005, after claimant failed to respond to the warning letter that he had delivered to claimant on April 24, 2005, concerning complaints that PNI had received from its customers. Claimant was not subject to a dress code and was paid in accordance with the Agreement on a per delivery basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Peter Pfluger testified that he had no personal knowledge why claimant had been terminated. Pfluger identified the Agreement as one that was executed by all of PNI\u2019s home delivery newspaper persons, including claimant. PNI does not keep track of each home delivery person\u2019s time, nor does it direct the method by which each home delivery newspaper person accomplishes the work. Pfluger confirmed that claimant was not provided with a Federal W-2 tax form, but only a Federal 1099 tax form, and no deductions were made from his compensation for unemployment or withholding taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">On appeal, PNI argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>POINT ONE.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">THIS COURT SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT THE BOARD OF REVIEW ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE APPEAL TRIBUNAL SINCE BROOKS IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHO IS NOT ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">\n<em>POINT TWO.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">THIS COURT SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT BROOKS IS ESTOPPED FROM CLAIMING THAT HE IS AN EMPLOYEE RATHER THAN AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">\n<em>POINT THREE.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">THIS COURT SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT THE BOARD OF REVIEW\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT BROOKS IS ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION WAS UNREASONABLE AND WAS UNSUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD BELOW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\"> Appellate courts have a limited role in reviewing decisions of an administrative agency. <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963); <em>State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark v. Gaines, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 331, 707 A.2d 165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>381, 718 A.2d 1210 (1998). There should not be an independent assessment of the evidence by the appellate court. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 (1999). The appellate court must accord a strong presumption of reasonableness to the decision of an administrative agency. <em>Smith v. Ricci, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>514, 525, 446 A.2d 501 (1982); <em>City of Newark v. Natural Res. Council, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 539, 414 A.2d 1304, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>245 (1980). Thus, the determinations of the administrative agencies must be given great deference. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 159, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). We cannot overturn an agency\u2019s decision that is based on sufficient evidence, even if this court would have reached a different result. <em>Outland v. Bd. of Trs., </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 400, 741 A.2d 612 (App.Div.1999). Therefore, if, in reviewing an agency decision, an appellate court finds sufficient, credible evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s conclusions, that court must uphold those findings even if the court believes that it would have reached a different result. <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int'l, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 588, 538 A.2d 794 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Conversely, a reviewing court is not bound to uphold an agency determination unsupported by sufficient evidence. <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980). Courts are not to act simply as a rubber-stamp of an agency\u2019s decision where it is not supported by substantial, credible evidence in the record as a whole or found to be arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Ibid.; <em>Marro v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 346, 154 A.2d 733 (App.Div.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law (UCL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-1 to -71 is a remedial act, the \u201cprimary objective of [which] ... is to provide a cushion for the workers of New Jersey \u2018against the shocks and rigors\u2019 of unemployment.\u201d <em>Carpet Remnant Warehouse v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>567, 581, 593 A.2d 1177 (1991) (quoting <em>Provident Inst. for Sav. in Jersey City v. Div. of Employment Sec., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>585, 590, 161 A.2d 497 (1960)). At the center of the UCL is the employer-employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>relationship. \u201cBecause the statute is remedial, its provisions [are to be] construed liberally, permitting a statutory employer-employee relationship to be found even though that relationship may not satisfy common-law principles.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The UCL defines \u201cemployment\u201d as \u201cservice ... performed for remuneration under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(l)(A). \u201cRemuneration\u201d is defined under the UCL as \u201call compensation for personal services, including commissions and bonuses and the cash value of all compensation in any medium other than cash.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(p). Under the UCL, there are twenty-six specific exclusions from the definition of employment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(7). Once the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (Department) determines that the relationship between the claimant and the party to whom he or she rendered services is that of an employer-employee, and is not \u201cstatutorily excluded,\u201d then the party who received the services and is challenging the Department\u2019s classification must establish the existence of the three criteria of the ABC Test. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(6). Simply stated, a presumption is created by statute that all services performed by an individual for remuneration constitutes employment for purposes of the UCL unless the services are statutorily excluded, N.J.S.A. 43:21 \u2014 19(i)(7), or the party that was determined to have acted as an employer proves that the services satisfied the ABC Test. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(6). The ABC Test provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Services performed by an individual for remuneration shall be deemed to be employment subject to this chapter ([N.J.S.A. 43:21-1 to -71]) unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the division that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">(A) Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such service, both under his contract of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">(B) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">(C) Such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(6)(A)(B)(C).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The three prongs of the ABC Test are commonly referred to as the \u201ccontrol test,\u201d the \u201ceourse-of-business or location-of-work test,\u201d and the \u201cindependent-business test,\u201d respectively. A party challenging a Department\u2019s classification must prove each of the three prongs of the ABC Test. <em>Carpet Remnant, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 581, 593 A.2d 1177. \u201cThe failure to satisfy any one of the three criteria results in an \u2018employment\u2019 classification. That determination is fact-sensitive, requiring an evaluation in each case of the substance, not the form, of the relationship.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the Board, after determining that none of the statutory employment exemptions were applicable, concluded that PNI failed to prove Prongs (A) and (C) of the ABC Test. PNI argues that the credible evidence in the record establishes otherwise. Although we are satisfied that PNI proved Prong (A) or \u201cthe control test\u201d provision of the statute, we agree with the Board\u2019s decision that PNI failed to prove Prong (C) or the \u201cindependent-business test\u201d provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In challenging the Board\u2019s determination that it failed to prove Prong (A), PNI argues that claimant \u201cwas free to engage anyone he wished to assist him with his newspaper delivery business or to substitute the services of another for his own at a payment he alone deemed appropriate.\u201d PNI contends that claimant \u201ccould agree to perform services for his customers other than the delivery of newspapers and to charge separately for his services.\u201d PNI asserts that claimant \u201ccould deliver other newspapers or periodicals to customers, including those of PNI\u2019s <em>direct competitors.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">' The Board counters that PNI failed to prove the \u201ccontrol test\u201d under the statute. The Board argues that the record contains indicia of PNI\u2019s control over the claimant\u2019s work performance, contending that claimant was: 1) \u201cassigned a territory in southern New Jersey\u201d by PNI; 2) \u201crequired to pick up his newspapers at a [certain] distribution center\u201d; 3) \u201cgiven a specific requirement where the customer wished to have the newspaper delivered\u201d on his or her property; 4) \u201cto deliver the newspapers in a \u2018dry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>timely fashion\u2019 5) \u201cprovided materials and received instructions on how to deliver the newspapers\u201d; 6) \u201cgiven plastic bags, in which he was to place the newspapers to prevent them from being soiled or damaged by rain or moisture\u201d; and 7) \u201csubject to a monthly report card issued by PNI[,] which rated his performance, primarily as it concerned customer complaints.\u201d As to this last factor, the Board asserts that under the Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[Claimant] could generate no more than two complaints per 1,000 copies of the Sunday paper and no more than one complaint per 1,000 copies of the daily paper. Any complaints were resolved \u201csolely in the best judgment\u201d of PNI. Where a subscriber complained to PNI that he or she did not receive a timely, dry[,] readable and/or complete newspaper and where PNI determined that [claimant] had to deliver a substitute copy, he would be charged $2.00 per paper. The record demonstrates that [claimant] had exceeded the number of allowable service complaint violations for much of the time that he was employed by PNI, which resulted in his being placed on probation for thirty days, and ultimately terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Under Prong (A), the party challenging the employment relationship must show \u201cthat the provider of the services \u2018has been and will continue to be free of control or direction over the performance of such services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carpet Remnant, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 582, 593 A.2d 1177 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(6)(A)). To meet that prong, the person challenging the employer-employee relationship \u201cmust establish not only that the employer has not exercised control in fact, but also that the employer has not reserved the right to control the individual\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Some factors \u201cindicative of control\u201d may include, but are not limited to, \u201cwhether the worker is required to work any set hours or jobs, whether the enterprise has the right to control the details and the means by which the services are performed, and whether the services must be rendered personally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 593 A.2d 1177. We are satisfied that PNI proved Prong (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We acknowledge that the issue of whether PNI proved Prong (A) should not be determined under the Agreement alone, but rather on all facts surrounding claimant\u2019s relationship with PNI, including the Agreement. To consider only the Agreement, and not the totality of the facts surrounding the parties\u2019 relationship, would be to place form over substance. <em>Electrolux Corp. v. Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Review, </em>129 <em>N.J.L. </em>154, 155, 28 A.2d 207 (E. &amp; A.1942). Here, the Agreement and the testimony presented to the Appeal Tribunal did not establish that PNI had exercised the necessary degree of control over the manner in which claimant performed his work, justifying the Board\u2019s determination that PNI failed to prove Prong (A). Pursuant to the Agreement and the testimony presented to the Appeal Tribunal, claimant was required to deliver the newspapers on time and in a good and readable condition. However, claimant was permitted to perform the work by any means that he sought fit and in any sequence that he chose. He was not provided continuous training by PNI, and he was permitted to engage anyone he desired to assist him in his newspaper delivery service, provided he paid the third party. He was free to deliver newspapers or other periodicals of PNI\u2019s competitors, provided that such other deliveries did not interfere with him completing the delivery of PNI\u2019s newspapers or periodicals as referenced in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Moreover, we conclude that the fact proffered by the Board, concerning PNI\u2019s right to determine a material breach of the Agreement based on the number of complaints it receives from its customers, is not evidence that claimant was subject to PNI\u2019s direction, control, and supervision as to the manner in which the work was to be performed, but only evidence of PNI\u2019s method of assuring that claimant performed the work that he had agreed to perform under the Agreement, that is, \u201cuse [his] best efforts to deliver a dry and undamaged newspaper in a location convenient to the reasonable expectations of the subscriber\u201d between certain hours of the day. <em>See Athol Daily News v. Bd. of Review, </em>439 <em>Mass. </em>171, 786 N.E.2d 365, 370-71 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Prong (C) or the \u201cIndependent-Business Test\u201d provision of the statute requires that the party challenging the employer-employee relationship prove that \u201c[s]uch [claimant] is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(6)(C). PNI argues that claimant \u201cmaintained an independent business as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>[Prong (C) ] of the test\u201d because claimant \u201cwas free to contract with other newspapers to perform delivery services both during the term of his contract with PNI and afterwards.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Prong (C) of the statute has been construed to mean that the \u201ctrade, occupation, profession or business\u201d of the claimant \u201cwas established independently of the employer or the rendering of the personal service forming the basis of the claim.\u201d <em>Gilchrist v. Div. of Empl. Sec., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 158,137 A.2d 29 (App.Div.1957). \u201c[T]he employee must be engaged in such independently established activity at the time of rendering the service involved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The requirement that the claimant be customarily engaged in an independently-established trade, occupation, profession or business \u201c \u2018calls for an enterprise that exists and can continue to exist independently of and apart from the particular service relationship. The enterprise must be one that is stable and lasting \u2014 one that will survive the termination of a relationship.\u2019\u201d <em>Carpet Remnant, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 593 A.2d 1177 (quoting <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 158, 137 A.2d 29). If the claimant is \u201cdependent on the employer, and on termination of that relationship would join the ranks of the unemployed, the [Prong (C)] standard is not satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585-86, 593 A.2d 1177. Stated another way, Prong (C) has been proven \u201cwhen a person has a business, trade, occupation, or profession that will clearly continue despite termination of the challenged relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 593 A.2d 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In applying the above principles, we conclude that the record is devoid of evidence demonstrating that claimant was customarily engaged in an independently established trade or activity from the mere delivery of PNI\u2019s newspapers \u201cat the time of rendering the service involved.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 158, 137 A.2d 29. Claimant never engaged in delivery services prior to commencing his delivery of newspapers for PNI, nor has he engaged in similar services since his termination from employment. Moreover, on termination from employment, claimant joined the ranks of the unemployed. Accordingly, Prong (C) was not satisfied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Carpet Remnant, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 585-86, 593 A.2d 1177. To the extent not addressed here, PNI\u2019s remaining arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> In support of its position that claimant was an independent contractor, not an employee, PNI included in its supplemental appendix a copy of a three-page document entitled: \"GUIDELINES FOR AUDITS OF NEWSPAPER DELIVERERS.\" The Guidelines did not contain a source reference. On inquiry by the Appellate Division Clerk's Office, we were advised that the Guidelines were prepared by the Department following dialogue with the New Jersey Press Association, for the purpose of providing informal guidance in the application of the ABC Test to home delivery newspaper persons. The Guidelines were never formally adopted by rule and are not codified in the New Jersey Administrative Code. Moreover, the preamble to the Guidelines states in relevant part that the Department \"remains steadfast ... that an independent contractor must satisfy the three conditions of the ABC Test. Independent contractor status is extended to those individuals who are truly established as an independent trade, profession, or business. When appearance suggests independence, but fact and substance indicates otherwise, fact will prevail.\u201d Because the Guidelines only represent a form of informal guidance to the newspaper industry, we determine the Guidelines not binding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
