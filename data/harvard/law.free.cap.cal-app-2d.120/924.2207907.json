Perry a promissory note for the sum of $1,000. This note was secured by a deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">On January 30, 1948, appellants satisfied the Perry note with money borrowed from respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">As evidence of this loan appellants gave to respondents their promissory note for $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>This note was secured by a mortgage on certain real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">This note was reduced to the sum of $500 by October, 1949, at which time the property described in the mortgage was conveyed to H. D. Downer.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">In the meantime, on April 12, 1949, respondents loaned appellants an additional $640; and took from appellants a note for $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">When appellants, on October 6, 1949, sold the real property to H. D. Downer the consideration therefor was the assumption by the purchasers of appellants\u2019 indebtedness to respondents, i.e.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">1. Unpaid balance on note of June 30, 1948, secured by mortgage on the property conveyed...............................$ 500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-12\">2. Unpaid balance on note of April 12, 1949____ 1,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-13\">A total of...................................$1,500.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">Downer not only assumed this indebtedness but agreed with respondents to pay it; and executed and delivered to respondents his promissory note therefor, plus an additional $300, borrowed by him from respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">This note for $1,800 was secured by a deed of trust on the same real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Appellants demanded the return of the notes executed by them; but the note of April 12, 1949, was not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">Respondents brought suit against appellants on the April 12, 1949, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">Appellants pleaded two defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-19\">1. That the note was usurious and void;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-20\">2. Extinction and discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">Since the obligation on this note of April 12, 1949, has been extinguished by the substitution of the new obligation therefor we need not pass upon the first defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">Findlay, J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
