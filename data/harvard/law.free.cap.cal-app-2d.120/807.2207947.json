It does not prohibit him when sued from setting up as a defense any sums which may be equitably due him from the plaintiff upon such illegal contract. Such a contract is not <em>malum in se </em>but merely <em>malum prohibitum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The applicable rule is thus stated in 12 American Jurisprudence (1938), Contracts, section 158, page 654, as follows: \u201cContracts made in violation of statutes, if not malum in se, are sometimes held valid, and generally so, notwithstanding the infraction of law, whenever it becomes necessary to save from injury persons for whose protection the violated statutes were enacted or whenever the public interests require that such contracts shall be enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">It is clear that equity and justice require that plaintiff be charged for the benefits which he has received from defendant and defendant be credited with the value of services and materials which he has furnished to plaintiff. There is no question of public interest or public policy involved in the instant ease. It is purely a matter of balancing the rights and equities between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Second: <em>Did the trial court err in denying plai/ntiff\u2019s motion to strike defendant\u2019s exhibits and testimony concerning the building contract between the parties, for the reason that the same was new matter and not admissible under defendant\u2019s general denial of the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\"><em>No. </em> It is not necessary to plead payment specifically in an answer. Evidence of payment may be shown under a general denial of the allegations of the complaint. <em>(Snodgrass </em>v. <em>Snodgrass, </em>81 Cal.App. 360, 363 [2] [235 P. 755].) In the instant case defendant generally denied in his answer the essential allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Therefore the foregoing rule is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Third: <em>Did the trial court commit prejudicial error in permitting defendant during the trial to amend his answer to conform to the proof by alleging that plaintiff had been paid any sums due him?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>No, </em>for two reasons: (1) As set forth in answer to question Second, <em>supra, </em>such evidence was admissible without any pleading, therefore plaintiff was not prejudiced by the amendment and any error in it must be disregarded by the court under the provisions of article VI, section 4% of the Constitution of the State of California;  (2) The rule is settled that amendments to pleadings rest in the sound discretion of the trial court whose ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>(Fetterley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>210 Cal. 282, 283 [3] [291 P. 411].) In the instant case there is no showing that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Moore, P. J., and Pox, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
