On the contrary defendant\u2019s attorney on the motion for a new trial conceded \u201cthe overwhelming evidence that the people\u201d had produced of defendant\u2019s guilt.  However, defendant argues on this appeal that certain of the evidence was conflicting and should have been disbelieved by the trier of fact. This, of course, cannot avail defendant in view of the well established rule in California that if there is any substantial evidence to sustain the findings of the trier of fact, an appellate court will not interfere with such findings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Since no other points are stated or argued, this court will presume that the rulings of the trial judge were correct and that the proceedings were regular and free from error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vivian, </em>50 Cal.App.2d 533, 537 [5] [123 P.2d 613] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 126, 128 [2] [70 P.2d 706] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cebulla, </em>127 Cal. 314, 318.
