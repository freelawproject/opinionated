Defendant merely argues the credibility of the evidence which was, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>course, a question for the trier of fact. He does not attempt to point out any other error in the proceedings before the trial court.  Therefore this rule is applicable: In the absence of a showing in the record to the contrary an appellate court will indulge all reasonable presumptions in favor of the judgment and rulings of the trial court, and will presume that the proceedings were regular and free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In order to overcome such presumption the burden is upon the appellant (defendant) to show affirmatively by the record that prejudicial error occurred, which error must be pointed out in the briefs of the complaining party. Otherwise any alleged error will be disregarded by this court.
