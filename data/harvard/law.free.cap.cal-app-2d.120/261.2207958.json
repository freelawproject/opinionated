Petitioners thereupon petitioned for an alternative writ of mandamus and for damages, to which petition the board demurred. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend, from which order (judgment of dismissal) petitioners appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The board\u2019s refusal to act on appellants\u2019 application, renewed several times, was based, as respondents state, \u201con its interpretation of section 38f of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, which interpretation did not allow the issuance of any new off-sale general licenses in Los Angeles County on the basis of a population increase, as the total number of off-sale licenses, including off-sale beer and wine licenses, was in excess of the number allowable for the population of Los Angeles County, (one per 1,000 persons in a county).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Section 38f reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201cIt is hereby determined that the public welfare and morals require that there be a limitation on the number of premises licensed for the sale of distilled spirits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">\u201cThe number of premises for which an on-sale general license is issued shall be limited to one of such premises for each 1,000, or fraction thereof, inhabitants of the county for which the premises are situated, provided that no additional on-sale general licenses, other than a renewal or transfer or as permitted hereinafter in this section, shall be issued in any county where the number of all premises for which on-sale licenses, other than on-sale beer licenses, are issued shall be more than one of such premises for each 1,000, or fraction thereof, inhabitants of such county, and provided further that no on-sale general license shall be issued in lieu of or upon the cancellation or surrender of an on-sale beer and wine license. The number of premises for which an off-sale general license is issued shall be limited to one of such premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>for each 1,000, or fraction thereof, inhabitants of the county in which the premises are situated, provided that no additional off-sale general licenses, other than a renewal or transfer or as permitted hereinafter in this section, shall be issued in any county where the number of premises for which <em>all </em>off-sale licenses are issued shall be more than one of such premises for each 1,000, or fraction thereof, inhabitants of such county. Population . . . shall he determined by the most recent United States decennial or special census.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal, entered after the sustaining of respondent\u2019s demurrer to petitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of mandate, without leave to amend, states that judicial notice is taken of official statistics published in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Bulletin for June, 1951, showing that \u201cthere are 3,336 premises with off-sale general liquor licenses, 198 premises with off-sale and on-sale general liquor licenses, and 3,747 premises with off-sale beer and wine licenses, making a total of 7,281 premises with off-sale liquor licenses in the County of Los Angeles.\u201d Under this computation, as respondents\u2019 brief points out, the board could not possibly issue a new license to appellants, possessed no discretion in respect to the matter; therefore no hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Appellants object to the board\u2019s interpretation of section 38f of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, \u201cso as to include in the computation of the total number of off-sale <em>general </em>licenses the number of existing off-sale <em>beer and wine </em>licenses. \u2019 \u2019 In support of this contention appellants cite such cases as <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 527 [213 P.2d 429]. Unlike the present case, the Johnstone opinion involved an attempt to compel the board to cancel a seasonal on-sale general liquor license. The reviewing court held that seasonal licenses had never been used in computing the number of licenses permitted. There was no decision concerning off-sale licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A reading of section 38f, particularly that part relating to off-sale licenses which is the only matter here involved, indicates the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the propriety of the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and the untenable nature of appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">As pointed out in respondents\u2019 brief, the board was without any power, jurisdiction or discretion to issue new off-sale general licenses other than under the conditions expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>laid down in the statute. If appellants\u2019 application for a new license did not fall strictly within the statutory conditions, and if the statutory maximum had already been reached, then obviously a hearing could accomplish nothing. As is well known, the law does not require idle acts. Had the board possessed any discretionary power to grant or withhold a license, a different question would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">The consideration of the first part of section 38f, relating to on-sale licenses, or of cases relating thereto, is of no assistance in dealing with the latter portion of the section pertaining to off-sale licenses. The separation of the two classes of licenses, the one permitting consumption of beverages upon the premises, and the other, such as the off-sale license requested by appellants, permitting only the sale of packaged goods for consumption off the premises, is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">As hereinbefore indicated, that part of the statute governing the present situation, expressly provides that \u201cno additional off-sale general license, other than a renewal or transfer or as permitted hereinafter in the section, shall be issued in any county where the number of premises for which <em>all </em>off-sale licenses are issued shall be more than one of such premises for each 1,000, or fraction thereof, inhabitants of such county. \u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The respondents are correct in saying that \u201cIf any effect at all is to be given to the use of the word \u2018all\u2019 in the phrase \u2018all off-sale licenses\u2019, the conclusion is inescapable that both off-sale general licenses and off-sale beer and wine licenses are to be used in computing the number of off-sale general licenses that may be issued in a particular county. The adjective \u2018all\u2019 would be wholly unnecessary if we were to follow appellants\u2019 argument that \u2018all off-sale licenses\u2019 means solely off-sale general licenses.\u201d The term \u201call\u201d must be construed to mean exactly what it seems to mean, and there is no authority for inserting the additional limiting words which appellants\u2019 theory would require. Had the legislators intended something else, the all-inclusive term would not have been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cThe board has blown hot and cold in its interpretation of 38f,\u201d and that the denial \u201ceven of a hearing was clearly arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, for which the remedy of mandamus should be granted,\u201d is without merit. In support thereof appellants cite <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 453 [186 P.2d 166], which, like <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>stone </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 527 [213 P.2d 429], hereinbefore mentioned, involves the issuance of on-sale licenses. Such cases do not support appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Since, as already pointed out, the board had no power to issue a license to appellants and consequently a hearing would have been pointless and without benefit to appellants\u2019 cause, which position was sustained by the trial court\u2019s sustaining of the general demurrer, it \u201cwould logically follow,\u201d as said by respondents, \u201cthat no damage can result from the failure to do an official act by a public officer, where the public officer is powerless to act. \u2019 \u2019 Moreover, as respondents state, \u201cappellants were seeking damages for the loss of profits which they <em>might </em>have received in operating a retail liquor department in conjunction with their grocery store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Under the circumstances shown by the record, it would be manifestly improper for an appellate tribunal to reverse the order and judgment of the trial court, and to order the board to do something which the law prohibits, namely the granting of a license in defiance of the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
