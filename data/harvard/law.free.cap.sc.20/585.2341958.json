Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, where it was heard in November, 1882, plaintiff claiming a trial <em>de novo. </em>The presiding judge (Aldrich) ruled that, under the provisions of section 358 of the code of procedure, which went into effect on May 1st, 1882, the appeal must be heard on the original papers sent up by the trial justice, without a jury, and without the examination of witnesses. To this ruling plaintiff excepted, and his appeal being dismissed, he further appealed to this court, upon the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c his Honor erred in ruling that an appeal taken from a trial justice\u2019s court prior to May 1st, 1882, must be tried on the papers sent up from the inferior court.\u201d Upon this ground the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed, this court holding that the change in the law of appeals from trial justices\u2019 courts, as enacted in section 358 of the code, did not apply to trials had before a trial justice prior to May 1st, 1882. Citing <em>Lynch\u2019s Code, </em>\u00a7 <em>369; Ex parte Graham, </em>13 <em>Rich. </em>283; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>18 <em>S. C. </em>481, and that plaintiff was entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
