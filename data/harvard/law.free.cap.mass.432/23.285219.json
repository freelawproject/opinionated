A Superior Court judge ordered BARCC to produce for the defendant a sanitized copy of its \u201chotline\u201d records stating the time, date, and fact of a telephone communication between the victim and a rape counsellor. The judge concluded that these records were not privileged, but relevant, and thus discoverable pursuant to general discovery principles. The judge also ordered BARCC to produce, for in camera inspection, records of the substance of communications between the victim and the rape counsellor, after determining that these records were privileged, but relevant \u201cpursuant to the principles of\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> BARCC refused to comply with these orders and the Superior Court judge ruled BARCC in contempt. BARCC appealed from the finding of contempt to the Appeals Court which affirmed the Superior Court judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 154 (1999). We granted BARCC\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Although this case arises in the context of a contempt proceeding, it involves essentially another application of the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedure. The primary issues for resolution here are whether the time, date, and fact of a communication between the victim and the rape counsellor are privileged and whether the defendant\u2019s proffer in this case was sufficient under the standards of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>to trigger an in camera review of the rape counselling records.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We start by summarizing the events culminating in the contempt adjudication. At a District Court probable cause hearing, the victim testified to the following during her direct testimony and cross-examination. After she and her friend Megan had spent an afternoon and night drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the defendant and three other individuals, the defendant raped and indecently assaulted her in the back seat of her automobile in the early morning hours of June 25, 1996. The victim only remembered portions of this incident due to her intoxicated condition. Later that day the victim asked Megan how she would define rape. Megan replied, \u201cSomeone does to you what you don\u2019t want them to do.\u201d With Megan present, the victim called BARCC and told a counsellor that she \u201cthought [she] had been raped,\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t know what rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>was.\u201d The woman at BARCC told her to go to a hospital.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The next day the victim went with Megan to a hospital and, from there, telephoned the police and reported the incident. The victim continued to socialize with the defendant and spent the night of July 3, 1996, in the defendant\u2019s bedroom with him, Megan, and Jacqueline, who was both the defendant\u2019s girl friend and the victim\u2019s best friend. The victim never told Jacqueline about the incident because she feared losing her friendship. Later during cross-examination, defense counsel inquired regarding further details of the victim\u2019s conversations with the BARCC counsellor, and the victim responded that she and the counsellor discussed how to define rape.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">After a probable cause finding and the return of indictments in the Superior Court, the defendant filed a motion and affidavit requesting the court to determine whether the BARCC counsel-ling records regarding this incident were privileged and, if so, to review them. On June 13, 1997, a Superior Court judge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ordered BARCC to produce the requested records unless it claimed a privilege, see note 2, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In response to the order, BARCC asserted that, because all its counsellors are certified rape crisis counsellors, the records were absolutely privileged under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, the statute that protects from disclosure records of a victim\u2019s sessions with a sexual assault counsellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On August 15, 1997, the defendant and the Commonwealth argued the defendant\u2019s motion. BARCC was not notified of and did not participate in this hearing. After the hearing, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>issued a written memorandum and order in which he concluded that the records were privileged under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, because the records were generated as a result of communications between the victim and a certified sexual assault counsel-lor in a way that \u201cdid not disclose the information to a person other than a person present for the benefit of [the victim].\u201d After determining that the records were privileged, the judge, \u201cpursuant to Stage II of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 181 (1993), as modified by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 225-227 (1996),\u201d reviewed the defendant\u2019s proffer, and concluded that the records \u201care relevant and material to the defense of the case and . . . the information . . . cannot accurately be obtained from another source.\u201d The judge\u2019s relevance determination was based on his decision that the conversations with the counsellor were the \u201cturning point\u201d in the case; that prior to that conversation, the victim was uncertain whether she had been raped; and that it was only after the conversation that she concluded that she had been raped and contacted the police. Thus, he issued an order to BARCC to produce the records for an in camera review pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On November 3, 1997, defense counsel informed the judge that, although BARCC had previously asserted that the records were privileged, it now claimed that no records existed. The judge ordered BARCC\u2019s keeper of records to testify regarding its failure to comply with his June 13 and August 15, 1997, orders to produce the records. At a hearing on November 17, 1997, BARCC\u2019s executive director (who is also the keeper of records) informed the judge that there were no treatment records regarding the victim, but that BARCC did possess log entries of the victim\u2019s call, which entries did not contain the substance of any conversation, but might contain information about referrals by the counsellor. In any event, BARCC pressed its claim that even a log entry (indicating the date and time of a call) was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The judge continued the case until November 21, 1997, and ordered BARCC to review its log entries to determine whether they included any information beyond the date and time of the victim\u2019s call. On November 21, 1997, BARCC informed the judge that it had identified a single log entry regarding the substance of the victim\u2019s conversation. The judge ruled that the date and time of the call were not privileged under G. L. c. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00a7 20J, and ordered BARCC to provide the defendant a redacted copy of the log showing only that information. As to the records that were privileged, the judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s proffer satisfied the requisites of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, su</em>pra,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the reasons stated in his August 15, 1997, order, and ordered that BARCC produce the complete log entry for an in camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">BARCC refused to comply with either of the judge\u2019s orders. On November 24, 1997, the judge issued a written memorandum and order recounting the findings and orders he had made at the November 21, 1997, hearing and ruling that BARCC was in contempt for not complying with the orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The defendant pleaded guilty, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>after the decision of the Appeals Court, but before the case was entered in this court. The case is not moot, however, as the contempt order remains outstanding and, pursuant to it, money is owed. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rape Crisis Servs. of Greater Lowell, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 190, 192-192 (1993) (appeal from order holding operator of treatment center in civil contempt for refusal to produce rape victim\u2019s treatment records for in camera inspection moot, where accused rapist\u2019s guilty plea ended his need for access to the records and judge had vacated contempt order).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">BARCC contends on appeal that the judge\u2019s November 24, 1997, order (1) violates the provisions of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, and the mandates of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>for a variety of reasons; (2) is erroneous because Mass. R. Crim. R 14 (a) (1) (C), 378 Mass. 874 (1979), limits pretrial discovery to material in the possession, custody, or control of the prosecutor; and (3) violates the due process rights of BARCC and of the victim under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">1. <em>Time, date, and fact of communication. </em>BARCC contends that the judge\u2019s order that it produce the \u201chotline\u201d information violates G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J (sexual assault counsellor privilege), and the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra. </em>The judge concluded correctly that the portion of the records that sets forth the time, date, and fact of a communication between the complainant and the rape counsellor on the \u201chotline\u201d is not protected by the sexual assault counsellor privilege. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20J, provides that a \u201c[confidential communication\u201d is \u201cinformation transmitted in confidence by and between a victim of sexual assault and a sexual assault counsellor . . . including] all information received by the sexual assault counsellor which arises out of and in the course of such counselling.\u201d As the Appeals Court noted, the date and time of the communication is not \u201cinformation transmitted\u201d or \u201cinformation received by\u201d a counsellor during the course of counselling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 160 (1999). Thus, the judge did not err in concluding that such information was not within the scope of that privilege. Although the dissent maintains otherwise, this has been the traditional interpretation accorded all privileges, including that in \u00a7 20J. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>402 Mass. 664, 667 (1988) (patient-psychotherapist privilege does not protect existence of fact of hospitalization, dates, or purpose of hospitalization); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>948 F. Supp. 97, 101 (D. Mass. 1996) (rape counselling records with dates of contact, length of contact, nature of contact [i.e., telephonic or in person], and name of rape crisis counsellor not privileged communication). See also <em>In re Subpoena Served Upon Zuniga, </em>714 F.2d 632, 640 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 983 (1983) (\u201cas a general rule, the identity of a patient or the fact and time of his treatment does not fall within the scope of the psychotherapist-patient privilege\u201d); <em>Santelli </em>v. <em>Electro-Motive, </em>188 F.R.D. 306, 310 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (psychotherapist privilege does not prevent disclosure of date of treatment or identity of psychotherapists); <em>Vanderbilt </em>v. <em>Chilmark, </em>174 F.R.D. 225, 230 (D. Mass. 1997) (\u201cFacts regarding the very occurrence of psychotherapy, such as the dates of treatment, are not privileged\u201d); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Zerendow), </em>925 F. Supp. 849, 855 (D. Mass. 1995) (holding that identity of attorney\u2019s client and course of payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>for legal fees not normally protected by attorney-client privilege); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum, </em>638 F. Supp. 794, 799 (D. Me. 1986), quoting <em>In re Subpoena Served Upon Zuniga, supra </em>at 639 (\u201cno privilege precludes disclosure of the \u2018identity of a [non-Medicare or non-Medicaid] patient or the fact and time of his treatment\u2019 \u201d). Once the determination is made that the records are not privileged, the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedure is no longer applicable. Thus, there was no error in the judge\u2019s order that BARCC produce the \u201chotline\u201d log containing the time, date, and fact of this call only.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">2. <em>Stage Two </em>\u2014 Fuller <em>relevancy determination. </em>BARCC maintains that the judge violated the provisions of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>by failing to require the defendant to submit the proffer required for a Stage Two relevancy determination. (See note 2, <em>supra). </em>BARCC\u2019s assertion is incorrect. The defendant submitted the required proffer on April 30, 1997, in his motion for review of certain records. Although this motion appears to have been filed in connection with a \u201cStage One\u201d privilege determination, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 181, the motion and in particular its accompanying detailed affidavit suffice as a basis for a Stage Two relevancy determination, and the judge clearly considered it as such.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">BARCC further complains that it had no opportunity to review the proffer until the middle of the \u201cfinal <em>Bishop </em>hearing\u201d and that it did not have an opportunity to review the transcripts of the prior proceedings in the case. The transcript of the November 17 hearing makes it clear that BARCC was given an opportunity by the judge on that day (which was before the \u201cfinal <em>Bishop </em>hearing\u201d of November 21) to review the defendant\u2019s proffer, was aware of the judge\u2019s prior finding of August 15, asked for and received a continuance, and submitted written memoranda arguing its position. Further, all these items were matters of record, and copies of court documents and transcripts could have been obtained. (BARCC was aware of the pendency of these proceedings at least since June 13, 1997, the date of the original order that the records be produced.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Nothing in the record indicates that BARCC ever sought an additional continuance from the judge or indicated to him any need for more time to respond to the arguments previously made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">3. <em>The defendant\u2019s proffer. </em>We next consider BARCC\u2019s contention that the judge improperly applied the <em>Fuller </em>standard in ordering an in camera review of the records, i.e., that the defendant\u2019s profiler was insufficient to warrant in camera review. The key point in the affidavit was that the victim had testified at the probable cause hearing that she only formed the opinion that she was raped after speaking with a rape crisis counsellor. The affidavit further stated that the victim testified at the probable cause hearing that she (1) had intercourse with her best friend\u2019s boy friend, the defendant, and had not told anyone because she did not want to ruin her friendship with her best friend; (2) vacillated as to whether she \u201chad intercourse\u201d with the defendant or \u201conly oral sex\u201d; (3) was involved in alcohol and drug activity on the night of the alleged incident<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; (4) lied to her grandmother about the events of that night; (5) continued to socialize with the defendant after the incident, including spending the night of July 3 in his bedroom; (6) was extremely susceptible to manipulation by peer pressure; and (7) was under treatment for depression and had been prescribed Prozac (apparently at the time of the incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The dissent would have us disregard many of these factors as , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>not material or relevant to the issue of consent because they occurred after the night in question. The distinction is not meaningful for the purpose of applying <em>Fuller. When </em>the other factors occurred in relation to the conversations with the rape counsellor is not the relevant inquiry. The focus, rather, is on whether all (or any) circumstances indicate that the requested information is likely to be relevant and material. Such factors as the victim\u2019s susceptibility to peer pressure and her lie to her grandmother increase the importance of her statements to the counsellor. Further, whether such other information (e.g., her lie to her grandmother, her alcohol and drug activity on the night in question) is available from other sources is not the issue; <em>Fuller </em>requires only that the information regarding the content of the conversations with the counsellor not be available from other sources. \u201cA motion for the production of rape counselling records should be . . . premised on ... a showing that the material [in the records] is not available elsewhere.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fuller, <em>supra </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The dissent also seeks to minimize the importance of several of these factors by referring to the certainty of the victim\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing. But that is not the issue. It is the victim\u2019s <em>prior </em>uncertainty and her earlier actions inconsistent with the fact of a rape that mandate the conclusion that the proffer was sufficient. For example, the fact that the victim spent a night in the defendant\u2019s bedroom less than one week after reporting that he had raped her <em>must </em>call into question the validity of the report of rape. The fact that she vacillated between whether she \u201chad intercourse\u201d with the defendant or \u201conly oral sex\u201d also indicates confusion and a conflict with her probable cause testimony. Further, her testimony that she did not reveal the sexual intercourse because she did not want to harm her relationship with her best friend suggests as well that the sexual relations were consensual. If the defendant had raped the victim, such an act is unlikely to harm the victim\u2019s friendship with the best friend; it is much more likely to affect the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>relationship with the best friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The affidavit clearly sets forth sufficient factors to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the conversations of the victim, an eighteen year old young woman, with the counsellor were the \u201cturning point\u201d in the case. The victim had been uncertain previously whether she had been raped and she suffered from an impaired memory of the events due to intoxication. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the conversations with the counsellor, she ultimately concluded that she had been raped and criminal proceedings were instituted. The judge accurately considered the \u201ccalls\u201d the \u201cturning point\u201d and concluded that a fact finder could well be influenced by the content of these calls which caused the complainant to become certain of her situation. Further, the exact content of the calls is material that may not be obtained elsewhere; the victim was the only other party to the calls and the accuracy of her memory was questionable. The proffer is clearly sufficient to support the judge\u2019s determination that there was a good faith, specific, and reasonable basis for believing that the records would contain exculpatory evidence relevant and material to the defense of the case and that this material could not be obtained from other sources.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The dissent\u2019s distinction between the victim\u2019s knowledge of the events and her knowledge of their legal import is without significance to the resolution of this case. Regardless of whether the victim knew what happened on the night in question, when a third party affects the victim\u2019s concept of whether she has been raped and then, pursuant to that discussion, the victim reports a rape to the police, the defendant cannot constitutionally be denied a right of access to that communication. The accusation arises from that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The dissent states that our interpretation of the privilege impliedly overrules <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996), because we have created an exception to the privilege without a showing that such an exception is necessary to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. That is not the case. We agree with the dissent that the Legislature intended the widest scope possible for this privilege. But the dissent acknowledges, as it must, that \u201ceven the most well-intended legislation must yield to constitutional norms.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 38. Accordingly, we are permitting the application of <em>Fuller </em>to the extent that is constitutionally permissible. The scope of the privilege, however, must be limited by the constitutional rights of the defendant. That limit has been reached in this case. If communications such as those here at issue are withheld from a defendant on these facts, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>due process and to a fair trial are violated. This confluence of factors that indicates the adolescent\u2019s emotional state, the level of her uncertainty about what had occurred, and the conditions under which she observed the events, at the very least, suggests a real possibility of a false allegation. Due process and the right to a fair trial are implicated to such a great degree that a statute that prevents the defendant from access to the underlying information and makes the accusation suspect cannot comply with constitutional requirements. We do not read the legislation as doing so and we shall not apply it in such a manner. The statute cannot be applied to deny the defendant a right to learn whether the young woman\u2019s conversations with the counsellor are consistent with her accusations against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">4. <em>Mass. R. Crim. R 14. </em>BARCC contends that the judge improperly ordered the records produced because rule 14 (a) (1) (C) limits discovery to material in the possession, custody, or control of the prosecutor. BARCC maintains that the Appeals Court erred in relying on the provisions of Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979), to permit the defendant to obtain the production of evidence from private third parties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 162 (1999). Rule 17 (a) (2) provides that a summons may command the production of documents, but that on motion, the court may quash or modify the summons if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive or if the summons is being used to subvert the provisions of rule 14. The rule further provides that the court may direct the documents to be produced within a reasonable time prior to trial and permit their inspection and copying by the parties if authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">BARCC\u2019s argument fails. BARCC has made no showing as to how the purpose of rule 14 was subverted; it has only offered a conclusory opinion. The defendant is entitled to obtain evidence needed to prepare his defense. The entire procedure in <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>is premised on this right, and is an effort to accommodate the statutory privilege within the right. Because this is the concept underlying rule 17, it is incumbent on one seeking to interfere with this right to demonstrate how the purpose of rule 14 was violated. BARCC has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">5. <em>Due process claims. </em>BARCC claims that its due process rights were violated because it did not receive notice and opportunity to be heard at the August 15, 1997, hearing. BARCC has a legal obligation to assert the privilege on behalf of its cli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 220 n.3. That obligation does not implicate any due process rights. In regard to notice that privileged records were involved, it appears from the docket in this case that notice did issue to BARCC on June 13, 1997, at least to the effect that records of this victim were being sought. Further BARCC was given notice and opportunity to be heard, at both the hearings on November 17, and November 21, prior to the issuance of the order in question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">BARCC further argues that the due process rights of the victim were violated when she testified to the fact and content of the telephone call at the probable cause hearing unaware of her right to refuse to respond to the questions. BARCC contends that the victim was prejudiced thereby because the revelation of the content of the telephone call formed the basis of the judge\u2019s determination that the records should be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is unnecessary to resolve the issue whether BARCC has standing to assert a violation of the victim\u2019s due process rights, as no due process rights of the victim were involved. The victim had merely a statutory right to assert the privilege that clearly BARCC may assert in circumstances such as these. The keeper of records in the position of a counselling center \u201chas the obligation to assert a client\u2019s privilege as to records in its keeping (unless the privilege has been waived by the client).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 220 n.3.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, BARCC was unaware of the probable cause hearing and the victim herself was hardly in a position to be aware of her rights. Clearly there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>was no waiver.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The content of that call was not the basis of the defendant\u2019s proffer or the judge\u2019s relevance determination. See Part 3, <em>supra. </em>The revelation of the <em>fact </em>of the call (which we have concluded was not privileged, see Part 1, <em>supra), </em>and the young woman\u2019s statements regarding her state of mind (that she had become certain that she had been raped only after her consultation with the BARCC counsellor) were sufficient (without the testimony as to the content of the call) to support the judge\u2019s relevance conclusion. Accordingly, there was no prejudice to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">6. <em>Disposition. </em>The order of the Superior Court is affirmed. Because criminal proceedings against this defendant have terminated, there is no longer a need for the records to be produced. Without denigrating in any way the vital importance of agencies such as BARCC, we cannot sanction failure to comply with the law. When the Superior Court judge\u2019s order for production of the records issued, BARCC was obligated to comply with that order unless and until a stay was issued.

Stage One is a determination whether the records are privileged. If the records are privileged, in Stage Two the judge considers whether the defendant by motion \u201chas demonstrated a good faith, specific, and reasonable basis for believing that the records will contain exculpatory evidence which is relevant and material to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d and whether the material is available elsewhere. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> We acknowledge briefs filed by the district attorneys for the Eastern, Berkshire, Bristol, Cape and Islands, Norfolk, Northern, and Northwestern districts; the district attorney for the Plymouth district; the district attorney for the Suffolk district; and the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and several others, as amici curiae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> This part of the conversation with the counsellor was elicited on cross-examination without objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"> The Commonwealth objected to this part of the conversation on the basis of a privileged communication, but the District Court judge, believing that Megan\u2019s presence eliminated any privilege, overruled the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> All the Superior Court proceedings relevant to this appeal occurred before the same judge, who conducted thorough proceedings throughout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b48-10\"> The <em>Fuller </em>case counsels that \u201c[rjape counselling records should not be summonsed to the court . . . until a defendant has filed a written motion seeking their production and explaining in detail his reasons for doing so, <em>and </em>a judge has ruled on the motion in the defendant\u2019s favor [i.e., made a ruling on the Stage Two relevancy issue]\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>It appears from the record that the judge here ordered the records produced initially because \u201cno claim of privilege has been made by the complainant herself or by . . . the subject counselling facilities.\u201d (If no privilege is asserted, the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedures of course are inapplicable.)

We further note that, although BARCC argues that G.

Further, the court\u2019s decision contradicts the plain language of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, and frustrates the clear intent of the Legislature in enacting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">1. <em>BARCC\u2019s records are neither material nor relevant. </em>The defendant\u2019s proffer in support of his motion to compel production of BARCC\u2019s records was insufficient under the standard this court articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra. </em>At the probable cause hearing, \u201cthe victim . . . testified . . . that she only formed the opinion that she was raped after speaking with a rape crisis counsellor.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 31. The motion judge and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>court erroneously view this as the \u201cturning point,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 32, in the case and conclude that any records documenting the substance of the victim\u2019s calls to BARCC\u2019s counsellors are relevant and material. The judge and now the court fail to distinguish between the victim\u2019s knowledge of events and the victim\u2019s understanding of the legal significance of those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Nothing in the defendant\u2019s proffer or the judge\u2019s findings indicates that the victim related a factual narrative of the assault to the rape crisis counsellors different from the facts she related to the police and others. She testified in unequivocal terms that before and after she telephoned the rape crisis center she knew what had happened to her. She just did not know what rape was.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of speaking with BARCC\u2019s counsellors, the victim\u2019s understanding of the <em>legal significance </em>of what had happened was clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Victims are not required to recognize the legal significance of an assault,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and failure to do so does not suffice as a reason to order the production of privileged records. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Fuller, supra. </em>This court has recognized that victims may seek the assistance of rape crisis counsellors before reporting the assault to the police. <em>Id. </em>at 222 (rape crisis counselling privilege \u201csupports the reporting of rapes\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 657 (1989). That a victim does so should not provide the reason for being forced to disclose her privileged communications with a counsellor she turns to for assistance. Neither the order to produce BARCC\u2019s records nor the order of contempt should have issued, and BARCC should not have been held in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">2. <em>Scope of the privilege. </em>As the court has recognized, the Legislature intended that \u00a7 20J create an \u201cabsolute privilege,\u201d not subject to any exception. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 265-266 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The privilege created by \u00a7 20J \u201c[b]y its terms . . . clearly promotes . . . important interests,\u201d such as encouraging victims of sexual assault to seek treatment, report the crime, and assist the Commonwealth in the prosecution of the perpetrator. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 221-222.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The court, however, recognizing that even the most well-intended legislation must yield to constitutional norms, has observed that \u201cthe . . . privilege shall be pierced in those cases in which there is a reasonable risk that nondisclosure may result in an erroneous conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 177 (1993). The court circumscribed this narrow, judicially created exception even more tightly in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>where it cautioned against creating an exception to the privilege that \u201cwould make the privilege no privilege at all, and would substitute an unwarranted judicial abridgment of a clearly stated legislative goal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Section 20J explicitly and unequivocally includes <em>\u201call information </em>received by the sexual assault counsellor <em>which arises out of and in the course of such counseling and assisting, including, but not limited to </em>reports, records, working papers or memoranda\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J. The conclusion that \u201call information\u201d means \u201call information except the date and time of contact\u201d rewrites the plain language of the statute. So too does the court\u2019s conclusion that the date and time of the counselling encounter are not part of information \u201carising] out of and in the course of . . . counselling.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 29, quoting G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Unlike other privileges that arise from statute, such as the psychotherapist-client privilege, the Legislature chose not to subject the rape crisis counseling privilege to <em>any </em>exception.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Now, the court has created an exception to the privilege without a showing that it is needed to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The Legislature has spoken unequivocally, and its intent clearly was to make the scope of the privilege as broad as is constitutionally permissible. The court\u2019s decision today creates an exception to \u00a7 20J that will result in the automatic release to defendants of information as to the date and time of hotline calls. It requires rape counselling centers to be in court on every case and may prevent victims from seeking help. It is not within the province of this court to create a broad exception where the Legislature has created none and, in so doing, to \u201csubstitute an unwarranted judicial abridgment of a clearly stated legislative goal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">3. <em>Other errors. </em>A number of factors cited by the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>support of its decision have no logical connection with BARCC\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">(1) The night the victim spent in the defendant\u2019s bedroom occurred after the victim spoke with the counsellors. Any counsel-ling records would not, therefore, contain reference to this later occurrence. Also, because the defendant admitted to having intercourse with the victim without obtaining her oral consent, see infra, this later occurrence is neither material nor relevant to the question of her consent on the night of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">(2) Evidence that the victim was being treated for depression does not provide a reason for compelling production of the records. There is no evidence in the record that depression or the treatment of depression affects an individual\u2019s credibility or propensity for prevarication. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 185 (\u201cThe defendant apparently assumes that a learning disability adversely affects credibility\u201d). The court\u2019s citation of the victim\u2019s treatment for depression suggests that, when a victim of a sexual assault is being treated for any mental or emotional difficulties, the privilege no longer applies, thus implicitly removing the protection afforded by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, from persons seeking help from psychotherapists or psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">(3) There is no reason to believe that the victim\u2019s susceptibility to peer pressure was relevant to her understanding of and action on the information given to her by BARCC\u2019s counsellors. The counsellors were not the victim\u2019s peers, and the record indicates that the victim\u2019s peers did not support her reporting the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">(4) The defendant admitted to the police that he had sexual intercourse with the victim and that she was so inebriated that she did not give oral consent when he began. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that BARCC\u2019s records will shed light on why, or whether, the victim equivocated as to whether vaginal intercourse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">(5) The fact that the victim\u2019s recall of events on the night of the assault, when she was inebriated, was spotty offers no support for the materiality or relevance of BARCC\u2019s records. There is no proffer that the victim\u2019s memory of the assault when talking with BARCC counsellors was different from her memory of those events at the probable cause hearing. See <em>ante </em>at note 11. The victim\u2019s memory of events <em>on the evening of the assault </em>was, as she admitted, impaired because of her inebriation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>that night. During her testimony at the probable cause hearing she was not confused; rather, she was firm in maintaining that there were portions of the evening she simply did not recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The court also cites, in support of its conclusion that BARCC\u2019s records would be material and relevant, several factors that are not supported by the record or that involve information available from other sources. As the court notes, information available from other sources should not be the subject of an order for production of records privileged under \u00a7 20J. <em>Ante </em>at 32. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The court writes: \u201c[T]he victim . . . lied to her grandmother about the events of that night . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 31. The hotline conversations did not concern the victim\u2019s statements to her grandmother. There were alternative sources for the information, such as the victim\u2019s friend who assisted in the lie. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 225-226.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The court writes: \u201c[T]he victim . . . was involved in alcohol and drug activity on the night of the alleged incident . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 31. Evidence that the victim was drinking and using marijuana is available from other sources, including from the victim\u2019s friend, who testified at the probable cause hearing, and from the victim herself. Because \u201c[ajlcohol is a factor in more than half of all . . . sexual-assault cases,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> allowing the fact of alcohol use by a sexual assault victim to abrogate the privilege \u201cmake[s] the privilege no privilege at all.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>we wrote that \u201c[i]t was not our intention ... to establish a standard and protocol that would result in virtually automatic in camera inspection for an entire class of extremely private and sensitive privileged material. To do so would make the privilege no privilege at all.\u201d The court\u2019s decision today abrogates the privilege based on factors that apply in most sexual assault cases, and directly contravenes the Legislature\u2019s intent in enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ing \u00a7 20J, the language of the statute, and our cases. Therefore, I dissent. I would vacate the order of contempt.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The only evidence as to the content of the calls comes from the victim\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing, which, as I note, <em>infra, </em>should never have been allowed. The victim described her conversation with the counsellor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">A.: \u201cI called up and said that I thought I had been raped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cYou thought you had been raped?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">A.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWere those the words you used?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">A.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWhy did you only think you had been raped?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDid you think that maybe something happened but you weren\u2019t sure?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-18\">A.: \u201cI knew it had happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-19\"> Victims often are confused about what constitutes a legally cognizable assault, especially when alcohol is involved and the perpetrator is an acquaintance.

Rev. 203, 204-205 (1996); Telljohann, High School Students\u2019 Perceptions on Nonconsensual Sexual Activity, 65 J. of Sch.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A [1984 ed.] [priest-penitent]), is a statement of absolute privilege. Statutory privileges normally have exceptions, some of which are quite general, and, for that reason, they indicate a less firmly based legislative concern than \u00a7 20J does for the inviolability of the communication being protected. . . . Section 20J protects a victim\u2019s expectation of privacy and guarantees the preservation of confidentiality <em>without exception\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 265-266 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 224 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> This statute is part of what appears to be a concerted effort on the part of the Legislature to address sex crimes in the Commonwealth.

L. c. 123A (providing for care, treatment, and rehabilitation of sexually dangerous persons).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> The court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 20J thus yields the anomalous result that the limiting language in statutes such as G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (psychotherapist-client privilege), to which the court analogizes \u00a7 20J, is construed so as to have the same meaning as the broader language in \u00a7 20J. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (creating privilege for communications \u201crelative to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> Neither the attorneys nor the judge at the probable cause hearing appears to have read the statute.

G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J (confidential communications include those made in the presence of \u201ca person present for the benefit of the victim\u201d).
