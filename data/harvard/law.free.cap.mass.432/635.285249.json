L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, for possession of a firearm without a license, subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d). </em>A judge in the District Court dismissed the youthful offender indictment, concluding that the defendant\u2019s earlier \u201cadjudication of delinquency\u201d for possession of a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>without a license was not a \u201cconviction,\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review and now vacate the dismissal of the indictment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The following facts are drawn from the District Court judge\u2019s findings, supplemented where necessary by unchallenged facts from the record. In January, 1999, Officer James Fay of the Lowell police department observed a Toyota Camry automobile, later found to be stolen, speeding north on Mount Vernon Street in Lowell. The automobile spun out of control, whereupon the officer saw two males leave the automobile and run west on Lombard Street. One was wearing a black mask and carrying a black book bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Two other officers with the Lowell police department tracked the two males through backyards and across several streets by following their footsteps in the snow. They eventually apprehended the defendant and another person, later identified by Officer Fay as the two individuals who had run from the Toyota Camry. A .22 caliber semiautomatic handgun with a loaded clip and defaced serial numbers was recovered from the black book bag apparently dropped while the two males were fleeing; the bag bore the defendant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In March, 1999, a. grand jury returned youthful offender indictments, G. L. c.119, \u00a7 54, charging the defendant with five offenses, including the one at issue here, possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>firearm without a license, subsequent offense, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d) </em>(Count B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basis for the subsequent offense indictment was that previously, in November, 1996, the defendant had been adjudicated delinquent for violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), possession of a firearm without a license, and had been committed to the Department of Youth Services (DYS). On the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, a judge in the Superior Court ordered that the youthful offender indictments against the defendant be sent to the juvenile session of the Lowell District Court, where the defendant moved to dismiss Count B. After-a hearing, a judge in the District Court allowed the motion on the ground that the defendant, notwithstanding his prior adjudication of delinquency for unlawful possession of a firearm, had not been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a firearm offense for purposes of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In 1996, the Legislature enacted substantial changes to the law governing delinquent children, addressed primarily to those children who commit violent or gun-related unlawful acts. See generally St. 1996, c. 200. See also R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 3, at 13-14 (Supp. 1998). We describe the provisions of the new law relevant to this appeal. As amended through St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 2, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, now provides several mechanisms by which the Commonwealth may initiate proceedings against a child who is charged with a violation of a law of the Commonwealth. It may proceed by complaint in a Juvenile Court; it may proceed by complaint in a juvenile session of a District Court; or it may proceed by indictment in a District or Juvenile Court if the child qualifies as a \u201cyouthful offender,\u201d as defined in the 1996 legislation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 54. We are concerned in this case with the category of \u201cyouthful offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ers\u201d who violate the law concerning firearms, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">As appearing in St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 5, the third paragraph of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, now provides that, if a child is adjudicated a youthful offender on an indictment, a judge shall impose, of three possible dispositional options, the one that best protects the \u201cpresent and long-term public safety.\u201d The most severe option grants a judge authority to punish the child by \u201ca sentence provided by law,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58 <em>(a), </em>in other words the punishment the child would receive were he an adult.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Alternatively, the judge may order a \u201ccombination sentence,\u201d which requires the commitment of the child to the custody of the DYS until he reaches the age of twenty-one years, and an adult sentence to a house of correction or to the State prison as provided by law, subject to required suspension. <em>Id. </em>Finally, a judge may commit the child to DYS until he reaches the age of twenty-one years, the least severe option.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It is not disputed that the Commonwealth could seek an indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ment of this defendant as a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d: he was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged firearm offense, the alleged offense was punishable by imprisonment in a State prison,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and he allegedly committed a firearm offense in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Two statutory issues are in dispute. First, may the defendant be indicted as a youthful offender for violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (d), the repeat offender provision of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10? That question turns on whether the defendant\u2019s 1996 \u201cadjudication of delinquency\u201d for violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), satisfies the requirement of \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>that a person previously be \u201cconvicted\u201d of a firearm offense. The second issue, closely tied to the first, concerns the proper interpretation of the new sentencing provisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58. The crux of that question is whether the 1996 dispositional provisions of \u00a7 58, seventh and eighth pars.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> apply only to children \u201cadjudicated delinquent on a complaint\u201d or apply also to \u201cyouthful offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The 1996 revisions of G. L. c. 119 are silent on whether the Legislature intended the term \u201cconviction,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>to apply to a child previously adjudicated delinquent, who is indicted as a youthful offender for a \u201csubsequent\u201d or \u201clike\u201d firearm offense. The defendant argues that treating a prior delinquency \u201cadjudication\u201d as a \u201cconviction\u201d so that a child may be prosecuted and sentenced to prison pursuant to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>would circumvent nearly one century of law giving effect to the Legislature\u2019s determination to decriminalize juvenile offenses. The Commonwealth does not challenge that the primary public policy of this Commonwealth remains one of rehabilitation and redemption of children who violate our laws. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53. Rather, it rests its argument on a more narrow statutory analysis that construing the term \u201cconvicted\u201d to include a delinquency \u201cadjudication,\u201d harmonizes G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 8, in a manner consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to protect the public from, and deal more severely with, children who violate our firearms laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We again embrace the maxim that a statute must be interpreted \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326 (1999), quoting <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 487-488 (1994). Statutes concerning a common topic should, of course, be read as a whole to produce an internal consistency and to effectuate the presumed intention of the Legislature. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>425 Mass. 523, 525 (1997); <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 58, 64 (1993). To this end where, by amending an existing statute, the Legislature changes some but not all of the provisions of an earlier statute, the later enacted provisions must be read together with the earlier provisions left unchanged as if they originally had been enacted as one. See 1A NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 22.32-22. 35, at 282-300 (5th ed. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>We begin our analysis by comparing the 1996 amendments to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52-63, with the earlier enactments of the statute to determine what \u201cmischief or imperfection\u201d in the original act the Legislature intended to remedy in 1996. <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, supra. </em>We recently noted that the purpose of the 1996 amendments was \u201cto reduce or to eliminate certain protections previously available to all juvenile offenders in an effort to address growing concern about violent crimes committed by juveniles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 227-228 (1999). See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 212-213 &amp; n.8 (1997). To deal specifically with children who commit violent offenses, especially those involving guns, St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 7, repealed the \u201ctransfer\u201d provision, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commonwealth may now proceed directly by indictment against a child and, for the first time in a juvenile proceeding, a judge may impose a sentence to the State prison on a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">At the same time, the provisions of the 1996 amendments did not eviscerate the longstanding principle that the treatment of children who offend our laws are not criminal proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>384 Mass. 784, 786 (1981), and cases cited. Notably, the 1996 act did not amend G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, which declares the legislative policy that the operative provisions of the statutes shall be liberally construed to require rehabilitative \u201caid, encouragement and guidance\u201d rather than criminal dispositions for children who offend.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, even as to the category of children adjudicated \u201cyouthful offenders,\u201d the statute does not label a \u201cyouthful of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>fender\u201d proceeding as \u201ccriminal.\u201d The distinction our law recognizes between child and adult adjudication exists partly to avoid the infringement of a child\u2019s constitutional rights, and partly to avoid the attachment of criminal stigma to children who may be amenable to rehabilitation. <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 648, 651 (1959). The 1996 amendments did not alter that fundamental policy determination by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Thus, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, continues to instruct us to construe liberally the new provisions contained in \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 58 in favor of treating children as offenders in need of aid, encouragement, and guidance, not as criminals. But the statutory mandate that we do so \u201cas far as practicable\u201d takes on new significance in light of the 1996 amendments that some children who violate some laws should, at the discretion of a judge in a juvenile proceeding, be subject to the same prison sentences provided by law as if they were adults. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58. It may not be \u201cpracticable\u201d to construe the provisions of the revised \u00a7\u00a754 and 58 to favor the \u201caid, encouragement and guidance\u201d of those children, while at the same time enforcing the legislative mandate that terms of incarceration, sometimes lengthy, be served in State prisons by some children found to imperil the public safety. In this respect, the 1996 amendments reflect a legislative determination that a purely rehabilitative approach directed to all children who engage in any unlawful conduct, no matter how egregious, is no longer desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We are mindful that, if the legislation we examine here can plausibly be found to be ambiguous, we should give the defendant the benefit of the ambiguity. <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 70, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992). In this case we detect no such ambiguity. If a prior \u201cadjudication\u201d does not satisfy the \u201cconviction\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>then the Commonwealth could never indict a child for a second or subsequent firearms offense under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>{d), </em>because a child is never \u201cconvicted\u201d of violating a statute, whether the Commonwealth proceeds by complaint or indictment. To accept the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the 1996 legislation would therefore impermissibly negate several provisions of the 1996 amendments in the face of a reasonable alternative construction. Cf. <em>Ben Elfman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Home Indem. Co., </em>411 Mass. 13 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The Legislature included within the statutory definition of \u201c[y]outhful offender\u201d children who violate only <em>one </em>identified criminal statute, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. The specific reference to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (if), in the definition of \u201c[y]outhful offender,\u201d G. L. c. 119 \u00a7\u00a7 52, and in the procedures concerning the treatment of a \u201cyouthful offender,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, strongly suggests that the Legislature intended to authorize the Commonwealth to indict children who repeatedly violate the gun laws, i.e., G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Similarly, seventh and eighth paragraphs of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, provide the maximum periods of commitment for a child who is adjudicated delinquent for a first, second, or subsequent <em>\u201cviolation </em>of [\u00a7 10] <em>(a), </em>(c) or <em>(d)\u201d </em>(emphasis added). From the plain reading of that provision it is apparent that the Legislature contemplated that a child can \u201cviolate\u201d \u00a7 10 <em>(d); </em>that is, he can be found to have committed a second or subsequent firearms offense in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>if he previously has \u201cviolated\u201d \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>or (c). If the Legislature had not intended to impose on children who repeatedly violate the gun laws the more severe sentences authorized by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>it would simply have omitted from its definition of \u201cyouthful offender\u201d any reference to \u00a7 10 <em>(d). </em>See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Alternatively, as to children who repeatedly violate \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>or (c), the Legislature could have required the Commonwealth either to indict under \u00a7 10 (a) or (c) (rather than under \u00a7 10 [&lt;f|), <em>or </em>to proceed by complaint and seek a longer commitment to DYS pursuant to paragraph eight of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, eighth par. It did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The defendant also argues that the Legislature intended G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, seventh and eighth pars., to govern the disposition of <em>all </em>children (\u201cdelinquent children\u201d and \u201cyouthful offenders\u201d) who commit a second or subsequent offense under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, and that those paragraphs effectively supersede the provisions of paragraph three that contemplate lengthy prison sentences for \u201cyouthful offenders\u201d who repeatedly violate the firearms laws. The seventh and eighth paragraphs of \u00a7 58 limit the dispositional options available to a judge for a child found to have violated G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as distinguished from children who violate any other laws: those provisions mandate that even children who are adjudicated delinquent on a <em>complaint </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>are not treated as leniently as other children precisely because they violate the gun laws. For a first firearms offense, a judge must now commit the child to a DYS facility for at least 180 days or until the child reaches his eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other words the Legislature required a more severe disposition for those children committing gun-related offenses, even if the offense is the child\u2019s first.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">For a second or subsequent gun-related offense prosecuted by a complaint, a judge must commit the child to a DYS facility for not less than one year, and the commitment period cannot be reduced or suspended. It is important to our resolution of this aspect of the defendant\u2019s argument to note that, in stark contrast to \u00a7 58, third par., \u00a7 58, seventh and eighth pars., does not allow a judge the option of imposing the most severe sanction, commitment to an adult prison as provided in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>(c), and <em>(d). </em>See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, if the seventh and eighth paragraphs are construed to apply to \u201cyouthful offenders\u201d as well as to children adjudicated delinquent on a complaint, those paragraphs would preclude a judge from imposing a sentence provided by law on a \u201cyouthful offender,\u201d as \u00a7 58, third par., seems to contemplate. In short, the consequences of this dispute for the defendant are significant. The maximum penalty that may be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 58, eighth par., for a child who commits a second or subsequent violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>commitment to DYS custody until he reaches age twenty-one years, is considerably more lenient than the possible seven-year prison sentence that can be imposed \u201cby law\u201d for a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">To resolve these different claims we look to the plain language of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, seventh and eighth pars., that provides in relevant part that \u201ca person <em>adjudicated a delinquent child </em>by reason of a violation\u201d of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>{a), </em>(c) or <em>(d), </em>must be placed in the custody of a DYS facility for at least 180 days (seventh par.), and that on a second or subsequent violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, <em>\u201csuch </em>child\u201d must be placed in a youth services facility for not less than one year (eighth par.) (emphases added). There is no reference to a person adjudicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d on an indictment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Absent some contrary indication in the statute, the same words used in different parts of a statute enacted at the same time should receive the same meaning. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. 571, 573 (1989), citing <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Info. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978). In \u00a7 58, second and third pars., the Legislature established procedures and dispositional options for two categories of children who offend: \u201cdelinquent children\u201d (second par.) and \u201cyouthful offenders\u201d (third par.).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A \u201cdelinquent child\u201d is subject to essentially rehabilitative penalties and remedies, while a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d is subject to penalties ranging from placement in a DYS facility to adult sentences in the State prison. There is no reason to conclude that, when the Legislature used the term \u201cdelinquent child\u201d in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, seventh and eighth pars., enacted at the same time as the second and third paragraphs, it had some different, more encompassing category of children in mind.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The seventh and eighth paragraphs apply only to \u201ca person adjudicated a delinquent child,\u201d and not to \u201ca child adjudicated a youthful offender on an indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Our reading is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent to increase the penalties for children who offend firearms laws. The Legislature provided, of course, that children who <em>are </em>adjudicated as youthful offenders on indictment receive an even more severe penalty than those adjudicated delinquent on a complaint. The minimum penalty that a judge may impose on a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d who violates \u00a7 10 <em>(d), </em>\u201ca commitment to the department of youth services until he reaches the age of twenty-one,\u201d exceeds the maximum disposition allowed under \u00a7 58, second par., for a subsequent firearms offense by a child prosecuted by complaint. Section 58 is thus a logical continuum of prosecution and sentencing for young offenders: It authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the Commonwealth and, subsequently, a judge to estimate both the danger a particular child presents to the public, and the child\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation. That more lenient dispositions are available to a judge where the Commonwealth proceeds by complaint, and more severe where the Commonwealth proceeds by indictment, is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s twin goals of protecting the public from dangerous offenders, while emphasizing the rehabilitation of those children who pose a less serious risk to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We therefore conclude that a \u201cprevious adjudication of delinquency\u201d for a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), (c), or (if), as that term is used in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52-63, is a \u201cconviction\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(d). </em>We emphasize that our holding is a narrow one, limited to these specific statutory provisions. We adhere to our long-standing jurisprudence that an \u201cadjudication\u201d that a child has violated a law generally is not a \u201cconviction\u201d of a crime. See, e.g., <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>384 Mass. 784, 786 (1981). It remains the law that the goal of our juvenile system of justice is to act in the best interests of children by encouraging and helping them to become law-abiding and productive members of society, and not to label and treat them as criminals. See, e.g., <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 666-668 (1978).
