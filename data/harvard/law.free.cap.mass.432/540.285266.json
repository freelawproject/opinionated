L. c. 231A by the Museum of Fine Arts (MEA), seeking a declaration that the will of the late Reverend William E. Wolcott (Wolcott) does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>allow the defendants to sell any of the seventeen paintings that were bequeathed to a charitable trust. The record establishes the following relevant undisputed facts. Wolcott died in 1911. In his will, executed on June 20, 1907, Wolcott bequeathed seventeen paintings, including paintings by Eugene Boudin, Camille Pis-sarro, and Claude Monet, to the trustees of The White Fund (trustees), a charitable trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions of the bequest read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201c3. Whenever the pictures or any part of them shall come into the actual possession of the said Trustees, they shall offer the same for purposes of exhibition to the Museum of Fine Arts in the City of Boston, unless they shall determine otherwise in accordance with the discretion confirmed on them in the following paragraph:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201c4. If at the time of my decease or at any subsequent time there shall exist within the present limits of the city of Lawrence a public art gallery housed in a fire-proof building and under such management as the Trustees of the White Fund shall approve, the said Trustees may deposit the aforesaid pictures with such art gallery for purposes of exhibition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201c5. The ownership and control of the pictures shall be vested permanently and inalienably in trust nevertheless, as aforesaid, in said Trustees of the White Fund and their successors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201c6. My purpose in mating this bequest is to create and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly among the people of the City of Lawrence. And I give to the said Trustees of the White Fund full and absolute authority in any contingency not fully provided for in the above stipulations to take such action as they judge best fitted to serve the purpose described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In the years after Wolcott\u2019s death, the trustees came into possession of, and offered, the paintings to the MFA for exhibition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Currently, the MFA possesses all seventeen paintings, and regularly exhibits three of them. The remaining fourteen paintings are in storage, and the MFA does not plan to exhibit them in its galleries. The fourteen paintings held in storage are available, in certain circumstances, to be shown to persons interested in viewing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">After learning that the trustees wanted to sell some or all of the paintings, the MFA brought this action in the Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment, for purposes relevant here, that the terms of Wolcott\u2019s bequest do not permit the trustees to sell any of the paintings. The MFA moved for summary judgment, and the Attorney General, a necessary party to the litigation, see G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8, filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment. The trustees filed a memorandum in support of the Attorney General\u2019s motion. A Superior Court judge allowed the MFA\u2019s motion in part, concluding that the provisions of Wol-cott\u2019s bequest do not permit the trustees to sell the paintings. As to the Attorney General\u2019s claim that the primary purpose of the charitable trust created by the bequest was not being satisfied, and that the bequest should therefore be modified under the doctrines of cy pres or reasonable deviation, the judge concluded that (1) as to the three paintings currently exhibited, Wolcott\u2019s intent was being carried out; and (2) as to the fourteen paintings not being exhibited, a trial was necessary to decide whether the trustees should be allowed to sell the paintings through cy pres. She therefore denied the Attorney General\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), another judge in the Superior Court entered a judgment and reported the propriety of the orders to the Appeals Court. We allowed the defendants\u2019 applications for direct appellate review. We conclude that the MFA is entitled to summary judgment, that the bequest does not permit the trustees to sell any of the paintings, and that, as a consequence, a trial is not necessary. We shall direct that an appropriate declaration be entered in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">1. The trustees argue that, under the express terms of Wol-cott\u2019s bequest, they have the complete power to sell the paintings. They maintain that this power comes into play because Wolcott\u2019s intent, \u201cto create and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly among the people of the City of Lawrence,\u201d is not being fulfilled in any meaningful way by the exhibition of only three paintings at the MFA. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>pursuant to the \u201cfull and absolute authority\u201d conferred on them under paragraph 6 of the bequest, the trustees conclude that they are authorized to sell the paintings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">An effort to determine Wolcott\u2019s intent by extrinsic evidence is unnecessary because the provisions of the bequest are not ambiguous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, </em>378 Mass. 137, 144 (1979); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 782, 785 (1994). Paragraph 5 of the bequest states: \u201cThe ownership and control of the pictures shall be vested permanently and inalienably ... in [the] Trustees.\u201d The judge correctly interpreted the meaning of the words in this paragraph by the application of commonly accepted rules. See <em>Longy Sch. of Music, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pickman, </em>344 Mass. 511, 513 (1962), and cases cited. Contrary to the trustees\u2019 assertions, the judge did not \u201coverlook\u201d a secondary meaning of the term \u201cinalienable.\u201d The contention that Wolcott must have intended the word \u201cinalienable\u201d to be used in the bequest the same way as the word had been used in the Declaration of Independence is not persuasive. The judge properly concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018permanently and inalienably\u2019 in the will means exactly what it says \u2014 the Trustees are to have <em>permanent </em>possession and control of the paintings\u201d (emphasis in original). The bequest makes clear that the paintings may not be sold by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The trustees read too much into the discretion conferred on them by paragraph 6 of the bequest. While the provision grants to the trustees \u201cfull and absolute authority ... to take such action as they judge best fitted,\u201d that authority is expressly limited, and the power becomes operative only in the event \u201cany contingency [is] not fully provided for in the [earlier paragraphs or the bequest].\u201d The record establishes that no such contingency has yet occurred. As provided in paragraph 3, the MEA has accepted the paintings and regularly exhibits three of them. Although fourteen of the paintings are normally kept in storage, the MFA has not refused to make the paintings available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>exhibition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, although not required to do so, the MFA has continued to insure and protect the paintings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">2. We reject the defendants\u2019 argument that either the doctrine of cy pres or the doctrine of reasonable deviation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> should be applied to the bequest because it is impracticable or impossible to carry out its purpose. The defendants maintain that Wolcott\u2019s primary purpose was to promote fine art, particularly for the people of Lawrence. They assert this purpose is not being fulfilled because exhibition of only some of the paintings at the MFA does not benefit the people of Lawrence, and because there is little likelihood that an art gallery suitable to exhibit the paintings will be built, or can be acquired, in Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Wolcott\u2019s expressed general charitable intent was \u201cto create and gratify a public taste for fine art,\u201d through the auspices of the MFA, with a preference that the people of Lawrence enjoy the paintings. The inability to exhibit in Lawrence the three paintings currently on display at the MFA provides no support for the defendants\u2019 argument. Those paintings are on display in a manner that accords with the provisions of paragraph 3 of the bequest and Wolcott\u2019s general intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The current inability to exhibit the other fourteen paintings in Lawrence would not justify the application of cy pres or reasonable deviation to sell the paintings. A sale of the fourteen paintings would be the antithesis of Wolcott\u2019s intent because the sale could deprive the public of any opportunity to view them. There is information in the record suggesting that it might be possible to display some or all of the fourteen paintings at a gallery in Lawrence or at a fine arts center in nearby Andover. Besides these locations, there may be other suitable sites that are close enough to Lawrence to warrant loosening the geographic restrictions in the bequest to permit exhibition of some or all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>fourteen paintings. The record shows that the trustees have not made reasonable efforts to explore alternative locations for exhibition. Until such efforts are made, and are shown to be futile, there is no need for further proceedings on the issue whether cy pres would apply to allow sale of the fourteen paintings in storage. See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>361 Mass. 372, 376-377 (1972); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 279 (1992). The MEA seeks only a declaration that the paintings not be sold. On this record, it is entitled to that declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">3. The judgment entered on September 7, 1999, is vacated. Orders are to be entered in the Superior Court allowing the MFA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the Attorney General\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. A judgment is to be entered declaring that the doctrines of cy pres and reasonable deviation do not apply, and that none of the paintings held by the trustees that are the subject of the bequest can be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\"> The White Fund Trust was established in 1852 by Daniel A. White and is governed by an indenture of trust dated August 23, 1852. In 1982, The White Fund was incorporated under Massachusetts law as The White Fund, Inc., a charitable corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> The judge should have allowed the MFA\u2019s motion to strike the affidavit of Elizabeth Nordbeck and portions of the affidavit of Jock Reynolds. Nordbeck is the dean of the Andover Newton Theological School. She opined that Wolcott\u2019s bequest was intended to benefit the citizens of Lawrence and that he would have preferred that the paintings be sold. Reynolds is a museum director who opined that a sale of all or some of the paintings would not detract from Wolcott\u2019s purpose. The material in the affidavits stated inadmissible opinions concerning Wolcott\u2019s intent. See <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>BayBank Merrimack Valley, N.A., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 169, 176 (1983). See also <em>Colder </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>282 Mass. 231, 239 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> The MFA has exhibited these paintings in response to requests. In January, 1990, all the paintings were exhibited to persons from the Lawrence area. After the decision of the Superior Court, a Lawrence-based group hosted another visit to the MFA to see all the paintings. Further, the MFA allows the viewing of any painting in storage on request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> Under the doctrine of reasonable deviation, \u201c[t]he court will direct or permit the trustee of a charitable trust to deviate from a term of the trust if it appears to the court that compliance is impossible or illegal, or that owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him compliance would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 381 (1959).
