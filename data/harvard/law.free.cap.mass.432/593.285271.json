Sharpe was shot to death in her home in Wenham. Two days later her husband, Richard J. Sharpe (Sharpe), was arrested in New Hampshire in connection with her death and was returned to the Commonwealth. He has now been indicted for murder in the first degree, and violation of a protective order, G. L. c. 209A. The death of Karen Sharpe, the police manhunt for, and the arrest of Sharpe were widely reported. In the wake of these events, The Boston Herald, Inc. (Boston Herald); The Essex County Newspapers, Inc. (Essex County Newspapers); and WHDH-TV, Inc. (WHDH-TV) (collectively, the media interveners) sought access to impounded documents in the Sharpes\u2019 divorce action and a related abuse prevention injunctive action. A judge in the Probate and Family Court allowed their motions and unsealed all of the impounded records.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">On July 31, 2000, and August 1, 2000, the media interveners filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County petitions pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking review of an order of a single justice of the Appeals Court impounding some but not all of the disputed documents. A single justice of this court vacated the order and effectively unsealed the court records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sharpe takes the present appeal to the full court from her order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We hold that in the specific circumstances of this case the public has a right of access to all of the judicial records of the relevant court proceedings in the Probate and Family Court; the continued impoundment of the documents is not necessary to protect Sharpe\u2019s constitutional or other rights to a fair trial or to protect any privacy rights he may have.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">To elucidate his claims, and those of the media interveners, we describe summarily the actions in the Probate and Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Court that underlie this appeal, and the efforts of the media interveners to inspect the records of those proceedings. Richard and Karen Sharpe were married in 1973. In February, 2000, Karen Sharpe moved out of the marital home in Gloucester and, after some weeks, moved with their two minor children to a new home in Wenham. On March 9, 2000, Sharpe filed for divorce in the Probate and Family Court (divorce action). In May, 2000, at the request of Karen Sharpe, supported by her affidavit dated May 17, 2000, and after an ex parte hearing, a judge in the Probate and Family Court issued, in a separate action, an abuse prevention order against Sharpe under G. L. c. 209A (abuse prevention action). The record does not reflect whether the judge received any other evidence at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On May 30, 2000, the judge extended the abuse prevention order, by agreement. On June 12, 2000, the judge again ordered that the protective order be continued. Two additional affidavits of Karen Sharpe, dated June 9 and June 12, 2000, respectively, were filed in support of the continued protective order. We need not describe here the contents of those affidavits, except to note that they contain, generally, allegations of Karen Sharpe that her husband had verbally and physically abused her on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">By June, 2000, there were multiple outstanding disputes between the Sharpes in their divorce action concerning discovery, temporary visitation agreements, financial disclosures, and related matters. On June 12, 2000, they filed in both the divorce action and in the abuse prevention action a stipulation that resolved those disputes. The judge thereupon entered several orders. First, as noted above, he extended indefinitely the abuse prevention order against Sharpe. Second, he appointed a guardian ad litem for the minor children. Third, with the agreement of Sharpe, he allowed a motion of Karen Sharpe filed in the divorce action to impound that case file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge indorsed the motion as follows: \u201cMotion allowed, so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number></p>\n<p id=\"AaR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>vacated his impoundment order of June 12, 2000, adding that \u201c[t]o the extent\u201d the impoundment order was entered in the abuse prevention action, that order was also vacated. He ordered that the files in both actions be made available to the public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also denied Sharpe\u2019s motion to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On July 26, 2000, Sharpe sought review of that order pursuant to Rule 12 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par.,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> before a single justice of the Appeals Court. He claimed that his right to a fair trial outweighed the public\u2019s interest in access \u201cto pretrial documentation filed in a divorce action.\u201d He also asserted that the judge in the Probate and Family Court had failed to accord the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>propriate weight to his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to a fair trial, and to his privacy rights. A single justice of the Appeals Court allowed his motion in part: she ordered that Karen Sharpe\u2019s affidavits of June 9 and June 12, 2000, remain subject to the initial order of impoundment \u201cpending the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against Sharpe, or further order of court.\u201d She ordered that all other documents \u201cshall not be impounded.\u201d Sharpe filed an emergency motion for reconsideration and for leave to appeal to the full Appeals Court. On reconsideration, the single justice ordered the impoundment of a third affidavit (dated May 17, 2000). She denied his motion in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The three media interveners then filed in the county court the petitions described above.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A single justice of this court vacated the order of the single justice of the Appeals Court and reinstated the order of the Probate and Family Court, thereby unsealing all of the judicial records. This appeal by Sharpe from her order followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We clarify first the status in this appeal of the various documents subject to the initial blanket impoundment order entered on June 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">As noted above, on July 25, 2000, the Probate Court judge vacated the entire impoundment order. On Sharpe\u2019s petition to the Appeals Court, the single justice again impounded three affidavits of Karen Sharpe; she affirmed the Probate Court judge in all other respects. Only the media interveners sought review of her order pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, each specifying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>they sought relief only from the impoundment of the three affidavits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its petition the Boston Herald added that the \u201cremainder\u201d of the order of the single justice of the Appeals Court effectively released all other documents and \u201cthus that part of the order is not at issue in this petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">For his part Sharpe took no affirmative steps to seek review of any aspect of the order of the single justice of the Appeals Court; he did not file a petition before the single justice of this court, nor did he file a cross petition. In a memorandum in opposition to the petitions of the media interveners, he did argue that the June 12, 2000, blanket order of impoundment should be \u201creinstated.\u201d But an aggrieved party \u201cmay not secure modification of a judgment unless [he] has filed a cross [petition].\u201d <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 288 (1991), and cases cited. See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734 (1992); 15 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller &amp; E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3904 (1995).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have stated that generally \u201cfailure to take a cross [petition] precludes a party from obtaining a judgment more favorable to it than the judgment entered below.\u201d <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 43 n.5 (1977), and cases cited. An order of the single justice of this court to impound all of the documents would surely have been a judgment more favorable to Sharpe than the relief ordered by the single justice of the Appeals Court. She implicitly declined to consider Sharpe\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to impound the entire file.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> She was correct to do so, for \u201c[t]his is not that rare case in which a court should entertain such an argument . . . .\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra. </em>The case files of both actions in the Probate and Family Court, other than Karen Sharpe\u2019s three affidavits, are thus not subject to any impoundment order; they remain sealed only because of the stay entered by the single justice of this court. We review only her order releasing the three affidavits and do not address Sharpe\u2019s broader requests for relief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Because it is a recurring problem, we next discuss the correct procedure for litigants to follow when seeking appellate review, under the uniform rules on impoundment procedure, of trial court orders concerning impoundment, and we discuss the correct standards of review to be applied by an appellate court and a single justice at each stage of the process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The uniform rules on impoundment procedure describe a procedure by which a judge in any department of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>may impound or refuse to impound material or may modify or terminate an existing impoundment order. Rule 12 provides that an order \u201cimpounding or refusing to impound material\u201d shall be subject to review by a single justice of an appellate court. Rule 12 must logically be read to allow review not only of orders of impoundment or refusal to impound under the rules, but also of orders obtained under rule 10 that modify or terminate previously issued impoundment orders. Sharpe, therefore, properly sought review by the single justice of the Appeals Court from the July 25, 2000, order of the Probate Court vacating the initial order of impoundment. See G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The uniform rules do not specify the standard of review that a single justice of either appellate court is to apply when considering a matter under rule 12. We think it fairly clear, however, that a single justice must determine whether the lower court judge abused his or her discretion or committed an error of law in issuing the order concerning impoundment. Both before and after the promulgation of the uniform rules, this court has recognized that judges have discretion to impound court files in appropriate circumstances, and the court has reviewed impoundment orders to determine whether they constitute an abuse of discretion or are legally erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>403 Mass. 628, 629, 637-638 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1066 (1989); <em>H.S. Gere &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>400 Mass. 326, 329 (1987); <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, </em>395 Mass. 274, 277-282 (1985). See also <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>318 Mass. 156, 158 (1945). Cf. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>407 Mass. 879, 885-886 (1990). The single justice of the Appeals Court stated that the applicable standard of review was the abuse of discretion or error of law standard. None of the parties requested that she apply any other standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Once a single justice of an appellate court decides a matter pursuant to rule 12, the uniform rules make no provision for any further review. The rules thus do not authorize a party aggrieved by the single justice\u2019s decision to appeal as a matter of right to the full appellate court. Because no other remedy is expressly provided, an appropriate course for an aggrieved party to pursue in a case such as this, where a single justice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the Appeals Court has decided the rule 12 matter, would be to file a petition in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, as the media interveners have done here, seeking to invoke the court\u2019s general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Under that statute, a single justice of this court could grant relief from the decision of the single justice of the Appeals Court if the petitioner demonstrated an otherwise irremediable and substantial violation of its substantive rights. <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 706 (1990), and cases cited. While the focus of the petition should be on whether the single justice of the Appeals Court erred, the resolution of that inquiry might require the single justice of this court to look indirectly at the underlying order of the judge in the trial court, to see whether there was an abuse of discretion or error of law when evaluating the competing interests and issuing the order concerning impoundment that is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">An aggrieved party to a G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, proceeding may then, of course, appeal to the full court, as Sharpe has done in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The full court will reverse a single justice\u2019s judgment, however, only if he or she has made a clear error of law or has abused his or her discretion. <em>Department of Mental Retardation </em>v. <em>Kendrew, </em>418 Mass. 50, 53 (1994), and cases cited. <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 106 (1989). That is the traditional standard governing our review of judgments pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We have applied that standard even where constitutionally based claims are at stake. See, e.g., <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, post </em>1008 (2000) (due process); <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 1010 (1998) (double jeopardy); <em>Spero </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>424 Mass. 1017 (1997) (equal protection). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, ante </em>1, 7-10 (2000) (applying abuse of discretion or clear error of law standard to review single justice\u2019s order concerning media presence in court room in criminal case); <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>408 Mass. 595, 602-604 (1990) (applying traditional standard to review single justice\u2019s order concerning media access to tape-recorded witness statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>430 Mass. 545, 546 (2000), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 682 n.2 (1977), Sharpe contends that, because he raises issues of constitutional dimension, the single justice\u2019s granting of relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, should be \u201copen for independent review [by the full court] on appeal.\u201d Those cases were appeals involving challenges to orders suppressing evidence in criminal cases. In those cases we stated and applied the traditional standard of review for suppression rulings: an appellate court does not disturb a motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact that are warranted by the evidence, but conducts an independent review of the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and rulings of law, particularly those of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In cases such as this \u2014 appeals from judgments entered pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 \u2014 we have not applied the standard of review suggested by Sharpe. Indeed, the phraseology of that standard plainly indicates that it is suited to appellate court review of findings of fact and rulings of law made by judges in the trial court following evidentiary hearings. We decline to intermix that standard with the standard traditionally applied when we review judgments entered under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3: the abuse of discretion or clear error of law standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">As our analysis below indicates, however, even under the traditional G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, standard the full court must independently review a single justice\u2019s legal rulings to determine whether they are erroneous.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In conducting that type of review and making that type of determination, we, like the single justice, examine the competing legal rights (constitutional and otherwise) of the parties. No deference is given to the single justice\u2019s legal rulings or to the legal rulings of the probate judge. Thus it is inherent in the standard of review we apply, the abuse of discretion or clear error of law standard, that we independently determine and apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We turn now to the substance of Sharpe\u2019s claims. The uniform rules that now govern the impoundment of records in civil proceedings \u201cincorporate many of the principles of our prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>cases.\u201d <em>H.S. Gere &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>400 Mass. 326, 332 (1987). We interpret those rules in light of our long-standing recognition that \u201conly in the most extreme situations, if at all, may a State court constitutionally forbid.a newspaper (or anyone else) to report or comment on happenings . . . which have been held in open court; and a similar rule would apply to court files otherwise unrestricted.\u201d <em>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>372 Mass. 539, 547-548 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The principle of publicity of judicial records is not, however, absolute. See <em>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, supra </em>at 548 (\u201chow far a State is required to go in assisting the press [or others] to gather information [and] keep . . . files open\u201d is unclear). See also <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Warner Communications, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 589, 598-599 (1978). Courts possess supervisory power over their records and files, and have properly denied public access where those records and files \u201cmight have become a vehicle for improper purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We have explained that a court possesses \u201cinherent equitable power to impound its files in a case and to deny public inspection of them . . . when justice so requires.\u201d <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, </em>395 Mass. 274, 277 (1985), quoting <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>318 Mass. 156, 158 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Consistent with these principles, rule 7 of the uniform rules provides that a judge evaluating a motion to impound documents may enter an order of impoundment only if \u201cgood cause\u201d to withhold documents from the public is shown. To determine whether good cause is shown, a judge must balance the rights of the parties based on the particular facts of each case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Warner Communications, Inc., supra </em>at 599 (decision to grant access to court documents is \u201cbest left to the sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>discretion of the trial court\u201d to be exercised in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case); <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>403 Mass. 628, 638 (1988) (Wilkins, J., concurring), citing Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure (1988). See also <em>id. </em>(judge must balance interests of publicity and defendant\u2019s right to fair trial); <em>H.S. Gere &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Frey, supra </em>at 329 (judge must balance parties\u2019 privacy concerns against general principle of publicity).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If there is good cause to impound documents, a judge is required to tailor the scope of the impoundment order so that it does not exceed the need for impoundment. <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We consider first the public right of access to judicial records of G. L. c. 209A proceedings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> There is a well-established common-law right of access to the judicial records of civil proceedings. See <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Warner Communications, Inc., supra </em>at 597 (\u201cthe courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents\u201d [footnotes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>omitted]); <em>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, supra </em>at 546 (affirming \u201cwith emphasis\u201d general principle of publicity in the absence of statutory limitation on access to judicial records). The presumption of access facilitates \u201cthe citizen\u2019s desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies,\u201d permits the media to \u201cpublish information concerning the operation of government,\u201d <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Warner Communications, Inc., supra </em>at 598, and supports the public\u2019s right to know \u201cwhether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, supra </em>at 179, quoting <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 158 (1977). Access to otherwise unrestricted records of judicial proceedings may therefore be viewed as an essential component of the general principle of publicity: \u201cthe public often would not have a \u2018full understanding\u2019 of the proceeding and therefore would not always be in a position to serve as an effective check on the system\u201d if it were denied access to judicial records. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Pokaski, </em>868 F.2d 497, 502 (1st Cir. 1989). See <em>New Bedford Standard-Times Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Third Dist. Court of Bristol, </em>377 Mass. 404, 417 (1979) (Abrams, J., concurring) (\u201cgreater access to information about the actions of public officers and institutions is increasingly recognized as an essential ingredient of public confidence in government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In criminal cases we have used a two-part test to determine whether there is a constitutional right of access to judicial records: the proceedings must have \u201can historic tradition of openness,\u201d and the public\u2019s access must play \u201ca significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.\u201d <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 635, quoting <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986). The public interest in access to judicial records concerning domestic violence is at least as strong.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The \u201ctradition\u201d of public access to G. L. c. 209A would plainly satisfy the first part of that test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>407 Mass. 879, 884 (1990). (\u201cIn the absence of a statute, a rule of court, or a principle expressed in an appellate opinion authorizing or directing a courtroom to be closed, the expectation is that courtrooms will be open\u201d). And the affidavits submitted by an applicant for a protective order that essentially serve as a substitute for, or supplement to, the applicant\u2019s testimony in open court, have an \u201cintegral relationship\u201d with those proceedings. <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Affidavits filed in support of a domestic abuse protective order would also satisfy the second part of the test, for access to those records permits the public to assume a significant, positive role in the functioning of the judicial system. The media interveners properly note that it is of considerable importance for the public to be in a position to evaluate why an order may or may not have been successful in protecting a victim of domestic violence. Conversely, protective orders may impose significant restraints on defendants, and it is equally important that the public\u2019s understanding of and confidence in the judiciary be facilitated by knowing the basis on which a judge acted in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The presumption of public access to these affidavits also finds support in the statute itself. As the single justice noted, G. L. c. 209A contains two express provisions limiting public disclosure of identified portions of court documents: the impoundment of the address of the person seeking a protective order, on request, and the impoundment of the records of cases in which either the plaintiff or the defendant is a minor. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 8. In 1999, the Legislature amended the existing law to add new provisions to protect applicants from disclosing to their abusers and the public their addresses and telephone numbers.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Legislature did not include affidavits (or any other portion of the file) in the category of information that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>be impounded. We glean from this the Legislature\u2019s determination that, except as expressly provided, judicial records of G. L. c. 209A proceedings are presumptively open. Sharpe\u2019s reliance on <em>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>372 Mass. 539 (1977), is therefore misplaced. We concluded in that case that impoundment of confidential bank records was not an unconstitutional infringement of the media\u2019s right of access to records in a civil case, in light of the \u201cclear legislative design\u201d of G. L. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 2-7, that a financial institution should not be required to reveal certain confidential financial information. <em>Id. </em>at 549. There is no such legislative determination of confidentiality for G. L. c. 209A matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Against this \u201crigorous presumption of openness,\u201d as she correctly termed it, the single justice first balanced Sharpe\u2019s competing constitutional guarantee to a fair trial before an impartial jury. We see no error in her conclusion that his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not require impoundment of the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In balancing the public\u2019s right to inspect documents against a defendant\u2019s rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to a fair trial, a court may consider a variety of factors. These may include whether the information has already been disclosed, the nature of the documents under impoundment, or whether there are alternatives to withholding public access, such as a change of venue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 551 (1990); <em>H.S. Gere &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Frey, supra </em>at 330; <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, supra </em>at 278-279.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The public\u2019s right of access is strong in this case. We have already explained that the public has a powerful interest in monitoring G. L. c. 209A proceedings and judicial resolution of claims of domestic abuse. Moreover, even a brief delay of disclosure of judicial records in those proceedings may infringe on those rights. \u201cAs a practical matter ... the element of time is not unimportant if press coverage is to fulfill its traditional function of bringing news to the public promptly.\u201d <em>Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 561 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Sharpe\u2019s right to a fair trial, on the other hand, is \u201cundeni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ably a substantial government interest,\u201d and judges are charged with \u201can affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity.\u201d <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 632-633, quoting <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>DePasquale, </em>443 U.S. 368, 378 (1979). Relying on a statement in <em>In re Globe Newspaper Co., </em>729 F.2d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 1984),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Sharpe contends that his Sixth Amendment rights are presumptively preeminent. Pretrial publicity that may be occasioned by the release of the affidavits does not, however, necessarily trump the principle of publicity: \u201c[Pjretrial publicity \u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity \u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d <em>Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Stuart, supra </em>at 554.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Here, the disclosure of the affidavits will increase only marginally whatever prejudice against Sharpe may already exist: there have already been pervasive media reports of Sharpe\u2019s physical and verbal abuse of his wife. Whatever the source, or the merits of those reports, the disclosure now of three affidavits, the contents of which are largely repetitive, is unlikely to add much of anything to the risk of an unfair criminal trial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Sharpe suggests that, despite the previous media coverage, the release of the affidavits will be especially prejudicial to him because the new source of information carries the \u201cimprimatur of the Probate Court.\u201d He argues that potential jurors will also be biased by the emotional force of Karen Sharpe\u2019s own accusations. His concern \u2014 to the extent it has merit \u2014 is insufficient to tilt the balance in his favor. A document does not obtain greater validity merely because it is filed in court. The affidavits of Karen Sharpe might actually be viewed by potential jurors as self-serving, given the highly contentious nature of the Sharpes\u2019 divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The single justice properly pointed out that, to the extent the disclosure of the affidavits did create any additional media coverage, there are remedies available to the judge presiding over the criminal trial to minimize any prejudicial impact on Sharpe.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> History counsels that, in the face of significant hostile publicity surrounding a criminal case, jurors may be selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>who are capable of, and do, reach an impartial decision based solely on the evidence at trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 775-776 (1997) (aggravated rape and murder of young woman in public park by eight young men); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra </em>at 551 (murder of State trooper). That is the reason we recognize that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury does not require that jury members have no prior knowledge of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concern over pretrial publicity affecting the jury pool may be particularly acute where a homicide takes place in a small rural community. See, e.g., <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Ware Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 633, citing <em>Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court, </em>729 F.2d 1174, 1181 (9th Cir. 1983). That is not the case here. But if the judge at Sharpe\u2019s criminal trial determines that the jury pool in Essex County may be so tainted by pretrial publicity that Sharpe may not obtain a fair trial before an impartial jury, the judge has substantial discretion in deciding whether to order a change in venue. See Mass. R. Crim. R 37 (b) (1), 378 Mass. 914 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The judge at Sharpe\u2019s criminal trial may also conduct an individual voir dire of prospective jurors concerning their exposure to pretrial publicity to ensure that each juror is able to render a fair and impartial verdict. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, ante </em>1, 6 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, supra </em>at 776-777; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 368, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983); <em>Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court, supra </em>at 1179 (\u201cRecent highly publicized cases indicate that even when exposed to heavy and widespread publicity, many, if not most, potential jurors are untainted by press coverage\u201d). The trial judge may also give explicit jury instructions during the trial that command the jurors to accord weight only to the evidence admitted at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmariello, </em>392 Mass. 126, 139-142 (1984). Sharpe points to no specific factors that compel the conclusion that these and other remedies available to the trial judge will be ineffective or inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The single justice also correctly concluded that any privacy rights that Sharpe might claim did not warrant impounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>affidavits. When the subject matter of publicity is of legitimate public concern, as it is here, there is no invasion of privacy. See <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk </em>County, 395 Mass. 274, 278 (1985), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652D comment d (1977). This is particularly true where the relief a party seeks is the impoundment of documents after there has already been extensive media coverage of the individuals and events at issue, as occurred here. See <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, supra, </em>citing Restatement (Second) of Torts <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 652D comment b. It is also by no means apparent that Sharpe ever had any privacy rights concerning the affidavits, or that an order impounding Karen Sharpe\u2019s affidavits would have withstood a challenge at the time they were filed. The affidavits were, after all, the equivalent of testimony in an open judicial proceeding. Impoundment of judicial records is not warranted simply because the parties elect to keep certain information shielded from public view. Rule 7 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure. There is, therefore, no merit to his suggestion that his right of privacy should not be \u201cdiminished\u201d or \u201ctransform[ed]\u201d because the media thrust him onto the public stage after the death of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We may summarily dispose of Sharpe\u2019s contention that unsealing the affidavits will damage the privacy rights of his children. The two minor children have not contested the termination of the impoundment order, and made no claim before the single justice that their privacy interests will be damaged by further media coverage of the case. To the extent their views have been communicated through counsel representing the estate of Karen Sharpe, they apparently support termination of the impoundment order. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We remand this case to the single justice of the county court with instructions that she remand this case to the Probate and Family Court where judgment shall enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> We discuss in Part II, <em>infra, </em>which documents are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\"> Both the single justice of the Appeals Court and the single justice of this court entered a stay of their respective orders; all of the documents remain impounded pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> Rule 1 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure (West 2000) , provides that \u201c \u2018impoundment\u2019 shall mean the act of keeping some or all of the papers, documents, or exhibits, or portions thereof in a case separate and unavailable for public inspection.\u201d Contrary to the requirements of Rule 2 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure, Karen Sharpe\u2019s motion for impoundment was not \u201caccompanied by affidavit in support thereof.\u201d See note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-5\"> Rule 8 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure provides in part: \u201cAn order of impoundment, whether ex parte or after notice, may be made <em>only </em>upon written findings\u201d (emphasis added).
