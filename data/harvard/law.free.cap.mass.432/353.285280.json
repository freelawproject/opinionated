G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2. On appeal, he claims numerous errors that would warrant reversal of his convictions and requests relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. While his appeal was pending, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that was referred to the Superior Court and denied without a hearing. His appeal from that order has been consolidated with his direct appeal from his convictions. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and the order denying his motion for a new trial. We conclude that relief pursuant to G.

The other three men survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Earlier that evening, members of two Springfield gangs known as Los Solidos and the Original Family Organization (OFO), a subordinate group whose members aspired to membership in Los Solidos, gathered in the apartment of Sharleen Alvarez located on the fourth floor at 659 State Street. Los Soli-dos members present were the defendant, Luis Berrios, Victor Figueroa, Johnny Sanchez, Luis Concepcion, and David Jiles. OFO members present were Daniel Rodriguez (\u201cpresident\u201d of OFO and the Commonwealth\u2019s cooperating witness in this case), Michael Borden, Jason Jiles, and Sharleen Alvarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Commonwealth presented evidence that warranted a finding that the defendant was the \u201cchief enforcer\u201d of Los Soli-dos, responsible for taking care of the gang\u2019s guns, handling threats to the gang, and, during \u201cwartime,\u201d exercising control over the gang in cooperation with its \u201cwarlord.\u201d There was testimony that, on the date of the shootings, Los Solidos were in a state of \u201cwar\u201d with a rival gang, the Latin Kings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Rodriguez testified that, at some point that evening, Concepcion and David Jiles entered the apartment and told the group that members of the Latin Kings were at the KFC \u201cthrowing signs,\u201d which meant that they were disrespecting Los Solidos by displaying their hand signal. When some of those present urged retaliation, the defendant took charge, stating, \u201cEverybody just calm down. We going [szc] take care of this.\u201d He summoned Rodriguez, Borden, Jason Jiles, and Berrios into the bathroom, where he said, \u201cIf you can get those Kings, we got to do what we got to do.\u201d Jason Jiles responded that he would take care of it. The defendant then directed Rodriguez and Ber-rios to leave while he remained in the bathroom with Borden and Jiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Returning from the bathroom, the defendant told Rodriguez, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m gon\u2019 [szc] take care of it. Let me do my job.\u201d Jason Jiles, in the defendant\u2019s presence, picked up a .22 caliber semiautomatic handgun and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this.\u201d The defendant then instructed Jason Jiles to \u201c[g]et a hoody,\u201d referring to a hooded sweatshirt, which Jiles put on before leaving the apartment. Borden also left the apartment at this time, and when Rodriguez asked where he had gone, the defendant told him not to worry about it. Borden often carried a .38 caliber revolver. Rodriguez testified that, shortly thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Jason Jiles returned to the apartment and said, \u201cThose ain\u2019t Kings,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cThey Kings. They Kings. Go do what you got to do and take care of it.\u201d Jason Jiles again left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">There was testimony by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses about the events outside the apartment. Just prior to the shooting, Carlos Falcon and three companions had left the KFC. The three men were seated inside Falcon\u2019s automobile, and Falcon was standing at the rear of the vehicle. A man matching the description of Borden approached and, after a brief verbal exchange, shot the three men in the vehicle with a .38 caliber revolver, wounding them. Jason Jiles, approaching from the rear, shot Falcon once in the back of the head with a .22 caliber handgun, killing him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Jason Jiles and Borden then returned to the State Street apartment, where they were congratulated by the others. Los Solidos \u201cwarlord,\u201d Johnny Sanchez, complained loudly to the defendant that the shooting was a mistake because it could \u201cbring the heat down on us.\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cThey\u2019ll never figure this one out. Everybody just keep quiet.\u201d Portions of this exchange were overheard by Springfield police officers outside the apartment, who had responded to a report of the shooting. The police were admitted to the apartment by Sharleen Alvarez. Only Rodriguez was arrested at the time, on an outstanding warrant. The defendant was arrested approximately two months later when Rodriguez implicated him in the shootings in a statement to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. </em>In his opening statement, the prosecutor informed the jury that Rodriguez, a cooperating witness for the Commonwealth, had a criminal history, but had made no \u201cdeals\u201d with the Commonwealth in return for his testimony, and that he was no longer associated with gangs and now lived a \u201cstraight and narrow life.\u201d The defendant moved for a mistrial, which was denied. He argues that this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>error because the prosecutor had impermissibly vouched for Rodriguez\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">A prosecutor may not express a personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness or assert personal knowledge of the facts in issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, </em>397 Mass. 633, 642 (1986), and cases cited. See also Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.8 (h), (i), as appearing in 428 Mass. 1305 (1999). He may in general state in his opening anything that he \u201cexpects to be able to prove by evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 451, 454 (1978), and cases cited. The judge concluded, and we agree, that the prosecutor did not vouch for Rodriguez but merely \u201cpredict[ed] what the witness would say.\u201d This prediction was borne out at trial, as Rodriguez testified that the Commonwealth had made no promises to him to induce him to testify against the defendant, and that he had ceased his gang involvement and held steady employment at the time of trial. The judge properly exercised his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">3. <em>Witness confidentiality. </em>Prior to Rodriguez\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth moved, pursuant to G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 <em>(d), (h), </em>to prevent defense counsel from cross-examining him about his address, telephone number, and place of employment, because he feared retaliation by gang members against himself or his family. The judge ruled that defense counsel could ask Rodriguez whether he was engaged in an occupation other than selling drugs, but not his specific employment or his employment address, and whether he now lived in western Massachusetts or in Connecticut, but not his city of residence or residential address. He also prohibited defense counsel from investigating these matters. The defendant argues that the restrictions infringed his right to confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131 (1968); <em>Alford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 692-693 (1931). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"Arj\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>364 Mass. 243, 251 (1973), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>at 133-134 (White, J., concurring), we held that a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness about his current address and place of employment may be restricted when the judge determines that a threat to the witness\u2019s safety from disclosure of this information outweighs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the defendant\u2019s need for it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 545 (1974). Here, the judge properly concluded that the risk to Rodriguez\u2019s safety was \u201cinherent in the situation,\u201d thereby relieving the Commonwealth of its burden to demonstrate an actual threat to the witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, supra, </em>citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Daddano, </em>432 F.2d 1119, 1128 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 905 (1971). The judge then ascertained from defense counsel the defendant\u2019s need for information about the witness\u2019s current address and place of business, carefully weighed the defendant\u2019s interest in disclosure against the witness\u2019s interest in privacy, and concluded that the latter was sufficiently compelling to warrant the limitations described above. In all other respects, the defendant had \u201can open and meaningful opportunity to cross-examine\u201d the witness. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Vinzant, </em>528 F.2d 681, 685 (1st Cir.), cert. dismissed, 426 U.S. 902 (1976). By permitting general questions as to the witness\u2019s home State and employment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge sought, and found, a compromise that allowed sufficient disclosure while minimizing any danger to the witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">4. <em>Cross-examination of the defendant, </em>(a) The defendant testified at trial, and now claims that it was error for the judge, to permit the prosecutor to question him about an incident that occurred approximately five weeks after the shootings: the defendant had been arrested and indicted, but subsequently acquitted by a jury, on the charge of possessing a firearm without a firearms identification card. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h). </em>Defense counsel objected repeatedly to the cross-examination concerning this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Commonwealth conceded at oral argument that it was er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ror for the judge to allow the prosecutor to question the defendant about his alleged unlawful possession of a firearm; its relevance to the charges against the defendant was tenuous and was substantially outweighed by its potential to suggest the defendant\u2019s criminal propensity. On review of the record, we are convinced, however, that this error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994) (preserved non-constitutional error). In response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, the defendant denied that he had possessed a handgun, and told the jury that he had been found not guilty on the charge, responses that served to minimize the prejudicial impact of the improper questions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>375 Mass. 380, 388 (1978), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 541 (1971). The judge then terminated the prosecutor\u2019s questioning when he asked the defendant about his arrest for this alleged misconduct. The prosecutor did not raise the matter again, and did not argue it in closing. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 646-647 (1997). During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, the judge instructed the jury that a witness\u2019s negative response to a leading question from counsel supplies no evidence for their consideration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>426 Mass. 395, 403 (1998). Both during the cross-examination and again in his final charge, the judge instructed the jury that, because the defendant had been found not guilty of the charge, they were required to find that he had, in fact, not possessed a gun as alleged. We presume that the jury followed these instructions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997), effectively negating any prejudice to the defendant. The judge properly exercised his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">(b) The defendant argues that it was error to permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>prosecutor to question him about an incident that occurred shortly after the shootings, in which he was stabbed, and to call a Springfield police officer to rebut a particular aspect of the defendant\u2019s testimony about the stabbing incident. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The permissible scope of cross-examination rests largely in the sound discretion of the judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>408 Mass. 185, 192 (1990). During cross-examination, the defendant first mentioned the stabbing to explain why he had left Los Solidos shortly after the shootings; he initially characterized the altercation that resulted in his injury as a \u201cgang fight.\u201d He subsequently denied that there was any ongoing conflict between Los Solidos and the Latin Kings around the time of the shootings, and when the prosecutor recalled the stabbing incident, the defendant claimed not to know who had stabbed him or whether it was gang related. The prosecutor then impeached the defendant with a statement he previously had made to police in which he had identified his assailant as a Latin King. Defense counsel objected, and the judge curtailed any further inquiry about this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The defendant opened the door to cross-examination on the issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>426 Mass. 589, 595-596 (1998). Moreover, his initial assertion that he had been stabbed in a \u201cgang fight\u201d made the circumstances of the stabbing relevant to subsidiary facts at trial as it was probative of the existence of a state of \u201cwar\u201d between Los Solidos and the Latin Kings. His subsequent denial of any knowledge of those circumstances or the identity of his assailant made his prior inconsistent statement to police relevant for impeachment purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 219 (1984). There was no abuse of discretion in allowing the prosecutor to inquire as far as he did about the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Nor was it error to allow the police officer to testify in rebuttal. Rebuttal evidence on a collateral matter may be admitted to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>425 Mass. 349, 355 (1997), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zezima, </em>365 Mass. 238, 242 n.5 (1974), <em>S.C., </em>387 Mass. 748 (1982). The judge allowed the prosecutor to call the Springfield police officer who had taken the defendant\u2019s statement about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>stabbing for the limited purpose of rebutting the defendant\u2019s claim that the police had \u201cbullied\u201d and \u201cpressured\u201d him into making the statement, as he had testified. The rebuttal testimony \u201ctended to cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s credibility because it created a basis from which the jury might infer that because the defendant\u2019s testimony [as to the voluntariness of his statement about the stabbing] was not accurate, other portions of his testimony also might be inaccurate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury-Ehrhart, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 434 (1985). It was, moreover, the defendant\u2019s denial of any knowledge of his assailant that prompted the Commonwealth to offer the rebuttal witness. The rebuttal testimony, brief and restricted in scope, was not likely to confuse the jury, and there was no unfair surprise to the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 107 (1982). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">(c) The Commonwealth filed a pretrial motion to introduce in evidence statements given to the police by Jason files, who had previously been tried and convicted as a principal on this homicide. In these statements, in addition to confessing his own role in the crime, files inculpated the defendant and reported numerous incriminating statements the defendant allegedly made the night of the shootings. The Commonwealth argued that the statements, although hearsay, were admissible because made by files against his penal interest. The judge deferred ruling on the motion; he subsequently informed the prosecutor that he doubted that files\u2019s statements were admissible. The Commonwealth did not call Jason files at trial and did not offer his statements in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">When cross-examining the defendant, however, the prosecutor used files\u2019s statements, asking the defendant whether, when files returned to the apartment and reported that the men at the KFC were not Latin Kings, he recalled telling files to go \u201c[l]ight up the car.\u201d The defendant denied making the statement. The prosecutor then asked the defendant whether he was aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>files had given a statement to police, to which the defendant responded affirmatively. The prosecutor then repeated the question about \u201clighting] up the car.\u201d Although defense counsel did not object, the judge, sua sponte, called for a bench conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The judge admonished the prosecutor that, while he had a right to cross-examine about statements that he had a good faith basis to believe the defendant had made, that basis could not be supplied by files\u2019s statements to police, which had been excluded from evidence. The judge remarked that it was plain to him, and likely also to the jury, that papers the prosecutor was holding were files\u2019s statements. The prosecutor did not dispute this observation nor did he challenge that files\u2019s statements had been excluded, but argued that tlieir contents furnished him a good faith basis for inquiring about the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements. The judge appeared to accept this argument, ruling that the prosecutor could ask the questions, provided that he conceal from the jury any appearance that he was relying on files\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defense counsel did not object, but the following day moved for a mistrial on the grounds, inter alia, that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to inculpatory statements that had been attributed to the defendant solely by fason files, a codefendant who had not testified, violated the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional right of confrontation, citing <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415 (1965). The judge denied the motion. The prosecutor proceeded, over objection, to ask the defendant six additional questions based on files\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge then interrupted and barred the prosecutor from asking any further questions based on the contents of files\u2019s out-of-court statements, restricting him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>inquiring about matters that were abeady in evidence through the testimony of other witnesses. On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that these questions infringed his right of confrontation under both the Sixth Amendment and art. 12.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It was improper for the prosecutor to cross-examine the defendant about incriminating material that derived exclusively from the inadmissible extrajudicial statements of a separately tried codefendant who did not testify at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra </em>at 419-420. See also <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Small, </em>371 F.2d 793, 794-795 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1033 (1967) <em>(.Douglas </em>error where prosecutor, by using statement of unavailable witness, \u201cindirectly but effectively brought to the jury\u2019s attention the substance of a statement that was not in evidence and, therefore, not subject to cross-examination\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 505-508 (1992) (witness\u2019s testimony as to incriminating portions of a nontesti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>fying codefendant\u2019s statement that the defendant had not adopted violated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra). A </em>confrontation clause violation, to which there is objection, is subject to review for harmless error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 509 n.11, citing <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 223 (1973). Although this is a close case, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s use of Jiles\u2019s statements did not result in unfair prejudice warranting reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">With respect to the first improper question, referring to the statement, \u201cGo light up the car,\u201d the defendant did not timely object,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and our review is, therefore, limited to determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s use of this statement created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 509. It did not. Although the attributed statement was relevant to the defendant\u2019s guilt as an \u201caccessory before the fact,\u201d it was cumulative of Rodriguez\u2019s lengthy testimony that portrayed the defendant as the man in charge on the night of the shootings. Rodriguez also told the jury of several incriminating statements the defendant made while encouraging and counseling the principals to commit the crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 510-511 (cumulative nature of evidence conveyed through improper question minimizes likelihood of miscarriage of justice). See also <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 A.2d 399, 411 (D.C. 1986) (no prejudicial <em>Douglas </em>error where statements in prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>improper questions \u201cdid not constitute \u2018the only direct evidence\u2019 \u201d against defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Additionally, this statement did not receive significant attention during the trial. The prosecutor asked a total of seven questions that referred to the contents of files\u2019s statements, only four of which appear to have had those statements as their exclusive foundation. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The defendant answered each, including the first, with a denial. In the course of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant (albeit on another subject), the judge interrupted and instructed the jury that a leading question on cross-examination that receives a negative response from a witness does not constitute evidence for their consideration, an instruction he repeated in his final charge. The prosecutor did not refer to files\u2019s statements in his closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jiles, </em>428 Mass. 66, 75 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 642 (1997) (in evaluating whether improperly admitted evidence creates substantial likelihood of injustice, we attach \u201c \u2018great weight\u2019 to the fact that the \u2018the jury\u2019s attention was not in any way focused on [that evidence]\u2019 \u201d). Thus, we are \u201csubstantially confident\u201d that, had this question not been asked, the juiy\u2019s verdict would not have been different. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The defendant timely objected to the three additional questions based exclusively on files\u2019s out-of-court statements. We must, therefore, determine whether the error in allowing these questions was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 162, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998) (preserved constitutional error). One of these questions asked whether the defendant recalled files telling him he had \u201cducked\u201d the gun into the woods after the shootings. This did not refer to any incriminating statement made by the defendant, but rather to files\u2019s own self-incriminating utterance after he committed the crime. No prejudice could have resulted from this question, as it did not bear on any aspect of the defendant\u2019s criminal liability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, </em>405 Mass. 634, 643 (1989), citing <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986) (factors for harmless error review include \u201cthe importance of the improperly admitted testimony to the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">With respect to the remaining two questions (i.e., did the defendant recall asking files what he did with the gun and tell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ing Jiles not to answer his telephone or pager after the shootings), it is important to our analysis that the defendant was charged and convicted as an \u201caccessory before the fact\u201d to murder and various felony assaults. G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2. Under the terms of the judge\u2019s clear and forceful instructions to the jury, only the defendant\u2019s conduct <em>prior </em>to the shootings (before the fact) was relevant to the offenses with which he was charged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both improper questions, however, recited statements the defendant allegedly made <em>after </em>the crimes had been committed; neither had the effect of suggesting that the defendant had counseled or procured Jiles or others beforehand to commit the shootings. This is not a case where improper questions referring to inadmissible evidence \u201cbore on a fundamental part of the State\u2019s case against [the defendant].\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra </em>at 420. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Moreover, while the jury could properly have considered these two attributed statements as evidence of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt \u2014 inasmuch as they suggested an effort to conceal the crimes, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 829 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 215 (1994) \u2014 in this regard the statements were cumulative of the testimony of Rodriguez, who testified that the defendant had instructed the other gang members in the apartment to keep quiet about the shootings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, supra </em>at 643 (cumulative nature of improperly admitted evidence relevant to determining whether error harmless). The prosecutor\u2019s use of these statements when the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine his codefendant and test his credibility thus did not \u201cadd[] critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra. </em>Bearing in mind the devastating testimony of Rodriguez, an eyewitness to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>actions, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s improper use of these statements did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">5. <em>Discharge of deliberating juror. </em>At the beginning of the deliberations the judge was informed that a member of the jury, later identified as juror 5-2, wished to speak with him about her inability to remain impartial. In the presence of the defendant and his counsel, the judge conducted a voir dire of the juror, who linked her inability to remain impartial to \u201cwhere [she] live[d],\u201d more precisely, to the fact that there were gang members in her neighborhood and that this made her \u201cafraid\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d She testified that she had not told other jurors that her fear arose from gang issues, but only that she was afraid to render a verdict due to the neighborhood where she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">After reviewing our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838 (1984), the judge conducted a further voir dire of the juror, again in the presence of the defendant and his counsel, this time asking specifically whether \u201c[she had] a personal problem that\u2019s not related to the other jurors or [her] relationship with them or to [her] views on the case.\u201d She responded that her only problem was that the case \u201chas to do with gangs,\u201d that this made her fearful, and that this problem was personal to her and unrelated to her views on the evidence in the case. The judge then inquired whether she wished to be discharged. When she answered in the affirmative, the judge, pursuant to G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B, and Mass. R. Crim. R 20 (d), 378 Mass. 889 (1979), discharged her for \u201cgood cause,\u201d substituted an alternate juror, and instructed the jury that the reason for the juror\u2019s discharge had nothing to do with her views on the case or her relationship with her fellow jurors and that they were to begin their deliberations anew. Defense counsel timely objected to the juror\u2019s discharge and moved for a mistrial, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 26B, provides that if, at any time after a case has been submitted to the jury and before the jury have agreed on a verdict, a juror \u201cdies, becomes ill, or is unable to perform his duty for any other good cause shown to the court,\u201d the judge may discharge the juror, substitute an alternate selected by lot, and permit the jury to renew their deliberations. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 20 (d). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>supra </em>at 844-846, we concluded that \u201c \u2018[g]ood cause\u2019 includes only reasons personal to a juror,\u201d that is, reasons unrelated to the \u201cissues of the case,\u201d the juror\u2019s \u201cviews on the case,\u201d or \u201chis relationship with his fellow jurors.\u201d In order to safeguard a defendant\u2019s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury, the judge must carefully scrutinize the reasons offered for discharging a juror at this critical stage of trial \u201cto ensure that a lone dissenting juror is not permitted to evade [the] responsibilities\u201d of his oath or to avoid the stress associated with persistently asserting a minority position in deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 846. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 722 n.15 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The judge adhered scrupulously to the procedural safeguards delineated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 843-846.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>id. </em>at 846; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 935 (1991). Moreover, we are satisfied that the record adequately supports the judge\u2019s finding that the juror\u2019s reason for seeking discharge was personal to her and unrelated to her views on the case or her relationship with her fellow jurors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Having heard the juror\u2019s testimony about the nature and source of her difficulty, the judge characterized her fear as the product of her residential surroundings coupled with \u201cthe nature of this case,\u201d and distinguished this latter from her views on the case, the issues it raised, or the evidence presented at trial. While this is, admittedly, a fine distinction, we think it neither untenable nor merely semantic. Although there was considerable evidence during trial about the organization and behavior of street gangs, nevertheless (as the judge clearly instructed the jury) such evidence was relevant only as it bore on the defendant\u2019s state of mind or motive for acting; the defendant\u2019s gang membership was not itself a triable issue in the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>about which the jury were required to make a finding. Moreover, at jury empanelment, the judge inquired whether prospective jurors had experiences with, or feelings about, gangs that would affect their ability to remain impartial, and he excused one juror who responded affirmatively. It is likely that the judge had this very inquiry in mind when he identified the \u201cnature of this case\u201d as one source of the juror\u2019s difficulty, and we conclude that, as a juror\u2019s expression of fear and potential prejudice would have furnished a sufficient basis for excusing her prior to trial, see G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, as well as during trial but prior to deliberations, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 505-507 (1999), it was reasonably considered \u201cgood cause\u201d for discharging her after deliberations had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Additionally, we note, as did the judge, that during the course of the trial juror 5-2 twice failed to appear and had to be escorted to the courthouse by police. Commenting on how \u201cupset\u201d she appeared to be, the experienced judge was in a superior position to observe and assess the juror\u2019s demeanor on voir dire. We will not disturb this assessment on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 794-795 (1977). Finally, the juror sought to be discharged on the first day on which the jury actually deliberated the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The timing of her request makes it unlikely that the jury were at an impasse or that the juror\u2019s difficulty was caused by stress associated with being a hold-out juror. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 874 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 846. In these circumstances, the juror\u2019s inability to perform her function as an impartial trier of fact for reasons entirely personal was a \u201cdemonstrable reality.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 846-847, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>17 Cal. 3d 687, 696 (1976). The judge did not abuse his discretion in discharging her.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">6. <em>Extraneous influences. </em>The defendant maintains that on three separate occasions the judge erroneously refused to conduct an individual voir dire of jurors regarding their possible exposure to extraneous influences. He also claims error in the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial based on one such refusal. When a judge determines that the jury may have been exposed during the course of trial to material that \u201cgoes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>he should conduct a voir dire of jurors to ascertain the extent of their exposure to the extraneous material and to assess its prejudicial effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, 376 </em>Mass. 790, 800 (1978). \u201cThe facts of the specific case are important,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, </em>422 Mass. 614, 616 (1996), and we review the judge\u2019s procedure for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 799. We conclude, with respect to each of the defendant\u2019s claims of extraneous influence, that the judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing to conduct a voir dire of the other deliberating jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">(a) While the judge was deciding how to proceed with respect to juror 5-2, defense counsel requested an individual voir dire of the other jurors to ascertain if they had been exposed to this juror\u2019s expressions of fear and concern about gangs. The judge declined to address the matter until the issue of juror 5-2 had been resolved. Defense counsel did not thereafter renew his request for a voir dire on this issue until the day after the juror\u2019s discharge. The judge again declined, stating that such an inquiry would be more harmful than productive. Even treating counsel\u2019s request for a voir dire as timely and the issue as properly preserved for appeal, it was not error to deny the request. Juror 5-2 testified that, although she had expressed her fear to the other jurors, she had not discussed its basis other than to say that it was related to \u201cwhere [she] live[d].\u201d Later, after the juror had been discharged, the judge recalled her and specifically inquired whether she had discussed her fears with any of the other jurors, which she denied. There was, therefore, no basis for the judge to infer that juror 5-2 had been a source of any extraneous influence on the remaining jurors, let alone that her statements raised a serious question of possible prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, supra </em>at 616-617 (individual voir dire of jurors properly conducted where, after judge had purged trial of any reference to gangs, one juror told others during deliberations that she knew defendant, knew he was gang member, thought him guilty, and was afraid to walk up street).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">(b) On the second day of deliberations, a juror reported to the judge that the previous evening a number of jurors had been filmed by a television camera and watched by two young men in the parking lot as they left the courthouse. The juror, in response to the judge\u2019s question, stated that the incidents had not made her nervous about sitting on the case. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>did not ask for a voir dire of the jury at this time, but later requested renewed inquiry of this juror and a voir dire of the other jurors concerning the two men who had observed them. The judge refused, concluding that this procedure could impair the jury\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the juror\u2019s report to the judge, recounting a brief and innocuous incident involving two unidentified male observers, plainly did not \u201craise[] a serious question of possible prejudice,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the judge\u2019s refusal to conduct a voir dire of the jury was a proper exercise of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">(c) On the morning of the third day of deliberations, the judge, following his regular practice, polled the jurors regarding, inter alia, their exposure to extraneous material, including newspaper coverage of the trial and \u201cparticularly . . . the Springfield Union News.\u201d Each juror, in turn, answered that he or she had complied with the judge\u2019s instructions the previous evening to avoid such media accounts of the trial, and the jury resumed deliberations. Defense counsel thereafter provided the judge two articles from the previous day\u2019s Springfield Union News \u2014 one concerning the discharge of juror 5-2, the other a memorial for the murder victim, Carlos Falcon \u2014 and moved for an individual voir dire of the jurors and a mistrial on grounds of extraneous influences. The judge denied the motions, stating that all members of the jury had just indicated their full compliance with his instructions, which specifically required them to avoid exposure to that particular newspaper, and that a voir dire on the matter was potentially harmful to deliberations. Clearly, having just determined that the jury had not been exposed to the extraneous influences in question, the judge properly exercised his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">7. <em>Denial of motion for a new trial. </em>When Michael Borden was arrested approximately thirteen months after the defendant\u2019s convictions, he gave two statements to the police, in which he did not name the defendant as having been present in Sharleen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Alvarez\u2019s apartment on the night of the shootings. He also gave a statement to a private investigator working for the defendant in which he claimed not to have seen or heard the defendant in the apartment. In all three statements, he identified Luis Berrios as the person who committed the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendant. While the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, he moved for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. R 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), claiming newly discovered evidence and submitting Borden\u2019s statements, along with affidavits from his appellate counsel and private investigator, as supporting evidence. The motion judge, who did not preside at the defendant\u2019s trial, denied the defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing, from which the defendant appeals. The discretionary decision to deny a motion for a new trial will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust or the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999), and cases cited. Neither ground for reversal is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In a carefully reasoned memorandum of decision, the motion judge ruled that Borden\u2019s statements, not being in the form of sworn affidavits,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> did not comply with Mass. R. Grim. R 30 (c) (3), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), had no corroborating circumstances or other indicia of trustworthiness that would render them admissible as declarations against penal interest, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Charles, 428 Mass. 672, 677, 679-680 (1999), and constituted, therefore, inadmissible hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 258 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 381 (1992). Alternatively, he reasoned, even if Borden\u2019s statements were admitted in evidence, numerous factual discrepancies rendered them inherently unreliable, such that they failed to raise a \u201csubstantial issue\u201d necessitating an evidentiary hearing, Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), or to establish that a new trial was warranted in the interests of justice. Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986). Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of these reasons independently constitutes a sufficient basis for the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">With respect to the latter basis for denial, we note, as did the motion judge, that Borden\u2019s statements to the police and private investigator contradict one another concerning events in Alvarez\u2019s apartment the night of the shootings, and also contradict the defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial concerning his presence in the apartment that night. Moreover, these statements contradict the admission Borden made under oath when entering his plea of guilty to charges arising out of the shootings, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>in which he expressly agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s statement of facts that identified the defendant as the person who instructed him and Jason Jiles to commit the crimes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The numerous discrepancies and contradictions in Borden\u2019s various statements about the crimes illustrate that an affidavit of a nontestifying codefendant subsequently offered in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is the \u201cweakest sort of evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 385 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>370 Mass. 746, 752 (1976). The judge acted within his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">8. <em>Section 33E review. </em>We have reviewed the entire record of the defendant\u2019s trial, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>and conclude that neither a reduction in the jury\u2019s verdict nor an order for a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\"><em> A </em>defendant convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree is entitled to review under G.

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>379 Mass. 456, 469-470, vacated sub nom. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>449 U.S. 809 (1980), appeal dismissed, 382 Mass. 690 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Rodriguez testified on direct examination that he was now employed as a cook and that, since he had begun cooperating with the police, he had had no further gang involvement, had not lived in Springfield, and had not sold drugs.

As a matter of Federal constitutional law, collateral estoppel does not bar the government in a criminal prosecution from introducing evidence from a separate prosecution on unrelated charges in which the defendant was acquitted. See <em>Krochta </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 711, 716-717 (1999), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Felix, </em>503 U.S. 378, 386 (1992), and <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 348-349 (1990). We have not previously considered whether the Massachusetts Constitution affords greater protection to criminal defendants in this regard. See <em>Krochta </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 718 n.14. Because we have concluded that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>was inadmissible pursuant to our law of evidence, we do not reach this constitutional issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that there was unfair surprise because the typewritten statement he made to the police was not provided to his counsel until the morning of the defendant\u2019s testimony. The judge repeatedly denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to introduce the typewritten report itself in evidence, and limited the prosecutor to questioning the defendant about whether he had given a statement to the police and what he had said about the stabbing and his attacker\u2019s identity. The defendant had access to this evidence independent of the police report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> The additional questions were (2) did the defendant recall asking Jason Jiles after the shootings what he did with the gun; (3) did he recall Jiles telling him he had \u201cducked\u201d the gun into the woods behind the apartment; (4) did he recall telling Jiles after the shootings not to answer his telephone or pager; (5) did he recall telling Jiles, \u201cThem are Kings. Them are Kings. Get back down there. Go do what you gotta do. Go take care of it\u201d; (6) did he recall Jiles\u2019s having changed his clothes after the shootings; (7) did David Jiles and Luis Concepcion come into the apartment and inform him of Latin Kings at the KFC. Of the seven questions asked by the prosecutor, two dealt with matters that were also testified to by Rodriguez (questions 5 and 7); the defendant himself testified about another (question 6). These three questions, therefore, were not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>412 Mass. 318, 327-328 (1992) (not improper to cross-examine defendant about matters testified to by others, provided that defendant not asked to comment on credibility of another witness). Thus, only four of the prosecutor\u2019s seven questions about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>matters contained in Jiles\u2019s statements are at issue here, the initial question regarding \u201clight[ing] up the car\u201d and questions 2-4 above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> The defendant makes no claim that the right of confrontation under art. 12 affords greater protection than the Sixth Amendment and we do not address this issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 568 n.9 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> The record does not indicate whether the judge made a final ruling on the admissibility of Jiles\u2019s statements. The prosecutor, however, was clearly aware that the judge considered the statements inadmissible, and the Commonwealth concedes on appeal that the statements had been excluded from evidence. The statements, which were offered as exceptions to the rule of hearsay exclusion as statements made by Jiles against his penal interest, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>373 Mass. 617, 623 (1977), would properly have been ruled inadmissible. Although they contained self-incriminating material and were generally against Jiles\u2019s penal interest, the statements clearly sought to shift blame to the defendant and others while exonerating Jiles or minimizing his own role in the crimes. Those portions of Jiles\u2019s statements inculpating the defendant thus lacked corroborating circumstances that would minimize the \u201chazards of fabrication or unreliability,\u201d and would not satisfy the test for admission as statements against a declarant\u2019s penal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 622. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. 672, 679 n.2 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>397 Mass. 275, 280-281 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopera, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 137 (1997). Additionally, absent \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980), the admission in evidence of Jiles\u2019s extrajudicial confession inculpating the defendant when Jiles was unavailable for cross-examination would have implicated and violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 126-128, 135-137 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 569 (1987) (claimed <em>Bruton </em>error addressed in context of separate trials of codefendants); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, supra </em>at 280 n.7. See also <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 134-139 (1999) (plurality opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\"> Although defense counsel, prior to trial, asserted the \u201cconfrontation clause\u201d as a barrier to the admission of Jiles\u2019s statements in evidence, this objection was raised ten days before the prosecutor asked this first question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 508-509 (1992) (defendant\u2019s objection during voir dire of witness two days before witness testified at trial, where defense counsel was himself uncertain about admissibility of testimony, insufficient to preserve claim of confrontation clause violation for appeal). Moreover, the defendant did not object when the prosecutor asked the question, or when he repeated it; the judge, sua sponte, interrupted and questioned the prosecutor about the propriety of his tactic. Not until the next day did the defendant move for a mistrial, arguing a confrontation clause violation. Thereafter, he objected to all questions put by the prosecutor that appeared to be based on Jiles\u2019s statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagano, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 59 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1089 (2000), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>343 Mass. 130, 135-136 (1961) (where defense counsel objected to last two of five questions asked by prosecutor, objection not timely with respect to the earlier three questions). Cf. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 420-423 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> The judge instructed the jury that liability as an accessory before the fact requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant counseled, hired, or procured the commission of a felony by persons who actually committed the criminal acts and that he shared their intent. He further instructed them that \u201cto counsel\u201d means to urge, encourage, advise or order a person to do an act and \u201cto procure\u201d means to bring the act about and, at the request of defense counsel, gave a supplemental instruction distinguishing an accessory before the fact from a joint venturer on the ground that the latter must be proven to have been present at the crime when it was committed and willing to assist. Moreover, the defendant was not tried as a conspirator or joint venturer, and any evidence of postshooting conduct among the various participants in these crimes was not directly relevant to the offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s procedure was defective, because he discharged juror 5-2 without a hearing and without making adequate findings to support his determination that the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement had been satisfied. The record does not support this assertion. The judge conducted a voir dire of the juror in accordance with the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 845 (1984). He then inquired of the two court officers who had contact with the jury, determining that neither had any information relevant to the juror\u2019s problem. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 769-770 (1979). The judge expressly concluded that the juror\u2019s problem was fear and that it was a personal matter unconnected to her views on the case or on the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> After charging the jury the previous day, the judge, owing to the lateness of the hour, immediately suspended deliberations until the following day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> This request was not timely, and our review is, therefore, limited to determining whether there was error that created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 669 (1982) (motion for mistrial based on extraneous influence, brought one day after incident, held untimely). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 797 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> The judge, at the request of defense counsel, had inquired of juror 5-2 whether she was one of the jurors who had been in the parking lot the previous evening, which she denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> Borden\u2019s statement to the private investigator, while it is labeled \u201caffidavit,\u201d contains the phrase \u201cI. . . swear,\u201d and is signed by both Borden and the investigator, was not verified by an oath before a magistrate or a notary public, nor does it affirm that Borden signed under the pains and penalties of perjury. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1A. The motion judge, therefore, correctly ruled that it was not an affidavit. See <em>O\u2019Brion, Russell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>LeMay, </em>370 Mass. 243, 245 (1976); <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Winchester, </em>369 Mass. 175, 177 (1975), citing <em>Murphy, petitioner, </em>321 Mass. 206, 213 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> Borden indicated some disagreement with the Commonwealth\u2019s statement of facts concerning his and Jason Jiles\u2019s respective roles in the shootings, prompting the prosecutor to restate and clarify these facts before the judge accepted Borden\u2019s plea. None of these disputed facts, however, concerned the defendant\u2019s role in directing Borden and Jiles to commit the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
