L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A); (2) indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B); and (3) unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun (G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>c. 269, \u00a7 10 [c]). On March 5, 1998, a jury convicted the defendant on all three indictments. On appeal, the defendant contends that prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient evidence warrant reversal. In an order and unpublished memorandum pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">1. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On September 28, 1995, Bonnie Jean Brault, the defendant\u2019s wife, discovered two photographs, one of which depicted a man\u2019s arm touching the genital area of a young female. Brault identified the arm in the inculpatory photograph as her husband\u2019s, and the female in the photograph as the defendant\u2019s then eight year old niece.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brault also identified certain details from the photograph, such as the couch, a sheet, her niece\u2019s blanket, and her husband\u2019s bathrobe. After showing the photograph to the niece\u2019s mother, Brault brought the photograph to the police who subsequently searched the defendant\u2019s home. The search revealed a sawed-off shotgun measuring one-quarter inch less than the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">At trial, three sorts of photographs were entered in evidence. The Commonwealth first introduced the photograph depicting the victim and the perpetrator\u2019s arm (inculpatory photograph). Then, for comparison purposes, the Commonwealth introduced various photographs depicting the defendant (and his arm) taken years prior to the arrest (prearrest photographs), and those photographs of the defendant (and his arm) taken by the police after his arrest (postarrest photographs). The Commonwealth employed the prearrest and postarrest photographs to exhibit the distinctive contour and hairiness of the defendant\u2019s arm. The Commonwealth also produced an expert in female genital development who testified that, based on the features depicted in the inculpatory photograph, the subject was under the age of eleven and one-half years. The defendant denied the allegations and accused his wife of manufacturing the evidence in order to retain custody of their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">2. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">a. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument twice referred to facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>not supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant objected to this line of argument. Thus, \u201c[wjith respect to each challenge, we consider the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the context of [the] entire argument, the evidence at trial, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 564 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987) (whether prosecutor\u2019s alleged error went to \u201cheart of the case\u201d or limited to collateral issues bears on propriety of closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant \u201cdid something\u201d to change the appearance of his arm was improper. To the extent differences existed between the arm depicted in the inculpatory photograph and the defendant\u2019s arm as depicted in prearrest and postarrest photographs, contrary explanations were offered. The defendant claimed the dissimilarities proved he had no part in the criminal act, that the arm in the inculpatory photograph was not his. The prosecution countered that the defendant altered the appearance of his arm in an attempt to conceal his culpability. Although a hair and fiber analyst confirmed that the defendant\u2019s arm hair had been neither cut nor dyed, she could not necessarily rule out the use of a \u201cdepilatory like Nair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u201cWe have never criticized a prosecutor for arguing forcefully for a conviction based on the evidence and <em>on inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the </em>evidence\u201d (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. 378, 391-392 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pontes, </em>402 Mass. 311, 315 (1988) (no finding of improper argument where evidence warranted inference). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 726 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994). Given the defendant\u2019s stance that the apparent differences between the prearrest and postarrest photographs prove the arm was not his, the Commonwealth\u2019s comments were reasonably \u201cwithin the prosecutor\u2019s right of retaliatory reply.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>407 Mass. 927, 939 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>385 Mass. 625, 633 (1982). There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Good, </em>409 Mass. 612, 626 (1991) (prosecutor\u2019s argument, including consciousness of guilt, proper given reasonable inference from evidence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Second, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant \u201chad to get his arms photographed\u201d is not supported by the record. Rather, it appears the defendant voluntarily consented to the photographing. Although this inaccuracy is regrettable, it does not constitute reversible error in the entire context of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cosme, </em>410 Mass. 746, 755 &amp; nn. 6, 7 (1991) (minor \u201cmisstatements\u201d and \u201cmischaracterizations\u201d did not warrant reversal). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>401 Mass. 731, 735 (1988). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 683 (1987) (no reversal for prosecutor\u2019s \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d where judge instructed jury that closing arguments not evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">b. <em>Omission of victim\u2019s name on indictment. </em>The defendant contends that it was prejudicial error for the Commonwealth to assert that the victim was the defendant\u2019s niece where the underlying indictments referred only to an unnamed \u201cchild.\u201d However, \u201ca defendant is not to be acquitted on the grounds of variance between the allegations and proof if the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless he is thereby prejudiced in his defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>375 Mass. 138, 139 (1978). Here, the name of the victim is not an essential element of the crime. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35 (\u201cimmaterial misnomer of third party\u201d does not warrant acquittal). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, </em>373 Mass. 839, 843 (1977). Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the defendant cannot claim prejudice. The grand jury minutes repeatedly referred to the defendant\u2019s niece (and only remotely suggested another possible victim). A number of factors strongly suggest that the defendant had sufficient notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that it was his niece in the inculpatory photograph. Prior to any legal proceedings, the defendant learned of the inculpatory photograph and its content from his sister. More than two years prior to trial, the grand jury heard extensive testimony as to the identity of the girl in the inculpa-tory photograph. The defendant\u2019s wife and foster daughter claimed it was the defendant\u2019s niece, although the niece\u2019s parents disagreed emphatically. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s opening argument explicitly countered the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d theory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 649 (1980). Absent a showing that the Commonwealth\u2019s theory surprised the defendant to his prejudice, the convictions stand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 871 (1982) (no prejudice where defendant \u201ccould not have been surprised\u201d by variance); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, supra </em>at 647 (no prejudice absent \u201cpersuasive contention . . . that the defendants were surprised by a development at trial\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the bill of particulars failed to provide adequate notice of the charges fails for similar reasons. Although the bill of particulars omitted any reference to the defendant\u2019s niece, it placed the alleged conduct in a narrower time frame than the indictment and directed the defendant\u2019s attention to the \u201cGrand Jury minutes [and] police reports,\u201d thereby providing adequate notice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 233-234 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 157, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mass. 60, 68-70 (1999) (improper for Commonwealth to pursue conviction on murder theory other than that set forth in bill of particulars).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">3. <em>Knowledge of Victim\u2019s Age.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In order to convict a defendant of posing or exhibiting a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in a state of nudity, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant had \u201cknowledge that [the victim] is a child under eighteen years of age or [was] in possession of such facts that he should have reason to know that such person is a child under eighteen years of age.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A. Notwithstanding expert testimony that the girl in the inculpatory photograph was \u201cin all likelihood under eleven and a half [years old], probably younger than that,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove he <em>knew </em>the victim was under eighteen years of age. Because the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty encompassed this argument we consider \u201cwhether the evidence received, viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient so that the jury \u2018might properly draw inferences . . . and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>411 Mass. 345, 349-350 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 588-589 (1983). Adhering to these principles, the record supports the conclusion that the defendant knew or had reason to know the victim\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The jurors could reasonably have inferred that the girl depicted in the inculpatory photograph was the defendant\u2019s niece. Such a conclusion is supported by the presence of the niece\u2019s blanket in that photograph. The defendant\u2019s sister testified that her daughter (i.e., the defendant\u2019s niece) had \u201cseveral fluffy, woollyish blankets,\u201d including a \u201cspecial\u201d one that she mistakenly left at the defendant\u2019s home when she visited in August, 1995. One Commonwealth witness added that the girl \u201ccarried it with her everywhere she went.\u201d Where two witnesses identified the girl\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d blanket in the inculpatory photograph, the jury could have inferred that the victim was in fact the defendant\u2019s niece. On the basis of this circumstantial evidence, the additional inference that the defendant knew or should have known his eight year old niece was younger than eighteen years was similarly warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Even if the jury concluded the victim was someone other the defendant\u2019s niece, the defendant\u2019s constructive knowledge of the age of the victim could be gleaned from the inculpatory photograph itself. Based on certain physical characteristics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>observable from that photograph, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert concluded that the victim was \u201cin all likelihood under eleven and a half [years old], probably younger than that.\u201d Physical appearance may be considered as a factor in discerning age. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittman, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>98 Mass. 6, 8 (1867). Because, \u201cjudging age on physical appearance is a guess and a guess is not a basis for sending someone to jail,\u201d the finder of fact may rely entirely on physical appearance to determine age only in cases involving \u201cmarked extremes of old age and youth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittman, supra </em>at 28. Here, the difference between the sexual development manifested by, at most, an eleven and one-half year old girl (as per the expert\u2019s opinion) and that of the statutorily prescribed eighteen year old is sufficiently \u201cextreme\u201d to sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">4. <em>Knowing Possession of Illegal Sawed-off Shotgun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">While searching the defendant\u2019s home, the police found a sawed-off shotgun with a barrel measuring seventeen and three-quarters inches. General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10 (c), prohibits the possession of a sawed-off shotgun, defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as \u201cany weapon made from a shotgun ... if such weapon as modified has one or more barrels less than 18 inches in length.\u201d Based on the measurements, the grand jury returned an indictment that defendant \u201cdid knowingly and unlawfully own, possess or carry on his person a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN . . . without being the holder of a valid license to carry firearms.\u201d At trial, the jury convicted him of the charge. The defendant contends that the conviction is not warranted without proof that he \u201cknew\u201d the weapon was shorter than the statutory limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Although knowledge is an essential element of each crime, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennefield, </em>373 Mass. 452 (1977), the Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant knew that the physical characteristics of the firearm he possessed (such as barrel length) rendered it subject to regulation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>383 Mass. 750, 762-763 &amp; n.16 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>374 Mass. 358, 360-361 (1978) (contrasting scienter in gun and obscenity cases). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Papa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 987, 987-988 (1984). Where, as here, the jury could have inferred that the defendant knew a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>firearm was in his possession, his ignorance vis-a-vis that firearm\u2019s dimensions is not a valid defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\"> The female\u2019s face was concealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> In her closing argument, the prosecutor invited the jury to compare the prearrest and postarrest photographs and stated: \u201cAre they the same arms? I suggest not, ladies and gentlemen. When he found out that <em>he had to come </em>and he had to get his arms photographed, he did something. You heard the expert. He didn\u2019t cut it. He didn\u2019t dye it. <em>But he did something. </em>And I asked her, \u2018If a person uses a depilatory like Nair . . . would you have noticed anything on examination under the microscope?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 I asked her about shaving. \u2018Not necessarily.\u2019 Use your common sense ladies and gentlemen. Look at the photograph prior. Look at the photograph after. <em>I suggest the only conclusion is something happened.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> \u201cExtraevidentiary remarks in closing arguments are normally adequately neutralized by a timely curative instruction and a general reminder that arguments of counsel are not evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>420 Mass. 226, 234 (1995), and cases cited. In light of the judge\u2019s repeated instructions that the closing arguments do not constitute evidence, any damage to the defendant was sufficiently repaired. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>400 Mass. 355, 359 (1987), <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 96 (1989) (any impropriety during final arguments adequately remedied through judge\u2019s instruction to jury). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>411 Mass. 120, 122 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> We note that, had the defendant not submitted voluntarily to the photographing of his arm, a judge surely could have ordered it. Given that possibility, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant \u201chad to get his arms photographed,\u201d is less damaging.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, </em>294 Mass. 273, 277-279 (1936), is misplaced. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, supra </em>at 278, we held the Commonwealth\u2019s amendment of an indictment was not error where the \u201camendment did not change the substance of the crime charged\u201d and still \u201crequired the defendant to answer for the murder of a particular man and no other.\u201d Given the unamended indictments in the case before us and the notice provided to the defendant, <em>DiStasio </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> The niece was eight years old in August, 1995, the time of the alleged incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
