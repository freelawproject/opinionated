Perry appeals. On appeal, the defendant claims that his motion for required findings of not guilty should have been allowed on both indictments. He also alleges error in the (1) admission of his statements to the police, (2) admission of hearsay evidence, (3) exclusion of expert testimony, (4) denial of his right to be present at a \u201ccritical stage[] of the proceeding!],\u201d and (5) admission of his statements to the police despite an alleged violation of his right to make a telephone call pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s convictions should be affirmed. We have reviewed the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and conclude that the interests of justice do not require the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt on the murder conviction or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">1. <em>Facts. </em>\u201cWe summarize the facts as the jury could have found them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain facts for discussion in conjunction with other issues.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>427 Mass. 740, 741 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. 152, 153 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985). Because the defendant argues that his motion for a required finding at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence should have been allowed, we summarize the evidence presented in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>A. <em>The defendant\u2019s acts. </em>In the autumn of 1994, the victim and the defendant traveled from Massachusetts to Arizona. The victim had attended special education classes and had participated in the Special Olympics. He was a talented cartoonist and the two men hoped to start a tattooing business. This enterprise never materialized, and, by December, the two returned to Massachusetts looking for a place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant and the victim spent approximately ten days with a friend, Wendy Poirier, and her fianc\u00e9, Danny Nauman. At that time, the victim weighed approximately 230 pounds. Although the defendant and the victim were friendly before the trip to Arizona, Poirier said that, by the time they moved in with Poirier, the defendant \u201chad become [verbally] abusive to [the victim], making very rude comments to him [and] calling him names.\u201d Poirier observed the defendant punch and push the victim several times. According to Poirier, the victim \u201ccower[ed] in the comer\u201d in response to these beatings. One day, Poirier observed the defendant bum a cigar into the victim\u2019s forehead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Poirier then told the defendant and the victim that both of them would have to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The defendant and the victim went to stay at the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s two-story family home. Also residing at the home were the defendant\u2019s three brothers, Leon, Richard, and Roger Perry. The defendant\u2019s mother and brothers were the lessees of the home. The defendant was not a signatory on the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">During the second week of December, Frank Parker, who did not know the Perrys, was with friends of the Perry family. The group stopped at the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. The defendant, the defendant\u2019s mother, Richard, and Roger were present. The defendant called the victim, who was on the second floor, to come downstairs. The defendant asked the group whether they wanted to \u201csee something funny.\u201d According to Parker, the victim \u201clooked like he had been beaten before.\u201d Parker said that the defendant delivered several \u201c[c]losed fisted punch[es] to the [victim\u2019s] temple.\u201d The victim begged the defendant to stop the beating. After several punches, the defendant told the victim to go upstairs, which the victim did.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Throughout December, 1994, a number of individuals witnessed other incidents at the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>friend of the defendant, Michelle King, saw the defendant and Nauman roughhousing with the victim. King said that this behavior escalated until the defendant was \u201cpunching at [the victim] and . . . shaking him around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On another occasion in December, 1994, King, Poirier, Nau-man, and the defendant were talking. Poirier and Nauman hinted to the defendant that the victim had betrayed some confidence of the defendant. Both the defendant and the victim were wanted by the police on outstanding warrants, and the defendant was concerned that the victim might betray him. The next day, King observed that the victim\u2019s \u201cface was bruised\u201d and \u201cswelled out, [and] all sorts of different colors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">By Christmas, the victim, who, according to Poirier, had been \u201ca very outgoing person,\u201d had become \u201cvery quiet and withdrawn.\u201d Around Christmas time, Laura White, another acquaintance of the Perry family, noticed that the victim\u2019s tongue was burned. The defendant told her that \u201cthey held [the victim] down on the kitchen floor and put a butter knife in the flames of the gas fire, and burnt [the victim] with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">By the end of December, White, who had taken courses with a view toward becoming a licensed practical nurse, noticed that the victim had \u201cseveral bums on his arms\u201d and that \u201che had been beaten. . . . [H]e had a black eye and his face was a little swollen.\u201d She treated the victim\u2019s burns with salve. The defendant told White that the victim also had a burn on his penis. Poirier, who saw the victim at the end of December, noticed through the victim\u2019s shirt that the victim also had a large bum on his shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">During the second week of January, 1995, Frank Parker once again accompanied friends who stopped by the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. The defendant\u2019s brothers, his mother, and his cousin, Clinton Maynard, all were present. Maynard was beating the victim by \u201cslamm[ing]\u201d the victim neck first onto the floor. The defendant joined Maynard and each of them took turns beating the victim. One of the two men held the victim so as to keep his neck exposed, and the other man used his outstretched arm to hit the victim across the neck. The defendant used his arm, which was in a brace, to beat the victim across the neck. The victim begged the two men to stop. According to Parker, the beating continued for \u201ca good half hour to [forty-five] minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Parker also said that, on this occasion, the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Maynard placed keys between their fingers and raked the keys across the victim\u2019s head so as \u201cto draw blood and rip his scalp open.\u201d In addition, the defendant used a bicycle chain wrapped in tape as \u201cbrass knuckles,\u201d punching the victim above the left eye and opening a wound approximately one inch around.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">That evening, Parker also saw the defendant and Maynard take the victim into the bathroom, where they scrubbed him with household cleaners. The victim was screaming, while the defendant and Maynard laughed. When the victim came out of the bathroom, he had cuts and bruises all over his face. During one of Parker\u2019s two visits to the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, the defendant told Parker that, if Parker went to the police, he (Parker) would \u201cend up floating in the river and nobody would be able to do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On February 14, 1995, White, who had treated the victim\u2019s bums in December, again visited the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home and asked to see the victim. The defendant went upstairs and returned with the victim. White observed that the victim \u201chad been beaten severely.\u201d According to White, \u201c[h]is face was swollen almost to a pumpkin size. It was purple. His . . . left eye was almost completely swollen shut. . . . His jaw looked . . . [n]ot centered on his face.\u201d The victim\u2019s arm appeared to be broken because it was \u201cpulled in and kind of twisted down.\u201d There was blood coming from the victim\u2019s ears, nose, and the side of his mouth. His hands were tied, and he smelled as if he had not showered for some time. White also noted that the victim appeared to have lost a significant amount of weight. White asked the defendant if she could look at the victim\u2019s arm. The defendant said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In February or March of 1995, Melissa Terry, another acquaintance of the Perry family, visited the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. The victim, who typically was upstairs during Terry\u2019s visits, called downstairs, saying that he was naked and had to go to the bathroom. Terry testified that the defendant\u2019s mother shouted back, \u201cI\u2019m not in charge of you\u201d and that \u201cFreddy [the defendant] was.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim attempted to come down the stairs. The defendant, Roger, and Maynard chased the victim back up the stairs. Terry heard a \u201cbunch of noise\u201d and then heard the victim crying and saying that he was bleeding. This went on for ten to fifteen minutes, during which time Terry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>heard the men \u201claughing, like it was real funny to them.\u201d That night, the police came to the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home looking for the defendant and the victim. According to Terry, the defendant\u2019s mother told the police that the two men were still in Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">White also testified that, on one of her visits to the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s household, the victim \u201cwas beaten\u201d and his wrists were tied up so as to force him to hold a coffee can in his hands. The defendant used the coffee can as a tobacco spittoon, occasionally missing the can and spitting on the victim. When some amount of liquid had accumulated in the can, the defendant forced the victim to drink it, which caused the victim to vomit. The defendant repeated this process several times while White was present. The victim asked to call his mother, but the defendant told him, \u201cNo.\u201d On one of her visits to the Perry household, White told the defendant that \u201cif he kept beating [the victim] like that, that [the victim] was going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">B. <em>The defendant\u2019s </em>confession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of evidence, State police Troopers Francis Hart and Thomas Nartowicz testified to the contents of the defendant\u2019s oral and written confessions. Although the defendant attempted to place the primary culpability on Maynard and Nauman, the defendant described beating the victim and noted that, at one point, the victim\u2019s \u201cface was all busted up and he couldn\u2019t eat.\u201d The defendant admitted that he \u201cbeat [the victim] pretty good a few times\u201d and \u201ckicked him with [his] work boots probably more than [he] should have.\u201d The defendant also admitted to hitting the victim with a \u201cclub of wood\u201d and with \u201cdumbbell bars.\u201d When the troopers asked the defendant about his and Maynard\u2019s reactions to the beatings, the defendant responded that \u201cthey laughed a few times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The defendant told the police that Maynard \u201ctied and gagged [the victim] to the weight bench, and that [the victim] was gagged several times.\u201d The defendant also admitted that he administered electric shocks to the victim using a frayed electrical cord.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that, although Maynard initiated this incident, they \u201call had to try that, because [Maynard] said it was fun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The defendant told the troopers that he had been aware that the victim was losing weight. According to the defendant, the victim died toward the end of March or beginning of April, 1995. Before the victim died, the defendant also noticed that the victim \u201cwas pretty weak.\u201d The defendant admitted to the police that he \u201cslapped\u201d the victim on the evening on which, according to the defendant, the victim died. The defendant claimed that he also heard Maynard \u201cslap\u201d the victim later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">When the defendant discovered the victim had died, he, his brothers Richard and Roger, and Maynard took the body, wrapped it in a blanket, and secured it with coat hangers. They put the body in the back of a van, along with weights, a cement block, and an old vise, to weight the body down. They then drove the body to a quarry in New Hampshire which appeared \u201cpretty deep\u201d and left the body there.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">C. <em>Physical evidence. </em>The body was discovered in a shallow pool in a New Hampshire quarry on May 23, 1995. The body was wrapped in blankets, with weights and other heavy objects attached, as the defendant described in his confession. The body had deteriorated significantly because of the damp conditions, but the medical examiner was able to determine that the victim suffered the following injuries while still alive: a fractured jaw resulting from a \u201cvery, very powerful blow to the face\u201d; a bruise with a laceration around the mouth; a bruise on the cheek; two black eyes; considerable bruising of the lower extremities; blunt force trauma to the knees; bruising from blunt force injury to the buttocks; considerable bruising on the arms suggesting that the victim \u201cwas trying to fend off blows\u201d; fractured bones in the left hand, resulting from \u201ccrushing blunt force\u201d; and a portion of skin removed from part of his back. The medical examiner could not ascertain whether a number of additional injuries had been inflicted antemortem or post mortem, including two scalp irregularities, one of which was consistent with being scraped with a key; a \u201cflaying wound\u201d or, in popular parlance, a partial \u201cscalping\u201d; blunt force trauma to one foot; and the partial amputation of at least one finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The medical examiner noted that the victim would have had difficulty chewing food with the jaw injury. Based on the medical examiner\u2019s estimation of the victim\u2019s weight at the time of death, the victim had lost approximately one hundred pounds between December, 1994, when the beatings began, and his death. The medical examiner could not determine with certainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the final act that caused the victim\u2019s death, but his testimony was that the cumulative effect of the beatings and starvation led to the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In addition to medical testimony, the jurors heard the testimony of police officers who searched the house at which the beatings of the victim took place, as well as the house to which the Perrys moved shortly thereafter. The police found bloodstains on the wallpaper and floor of an upstairs bedroom, bloodstained scissors, weights, and an electrical cord with severed ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence on murder charge. </em>The Commonwealth requested that the charge of murder in the first degree be submitted to the jury on theories of individual and joint liability. Because the jurors returned a general verdict of guilt on the conviction of murder in the first degree, we review the sufficiency of the evidence under both theories.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>420 Mass. 810, 811 (1995). We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the conviction of murder in the first degree was insufficient both under theories of joint and individual liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 [emphasis in original omitted]. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>[378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979)], quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). See Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). . . . \u2018[I]t is not necessary to prove that no one other than the accused could have performed the act.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 175 (1980). However, \u2018[t]he question of guilt must not be left to conjecture or surmise.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 312 (1985).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">A. <em>Malice aforethought. </em>Under both joint and individual liability theories of murder in the first degree with extreme atrocity or cruelty, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant acted with malice aforethought. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 719-720 (1996) (under joint venture theory, \u201cthe Commonwealth must show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>defendant shared with the principal the mental state required for the crime of murder. . . . The mental state required for murder is malice aforethought\u201d). The defendant claims that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the requisite mens rea. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cMalice aforethought may be shown by proof that the defendant, without justification or excuse, intended to kill the victim. Malice aforethought may be inferred if, in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra </em>at 720. The defendant\u2019s use of deadly weapons in beating and electrocuting the victim supports the reasonable inference that the defendant intended to cause death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>428 Mass. 383, 388 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wil<em>liams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 121 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra. </em>Common sense dictates these acts created a plain and strong likelihood of death. See <em>id. </em>at 720, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 848 (1990) (for proposition that \u201cdefendants should have known as vicious beating progressed that victim could suffer death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In addition, the defendant was told by Laura White that, \u201cif he kept beating [the victim] like that, that [the victim] was going to die.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe jury could reasonably have concluded that [the defendant\u2019s] intention was to inflict injury and that this intention was coupled with an awareness that [there was a plain and strong likelihood that] death might result from the injuries he participated in inflicting. Under the third prong of malice, the jury could infer that \u2018in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow [from his] act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra </em>at 720, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 437-438 &amp; n.3 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>419 Mass. 350, 353 (1995) (\u201cSpecific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>intent, therefore, could have been established by the defendant\u2019s repeated infliction of serious physical injuries\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. <em>Proximate cause. </em>(1) <em>Joint venturer liability. </em>The defendant claims that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that (1) he acted as a joint venturer and (2) the acts of the joint venturers were the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Where multiple assailants participate in a joint venture to commit murder, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth [is] not required to prove the precise conduct of each [individual] if there [is] evidence that a [homicide] took place.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 367, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111 121 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. 262, 268 (1994) (\u201cDirect evidence of who shot the victim[] \u2018is not required where, as here, there is strong circumstantial evidence that one of the [assailants] shot\u2019 the victim[]\u201d). Rather, the Commonwealth\u2019s burden is to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [1] was present at the scene of the crime, [2] with knowledge that another intended to commit a crime, and [3] by agreement was willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra </em>at 719. \u201c[M]ere presence at the commission of the wrongful act and even failure to take affirmative steps to prevent it do not render a person liable as a participant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 708 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant was present, knew about, participated in, and rendered aid to the joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra. </em>Witnesses saw the defendant act in concert with Maynard and others \u2014 taking turns holding and beating the victim. The defendant participated with Maynard in electrocuting the victim. The evidence also showed that, when outsiders came into the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, various members of the family would block the opening to the area of the house where the victim was kept. The defendant assisted his brothers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Maynard in disposing of the body. Evidence that the defendant assisted in \u201cavoiding] detection and detention\u201d and \u201cattempt[ed] actively to conceal evidence\u201d warrants the inference that he continued to be involved in the joint venture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. 848, 863 (2000). These facts support submission of the case to the jurors on the theory that the defendant was engaged in an ongoing joint venture with others to inflict brutal and potentially fatal injuries on the victim over an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence also sufficed to show that the acts of the joint venturers were the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. To be sufficient on the issue of proximate cause, the evidence must warrant the inference that these acts were such that they, \u201cin the natural and continuous sequence, produce[d] the death, and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rhoades, 379 Mass. 810, 825 (1980), quoting California Jury Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 8.55 (4th rev. ed. 1979) (defining proximate cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The evidence suggested several possible causes of death. The cause of death was listed on the death certificate as multiple blunt and sharp force injuries applied over time, to the head, torso, and extremities. The medical examiner said that, after completing his inquiry into the cause of death, his \u201csupposition\u201d was that the victim \u201cdied of lung infection [which was] a direct consequence of the stress, pain, inability to eat and other factors, including hemorrhage, as a final, overall effect of all of those injuries.\u201d The medical examiner also said that some of the wounds, if left untreated, could have caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The evidence showed that the defendant and his coventurers participated in repeated and severe beatings of the victim, often applying potentially deadly force; that the defendant participated in the incident during which the victim\u2019s tongue was burned with a butter knife; and that the defendant and Maynard repeatedly hit the victim across the neck. These facts warrant the inference that the defendant and his coventurers caused blunt force trauma to the victim, caused the victim\u2019s inability to eat, and caused the victim to experience \u201cstress\u201d and \u201cpain.\u201d Because the foregoing were cited by the medical examiner as causes of the victim\u2019s death, the evidence sufficed to permit the jurors to determine whether the defendant, as a participant in a joint venture, caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The defendant notes that the medical examiner\u2019s testimony indicated that the victim may have died of pneumonia. According to the defendant, the Commonwealth\u2019s proof on the proximate cause issue fails because of this intervening cause. We do not agree. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s acts need not be the sole or exclusive cause of death.\u201d <em>Comonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 503-504 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 298, and 428 Mass. 39, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1003 (1998). Where a defendant causes an injury which, along with other contributing factors or medical sequella of the injury, leads to death, jurors may determine that the defendant\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of the injury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>403 Mass. 575, 582 (1988) (that extreme cold also contributed to death does not relieve defendant of responsibility); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanetzian, </em>350 Mass. 491, 492-495 (1966) (defendant\u2019s conviction affirmed where operation on gunshot wound caused by defendant led to peritonitis and three additional operations; where cause of death was determined to be \u201cintra-abdominal abscesses, broncho-pneumonia, and left empyema due to gunshot wound\u201d; and, where autopsy could not \u201cpositively exclude\u201d chronic bronchitis as cause). Here, the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that any pneumonia would have been caused directly by the beatings and abuses sufficed to show that the acts of the defendant and his coventurers were the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth was required to prove that a particular beating or beatings caused the victim\u2019s death and that the defendant was present at such beatings. The flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is his assumption that each violent incident was an independent joint venture. The various beatings and abuses inflicted on the victim were not independent crimes or ventures producing independent effects: the acts constituting the crime were the multiple abuses and beatings which had the cumulative effect of causing the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">(2) <em>Individual liability. </em>The defendant claims that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>monwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that, on a theory of individual liability, he caused the victim\u2019s death. In support of this claim, the defendant asserts that the Commonwealth failed to show that a specific act of his caused the victim\u2019s death. Along these same lines, the defendant asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that the victim\u2019s death was not caused by the intervening act of a third party, such as Maynard or one of the defendant\u2019s brothers. The defendant also argues that the Commonwealth did not produce evidence sufficient to show that the defendant harmed the victim between February and the time of the victim\u2019s death at the end of March or beginning of April. Each of these arguments fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The Commonwealth produced sufficient evidence to show that the defendant, acting individually, caused the victim\u2019s death. \u201cThe fact that the cause of death was not ascertainable from the body does not of itself preclude the Commonwealth from proving that the victim\u2019s death was by violence and the criminal agency of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lawrence, 404 Mass. 378, 390 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 354 (1985), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986). When an autopsy does not provide enough information to determine with certainty the cause of death, other evidence at trial may nevertheless support the inference that the defendant\u2019s act was the proximate cause of the death of the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, supra </em>at 358-359, and cases cited.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defendant\u2019s use of deadly weapons in beating and electrocuting the victim, along with the medical examiner\u2019s testimony as to the cause of death, suffice for the jurors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>conclude that the defendant\u2019s acts caused the death of the victim. The defendant told police that he kicked the victim with his work boots \u201cmore than [he] should have.\u201d The defendant beat the victim with a \u201cclub of wood\u201d and with \u201cdumbbell bars,\u201d applied electric shocks to the victim, used his arm, which was in a brace, to hit the victim full across the neck, and hit the victim in the head with a bicycle chain wrapped in tape. The defendant slapped the weakened victim on the night he died. These acts also support the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s acts caused the victim\u2019s death. This evidence was sufficient to permit the jurors to draw the inference that the defendant\u2019s acts caused the victim\u2019s death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 745, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985) (where multiple assailants beat victim to death and evidence showed that defendant assaulted victim with deadly weapon so as to put victim\u2019s life in jeopardy, defendant\u2019s \u201cliability as a contributing cause of [the victim\u2019s] death need not be related to any theory of joint liability, nor need [the defendant\u2019s] acts have been the sole cause of death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant, however, also asserts that the evidence failed to show that the defendant\u2019s acts, and not the intervening acts of third parties (namely, Maynard and the defendant\u2019s brothers), caused the victim\u2019s death. We reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that the beatings by other individuals constituted an independent, intervening cause of the sort that would relieve the defendant of culpability. Maynard, the defendant, and other individuals as joint venturers and as individuals beat and abused the victim on consecutive occasions. The defendant was well aware of what was happening and participated in most of the beatings described by witnesses. \u201cIntervening conduct that is reasonably foreseeable will not relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 791 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>404 Mass. 532, 534 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 745, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Golston, </em>373 Mass. 249, 256 (1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1039 (1978) (\u201cto supersede defendant\u2019s liability, intervening cause must be the sole cause, not merely a contributing cause\u201d). The alleged intervening conduct \u2014 i.e., the continuing abuses by Maynard and the Perrys \u2014 was reasonably foreseeable because the defendant knew that Maynard had said that electrocuting the victim \u201cwas fun,\u201d that they all had laughed while beating and abusing the victim. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>was present during most of the time that the abuse continued. Given the defendant\u2019s knowledge of and participation in many assaults against the victim, as well his knowledge of others beating and abusing the victim for a long period of time, it cannot be said that the assault and the abuse by the other participants whom he saw abuse and beat the victim constitutes an unforeseeable, independent, intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Further, the defendant\u2019s argument misreads our law as to intervening acts and individual liability. \u201cThere may be more than one proximate cause of death. When the conduct of two or more persons contributes concurrently as proximate causes of a death, the conduct of each is a proximate cause of the death regardless of the extent to which each contributes to the death. A cause is concurrent if it was operative at the moment of death and acted with another cause to produce the death.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 745 n.21, quoting California Jury Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 8.55 (4th rev: ed. 1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, the medical examiner testified that the beatings, inability to eat, stress, and pain caused the victim\u2019s death. The evidence warranted the inference that the defendant participated in the beatings and other abuses, and that the effects of these acts were operative at the time of death and caused the victim\u2019s death. Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra, </em>\u201c[w]hen the conduct of two or more persons contributes concurrently as proximate causes of a death, the conduct of each is a proximate cause of the death regardless of the extent to which each contributes to the death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The defendant, however, points to our cases that state that, \u201c[w]hen the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two <em>inconsistent </em>propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 601 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, </em>349 Mass. 196, 200 (1965). We have applied this rule where multiple defendants play some role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the events leading to the victim\u2019s death, but where there is insufficient evidence as to whether any of the acts of the individual defendant before us contributed to the death. This was the case in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>420 Mass. 810 (1995), where the medical examiner testified that the cause of death was blunt force applied to the head and face. The only eyewitness to the beating of the victim by the defendant and another individual testified that the defendant never beat or kicked the victim above the chest. <em>Id. </em>at 812. One of three inconsistent statements given by the defendant indicated that the defendant did strike the victim in the face, but that statement also suggested that this occurred well before the blows that caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 814. We concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence . . . left the defendant\u2019s guilt on an individual liability theory \u2018to conjecture or surmise and ha[d] no solid foundation in established facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>305 Mass. 393, 401 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, supra. </em>Here the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that the victim\u2019s death was caused by the cumulative effect of the multiple beatings, many of which the defendant perpetrated. The evidence linked the defendant\u2019s acts to the factors cited by the medical examiner as causing the victim\u2019s death. This evidence was sufficient for the jurors to conclude that the defendant\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s argument that there was a gap of weeks or months in the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s actions against the victim. To make its case, the Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant continued to beat the victim between mid-February and the time of the victim\u2019s death at the end of March or beginning of April: the evidence supported the conclusion that the victim died because of the cumulative effect of being beaten for months.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Nevertheless, there was evidence warranting the inference that the defendant continued to abuse the victim through the time of the victim\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s confession to the police describing his abuse of the victim did not indicate any change in his participation in the beatings in the weeks before the victim\u2019s death. In addition, the defendant continued to be involved in the crime through the time that he assisted in dispos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ing of the body.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 357 (1985), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986) (\u201c[t]he jury could have considered the great length of time and manner in which the body was secreted as indicative of the defendant\u2019s attempts to conceal evidence of his criminal act\u201d). Thus, the jurors could infer that the defendant did not alter his behavior toward the victim in the weeks before the victim\u2019s death, particularly when the defendant admitted \u201cslapping the victim the night the victim died.\u201d Also, evidence that the defendant assisted in \u201cavoiding] detection and detention\u201d and \u201cattempted] actively to conceal evidence\u201d warrants the inference that he continued to be involved in the ongoing criminal venture as a joint venturer and individually. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. 848, 863 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The evidence also showed that only two people saw the victim immediately before his death \u2014 the defendant and Clinton Maynard, both of whom \u201cslapped\u201d the victim. Although a \u201csimple blow with the hand administered to a healthy adult\u201d does not create a strong likelihood of death, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 702 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976), the victim\u2019s physical condition had deteriorated significantly, as the defendant was aware. Given the victim\u2019s weakened condition, the evidence supported the inference that either or both \u201cslaps\u201d contributed to the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the issue of proximate cause was sufficient on joint and individual responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence on the kidnapping charge. </em>The kidnapping charge was submitted to the jurors on theories of joint and individual liability. The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict on either theory. Because the jurors returned a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>verdict, we must determine whether the evidence was sufficient on both theories. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, supra </em>at 811. We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A person is guilty of kidnapping if he or she \u201cwithout lawful authority, forcibly or secretly confines or imprisons another person within this commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26. The evidence showed that the defendant knew that Maynard tied and gagged the victim to a weight bench. When visitors came to the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, the defendant or his brothers would stand blocking the entry to the stairs to the floor on which the victim was being held. One evening, when the defendant and his brothers were leaving the house for the evening, a witness heard either the defendant or his brother Roger say that \u201cthey\u201d had the victim gagged and tied. The defendant told the victim that \u201che wasn\u2019t allowed to go near the windows or outside.\u201d The defendant would not allow the victim to come downstairs. During the incident with the tobacco juice, in which the defendant was the principal participant, the victim\u2019s hands and feet were bound. When the victim asked to be able to call his mother, the defendant said, \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">These facts ar\u00e9 sufficient to show that, on a theory of joint liability, the defendant cooperated with others in the household to confine the victim by force and in secret. These facts also are sufficient to show that, on a theory of individual liability, the defendant bound the victim, prohibited him from communicating with his mother, and kept him upstairs. The evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant kidnapped the victim under both theories of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The defendant also argues that the acts underlying the kidnapping conviction were merely incidental to the assaults and murder, and that, therefore, the convictions were duplicative. We continue to adhere to the approach announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>397 Mass. 244, 254 (1986), in which we stated that \u201cwe are unwilling to adopt a rule that requires the treatment of confinement or asportation used as a means to facilitate the commission of such crimes as merged in the substantive crime.\u201d There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument on this point. This case is also distinguishable from those in which the intent to commit the felony is used as the malice required to prove the murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Mass. 86, 95-97 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 556-557 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">4. <em>Evidentiary rulings. A. The defendant\u2019s statements to the police. </em>The defendant argues that his oral and written statements to the police should not have been admitted because (1) the police did not cease questioning when, according to the defendant, he requested tire presence of an attorney; and (2) his statement was involuntary. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The judge\u2019s findings and the record reveal the following facts. Troopers Hart and Nartowicz were ordered to question the defendant because information was received indicating that the defendant was involved in the murder of the victim. At that time, the defendant was in custody at a house of correction on an unrelated matter. The troopers arrived at the house of correction at approximately 3 a.m. and requested that the defendant be produced for questioning.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant was brought to a room used by correction personnel as a lunch break room. The troopers read the defendant the Miranda warnings; the defendant read the warnings to himself; and the defendant signed a waiver indicating that he was willing to answer the troopers\u2019 questions. Over the course of three hours, the defendant was questioned orally and subsequently wrote out a statement. The defendant was seated at a table with the two troopers and was given cups of coffee. When the defendant needed to use the restroom, he was escorted to the appropriate facilities. The defendant was calm and cooperative, but showed little emotion through the course of the interview. When the defendant returned to his cell, the troopers requested that the correction officers prevent the defendant from using a telephone possibly to communicate with Maynard or other suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">(1) <em>Alleged violation of right to an attorney. </em>At the hearing on the motion to suppress, and at trial, Troopers Hart and Nartowicz testified that the defendant never requested that questioning cease and never asked that an attorney be present during questioning; the defendant, on the other hand, testified that he asked repeatedly to have an attorney present during questioning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>but that the State troopers told him that no attorney was necessary. \u201cIt is well established that, if an individual in custody \u2018states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 474 (1966)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 448 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judge found \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt . . . that [the defendant] never requested [an] attorney.\u201d The judge noted that his finding \u201cis supported by the wholly credible testimony of Officers Hart and Nartowicz.\u201d The defendant\u2019s reliance on his testimony is misplaced because the judge did not credit it. We accept the judge\u2019s findings. The question of credibility is for the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 144-145, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). Given these factual findings, there was no error in admitting the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">(2) <em>Voluntariness. </em>In support of his motion to suppress statements made at the interview with Troopers Hart and Nartowicz, the defendant offered the expert testimony of a psychiatrist who interviewed the defendant and administered a psychological test to the defendant. According to the psychiatrist, the defendant suffered from severe depression and paranoia and would not be able to sustain concentration throughout a three-hour police interview. Based on this testimony, the defendant alleges that his statement was made involuntarily, and, therefore, should not have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 834 (1994), <em>S.C., 416 </em>Mass. 651 (1998). The judge, however, did not credit this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Commonwealth offered the conflicting expert testimony of a psychologist. The psychologist disagreed with the psychiatrist\u2019s interpretation of the test results, particularly with respect to the defendant\u2019s ability to concentrate. In addition, according to the psychologist, the test administered to the defendant would not accurately reflect the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time the defendant spoke with the State troopers. The judge determined that the psychologist was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing a trial judge\u2019s determination that a voluntary waiver was made, the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings will not be disturbed, if they are warranted by the evidence, and his resolution of conflicting testimony will be accepted.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 303 (1978). . . . Although the judge\u2019s ultimate findings are open for review, \u2018a finding of voluntary waiver is \u201centitled to substantial deference by this court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 138 (1977), aff\u2019d, 439 U.S. 280 (1978).\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>[376 Mass. 811, 822 (1978)]. However, \u2018[o]ur appellate function requires that we make our own independent determination on the correctness of the judge\u2019s \u201capplication of constitutional principles to the facts as found . . . .\u201d <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977).\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 550 (1977).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 144-145.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The judge determined that the defendant was competent to waive his rights and to give both oral and written statements voluntarily to the police. In support of this determination, the judge found that the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatement was chronological and coherent and to a large extent exculpatory in minimizing [the defendant\u2019s] role in the beatings\u201d; that the defendant understood his rights and had the capacity to exercise those rights; and that the psychologist\u2019s \u201ctestimony regarding the [test\u2019s] inability to retroactively determine an individual\u2019s mental state [was] particularly credible.\u201d The record amply supports the judge\u2019s factual findings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, supra. </em>The findings warrant the legal conclusion that the defendant was competent when he gave his statements to the police and that the statements were made voluntarily after a competent waiver of his Miranda warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">B. <em>Hearsay testimony. </em>The defendant objects to the admission of Melissa Terry\u2019s testimony regarding the out-of-court statements of Lena Perry, the defendant\u2019s mother. Terry testified that Lena Perry had said that the defendant was \u201cin charge\u201d of the victim. This statement was admitted de bene, on the theory that the Commonwealth would present evidence that Lena Perry was part of the joint venture. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to exclude the evidence and instructed the jurors that, if they determined that the statement was made by a coventurer, they could consider this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The extrajudicial statement of a coventurer is admissible if the statement is made during the pendency of the joint venture and in furtherance of its goal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1976). The defendant does not challenge this principle. Instead, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that Lena Perry was a coventurer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The evidence warranted the conclusion that Lena Perry participated in the kidnapping and beating of the victim. To be a coventurer, Lena Perry must have been \u201c[1] present at the scene of the crime, [2] with knowledge that another intended to commit a crime, and [3] by agreement was willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 719 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Lena Perry was present throughout the months that the victim was kept in her home and specifically at the incidents during which the victim was restrained. The jurors also would have been warranted in concluding that Lena Perry knew of the victim\u2019s confinement. Such an inference was reasonable given her daily presence in her home where the victim was confined for months.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Lena Perry\u2019s participation went beyond mere presence at the scene of the crime. Frank Parker testified that Lena Perry \u201chit [the victim] with [a] cane.\u201d She aided in the kidnapping by providing the place of the victim\u2019s confinement. Her name was on the lease for the home, but neither the victim\u2019s nor the defendant\u2019s name was listed on the lease. She allowed the defendant to bring the victim into her home and then to confine the victim in her home, knowing that the victim was being abused in her home. This evidence was sufficient to permit the jurors to decide that Lena Perry was present and rendered assistance to the defendant and, therefore, that she was a coven-turer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The statement of a coventurer is admissible if the statement is made in furtherance of the joint venture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra </em>at 543. Lena Perry\u2019s statement that the defendant was in charge and should decide what to do when the victim requested permission to use the bathroom was a statement made in furtherance of the kidnapping. The statement evinced Lena Perry\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s confinement and facilitated the defendant\u2019s ongoing confinement of the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The evidence was sufficient for the judge to instruct the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that they could consider the statement if they determined that it was made as part of the joint venture. The hearsay testimony as to Lena Perry\u2019s statement was properly admitted as the statement of a coventurer made in furtherance of the joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">C. <em>Exclusion of expert testimony. </em>One of the Commonwealth\u2019s key witnesses testified that, in the past, she struggled with a long-term addiction to drugs. The defendant sought to introduce expert testimony of the symptoms of prolonged drug abuse. In the defendant\u2019s proffer before the judge as to this testimony, defense counsel stated that the expert would testify to the effects of \u201cprolonged and chronic marijuana use . . . [which is called] cannabis disorder,\u201d which caused symptoms such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cthe inability to remember, to recall, to perceive, and also . . . the ability to confabulate and create.\u201d The judge did not allow the expert\u2019s opinion in evidence. The defendant argues that the exclusion of this testimony was in error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The witness testified to having memory difficulties caused by other psychiatric conditions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> She also testified to her history of drug use. She was cross-examined fully on each of these topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe admission of expert testimony lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 497, 501 (1972). Evidence as to a witness\u2019s drug use may not be used to attack a witness\u2019s credibility unless the evidence relates to direct observation <em>\u201cof the effect of drug consumption </em>on [the witness\u2019s] capacity to perceive or recall\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arce, </em>426 Mass. 601, 604 (1998). Here, the expert witness never observed directly the condition his proposed testimony was to describe. Nor was there any evidence that the witness in fact suffered from such a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In these circumstances, the proffered testimony would have served as expert commentary on the witness\u2019s credibility. \u201c[A]n expert \u2018may not offer an opinion on a witness\u2019s credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>430 Mass. 529, 538 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales-Maldonado, </em>115 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 1997). Credibility of witnesses is for the jury to decide. See <em>id. </em>Given the absence of evidence linking the witness\u2019s memory difficulties to her drug use, such expert testimony should not have been allowed. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">5. <em>The defendant\u2019s absence at jury voir dire. </em>Before the voir dire of the jurors, which took place at the sidebar, the judge asked defense counsel whether the defendant wished to be present at the sidebar. Defense counsel replied, \u201cfor this I would rather have him sit back there.\u201d The defendant argues that we should adopt a rule requiring judges to inquire of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>whether he wishes to be present in these circumstances. The defendant also argues that, because he was not present at the sidebar, his right to be present at critical stages of the proceedings under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, was violated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to be'present at all critical stages of a criminal proceeding, including voir dire of an individual juror, if \u2018an appropriate request for his presence is made.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 602 (1993). . . . The defendant made no such request in this case, the judge never \u2018excluded\u2019 him, and his counsel never objected to the defendant\u2019s absence. In such circumstances, we \u2018consider[] the issue waived and will not address it on appeal.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 605.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 626 n.5 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">6. <em>Statutory right to use the telephone. </em>The defendant alleges an additional error which was not raised below. According to the defendant, the judge erred in admitting testimony of the defendant\u2019s confessions to the police because the defendant was denied his right to access to a telephone under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33E. Because this claim was not raised at trial, we review to determine whether there was an error and, if there were, whether that error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 291-292 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendant was in custody on an unrelated matter when the police arrived at the house of correction to question him. General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 33A, provides: \u201cThe police official in charge of the . . . place of detention having a telephone wherein a person is held in custody, shall permit the use of the telephone ... for the purpose of allowing the arrested person to communicate with his family or friends, or to arrange for release on bail, or to engage the services of an attorney. Any such person shall be informed forthwith upon his arrival at such station or place of detention, of his right to so use the telephone, and such use shall be permitted within one hour thereafter.\u201d The statute is plainly inapplicable where the defendant already is incarcerated on another matter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There was no error and, therefore, no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>7. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that none of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal warrants reversal. Having reviewed the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we also conclude that there is no reason in law and justice for ordering entry of a lesser degree of guilt on the murder verdict or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> Poirier\u2019s testimony was admitted for the limited purpose of showing the nature of the relationship and any pattern of behavior between the defendant and the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> We address the admissibility of this evidence, <em>infra </em>at 234-236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements was denied.

This argument lacks merit. The jurors need not have credited the portion of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police that indicated that he acted out of fear. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985) (in reviewing denial of motion for required finding, we consider evidence in light most favorable to Commonwealth).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>428 Mass. 617, 622 (1999) (\u201cThe defendant argues that the rape and murder were two separate and unrelated criminal acts, and that his participation was limited to the rape. While the defendant offers one possible interpretation of the evidence, it is not the only reasonable one. \u2018[T]o the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>424 Mass. 64, 68 [1997], quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 245 [1981]\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Talamantez, </em>169 Cal.

This does not render the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence insufficient. The medical examiner testified that certain of his findings were inconclusive because of the state of the body and the wet environment in which the body was left. In these circumstances, the jurors were entitled to credit the testimony of individuals who witnessed the defendant injuring the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. 378, 390 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 744-745, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>2 Allen 136, 142 (1861) (\u201c \u2018If a person inflicts a wound with a deadly weapon in such manner as to put life in jeopardy, and death follows as a consequence of this felonious and wicked act, it does not alter its nature or diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated in producing the fatal result.\u2019 . . .

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 357 (1985), cert. denied, <em>477 </em>U.S. 904 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> Although we do not consider evidence introduced by the defendant in evaluating the claim that the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief should have been granted, we n\u00f3te that the defendant\u2019s presentation of evidence strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The defendant testified that, on the night of the murder, he \u201cslammed\u201d the victim \u201cupside of the head.\u201d Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s case did not deteriorate after it rested its case in chief. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 79 n.5 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> The facts listed in note 16, <em>infra, </em>also support the inference that the defendant controlled the victim\u2019s movements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> The time of the interview does not appear to have been a calculated tactic on the part of the troopers. The troopers spent the evening and early morning hours questioning a number of individuals, including other members of the Perry family, who implicated the defendant in the death of the victim. After consulting with their commanding officer, the troopers were instructed to proceed to the house of correction to question the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> Suzan Phillips testified that on one evening the defendant threatened Lena Perry in order to keep her from leaving the house. This evidence that Lena Perry was afraid of her son does not preclude the jurors from considering her statement if they determined she was a joint venturer. Phillips said that she accompanied Lena Perry to weekly church suppers, supporting the inference that Lena Perry was free to come and go. In the light most favorable to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>monwealth, there was sufficient evidence that Lena Perry was part of the joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> The defendant argues that, if the admission of the statement were error, we should review under a harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 73 (1995). Generally in considering evidentiary rulings, we apply a nonprejudicial standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Esteves, 429 Mass. 636, 639 (1999). Although there was no error in the admission of the statement, we note that the statement was merely cumulative of the evidence that the defendant controlled the victim\u2019s life. For example, immediately after the defendant\u2019s mother said that the defendant was in charge of the victim, the defendant told the victim to go back upstairs. Parker testified that, when he was at the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, it was the defendant who called the victim downstairs, beat the victim, and sent the victim upstairs. Laura White asked to see the victim in February and the defendant brought him downstairs. When White asked to look at the victim\u2019s arm, the defendant said no. The defendant told the victim he could not telephone his mother. The defendant also told the victim to tell White that the defendant had made him \u201cgive Johnny [Maynard] a blow job.\u201d The defendant laughed and said he made the victim do it. Thus, the statement that the defendant was in control of the victim was merely cumulative of other evidence making the same point.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Evidence regarding the victim\u2019s being forced to give Maynard a \u201cblow job\u201d was admitted in relation to a charge of aggravated rape. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a requested finding of not guilty on the charge of aggravated rape, but the testimony pertaining to this incident remained in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Although we do not consider evidence presented during the defendant\u2019s case in reaching our decision, we note that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on this issue did not deteriorate after the Commonwealth rested. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 80 n.5 (1978). A real estate agent who testified for the defense stated that Lena Perry forced her to wait forty-eight hours before showing the house, justifying the inference that Lena Perry was assisting in keeping the victim\u2019s confinement and condition a secret.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\"> The witness testified that, due to psychiatric conditions, she had difficulties in sequencing events chronologically and had undergone counselling. The records reviewed by the defense expert support this testimony. Her psychiatric records listed these conditions as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. The judge conducted proceedings in accord with our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), and ordered the witness\u2019s psychiatric records turned over to the defendant. The defense expert was permitted to testify that individuals with disorders like those of the witness might suffer from \u201cmajor impairments in memory and integration of attention and perception.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> In addition, we are not persuaded that the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d with respect to the murder charge in this case. To determine whether an inmate is \u201cin custody,\u201d courts, \u201crather than asking whether a prisoner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>free to leave the facility . . . ask[] whether he is subject to some restraint in addition to those normally imposed on him by virtue of his status as an inmate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 434 (1999), and cases cited. \u201cAn additional restraint is one that places a restriction on the inmate\u2019s freedom of action in connection with the interrogation and prevents him from leaving the scene of questioning by placing a further limit on his already restricted freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Here, the defendant was not placed under arrest for the murder of the victim. The defendant was asked whether he wanted to speak to the police. He was brought to the correction officers\u2019 lunch break room and given coffee on request. Although he was escorted to the restroom, his freedom of movement was not limited beyond that to which he was already subject from incarceration for an unrelated offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
