L. c. 112, \u00a7 131 (LICSW), is \u201ca provider of health care\u201d entitled to a medical malpractice tribunal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. We conclude that LICSWs are not entitled to a malpractice tribunal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, and order that the plaintiff\u2019s motion to quash the defendants\u2019 requests for a tribunal be allowed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint alleges that she was a patient of the defendant Mary Bosley, a licensed psychologist. The plaintiff claims that Bosley\u2019s treatment was negligent in many respects, including an alleged failure \u201cto maintain proper boundaries between patient and therapist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">After several years of this allegedly negligent treatment, Bos-ley referred the plaintiff to the defendant Sally Bowie, a LICSW. Bowie rendered therapy to the plaintiff and Bosley jointly for a period of two to three months. The plaintiff contends that Bowie was negligent in failing to advise Bosley that her (Bosley\u2019s) treatment of the plaintiff was inappropriate, in failing to warn the plaintiff that Bosley\u2019s treatment was inappropriate, in failing to advise the plaintiff to seek sole rather than joint treatment, and in failing to report Bosley\u2019s misconduct to licensing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The amended complaint also names as defendants six therapists who were allegedly \u201caffiliated in practice\u201d with Bosley. Five of those defendants (Annelle Rowen, Timothy Clark, Ellen Mathewson, Sandra Orenstein, and Ann Solomon Schwartz) are LICSWs. The remaining defendant, Paul Bosley, is licensed as a marriage and family therapist pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 165. The plaintiff claims that the defendants who were \u201caffiliated\u201d with Bosley knew or should have known that Bos-ley\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff deviated from accepted practices and that they failed to advise Bosley that her treatment of the plaintiff was inappropriate, failed to warn the plaintiff that she was receiving inappropriate treatment from Bosley, and failed to report Bosley to licensing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">With their answers, the defendant Bowie and the defendants \u201caffiliated\u201d with Bosley each filed a request for a medical malpractice tribunal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, whereupon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>plaintiff filed a motion to quash those requests. The motion to quash was denied as to Bowie and allowed as to the other defendants \u201caffiliated\u201d with Bosley. The plaintiff then sought an interlocutory appeal from the partial denial of her motion to quash, and the defendants Rowen, Cl\u00e1rk, Mathewson, Oren-stein, and Schwartz filed cross appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">2. <em>Definition of \u201cprovider of health care\u201d under \u00a7 60B. </em>An action against \u201ca provider of health care\u201d based on alleged \u201cmalpractice, error or mistake\u201d must first be submitted, to a tribunal for its determination whether the plaintiff\u2019s evidence \u201cis sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. Section 60B defines \u201ca provider of health care\u201d as \u201ca person, corporation, facility or institution licensed by the commonwealth to provide health care or professional services as a physician, hospital, clinic or nursing home, dentist, registered or licensed nurse, optometrist, podiatrist, chiropractor, physical therapist, psychologist, or acupuncturist, or an officer, employee or agent thereof acting in the course and scope of his employment.\u201d The plaintiff contends that only those health care professionals specifically enumerated in the \u00a7 60B list are entitled to a tribunal and that LICSWs, appearing nowhere on that list, therefore are not entitled to a tribunal. The defendants argue that the list set forth in \u00a7 60B modifies only the immediately preceding term \u201cprofessional services\u201d and that the term \u201clicensed by the commonwealth to provide health care\u201d is not modified or limited by the list. Because they are \u201clicensed by the commonwealth to provide health care,\u201d the defendants argue that they are entitled to a tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>413 Mass. 670, 675-676 (1992), we held that emergency medical technicians (EMTs) were not \u201cprovider[s] of health care\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 60B. In doing so, we noted that EMTs \u201cwere not included in the Legislature\u2019s list\u201d and rejected the assertion that merely being_\u201clicensed by the. Commonwealth\u201d would suffice to bring a health care professional within , the ambit of the tribunal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 675. See <em>Rahilly </em>v. <em>North Adams Regional Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 721 (1994) (\u201clife-flight\u201d helicopter service not \u201cprovider of health care\u201d within G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The defendants ask this court to revisit the <em>Perez </em>case and to consider their alternative interpretation of the \u00a7 60B list, i.e., that the list only modifies the term \u201cprofessional services\u201d and not the term \u201clicensed by the commonwealth to provide health care.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded. The proposed alternative reading would render the list itself superfluous, as the health care professions identified in the list would already be covered by the term \u201clicensed by the commonwealth to provide health care.\u201d Physicians, dentists, nurses, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, physical therapists, psychologists, and acupuncturists are all \u201clicensed by the commonwealth to provide health care,\u201d and there would be no need to enumerate those specific professions in the statutory definition if the definition were intended to include every conceivable form of licensed health care professional. \u201cIt is a common tenet of statutory construction that, wherever possible, no provision of a legislative enactment should be treated as superfluous.\u201d <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979). A reading of \u00a7 60B that renders superfluous its listing of specific licensed professions would be contrary to that canon of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The defendants argue that the purposes underlying the malpractice tribunal are equally applicable\"!\u00bb the profession of social work and that we should therefore read the statutory definition broadly so as to accord social workers the protection of a tribunal. In establishing the mechanism of a screening tribunal for medical malpractice cases, the Legislature sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>discourage frivolous malpractice claims and thereby contain the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 577 (1978); <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 647, 651 (1977); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 655 n.4 (1977). The defendants argue that the dual problems of frivolous claims and escalating malpractice premiums persist in all branches of health care, and that including all licensed health care professionals within \u00a7 60B will further the over-all legislative purpose. They specifically argue that the health care services they provide as LICSWs are virtually identical to those provided by licensed psychologists and that, where the Legislature expressly included psychologists in \u00a7 60B, the Legislature must have intended to include LICSWs as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Whatever the merits of the defendants\u2019 policy argument may be, the Legislature has crafted a lengthy and detailed list of the professions covered by \u00a7 60B. Any expansion of that list must be left to the Legislature. Consistent with our analysis in <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., supra, </em>we hold that the malpractice tribunal statute covers only those health care professions expressly identified in the list of licensed providers set forth in \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">3. <em>Equal protection. </em>The defendants next argue that excluding LICSWs from \u00a7 60B denies them equal protection of the laws in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions. LICSWs are not members of a suspect group, nor is there any fundamental interest at stake in according or denying them the screening mechanism of a malpractice tribunal. As such, \u00a7 60B does not deny LICSWs equal protection \u201cas long as it is rationally related to the furtherance of a legitimate State interest.\u201d <em>Chebacco Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>429 Mass. 721, 722 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The defendants\u2019 assertion that the services they provide are virtually identical to those provided by licensed psychologists does not suffice to make out their equal protection claim. \u201cLegislative line drawing \u2018requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723, quoting <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 315-316 (1993). Many professions provide services aimed at the mental and emotional health of their clients, and many of those professions may employ techniques that are also used by licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>psychologists. The drawing of a line that provides psychologists with the benefit of a malpractice tribunal but denies that benefit to other related professions does not violate equal protection \u201cif there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Chebacco Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., supra </em>at 313. \u201c[S]uch line drawing does not violate equal protection principles simply because it \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chebacco Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Notwithstanding the overlap between the forms of therapy rendered by licensed psychologists and those rendered by LICSWs, the Legislature has defined and treated., these two categories of providers differently. They are licensed and governed by separate boards of registration (see G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 76 [board of registration of psychologists], and G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 80 [board of registration of social workers]), and they have differing education and experience requirements for licensure (compare G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 120 [requirements for psychologist license] with G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 \u00a7 131 and 132 [requirements for social worker license]). The statutory description of the range of services offered and the techniques used by licensed psychologists is different from the services and techniques outlined for social workers. Compare G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 118 (defining \u201cpractice of psychology\u201d), with G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 130 (defining \u201cpractice of social work\u201d). While the two professions share some services and techniques in common, each offers services and uses techniques that are not_offered or used by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 specific assertion that they provide the same types of psychotherapy as that provided by psychologists, the Legislature has expressly characterized the psychotherapy that social workers are to provide as \u201cpsychotherapy of a nonmedical nature.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 130. Consistent with the Legislature\u2019s view that the therapy provided by social workers is \u201cnonmedical,\u201d the governing statutes tellingly refer to the individuals serviced by social workers as \u201cclients,\u201d whereas the individuals serviced by psychologists are referred to as \u201cpatients.\u201d See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 129A (protecting confidential communications between psychologist and \u201cpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tient\u201d); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135A (protecting confidential communications between social worker and \u201cclient\u201d). Finally, the Legislature\u2019s view that these are overlapping yet distinct professions is articulated clearly by the mandate that social workers not hold themselves out to the public as psychologists and vice versa. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 125 (allowing \u201cqualified members of other professions or occupations such as . . . social workers\u201d to do \u201cwork of a psychological nature consistent with the accepted standards of their respective professions\u201d provided they do not hold themselves out to the public as \u201cpsychologists\u201d); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 134 (allowing \u201cqualified members of other professions or occupations such as . . . licensed psychologists\u201d to do \u201cwork of a social service nature\u201d provided they do not hold themselves out to the public as engaging \u201cin the practice of social work\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Despite common goals and utilization of some common methods, the profession of social work is not identical to the profession of psychology. Granting psychologists the benefit of a malpractice tribunal while denying that benefit to \u201cnonmedical\u201d professionals who also address the emotional and psychological well-being of their clients is perfectly rational. Equal protection analysis does not compel the inclusion of LICSWs in \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">4. <em>Officer, employee, or agent. </em>The \u00a7 60B definition of \u201cprovider of health care\u201d also includes \u201can officer, employee or agent\u201d of any person or entity on the list of specific licensed health care providers where that officer, employee or agent was \u201cacting in the course and scope of his employment.\u201d In a memorandum in support of her petition for interlocutory review, the plaintiff referred to the defendants Rowen, Clark, Mathewson, Orenstein, and Schwartz as \u201cBosley\u2019s partners in a group practice.\u201d Seizing on that reference to \u201cpartners,\u201d and invoking the doctrine that partners are \u201cagents\u201d of the partnership, see G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 9 (1), these defendants contend in the alternative that they are entitled to a tribunal as alleged \u201cagents\u201d of a licensed psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">No such argument was made below, for the simple reason that the amended complaint does not allege a \u201cpartnership\u201d or any other form of \u201cagency\u201d relationship between these defendants and Bosley. The amended complaint does not set forth claims stemming from anything these defendants allegedly did on Bosley\u2019s behalf, nor does it assert that these defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>are vicariously liable for Bosley\u2019s misconduct. Rather, the claims against these defendants are predicated entirely on their own alleged professional negligence in failing to take any action when they knew or should have known that Bosley\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff had gone beyond the bounds of an appropriate therapeutic relationship. The allegation in the amended complaint that defendants were \u201caffiliated in practice\u201d with Bosley (an allegation that falls short of alleging a \u201cpartnership\u201d or other \u201cagency\u201d relationship) is merely set forth as the factual basis for the claim that these defendants were in a position to know of the impropriety in Bosley\u2019s handling of the plaintiff\u2019s therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The defendants did not contend before the trial court, and do not contend here, that they were \u201cagents\u201d of Bosley. They have, in their brief to this court, denied that-they were \u201cpartners\u201d with Bosley; in their answer to the allegation that they were \u201caffiliated in practice\u201d with Bosley, they have admitted only that they were \u201can association for the practice of psychotherapy\u201d and that Bosley was \u201cassociated\u201d with them. In the absence of any assertion by any party that these defendants were \u201cagents\u201d of Bosley, or any claim based on an \u201cagency\u201d relationship, there is no basis for granting them a malpractice tribunal as \u201cagent[s]\u201d of \u201ca provider of health care.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judge\u2019s order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to quash the defendant Sally Bowie\u2019s request for a medical malpractice tribunal is reversed and the judge\u2019s order allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to quash the remaining defendants\u2019 requests for a medical malpractice tribunal is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> Mary Bosley, whose status as a licensed psychologist would indisputably entitle her to a tribunal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, never requested a tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> Paul Bosley, the licensed marriage and family therapist, did not seek an appeal from the order quashing his request for a tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> The defendants also suggest that <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>413 Mass. 670 (1992), can be distinguished on the ground that the ambulance EMTs there were sued only for failing to transport a patient, not for the rendering of any health care services. That proffered distinction was not the basis for the <em>Perez </em>decision, nor does it hold up under scrutiny. The claims against those defendants included the allegation that the EMTs, after taking the patient\u2019s vital signs and erroneously determining that there had been no significant change from their prior transport of the patient, had communicated with the hospital emergency room concerning the patient\u2019s desire to be transported back to the hospital to refill a prescription but had failed to alert the hospital to the changes in the patient\u2019s condition. <em>Id. </em>at 672-673. The plaintiff\u2019s expert had opined that, had the EMTs accurately reported the patient\u2019s worsening condition to the emergency room personnel, the hospital would have authorized the transport. <em>Id. </em>at 674-675. An EMT\u2019s assessment of a patient\u2019s condition at the scene and report of those conditions back to emergency room personnel would appear to qualify as the rendering of health care services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> While a tribunal does not determine vicarious liability for another provider\u2019s malpractice, see <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Latimer, </em>390 Mass. 265, 272 n.2 (1983); <em>Kilmartin </em>v. <em>Lowell Gen. Hosp., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1986); <em>DiNozzi </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 973, 974 (1985); <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 812 (1980), a defendant would be entitled to have a tribunal review whether the claims of malpractice on the part of the principal tortfeasor raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. Here, where Bosley has not sought a tribunal hearing for the. claims of malpractice against her, there has been no tribunal -determination with respect to those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
