L. c. 123A, as amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that provide for the civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons, apply to persons such as the three defendants, whose convictions of sexual offenses predate September 10, 1999, the effective date of St. 1999, c. 74. On September 10, 1999, each of the defendants was serving his respective sentence on the sexual offense of which he was previously convicted, and was scheduled to be released from prison shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the day before their scheduled releases, the Commonwealth filed petitions in the Superior Court seeking each defendant\u2019s commitment as a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After being temporarily committed, each of the defendants moved to dismiss the petition filed against him. The defendants argued that the 1999 version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>c. 123A violated various State constitutional provisions, or that the definition of sexually dangerous persons in c. 123A, \u00a7 1, did not apply to persons who had not been convicted of a sexual offense on or after the effective date of the 1999 amendments. The judge in each case did not decide the constitutional claims, but rather concluded that the defendant could not be subjected to potential commitment under c. 123A because his prior conviction of a sexual offense predated the effective date of the 1999 amendments, and on that basis, allowed the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth appealed from each order of dismissal. Pending our determination of these cases, Davila and Wilson have remained committed. We conclude that civil commitment proceedings under c. 123A were properly initiated against the defendants, whose convictions for sexual offenses predate the effective date of the 1999 amendments. We reject the defendants\u2019 constitutional claims that c. 123A violates their rights to be protected from ex post facto lawmaking, as well as their due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We also consider whether Bruno\u2019s due process rights were violated by the Commonwealth\u2019s recent attempt to have him committed, where he previously had been evaluated by two psychiatrists who opined that he was not a sexually dangerous person under an earlier version of c. 123A. We conclude that, where Bruno had not been adjudged not sexually dangerous, and where the Commonwealth\u2019s recent commitment petition was not predicated solely on the grounds on which the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>commitment petition was based, the Commonwealth did not violate Bruno\u2019s due process rights by recently filing a petition to commit Bruno as a sexually dangerous person.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Last, we consider the propriety of an order committing Wilson to the treatment center for examination and diagnosis for a period not to exceed sixty days. This order was entered by the judge before he allowed Wilson\u2019s motion to dismiss. The judge, after hearing, committed Wilson because he found probable cause existed that Wilson was a sexually dangerous person. The judge then reported his order as well as six questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), and G.L. c.231, \u00a7 111.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, transferred the report, together with the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the order allowing Wilson\u2019s motion to dismiss, from the Appeals Court to this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the order of commitment and address the reported questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We first provide an overview of the statute. On September 10, 1999, the Legislature enacted emergency legislation, St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, amending c. 123A by providing for the one day to life commitment of a person adjudged a \u201csexually dangerous person.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to these amendments, for a period of almost ten years, no new \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d classifications and no new commitments were permitted. See St. 1990, c. 150, \u00a7 304 (repealing G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 3-6, and 7).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 1999 amendments established a new definition of a sexually dangerous person, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, and five new sections, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16, concerning the procedures for adjudicating persons as sexually dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">As amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 6, a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201cany person who has been (i) convicted of or adjudicated as a delinquent juvenile or youthful offender by reason of a sexual offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility; (ii) charged with a sexual offense and was determined to be incompetent to stand trial and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes such person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility; or (iii) previously adjudicated as [sexually dangerous] by a court of the commonwealth and whose misconduct in sexual matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>indicates a general lack of power to control his sexual impulses, as evidenced by repetitive or compulsive sexual misconduct by either violence against any victim, or aggression against any victim under the age of 16 years, and who, as a result, is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury on such victims because of his uncontrolled or uncontrollable desires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Statute 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 4, inserted definitions for the terms \u201c[mjental abnormality\u201d and \u201c[pjersonality disorder.\u201d A \u201c[mjental abnormality\u201d is defined as \u201ca congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. A \u201c[pjersonality disorder\u201d is defined as \u201ca congenital or acquired physical or mental condition that results in a general lack of power to control sexual impulses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The definition of the term \u201csexual offense\u201d identifies various specifically enumerated crimes, including, undisputedly, the crimes of which the defendants were convicted. <em>Id. </em>See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The new commitment procedures, as applied to persons such as the defendants who have been convicted of a sexual offense, require \u201c[ajny agency with jurisdiction\u201d over such persons, or custodial agency, to \u201cnotify in writing the district attorney of the county where the offense occurred and the attorney general six months prior to the release of such person.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (a). If the district attorney or Attorney General then \u201cdetermines that the prisoner ... is likely to be a sexually dangerous person as defined in section 1 [of c. 123A],\u201d either \u201cmay file a petition alleging that the prisoner ... is a sexually dangerous person and stating sufficient facts to support such allegations in the superior court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u201cUpon the filing of a petition,\u201d the court must \u201cdetermine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(c). </em>Such person is entitled to notice and a hearing, together with the right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to view and copy all petitions and reports in the court\u2019s file. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 (c), <em>(d). </em>If the person is scheduled to be released \u201cprior to the court\u2019s probable cause determination, the court, upon a sufficient show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ing based on the evidence before the court at that time, may temporarily commit such person . . . pending disposition of the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 (&lt;?). The person may move for relief from such commitment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">If the court finds probable cause to believe that the person is sexually dangerous, he may be committed \u201cfor a period not exceeding [sixty] days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a). No later than fifteen days before the expiration of the sixty-day examination period, the qualified examiners must \u201cfile with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis and their recommendation of the [person\u2019s] disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The person may retain his own expert, and if indigent, \u201cthe court shall provide for such qualified examiner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 13 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Within fourteen days of the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports, the district attorney or Attorney General \u201cmay petition the court for a trial ... to determine whether [the] person is a sexually dangerous person.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>Trial must commence within sixty days from the date that the petition is filed unless good cause is shown or the interests of justice so require. <em>Id. </em>To prepare for trial, the person is entitled to the assistance of counsel and may retain \u201cexperts or professional persons to perform an examination on his behalf\u201d and to examine \u201call relevant medical and psychological records\u201d concerning the person. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14 <em>(b). </em>If the person is indigent, the State shall provide him with counsel and experts. <em>Id. </em>If the person intends to use the testimony or report of his qualified examiner, he must file the examiner\u2019s report with the court, and provide the district attorney and Attorney General with a copy, \u201cno later than ten days prior to the scheduled trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">During the trial, the person \u201cshall be confined to a secure facility.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>If the jury unanimously find \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the person is a sexually dangerous person, he will be committed from one day to life, until discharged. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>The effective date of the order of commitment is the person\u2019s \u201cdate of discharge, from jail, the house of correction, [or] prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the person is scheduled to be released from jail or prison \u201cat any time prior to the final judgment, the court may temporarily commit such person . . . pending disposition of the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14 (&lt;?).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">A person committed under \u00a7 14 <em>(d) </em>\u201cshall be entitled to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>a petition for examination and discharge once in every twelve months.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. At any time, the Department of Correction (department) may file a discharge petition \u201cif it believes a person is no longer a sexually dangerous person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The right to a speedy hearing is afforded to the petitioner, and at any such hearing, either the petitioner or the Commonwealth may demand a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>On the committed person\u2019s motion, or on its own motion, the court \u201cshall appoint counsel\u201d for the committed person. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Prior to a trial or dispositive hearing, the court \u201cshall order [the committed person] to be examined by two qualified examiners.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. The examiners are obligated to conduct \u201cexaminations, including personal interviews,\u201d of the committed person, and must file written reports of their \u201cexaminations and diagnoses, and their recommendations for the [committed person\u2019s] disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the committed person \u201cwithout good cause\u201d refuses to be personally interviewed by a qualified examiner, \u201csuch person shall be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on the petition and the petition shall be dismissed upon motion filed by the commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnless the trier of fact finds that such person remains a sexually dangerous person, it shall order such person to be discharged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">1. <em>Retroactivity. </em>The defendants maintain that the application of the amended c. 123A to them is unconstitutional because it was triggered by an event, namely, a conviction of a sexual offense, that occurred before its effective date. They assert that the statute may only be applied to persons (unlike themselves) whose convictions of sexual offenses occur on or after the effective date of the 1999 amendments. We disagree because we conclude that the statute operates prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">There is no dispute that the requisite convictions of sexual offenses in these cases occurred before the effective date of the 1999 amendments to c. 123A, and that absent these prior sexual offense convictions, the defendants could not be subjected to potential commitment as sexually dangerous persons. Those facts, however, do not render the statute retroactive. In determining whether a statute operates retroactively or prospectively, the whole statute, and here, the entire definition of the term \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d as well must be considered. 2 N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.04, at 350 (5th ed. 1993). When the conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>occurs on or after its effective date, the statute\u2019s application is deemed prospective, and therefore permissible. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>366 Mass. 779, 781 (1975); <em>Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>318 Mass. 563, 571 (1945). See also <em>McAndrews </em>v. <em>Fleet Bank, </em>989 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Here, the conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application is not the prior conviction of a sexual offense, but the current mental condition of a defendant. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1 (definition of \u201c[sjexually dangerous person\u201d); \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The focus of the definition of \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d and the statute\u2019s various sections relating to the procedures governing commitment is a defendant\u2019s current mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">That a person, in addition to possessing the requisite current mental condition, must have been convicted of a sexual offense, only identifies and limits the class of persons subject to potential commitment under c. 123A. \u201cThe [Ljegislature may, of course, choose to classify or reclassify a thing, and provided the new definition is applied only to determine status for the purpose of matters arising in the future, the prohibition on retroactive laws is not violated. A law is not made retroactive because it alters the existing classification of a thing. Nor is a law retroactive if it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.\u201d <em>United States Envtl. Protection Agency </em>v. <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc., </em>826 F.2d 361, 365 (5th Cir. 1987). See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, supra. </em>See also 2 N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 41.01, at 338 (\u201ca statute is not rendered retroactive merely because the facts upon which its subsequent action depends are drawn from a time antecedent to its effective date\u201d). Because the requisite sexual offense convictions determine only the persons eligible for potential civil commitment, and is not the basis for commitment, the statute is not retroactive in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Our conclusion does not contradict the \u201cnew consequence\u201d formulation of retroactivity, under which a court must ask \u201cwhether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 270 (1994). That inquiry is not simply a determination whether the new statutory provision effects an unanticipated consequence, but \u201ca process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>a relevant past event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While \u201c[a]ny test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity,\u201d <em>id., </em>we are satisfied that the statute, with its focus on a person\u2019s current mental condition, does not operate retroactively. Our conclusion obviates the need to address the defendants\u2019 remaining arguments concerning the retroactive application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">2. <em>Ex post facto law. </em>The defendants argue that various features of c. 123A render the statute punitive in both intent and effect, and thus, an unconstitutional ex post facto law under art. 24 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They point to the following features of the statute as punitive: (1) the commitment and treatment occurs after a sexually dangerous person has served his sentence, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (2) the statute does not permit less restrictive alternatives to commitment; and (3) the treatment center is operated by the department, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2, instead of the Department of Mental Health, as previously had been the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We reject these contentions. The statute is neither punitive in intent or effect, nor does it constitute an ex post facto law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In support of their arguments, the defendants rely principally on the dissenting opinion in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 373 (1997) (Breyer, J., dissenting). There the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas, and upheld as constitutional the Sexually Violent Predator Act, see Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59-29a01 et seq. (1994) (Kansas statute), which contains many provisions similar to those in c. 123A. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 371. The Court considered, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>other issues, whether the Kansas statute violated the Federal Constitution\u2019s prohibition on ex post facto lawmaking. <em>Id. </em>at 361. We find the Court\u2019s analysis instructive here. See <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>427 Mass. 298, 301, <em>S.C., </em>428 Mass. 39, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1003 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The defendants acknowledge that only a criminal or penal statute could potentially constitute an ex post facto law. Whether a statute was intended to be criminal or civil depends on the Legislature\u2019s intent, which is a matter of statutory construction. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 361. If a statute was intended to be civil, then it is penal \u201conly where a party challenging the statute provides \u2018the clearest proof\u2019 that \u2018the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention\u2019 to deem it \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248-249 (1980). See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 537-538 (1998). The defendants fall short of satisfying this high burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Legislature intended the current version of c. 123A, as with former versions, to be remedial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>424 Mass. 236, 239, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 832 (1997); <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 153-154, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 111-112, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982). Statute 1999, c. 74, is entitled \u201cAn Act. . . establishing <em>civil </em>commitment\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 361. Persons committed are committed to a treatment center providing for their \u201ccare, custody, treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 2. Further, c. 123A retains its place among public welfare chapters of the General Laws. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 361. The Legislature left intact the statute\u2019s title, \u201cCare, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexually Dangerous Persons.\u201d St. 1958, c. 646, \u00a7 1. These facets of the statute, together with its stated purpose, \u201cto protect forthwith the vulnerable members of our communities from sexual offenders,\u201d see St. 1999, c. 74, emergency preamble, underscore the dual goals of the amendments, namely, to protect the public from sexually dangerous persons, and to provide them treatment, and rehabilitation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, supra. </em>Because the Legislature intended to establish a remedial scheme, the statute is deemed \u201cnonpunitive and therefore civil.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 538. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The statute\u2019s scheme has not been shown to be so punitive in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>purpose or effect as to negate the Legislature\u2019s remedial intention. See <em>id.; Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 2), </em>425 Mass. 217, 220 (1997). As to the statute\u2019s purpose, it is neither retributive, nor does it function as a deterrent. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 361-362. It is not retributive because \u201cit does not affix culpability for prior criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. As we previously explained, the statute\u2019s requirement, in the cases of the defendants, of a conviction of a sexual offense, is not the basis for commitment, but rather merely identifies and limits the class of persons subject to commitment proceedings under c. 123A. Consequently, \u201cthe fact that the [statute] may be \u2018tied to criminal activity\u2019 is \u2018insufficient to render [the statute] punitive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 292 (1996). In addition, because commitment is based on a person\u2019s current mental condition, and no finding of scienter is required to commit the person, the statute is not retributive. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 362. Last, by the nature of their current mental condition, those persons committed under the statute are \u201cunlikely to be deterred by the threat of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362-363. See <em>Hill, petitioner, supra </em>at 154 (commitment \u201cdoes not serve as . . . deterrent measure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The three features of the statute on which the defendants rely, when viewed against the entire statutory scheme, do not render the statute punitive. While the dissenting opinion in the <em>Hendricks </em>case opined that the requirement of completion of a sentence prior to commitment under the Kansas statute makes \u201ca legislative scheme . . . look punitive,\u201d it acknowledged a counter-argument that a State \u201cshould be permitted to postpone treatment until after punishment in order to make certain that the punishment in fact occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 386 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Statutory history suggests this concern may be what the Legislature had in mind when enacting St 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 8. Under prior versions of c. 123A, a sexually dangerous person would be committed concurrent with serving his sentence, St. 1985, c. 752, \u00a7 1, or could, in lieu of serving his sentence, be committed, St. 1958, c. 646, \u00a7 1. While the dissent in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 386 (Breyer, J., dissenting), rejected the counter-argument, it did so because \u201c[m]uch of the treatment that Kansas offered [in connection with commitment] can be given at the same time as, and in the same place where, [the defendant] serves his punishment.\u201d The Supreme Court did not decide whether the Federal Constitution requires States to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>inmates sex offender treatment while incarcerated for a subsequent civil commitment to be valid as nonpunitive. We do not decide this question because the defendants made no claim in the trial court that treatment was not or would not be available when they serve their punishment. The issue is therefore not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">That c. 123A does not provide less restrictive alternatives to commitment, such as \u201cpostrelease supervision [or] halfway houses,\u201d see <em>Kansas </em>v. Hendricks, <em>supra </em>at 387 (Breyer, J., dissenting), does not render the statute punitive. To the contrary, those persons subjected to confined commitment have been found either to be \u201clikely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility,\u201d or to have \u201ca general lack of power to control . . . sexual impulses . . . and . . . likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Thus, because such persons are likely to commit future harm, confined commitment appears to be the only viable form of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Last, the fact that treatment for committed persons is provided at a treatment center operated under the auspices of the department of correction does not render the commitment penal in nature. We previously rejected such a claim under an earlier different version of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, supra </em>at 238-239. Further, the defendants do not dispute that sexually dangerous persons are kept apart from the criminal population in the treatment center. Nor do they dispute that under the statute they only can remain committed while they possess the requisite mental condition. If the trier of fact finds that a person is no longer sexually dangerous, the department of correction must release that person.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">3. <em>Due process. </em>While commitment proceedings under c. 123A are civil proceedings, the potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to these proceedings \u201cmandates that due process protections apply.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977). The defendants argue that temporary commitment of an indeterminate duration pending a probable cause hearing, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e), </em>violates their substantive due process rights because the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>restraint does not occur in narrowly circumscribed situations. They maintain that the temporary restraint is not imposed in narrowly circumscribed situations because the \u201cdistrict attorneys\u2019 discretion to initiate proceedings is not informed by meaningful guidelines; a district attorney can file a petition for commitment of any person who has been convicted of a single sex offense.\u201d The defendants also claim that this lack of guidelines violates their procedural due process rights. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[Sjubstantive due process\u201d prevents the government from engaging in conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), or interferes with rights \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325-326 (1937).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987).\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993). Where, as here, the right involved, freedom from physical restraint, is \u201cfundamental,\u201d we \u201c \u2018must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation,\u2019 <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977).\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 674 &amp; n.10. That right \u201cis not absolute.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 356. A State \u201cmay impose a regulatory restraint on the individual in narrowly-circumscribed situations.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 677-678. The statute imposing the restraint may be upheld only if it is \u201cnarrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The defendants mistakenly argue that under the statute, a district attorney may file a petition to commit anyone who has been convicted of a sexual offense. As previously explained, while such a conviction is required before commitment proceedings may be initiated, commitment proceedings turn on a person\u2019s current mental condition. A district attorney cannot file a petition to commit a person unless it is \u201clikely\u201d that the person possesses the requisite mental condition under the statute. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>This determination must be supported by \u201csufficient facts,\u201d and not merely averred. <em>Id. </em>A person is not temporarily committed under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e), </em>simply on the filing of a petition. Rather, the Commonwealth must make a \u201csufficient showing\u201d based on \u201cevidence before the court,\u201d that the person named in the petition is sexually dangerous, <em>id., </em>and that the person is likely to commit future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>harm. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1. Also, the statute carefully limits when temporary commitment may be sought. It may only be sought when the person named in the petition is scheduled for release prior to the probable cause hearing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>A person temporarily committed is committed to a treatment center. <em>Id. </em>He does not remain incarcerated. These particular features of the temporary commitment scheme reflect the Legislature\u2019s concern with protecting the public from harm by persons who are soon to be released <em>and </em>who are likely to be sexually dangerous. The defendants do not dispute that this interest is both legitimate and compelling. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 747 (1987) (\u201cpreventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal\u201d). Further, the person named in the petition may challenge the \u201cshowing\u201d and resulting temporary commitment. He \u201cmay move the court for relief from such temporary commitment at <em>any time </em>prior to the probable cause determination\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (&lt;?). Thus, if the Commonwealth fails to satisfy its burden, the person may not be temporarily committed. The statute permits temporary commitment only in narrowly circumscribed circumstances, and thus, does not violate the defendants\u2019 substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The lack of guidelines to district attorneys does not deprive the defendants of procedural due process. Procedural due process \u201crequires that a statute or governmental action that has survived substantive due process scrutiny be implemented in a fair manner.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 674. The statute provides ample procedural protections to those subjected to potential commitment, and therefore, does not violate the defendants\u2019 procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">4. <em>Bruno\u2019s claim of collateral estoppel. </em>Bruno asserts that the Commonwealth violated his due process rights because it initiated commitment proceedings against him after two psychiatrists previously had concluded that he was not sexually dangerous under a former version of c. 123A. In November, 1981, Bruno was convicted of aggravated rape. In May, 1985, while Bruno was serving his sentence, the superintendent of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk (M.C.I., Norfolk), moved, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6, to have Bruno committed to the treatment center for a period not to exceed sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>to determine whether he was a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Subsequently, Bruno was committed and examined by two psychiatrists. Each psychiatrist concluded that Bruno was not a sexually dangerous person, and, on January 9, 1986, Bruno was returned to M.C.I., Norfolk to serve the remainder of his sentence. In 1989, tire commitment petition was dismissed for lack of prosecution. On September 20, 1999, the day before Bruno completed serving his sentence on the rape conviction, the Commonwealth filed a petition again seeking his commitment under c. 123A, as recently amended. The judge never reached this issue because he decided the case on the issue of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Bruno principally relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, supra. </em>Unlike Bruno, Travis had been committed to the treatment center for one day to life. After a hearing on his petition for discharge Travis was <em>adjudged </em>to be no longer sexually dangerous and ordered conditionally released. He was recommitted for breach of the conditions of his release, but not before the judge vacated his earlier finding that Travis was no longer sexually dangerous. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 241. The court concluded that \u201cas a matter of fundamental fairness under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a finding that an individual is no longer sexually dangerous must be as immune from subsequent or collateral attack as is a criminal judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, however, limited its holding \u201conly to circumstances in which there has been a finding [pursuant to a \u00a7 5 proceeding] that an individual is not sexually dangerous at that particular time and a subsequent or collateral attack is made on that finding as it relates to the individual\u2019s status at the time the finding was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249 n.5. See <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Gaughan, 471 </em>F.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1973) (due process issues may arise where person, after having been found or adjudicated not sexually dangerous, and in \u201cabsence of intervening misbehavior,\u201d is subjected to subsequent commitment proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Commonwealth does not seek to commit Bruno based on the same grounds on which the superintendent relied in 1985. Contrary to Bruno\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere has been no \u2018interven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ing misbehavior,\u2019 \u201d see <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Gaughan, supra </em>at 797, the Commonwealth\u2019s current petition is not predicated only on Bruno\u2019s prior criminal history (including the rape conviction which satisfies the requisite sexual offense conviction under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1), which reveals a history of drug and alcohol abuse coupled with acts of violence. Rather, it is also based on Bruno\u2019s conduct after the psychiatrists had concluded in 1985 that he was not sexually dangerous and while he was institutionalized. This conduct reveals that: Bruno had refused to pursue sex offender therapy while incarcerated; Bruno\u2019s parole was twice revoked for testing positive for drugs; Bruno tested positive for Hepatitis B<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; and Bruno\u2019s parole was another time revoked for being arrested for allegedly assaulting his girl friend with whom he lived, and for possessing a hypodermic needle. Thus, due to the additional evidence contained in the current commitment petition, the issue therein, whether Bruno is currently a sexually dangerous person, is quite different from whether he was sexually dangerous in 1985. For these reasons, we reject Bruno\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth is precluded from initiating commitment proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">5. <em>Questions in reported case. </em>Final judgment entered on Wilson\u2019s motion to dismiss, thus rendering the report moot. See <em>Matter of the Reorganization of Elec. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. (Bermuda), </em>425 Mass. 419, 420-421 (1997). However, it is entirely appropriate for us to decide the issues raised by the report as the parties have requested. The issues concern aspects of the statute\u2019s temporary commitment and probable cause hearing procedures on which the statute is silent; are of recurring importance to the administration of justice; and are likely to evade appellate review given the short time periods during which a person may be committed pursuant to these procedures prior to trial. See <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, <em>777 </em>(1996). See also <em>Acting Superintendent of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 103 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The parties do not challenge the judge\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to believe that \u201cWilson has pedophilia . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and that there is a high likelihood that Wilson will continue his uncontrollable desires for and is likely to commit further sexual assaults against young boys,\u201d thus requiring his commitment for a period not exceeding sixty days for examination and diagnosis pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Rather, the parties challenge various rulings of law the judge made concerning the temporary commitment and probable cause hearing provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">(i) <em>Standard of proof for temporary commitment. </em>The first reported question involves the standard of proof required to commit a person temporarily under \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>The statute merely mentions a \u201csufficient showing.\u201d The judge ruled that the Commonwealth must meet the probable cause to arrest standard articulated in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, 416 </em>Mass. 221 (1993). Wilson argues that the judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The Commonwealth urges us to adopt the reasonable suspicion standard. That standard justifies only a very brief detention quite different from the temporary, though vastly intrusive, detention permitted under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blais, </em>428 Mass. 294, 298 (1998) (officer with reasonable suspicion that person is operating vehicle while under influence may briefly detain person to administer field sobriety tests); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 585 (1997) (officer who detains person on reasonable suspicion may detain for short period, fifteen minutes, to transport person for identification purposes); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>356 Mass. 642, 646-647 (1970) (officer who detains persons on reasonable suspicion may hold them for \u201cexpedious collateral inquiry which might result in the suspects\u2019 arrest or prompt release\u201d). The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Lamb, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 491, 496-500 (1975), is misplaced. The issue there was the culpability of the Commonwealth in bringing a case to trial approximately ten months after a sixty-day observation period concluded with two psychiatrists reporting that Lamb was sexually dangerous. The current \u00a7 14 (a) addresses such a situation, which has no bearing on the standard of proof required to commit temporarily a person under \u00a7 12 <em>(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The loss of liberty that one faces even when temporarily committed is \u201ctantamount to the infringement of being arrested.\u201d <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Mayas, </em>984 F.2d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 1993) (emergency commitment for fifteen days under New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Mental Hyg. Law, \u00a7 9.39). See <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>109 F.3d 809, 817 (1st Cir. 1997) (emergency commitment for ten days under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12, implicates the Fourth Amendment as if person were arrested). One cannot lawfully be arrested unless probable cause exists or is shown promptly after the arrest. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 227, 232 (in case of warrantless arrest, judicial determination of probable cause made promptly after arrest will satisfy mandate under Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The Commonwealth alternatively has asked that we consider applying a \u201cspecial needs\u201d exception to the probable cause requirement similar to that applied in <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Life-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>77 F.3d 540, 552 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>519 U.S. 911 (1996). That case is distinguishable. There, a \u201cspecial needs\u201d exception permitted officers to enter without a warrant the home of a person for the purpose of detaining her pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(a), </em>after an impartial qualified physician determined her to be dangerous and mentally ill. The issue before the court was not the quantum of proof needed to justify depriving the woman of her liberty, but to justify the warrantless entry onto premises to attend to an emergency situation. Cf. <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra </em>at 817 (where officer seizes person for emergency involuntary commitment under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>[a], </em>without expert determination, there must be probable cause to do so). We see no justification for such an exception here. There is no exigency or emergency about the release dates of inmates likely to be the subject of these petitions, except, arguably, during the first few months following the effective date of the statutory amendments. The Commonwealth concedes that the exigency is the lack of time it was given to gather and present all available evidence of sexual dangerousness prior to <em>these </em>inmates\u2019 release dates, although in Wilson\u2019s case it presented some expert evidence at the temporary commitment hearing, and two expert witnesses at the probable cause hearing. The Commonwealth acknowledges that in future cases it should receive six months\u2019 notice of an inmate\u2019s release date and therefore could obtain the necessary evidence and even complete the final commitment hearing before that date. In such cases the order of commitment would not take effect until the inmate\u2019s parole or discharge. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The judge ruled that the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof at the probable cause hearing under \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>is the same as that required for a probable cause, or bind-over, hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38. It is referred to as the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard. See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850 (1973). \u201cThe minimum quantum of evidence required by this bind-over standard is more than that for probable cause for arrest but less than would \u2018prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Bieber, </em>100 N.Y.S. 2d 821, 823 (N.Y.C. Magis. Ct. 1950). Wilson argues for the application of this standard at the \u00a7 12 (c) hearing. The Commonwealth argues that the probable cause to arrest standard should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Commonwealth contends that, because the \u00a7 12 (c) hearing is only a preliminary hearing, much the same as a preliminary parole revocation hearing, the arrest standard should apply. See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 485 (1972). The Supreme Court held that the arrest standard should apply to a preliminary parole revocation hearing because it was informal in nature and would be followed by a more formal proceeding before the parole board. Such a hearing must be conducted by some impartial person, not necessarily a judge. At the hearing the parolee must be informed of the nature of the alleged parole violations. He has the <em>tight </em>to present favorable information by bringing letters, documents, or individuals; he may call and question persons who reportedly gave information on which the parole violation is based. <em>Id. </em>at 486-487. Such a hearing is vastly different than the hearing afforded under \u00a7 12 (c). The latter includes the right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the right to call witnesses. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(d). </em>It is an adversary proceeding conducted in a formal manner before a judge in the Superior Court, not unlike a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Where a statute is silent as to the standard of proof to be applied at a hearing, our determination of which standard shall apply is not made solely on the basis of the status of the hearing. We are guided by due process considerations, including the nature and complexity of the dispute, the competing interests of the parties, the nature of the hearing provided by statute, i.e., whether it is formal or informal, and its place in the over-all statutory scheme. See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, supra; Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 245. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>held that the standard of proof in grand jury proceedings is the arrest standard, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 451 (1984), but that the directed verdict standard applies to a bind-over hearing, <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>Both proceedings are preliminary to trial, and both look to a common end: holding a defendant for trial. The lower standard is suitable to the informal, ex parte nature of grand jury proceedings, whereas the higher standard is more appropriate to the more formal, adversary nature of the bind-over hearing. The \u00a7 12 (c) commitment hearing is more like the bind-over hearing, with its formal requirements and adversary nature. It also shares with the bind-over hearing statutory requirements for the right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the right to present witnesses on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The directed verdict standard is appropriate to this type of proceeding. The judge found that the Commonwealth met that burden, and We are satisfied that his finding was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">(ii) <em>Expert evidence at temporary commitment hearing. </em>The second reported question involves the need for expert evidence to commit a person temporarily under \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>The statute is silent on the question. The judge concluded such evidence is required, and Wilson argues that the judge was correct. The Commonwealth contends that none is required, relying primarily on insanity defense cases, where the question of a defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility may be raised, in some cases, without the need for expert testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>377 Mass. 638, 644 (1979), and cases cited, and resolved without any expert testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keita, </em>429 Mass. 843, 847 (1999). The analogy is inapt because the Commonwealth is not aided by the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d in cases under c. 123A, unlike criminal prosecutions, and it must affirmatively prove that the person has the requisite current mental condition. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s burden, as we have said, is the probable cause to arrest standard. \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the police officers were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing a crime.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 242, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>386 Mass. 278, 283 (1982). See <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 111 (1975). Analogizing to this standard, probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>cause to commit a person temporarily under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (e), exists when the evidence presented, assuming it is true, is sufficient to warrant a judge in believing that the person is a sexually dangerous person. The evidence must meet this standard as to each element of proof, which includes proof that the person currently \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes such person likely to engage in sexual offenses.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Whether a person suffers from a mental abnormality or personality defect, as well as the predictive behavioral question of the likelihood that a person suffering from such a condition will commit a sexual offense, are matters beyond the range of ordinary experience and require expert testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mass. 60, 67 (1999) (error to exclude expert testimony on posttrau-matic stress disorder or battered woman syndrome, as not within common experience of ordinary juror); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>423 Mass. 436, 447-448 (1996) (expert testimony required to explain likelihood of transmission of sexually transmissible disease from defendant to victim, being matter beyond ken of ordinary juror).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Because a temporary commitment will be sought in circumstances akin to an emergency to hold a person for a short period until a probable cause hearing is held, the expert evidence required for a temporary commitment need not be in the form of live testimony, and need not be extensive, but it must establish probable cause as to those elements of proof. It is not disputed that the Commonwealth met that burden in Wilson\u2019s case. We note that it did so on rather short notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">(iii) <em>Duration of temporary commitment absent expert evidence. </em>In his third reported question the judge asks how long a temporary commitment may be ordered if the Commonwealth fails to adduce expert evidence. He ruled that such a commitment may only last twenty-four hours. Wilson argues that he was correct. We agree, but caution that even a twenty-four hour commitment can be justified only on a showing that is the equivalent of probable cause to arrest. See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 236-238. If a petition for commitment under \u00a7 12 <em>(e) </em>is made without expert evidence meeting the requirements of Part 5 (ii), <em>supra, </em>it must be represented to the judge that .such evidence exists, is not immediately available for presentation, but will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">(iv) <em>Duration of temporary commitment. </em>The fourth reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>question asks how long a person may be temporarily committed under \u00a7 12 <em>(e) </em>pending commencement of the probable cause hearing under \u00a7 12 (c) and <em>(d). </em>The statute does not address the matter. The judge ruled that it must be brief, without assigning any precise length of time. Wilson again argues that the judge was correct. The Commonwealth argues for a reasonable amount of time, and that ten business days is generally what is needed adequately to prepare for the probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The judge ordered the probable cause hearing to begin five calendar days after he ordered Wilson\u2019s temporary commitment. The parties agreed to extend that date by one week, and the judge acceded to their request. The probable cause hearing commenced twelve days after the temporary commitment. The second day of trial commenced two weeks later due to scheduling problems for one Commonwealth witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Due process is a flexible concept capable of \u201cappropriate accommodation of the competing interests involved\u201d in a case. <em>Lotto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 775, 780 (1976), quoting <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 579 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 113 (1990), and cases cited. The probable cause hearing under \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>and <em>id) </em>is a formal adversary proceeding. It typically involves proof from various sources, including police reports, probation records, mental health records, social worker records, victim statements, prison records, military records, and of course, securing expert testimony on short notice. A prosecutor may have developed a substantial file on a person while preparing a particular case, but the issue of sexual dangerousness involves matters beyond the typical criminal prosecution and of which the prosecutor initially may have been unaware. Materials are often needed from agencies in other cities, counties, or States. Due to the length of a person\u2019s imprisonment, such materials likely will have been placed in a storage facility and not easily retrieved. Although a prosecutor would do well to anticipate bringing a proceeding under c. 123A against a likely candidate by developing the file immediately after prosecution, often that may not be possible. Adequate preparation requires time. There will be considerable demands on both counsel. Defense counsel will also require adequate time to prepare a defense to a probable cause hearing, as the defendant has a substantial interest in his freedom. Society also has a substantial interest, namely, being free from sexual predators (if a defendant is indeed such a person), and seeing that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>defendant is treated with basic fairness. We think, on balance, that ten business days is not an unreasonable period of time, and is approximately the amount of time on which the parties agreed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We note that a person may be held for ten days under the emergency commitment procedure created by G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (a), <em>see Ahern </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>109 F.3d 809, 817 (1st Cir. 1997). Other courts have cited statutes authorizing temporary commitments of ten days, and longer. See e.g., <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Van Zandt, </em>554 F. Supp. 68, 71 (S.D. Tex. 1982) (fourteen days); <em>Bension </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>455 F. Supp. 662, 669 (D.D.C. 1978) (not to exceed thirty days); <em>Doremus </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>407 F. Supp. 509, 515 (D. Neb. 1975) (not to exceed sixty days). The brevity of the twenty-four hour requirement in <em>Jenkins, </em>on which the judge relied, stemmed from our concern that a person was being held on a determination of probable cause made not by a neutral magistrate, but by a police officer. Such was not the case here. Wilson was held on the judge\u2019s order only.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We conclude that absent unusual circumstances, a probable cause hearing should commence no later than ten business days after a temporary commitment order is made under \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>We again note that the Commonwealth generally expects to be able to complete a probable cause hearing before an inmate\u2019s discharge date in future cases where it will have received the six-month advance notice of discharge provided by \u00a7 12 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(v) <em>Expert testimony at probable cause hearing. </em>The fifth reported question involves the need for expert testimony at the probable cause hearing. The judge ruled that it is required. We agree. As discussed at Part 5 (i), <em>supra, </em>this is a formal adversary proceeding, with the right to cross-examine expressly afforded by \u00a7 12 <em>(d) </em>(3). The Commonwealth presented two experts at Wilson\u2019s probable cause hearing on short notice. Both experts interviewed Wilson, and both opined that he is a sexually dangerous person. The judge credited their testimony and ordered Wilson committed for sixty days under \u00a7 13 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">(vi) <em>Segregation of persons committed from persons adjudged sexually dangerous. </em>The sixth reported question asks whether persons committed under \u00a7\u00a7 12 <em>(e) </em>and 13 <em>(a) </em>must be held separately from persons adjudged sexually dangerous. The judge ruled that they must be held separately. In his order for commitment the judge directed that Wilson be held apart from persons adjudged sexually dangerous, but also ordered that Wilson receive treatment while held.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The judge found no facts to support his segregation order, and the record is sparse on the matter. The order appears to be based on (1) a provision in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 35, which states that an alcoholic who is committed thereunder must be \u201choused and treated separately from convicted criminals,\u201d and (2) a requirement that pretrial detainees at the Suffolk County Jail be housed in conditions \u201csuperior\u201d to those, of inmates under sentence. See <em>Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail </em>v. <em>Eisenstadt, </em>360 F. Supp. 676, 686 (D. Mass. 1973), aff\u2019d, 494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, </em>419 U.S. 977 (1974). The record before us is inadequate as a basis for the judge\u2019s segregation order, and does not permit us to give a reasoned and intelligent answer to the question reported. We note, however, that c. 123A does not require a segregation of the type ordered, and that the superintendent of the treatment center has promulgated rules and regulations regarding persons temporarily committed consistent with a management plan for the facility as a whole that comports with constitutional requirements as determined by the United States District Court. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Greenblatt, </em>53 F. Supp. 2d 117, 134-137 (D. Mass. 1999). Those regulations provide that persons temporarily committed shall be assigned to an observation unit within the main section of the treatment center, and that they shall be managed in a manner similar to management for the facility as a whole. Management of the treatment center has been committed to the discretion of the Commissioner of Correction, subject to the jurisdiction of the department. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 2. There has been no showing that he has abused that discretion in holding those temporarily committed in accordance with those rules and regulations. Nor has there been any showing that the manner and conditions under which those temporarily committed are held is unconstitutional. Similarly, there is no basis for that aspect of the commitment order that directs treatment for Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>The orders dismissing the petitions seeking commitment of Bruno, Davila, and Wilson are vacated and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings. Those portions of Wilson\u2019s commitment order directing that he be held separately and that he receive treatment while under observation are vacated; the order for his commitment for sixty days is in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\"> General Laws c. 123A, as amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, has remained unchanged since the 1999 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\"> Bruno was scheduled for release on September 21, 1999, after completing a ten-to-twenty-year sentence imposed on November 2, 1981, for aggravated rape.
