Goodrow (Goodrow) commenced a class action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Lane Bryant, Inc. (Lane Bryant), for failing to pay overtime compensation at the rate of one and one-half times her hourly rate for the hours she worked in excess of forty in any work week, contrary to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. She also sought individually triple damages under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 IB. After a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge found for Goodrow and awarded her damages in the amount of $3,773.58,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plus interest, costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Lane Bryant appealed, claiming (1) Goodrow was exempt from the provisions of \u00a7 1A because she was a \u201cbona fide executive\u201d; (2) the judge\u2019s method of calculating overtime compensation for Goodrow, a salaried employee, was incorrect; and (3) G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB, are unconstitutionally vague as applied. We granted its application for direct appellate review. The judge further found, as a matter of discretion, that individually Goodrow was not entitled to triple damages. Goodrow appealed, claiming the judge lacked discretion to deny triple damages after finding a violation of \u00a7 1A. We granted her application for direct appellate review. We reverse the'judgment for Goodrow and affirm the judgment denying punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">1. <em>Background facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge. Lane Bryant operates a nationwide chain of retail stores that sell clothing and related goods to larger women. Goodrow began working at the Lane Bryant store in the Greendale Mall in Worcester on November 9, 1993. After a brief period of training Goodrow was transferred to the Lane Bryant store in Auburn, where she remained until she resigned, on April 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">On an average day, two or three employees worked in the Auburn store: a store sales manager, a cosales manager, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>sales associate. Goodrow\u2019s job title was \u201cco-sales manager.\u201d Store sales managers and cosales managers were paid on a weekly salary basis. Sales associates, who were generally part-time workers, were paid on an hourly basis. Goodrow never worked less than forty hours per week, and ordinarily worked forty-six to forty-seven hours per week. During holiday seasons, Goodrow worked an additional five to seven hours per week. Her initial salary was $320 per week. On March 6, 1994, Good-row\u2019s pay was raised to $325 per week. On March 12, 1995, her pay was raised again to $342 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Goodrow\u2019s daily duties were as follows. She arrived at approximately 9:30 a.m., when she would turn on the cash registers, put cash in the registers, and examine the \u201cregister mail.\u201d At 10 a.m. the store opened to customers. For the rest of the day she and the other employees performed retail sales work, including such tasks as waiting on and assisting customers, ringing up sales, setting up special promotional sales displays, replacing sold items on shelves, racks, or hangers, and keeping the store neat and presentable. Goodrow\u2019s other duties included cleaning bathrooms, putting out trash, and providing on-the-job guidance and assistance to sales associates. At about 12:30 p.m. the part-time sales associate would go home and another cosales manager would arrive and stay until closing while Goodrow remained until 6:30 p.m. When Goodrow was the cosales manager who arrived at 12:30 p.m., she would stay until the store closing process was completed at about 9:30 p.m. The closing process included cleaning up the premises, vacuuming the floor, replacing light bulbs, washing mirrors, dusting, closing the cash registers, putting away the day\u2019s receipts, making bank deposits, and locking the store for the night. Whenever Goodrow left the store her pocketbook and bags were checked by another employee pursuant to a company policy designed to minimize employee theft. Cosales managers such as Goodrow did not have authority to hire, fire, or discipline other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">During the period Goodrow worked in the Auburn store, the position of store sales manager was left unfilled on two occasions that lasted approximately four and ten weeks, respectively. Goodrow, the cosales manager with seniority on those occasions, assumed some of the responsibilities ordinarily held by the sales manager. Her assumption of those duties was unofficial and resulted in no increase in compensation. During those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>two periods the Lane Bryant district manager visited the store more often, sometimes as many as three or four times each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Prior to the time of Goodrow\u2019s employment cosales managers were paid on a salary basis plus some overtime. Then, in 1991, they were paid only straight salary with no overtime. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) investigated Lane Bryant\u2019s overtime payment practices to determine whether they complied with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219. In November, 1992, one year before Goodrow joined Lane Bryant, the company reached an accord with the DOL. Under the terms of that agreement Lane Bryant was to \u201cpay [its] co-managers on a fluctuating workweek basis\u201d beginning November 15, 1992. That agreement further provided that, \u201cin order to avoid weekly computations and to provide additional compensation, co-managers, in accordance with [Field Operations Handbook] \u00a7 32b04b(a),[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] will receive an extra half-time based on their salary divided by 40 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Goodrow testified that, at the time she was hired in 1993, the Lane Bryant district manager who interviewed her told her that she would receive eight dollars per hour, which \u201caveraged out to $320 a week for forty hours,\u201d and that, for all hours she worked in excess of forty, she would be paid at half of her hourly rate. On March 15, 1995, Goodrow signed a memorandum explaining the compensation scheme as it applied to her first pay raise. In pertinent part, the memorandum read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cAs a Co-Sales Managers [szc] (\u2018CSM\u2019) of Lane Bryant, you are an Exempt, Salaried associate. This means that you will be paid a weekly salary for hours worked each week. For all hours worked in excess of 40 per week, you will receive a supplemental rate of pay equal to one-half (.5) your regular rate of pay. . . . Please note that any benefits to which you may be entitled (sick, vacation, holiday, etc.) are paid based on a 40-hour week, or 8 hours per day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The memorandum also included the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>\u201cExample (Based on 45 hour workweek): Your Personal Calculation:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZm\">$308.00 X 52 wks = $16,016.00 $325.60X52 = $16,931.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQK\">$3.85 X 52 wks X 5 = $1,001.00 $4.07 X52X5 = $1,058.20</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">Goodrow resigned, voluntarily, on April 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-19\">2. <em>\u201cBona fide executive\u201d exemption. </em>Lane Bryant argues that Goodrow was exempt from the overtime provisions of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, because she was a \u201cbona fide executive\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A (3), especially during the periods of time when she temporarily assumed the responsibilities of a store manager. Lane Bryant contends that, because neither the statute nor the corresponding regulations define \u201cbona fide executive,\u201d and absent any Massachusetts appellate decision construing the term, we should look to the ELSA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the Federal regulations to determine whether Goodrow was an exempt employee. Lane Bryant further argues that employees who have limited control or discretion in the workplace and who spend the majority of their time on nonexempt tasks may nevertheless be considered exempt as bona fide executives under the FLSA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and should receive similar treatment under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A (3). Generally, the party claiming an exemption from the provisions of a statute has the burden to show that it is entitled to the exemption. Cf. <em>New England Legal Found. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>423 Mass. 602, 609 (1996) (burden on taxpayer claiming exemption to prove entitlement); <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mark IV Homes, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 575, 580 (1982) (burden on party claiming exemption under G. L. c. 93A to prove entitlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Where a \u201cstatute does not effectively define [terms] we have said that the Legislature should be supposed to have adopted the common meaning of the word, as assisted by a consideration of the historical origins of the enactment.\u201d <em>Jancey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>421 Mass. 482, 490 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 603 (1998), quoting <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>382 Mass. 354, 357, appeal dismissed, 452 U.S. 933 (1981). The legislative history of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, provides no guidance as to the meaning of the term \u201cbona fide executive.\u201d See St. 1960, c. 813; 1960 Senate Doc. No. 1; 1960 House Doc: Nos. 1348, 2414, 3100; 1959 House Doc. No. 2666. In such instances we may look to interpretations of analogous Federal statutes for guidance, see <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 361 (1995), but we are not bound by them. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 441 (1995); <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 163 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">There is also the matter of preemption. Title 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 218(a) makes clear that the wage and hour standards set forth in the FLSA are the floor, and that \u201cthe FLSA does not preempt any existing state law that establishes a higher minimum wage or a shorter workweek than the federal statute.\u201d <em>Cosme Nieves </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>v. <em>Deshler, </em>786 F.2d 445, 452 (1st Or.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 824 (1986). Conversely, a State law may be preempted by the FLSA if it conflicts with the FLSA, or if it is impossible for a third party to comply with both the FLSA and the State law. See <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 375-376 (1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1036 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1) provides: \u201c[S]ection 207 of this title shall not apply with respect to . . . any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d This provision is nearly identical to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A (3). However, unlike its State counterpart, it is illuminated by interpretive regulations defining and delimiting the terms \u201cexecutive, administrative, or professional.\u201d See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.0 et seq. (1999). To determine whether an employee is an \u201cexecutive,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> establishes a \u201clong test\u201d for employees who earn between $155 and $250 a week, and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.119 establishes a \u201cshort test\u201d for those earning more than $250 a week.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Goodrow was not a bona fide execu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>five under either test. Her primary duty at Lane Bryant did not consist of \u201cmanagement of the enterprise\u201d or a subdivision thereof, nor did it involve determining Lane Bryant\u2019s over-all course or policies. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>912 F.2d 1066, 1070 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1086 (1991); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(a). Despite her temporary assumption of managerial duties at the Auburn store, Goodrow did not spend more than fifty per cent of her time at Lane Bryant performing managerial duties. \u201cAs a \u2018rule of thumb,\u2019 for tasks to constitute an employee\u2019s primary duty, \u2018the employee must devote more than fifty percent of [her] time to these duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>West </em>v. <em>Anne Arundel County, </em>137 F.3d 752, 763 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1048 (1998), quoting <em>Shockley </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>997 F.2d 18, 26 (4th Cir. 1993). See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.103, 541.206(b). At best, Goodrow customarily and regularly directed the work of only one part-time sales associate at the store, not the two or more required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(b) and (f). Goodrow had no authority or influence over any decision to hire, fire, promote or demote any other employee in the store. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(c). She did not exercise any discretionary powers in the execution of her job because all decisions she made concerning the business of the store were subject to the approval of upper level managers. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(d). Finally, Goodrow spent well over forty per cent of her time at Lane Bryant engaged in nonmanagerial activity. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(e). She was primarily occupied with carrying out the day-to-day affairs of the retail business.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Nor do we think that Goodrow was a bona fide executive within the common understanding of those words. Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 794 (1993) defines \u201cexecutive\u201d as \u201cone who holds a position of administrative or managerial responsibility in a business or other organization.\u201d \u201cAdministrative\u201d pertains to \u201cthe management of public affairs [or] the principles, practices, and rationalized techniques employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>achieving the objectives or aims of an organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. To \u201cmanage\u201d is \u201cto control and direct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1372. In a related context, the Legislature defined a managerial employee as one who \u201cparticipate [s] to a substantial degree in formulating or determining policy.\u201d G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1. \u201cBona fide\u201d is defined as \u201cin good faith without fraud or deceit. . . . [synonym] authentic.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Although her title was \u201cco-manager,\u201d Goodrow did not hold a position of managerial responsibility within the Lane Bryant organization. She did not have any significant control or discretion over the principles, practices, and strategies applied by Lane Bryant in achieving its business objectives, and she did not participate to any degree whatsoever in formulating or determining Lane Bryant\u2019s policies. She performed the duties of the sales manager on two occasions for a total of only fourteen weeks, but they were not her regular duties, she received no pay differential for the extra work, and the district manager could be seen as the actual temporary manager in light of her stepped up visits to the store. A manager in name does not a manager make. Goodrow\u2019s duties and her modest level of compensation do not comport with what is commonly understood as an \u201cexecutive\u201d position. The common understanding of the term, which we apply in the absence of any Massachusetts statutory or regulatory definition, is at least as beneficial to the employee as the Federal definition. Consequently, there is no preemption of our gloss. The judge correctly concluded that Goodrow was not employed as a bona fide executive at Lane Bryant and thus was not exempt from the overtime provisions of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">3. <em>Calculation of overtime. </em>Lane Bryant argues that the judge erred in calculating Goodrow\u2019s overtime pay because the method he used to define her regular rate of pay was inconsistent with the applicable Massachusetts regulation, 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02, tenth par. (1993), as well as the Federal regulations. Lane Bryant further argues that because G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, is largely based on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), and application of the \u201cfluctuating workweek\u201d method of calculating overtime as described in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114 is an acceptable means of complying with Federal law, its application also must be permissible under Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The judge concluded that G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, requires that all employees receive overtime at the rate of one and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>times the hourly rate they earn in a forty-hour week. His interpretation is more beneficial to the employee than the method of payment permitted under the Federal regulations, but it ignores the Massachusetts regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 1A, provides that \u201cno employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees ... for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d The corresponding regulation in effect during Goodrow\u2019s employment provided that the basic minimum overtime rate was \u201c1 Vz times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.\u201d 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.03(1) (1993). The term \u201cregular rate of pay,\u201d however, is defined neither in the statute nor in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Title 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defines \u201c[r]egular [h]ourly [w]age rate\u201d as \u201cthe amount that the employee is regularly paid for each hour of work. When an employee is paid on a piece work basis, salary, or any basis other than an hourly rate, the regular hourly rate shall be determined by dividing the total hours worked during the week into the employee\u2019s total earnings.\u201d This regulation recognizes that a salaried employee\u2019s regular hourly rate<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may fluctuate on a weekly basis depending on the number of hours worked, and is inversely proportional to the number of hours worked. The nonexempt salaried employee is still entitled under 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.03(1) (1993) to receive one and one-half times that rate for overtime hours worked, but that requirement is satisfied by paying the employee an additional fifty percent of the regular hourly rate for the overtime hours worked. This is so because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>employee\u2019s salary is considered to include \u201cstraight time\u201d for all hours worked, including the overtime hours. Had this not been the case the regulation would have provided that the regular hourly rate be determined by dividing weekly salary by forty hours. The check on this method of payment is found in the same regulation, which provides that \u201c[r]egardless of the basis used, whether time rate, commission basis or piece rate, the employee shall be paid not less than the applicable minimum wage each week.\u201d 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02. We must determine whether this method of calculating overtime for a nonexempt salaried employee is at least as beneficial to the employee as what she would receive under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), which is nearly identical to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, provides that \u201cno employer shall employ any of his employees ... for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d Four years after Congress enacted the FLSA, the Supreme Court construed the term \u201cregular rate\u201d as \u201c[w]age divided by hours. ...\u201d <em>Overnight Motor Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Missel, </em>316 U.S. 572, 580 n.16 (1942). Three years later, the Supreme Court further explained that the regular rate of pay is \u201cthe hourly rate actually paid the employee for the normal, non-overtime workweek for which he is employed.\u201d <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Co., </em>325 U.S. 419, 424 (1945). In 1968, the DOL promulgated several interpretive regulations governing the calculation of overtime compensation for several types of employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.109 (2000) the \u201cregular rate\u201d of pay is a rate of pay per hour. The hourly rate for employees paid on an hourly basis is the \u201cregular rate,\u201d and overtime compensation is one and one-half times the hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours worked in excess of forty during the week. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.110 (2000). For employees paid on a salary basis, the \u201cregular hourly rate of pay, on which time and a half must be paid, is computed by dividing the salary by the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>hours which the salary is intended to compensate.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.113 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The regular rate of pay for salaried employees whose hourly work week varies, and who have an understanding with their employers that their fixed salary constitutes straight-time pay for whatever hours they are called on to work in a work week is calculated by dividing the regular weekly pay by the total number of hours worked in the week. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114 (2000). The overtime rate of pay in this scenario is calculated by multiplying one-half the regular rate of pay by the number of hours worked in excess of forty hours.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>This is the so-called \u201cfluctuating work week\u201d method of calculating overtime. It falls heavily on those at the lower rungs of the economic ladder, but its use has been approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Overnight Motor Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Missel, supra </em>at 580. It is the same as the method of calculating overtime for nonexempt salaried employees under 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02 and 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.03(1). See <em>Valerio </em>v. <em>Putnam Assocs., Inc., </em>173 F.3d 35, 39-40 (1st Cir. 1999). The Commissioner of Labor and Industries has authority to provide lower income salaried employees with a more favorable method of calculating overtime than the method used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Lane Bryant calculated Goodrow\u2019s overtime under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>fluctuating work week method, but it used a denominator of forty hours rather than the actual number of hours worked in a given week. The DOL approved Lane Bryant\u2019s use of this method to calculate overtime for cosales managers. This method is permitted under the DOL Field Operations Handbook, although it is not included in either the Federal or the Massachusetts regulations. See note 4, <em>infra. </em>It affords employers an easier means of calculation because it uses the same denominator in the calculation every week. The trade-off, in the view of DOL, is that it affords more money to the employee. Because this method resulted in more overtime pay than Goodrow was entitled to receive under either the State or Federal regulations, she has not been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The trial judge concluded that even if G. L. c. 151 permits the fluctuating work week method of calculating overtime, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114 requires that there be a \u201cclear mutual understanding\u201d of the parties that any overtime compensation will be calculated by that method. Section 778.114 contains no such requirement. It requires only that the parties have a \u201cclear mutual understanding . . . that the fixed salary is compensation (apart from overtime premiums) for the hours worked each week, whatever their number, rather than for working 40 hours or some other fixed weekly work period.\u201d See <em>Valerio </em>v. <em>Putnam Assocs., Inc., supra </em>at 40. Goodrow testified that she always understood how she would be paid, and that the March 15, 1995, written memorandum expresses the same method by which she was paid from the first day of her employment. The absence during seventeen months of employment of any indication that Goodrow did not understand how she would be paid is evidence of a clear mutual understanding concerning how she was paid. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Her understanding as to how her overtime compensation would be calculated need not have been exhaustive, see <em>id. </em>at 40, but here it was. The March 15 memorandum made clear not only that Goodrow\u2019s salary covered all hours worked each week, but also included examples of how overtime would be calculated. In that respect Goodrow received more detail than was required. <em>Id. </em>As matter of law, based on Good-row\u2019s testimony and the terms of the March 15 memorandum, Goodrow and Lane Bryant had a \u201cclear mutual understanding\u201d that Goodrow\u2019s salary would serve as compensation, apart from overtime, for all hours worked each week. To the extent that 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02, tenth par., does not require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cclear mutual understanding,\u201d it is preempted by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">4. <em>Vagueness. </em>Having determined that the Massachusetts statute and regulations permit a fluctuating workweek method of calculating overtime for nonexempt salaried employees, we need not address Lane Bryant\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">5. <em>Treble damages. </em>Because we hold that Lane Bryant did not violate G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, Goodrow\u2019s cross appeal from the denial of her claim of treble damages is moot. However, the issue is likely to arise in the class action, trial of which has been severed from the trial of Goodrow\u2019s individual claim, so we express our opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 IB, provides in relevant part that, \u201cif any person is paid by an employer less than such overtime rate of compensation [required by \u00a7 1A], such person may recover in a civil action three times the full amount of such overtime rate of compensation less any amount actually paid to him or her by the employer.\u201d Goodrow contends that, in light of the fact that the Legislature declined to require a showing of intent or wilfulness with respect to the treble damages provision, the plain meaning of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the context of this sentence is that an employee illegally deprived of overtime compensation is permitted but not required to bring a civil action in which, if successful, she is entitled to recover treble damages. The word \u201cmay,\u201d argues Goodrow, therefore relates to a plaintiff\u2019s option to initiate a civil action for damages rather than to the amount of damages recoverable under the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Multiple damages such as the treble damages at issue here \u201care \u2018essentially punitive in nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 322 (1993), quoting <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990). See <em>Kansallis Fin. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Fern, </em>421 Mass. 659, 672 (1996). They are allowed only when expressly authorized by statute, <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 813 (1991), and are ordinarily applied by the Legislature \u201cagainst those defendants with a higher degree of culpability than that sufficient to ground simple liability.\u201d See <em>Kansallis Fin. Ltd., supra. </em>Punitive damages may be awarded for conduct that is \u201coutrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u201d <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 17a (1998), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00a7 908(2) (1979). In the instant case, the judge found that, in light of the uncertainty of the state of the law in Massachusetts and the fact that Lane Bryant relied on the advice of counsel and followed law and procedures apparently sanctioned elsewhere, there was \u201cno legal or equitable basis\u201d on which to impose multiple damages. We agree. We find nothing in the record to support a finding that Lane Bryant intentionally or wilfully violated Massachusetts law or that its conduct was \u201cevil in motive\u201d or showed a \u201creckless indifference to the rights of others,\u201d and we therefore decline to award treble damages. To do otherwise absent evidence of heightened culpability would very likely constitute an \u201carbitrary or irrational deprivation[] of property,\u201d <em>TXO Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Alliance Resources Corp., </em>509 U.S. 443 (1993) (Kennedy, J., concurring), and thus would be constitutionally impermissible. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The judgment in favor of Goodrow is reversed and judgment for Lane Bryant is to enter therein. The judgment denying punitive damages is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\"> By order dated March 11, 1999, the trial judge had severed and stayed all proceedings on the class action pending the resolution and appeal of Good-row\u2019s individual claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\"> A stipulated figure representing single damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> The United States Department of Labor Field Operations Handbook \u00a7 32b04b(a) (entitled \u201cSalaried Employees, Irregular hours worked\u201d) (1967) provides: \u201cIf an employee is given a stipulated salary <em>with the understanding that it constitutes straight time pay for all hours he works, </em>and if his hours of work fluctuate from week to week, his regular rate of pay ordinarily will vary from week to week in accordance with the number of hours worked each week.
