P. 64, a judge in the Probate and Family Court reserved and reported four questions concerning the financial obligations of a deceased father\u2019s estate to his minor child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201c1. whether a testator, survived by a minor child to whom he owed . . . support pursuant to a court order, may disinherit that child pursuant to the [omitted child statute,] G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 20;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u201c2. whether the child\u2019s claim for support is in the nature of a preferred creditor\u2019s claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">\u201c3. whether a posthumous support obligation includes assets of an inter vivos trust; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201c4. whether an order to secure postmajority educational support may be made in the circumstances of posthumous support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">We discuss the background facts and applicable law before answering the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">1. <em>Background. </em>The father died on November 20, 1994, at the age of fifty-five. He was divorced at the time of his death. He was survived by two children, an adult daughter from his only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>marriage, and a minor child (child) born on September 10, 1990, to the mother, L.W.K. (mother), to whom he was not married. The mother was forty-two years old at the time of the child\u2019s birth. Prior to the father\u2019s death, the mother brought a paternity action to establish him as her child\u2019s father. On June 11, 1992, after a hearing, a judge in the Probate and Family Court so determined, and ordered the father to pay child support of $100 a week to the mother, the order to remain in effect \u201cuntil further order of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The father paid the required child support until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On June 3, 1994, the father executed a will that disinherited his minor child, leaving to her the amount of one dollar. He further directed that she \u201cshall not be considered as an heir-at-law of mine\u201d nor \u201ca child of mine or issue of mine for any purpose under this will.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The will provided that, after the payment of specific monetary bequests and disposition of certain tangible property, the remainder of the estate be devised and bequeathed to a trust (trust) that the father had previously established on February 3, 1977. On the same day the father also signed a final amendment to the trust that restated all of the trust terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trust instrument authorized the trustees, on the father\u2019s death, to collect various life insurance policies and any devises and bequests made by the father to the trust. The trust named the father\u2019s sister (sister) and his adult daughter (the only child from his quondam marriage) as the sole beneficiaries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>After the father\u2019s death, the sister was appointed executrix of his estate. She filed a Federal estate tax return that listed the father\u2019s total gross estate as $800,398, and a taxable estate of $648,722.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On the death of the father, the mother filed a claim for Social Security benefits on her child\u2019s behalf based on the father\u2019s participation in the Social Security system. It was determined that the child, as a qualified minor, was entitled to receive at that time $849 a month in Social Security benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The child is entitled to receive these benefits until she turns eighteen or until her nineteenth birthday if she has not finished high school. The child is now ten years old. Her mother has the sole responsibility for her care and upbringing. The child\u2019s only source of income is the Social Security benefits, in addition to support from her mother.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">A guardian ad litem, appointed to represent the child\u2019s interests in the father\u2019s estate, filed a complaint for modification of the child support order entered in 1992, and a notice of claim against the estate seeking further support payments for the child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Some time later, a petition for authority to compromise was filed in the estate probate proceeding in which the mother and the sister (executrix of the father\u2019s estate) agreed to a settlement of all claims of the child in the amount of $10,000. A second guardian ad litem, appointed to represent the child\u2019s interests, filed an opposition to the compromise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After a hearing, the compromise was dismissed and an attorney was appointed to represent the child in the modification action. The judge allowed a joint motion filed by the mother and the executrix to amend the complaint for modification to add the trustees as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The parties submitted a statement of agreed facts and made a joint request for rulings. The judge ruled preliminarily that (1) the father could not disinherit his minor child to defeat his sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>port obligations; (2) the assets of the inter vivos trust and the estate are subject to the child\u2019s support claim; (3) she had the authority to enter an order against the father\u2019s estate for future educational support of the child; and (4) the child\u2019s receipt of Social Security benefits did not bar further claims for support. Because the judge determined that the case presented questions of first impression, and that answers to the questions materially affected the merits of the claim for modification, she reserved and reported four questions and stayed the proceedings pending an appellate ruling. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">2. <em>Questions one and two. </em>For ease of discussion we address in tandem the first two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Testamentary freedom is not absolute, and certain preexisting obligations have priority over all testamentary dispositions. See, e.g., <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>305 Mass. 532, 535 (1940) (testamentary dispositions subject to the \u201cclaims of creditors and to administration expenses\u201d); G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 15, 16 (spousal elective share takes priority over testamentary dispositions). See also H.J. Alperin &amp; L.D. Shubow, Summary of Basic Law \u00a7 22.113, at 565 (3d ed. 1996). A legally enforceable obligation to pay child support, like other financial obligations of the testator, takes precedence over testamentary dispositions and must be satisfied prior to any distribution of assets under the will.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>parent charged with an obligation to support his<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> child cannot nullify that legal obligation by disinheriting his child pursuant to G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Beyond satisfaction of his support obligation, however, a parent is free to exercise his testamentary discretion with respect to a minor child, as all others, and may disinherit her.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In order to answer questions one and two, therefore, we must resolve whether the order to the father to support his minor child survived his death. Specifically we must decide whether a child support order, made pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, during the father\u2019s life, creates an obligation on his estate to continue support until his child reaches majority, or whether any obligations for her future support were extinguished by his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The duty of a parent to support a minor child is statutory. See, e.g., G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28; G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37; G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9. The question, therefore, is one of statutory interpretation. We conclude that the death of the father does not extinguish his duty to support his minor child. We do so for several reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>First, contrary to the dissent, we are not legislating but applying unequivocal policy mandates of the Legislature to the specific facts of this case. For decades extending back into the Nineteenth Century, the Legislature has mandated and this court has recognized that parents have an obligation to support their minor children. The Legislature has expressed that duty in unmistakable terms: \u201cIt is the public policy of the commonwealth that dependent children shall be maintained, as completely as possible, from the resources of their parents thereby relieving or avoiding, at least in part, the burden borne by the citizens of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1998, c. 463, \u00a7 101 (approved with emergency preamble, Jan. 14, 1999).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Legislature has also decreed that the statutes concerning child support enforcement \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate\u201d that public policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Second, in this Commonwealth there have been recent and profound legislative changes that have increased significantly the obligation of parents to support their children.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Federal law has also increased significantly the obligations of parents for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>child support.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, both State and Federal law are explicit in providing for the broadest possible support of minor children by their parents. Moreover, under the Child Support Enforcement Act an \u201c[ojbligor\u201d is defined as \u201can individual, or <em>the estate of a decedent, </em>who owes <em>or may owe </em>a duty of support, or who is liable under a child support obligation,\u201d plainly suggesting that the Legislature intended liability for child support obligations to survive the death of a parent (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1A. That the child support order was entered in a paternity proceeding other than a divorce proceeding is of no significance, for the Legislature has mandated that children born out of wedlock are entitled to the same rights and protections of the law as all other children. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Third, the Legislature has imposed an explicit duty on parents who divorce and those who give birth to children out of wedlock to support their minor child until they attain their majority. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 1, imposes child support responsibility on a parent from the child\u2019s birth to the age of eighteen, and beyond that period if certain statutory and readily discernible circumstances exist.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 594-595 (1987). See also G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37 (imposing support obligations on separated parents of minor children). Where its terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>are unambiguous, a statute must be held to mean what it plainly expresses. See 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.01 (6th ed. rev. 2000). In this case, the child support order is in force until the child is emancipated or \u201cuntil further order of the Court.\u201d Neither of these contingencies has occurred. We are not free to add a further requirement, beyond what the Legislature has declared, that the father is responsible for the support of his child bom out of wedlock \u201cfrom [her] birth up to the age of eighteen,\u201d G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1, but only until his death.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Our ruling is also consistent with the declared public policy of this Commonwealth \u201cthat dependent children shall be maintained, as completely as possible, from the resources of their parents.\u201d G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. It would be inconsistent with that and other mandates of the Legislature to conclude that a father\u2019s court-ordered support obligation abated on his death, depriving his young daughter, of the resources necessary for her maintenance. In an intact family, minor children have security against the loss of support when one parent dies, even in the case of testamentary disinheritance, because of the spousal elective share. G. L. c. 191, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16. See also G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 1 (spouse\u2019s right to share of property not disposed of by will); G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 1 (surviving spouse listed first in schedule of persons entitled to appointment to administer intestate\u2019s estate); G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1 (right of surviving spouse to bring wrongful death action). Children' of divorced parents and children bom out of wedlock do not have the same protection. For this reason, we are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that our holding would unfairly discriminate against children from intact families.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Fourth, a conclusion that child support obligations survive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the death of a parent is consistent with prevailing contemporary legal authority. See, e.g., <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>166 Vt. 414, 418 (1997), citing <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>193 Va. 631, 636 (1952) (\u201ctext writers and a decided majority of cases hold that under modern conditions liability of the father is not necessarily terminated by his death, and that there is no sound reason, unless prohibited by statute, why his estate should not be charged with his obligation to support his minor children\u201d). See also <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Edelman, </em>65 Wyo. 271, 291-292 (1948), in which the Wyoming Supreme Court reached the same conclusion fifty years ago. The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act \u00a7 316 (c), 9A U.L.A. 102 (Master ed. 1998), reflects this prevailing view: \u201cUnless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child but <em>not by the death of a parent obligated to support the child.\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). The comment to that section explains: \u201c[Tjhis section terminates the obligation of a parent to support a child, only upon the child\u2019s emancipation. The <em>parent\u2019s death does not terminate the child\u2019s right to support, </em>and the court may make an appropriate order establishing the obligation of the deceased parent\u2019s estate to the child\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Finally, there is nothing in G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 20, that prohibits such a construction. That statute \u201cforbids nothing and compels nothing; it merely provides a framework within which private testamentary decisions may be freely made.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>371 Mass. 262, 265 (1976). Our conclusion interpreting the legislative mandate that child support obligations do not abate at death will not create any uncertainty for estate planning purposes. See <em>Hornung </em>v. <em>Estate of Lagerquist, </em>155 Mont. 412, 419 (1970) (\u201cthe enforcement of an obligation for future support presents no greater problems than any other unliquidated claim against an estate\u201d). Unlike alimony, an order to provide for the support of a minor child terminates at a specific age. Accordingly, the total amount of child support that a parent is obliged to pay may be readily determined \u2014 in contrast to an order to provide alimony that in many circumstances terminates only when a spouse remarries (a date uncertain in the future) or on the recipient\u2019s death (similarly uncertain).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The protection of minor children, most especially those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>may be stigmatized by their \u201cillegitimate\u201d status or who are not supported by divorced parents fully capable of doing so, has been a hallmark of legislative action and of the jurisprudence of this court. Consistent with the public policy so clearly articulated by the Legislature, the estate of the father in this case is charged with his court-imposed obligations to support his minor child. Beyond satisfaction of those obligations \u2014 which we address further in our discussion concerning question four \u2014 the father may disinherit his minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">3. <em>Question three. </em>We consider whether the father\u2019s support obligation can be satisfied from the assets of his inter vivos trust. We conclude that all the assets of the inter vivos trust established by the father, under which he was the sole beneficiary entitled to funds at his request, and which he solely retained the power to modify, alter or revoke, must be included in the estate and, as such, must be made available to satisfy his child support obligations. Such a ruling is consistent with our law in closely related areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We have held that, for the purpose of determining a surviving spouse\u2019s elective share, G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 15, assets in an inter vi-vos trust over which the decedent had a general power of appointment, exercisable by deed or by will, constitute the estate of the deceased spouse. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. Burkin, 390 Mass. 864, 867 (1984).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Appeals Court has similarly recognized that creditors can reach the assets of an inter vivos trust to \u201cthe maximum amount which the trustee . . . could pay to [the trustee] or apply for his benefit,\u201d in order to satisfy the trustee\u2019s debts to them. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 636 (1979). See <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, ante </em>390 (2000). See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 156 (2) (1959); Restatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 34.3 (3) comments h, j <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(1990). Our earlier decisions reason that, as to property that a settlor may appoint to himself or his executors, the property could have been devoted to fulfilling debts or a widow\u2019s \u201cspecial interests which should be recognized.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Bur-kin, supra </em>at 869. We see no reason not to adopt the same reasoning for purposes of payment of a child obligation debt, and the defendants offer none.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">4. <em>Question four. </em>We are asked to determine whether an order to secure postminority educational support may be made posthumously. We note, preliminarily, that on a related issue the judge concluded that the Social Security benefits received by the child after her father\u2019s death were not a \u201csubstitute\u201d for his child support obligations, but a credit to him. The judge did not report that question to us. However, that issue is inextricably connected to our consideration of the posthumous order to pay some amount for the child\u2019s college education: both issues require us to consider whether the death of a parent warrants reconsideration and possible modification of the original child-support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The judge found that the child would be entitled to receive monthly Social Security benefits until her eighteenth birthday, and possibly to the age of nineteen if she has not completed her high school education as of that date. She further found that the child\u2019s mother would be more than sixty years of age at the time the child is ready to enter college and that other than the support the child receives now, \u201cthere are no other sources of funds for her present and future needs.\u201d The judge concluded that she had the authority \u201cto set aside a lump sum in trust as security for [the child\u2019s] future educational support if the assets are sufficient,\u201d and that the amount for educational support \u201cmay be made contingent upon the child\u2019s eligibility for that award under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9.\u201d She noted that \u201c[i]n this way, the estate administration will not be unduly prolonged.\u201d As to the Social Security benefits, she concluded that the benefits \u201cact as a \u2018credit\u2019 to the obligor in determining the appropriate amount of support in a modification hearing, and not as a substitute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that support obligation.\u201d Because the order was interlocutory, the judge did not specify any specific sum to be set aside \u201cin trust\u201d as security for the child\u2019s future educational support, nor did she determine the amount of support obligation, taking into account the \u201ccredit\u201d of the Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The judge\u2019s authority to enter or to modify a support order is statutory. G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 20, provides in relevant part that a \u201ccourt with original jurisdiction . . . <em>has continuing jurisdiction, </em>upon a complaint filed by a person or agency entitled to file original actions, to modify judgments of support, custody or visitation\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). See also G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28 (\u201cUpon a complaint after a divorce, filed by either parent or by a next friend on behalf of the children after notice to both parents, the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children . . .\u201d). Because an obligation to provide child support survives the death of a parent, a judge must have the authority to modify any such obligation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Our statutes contain no provision that the judge\u2019s \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d while a child is a minor is conditional on her parent being alive. Importing such a requirement into the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>would conflict with the overriding public policy clearly articulated by the Legislature we described earlier. In <em>DuMont </em>v. <em>Godbey, </em>382 Mass. 234, 240 (1981), we held that posthumous modification of an alimony award was permitted (\u201cProbate Court could properly determine what, if any, payments were due after the death of the husband, and could modify its decree not only as to the future, but also as to arrears\u201d). Recognition of posthumous modification of a child support order is more compelling because the express language of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20, provides a judge with continuing jurisdiction. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The original 1992 support order did not contain any provision for his child\u2019s later educational support. The terms of that order, however, made it subject to further modification, and, as the judge in this case found, in the eleven-year period prior to the paternity action, the father had held several positions of employment commensurate with his educational background and expertise. But at the time of the hearing he characterized his occupational status as \u201c[unemployed.\u201d He was fifty-two years of age at the time, and there is no suggestion that he would not have attained gainful employment subsequent to the paternity adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">A support order may be modified if the judge finds a \u201csubstantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child has occurred and finds modification to be in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. While nothing mandates that the death of the parent-obligor automatically results in a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d warranting modification, this case plainly meets that standard. The child now receives Social Security benefits as a result of the father\u2019s death that were not earlier available. Moreover, in contrast to the period before the father\u2019s death, any resources that may be necessary to maintain his young daughter are available only for the limited period during the administration of the estate; beyond that the support order can no longer be changed by \u201cfurther order of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">With respect to the effect of the now-available Social Security benefits, we previously have held, along with the majority of States, that a noncustodial parent who receives Social Security disability income benefits is entitled to modification of his child support obligation. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 185-186 (1998). See generally Annot., 34 A.L.R. 5th 447, 469-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>487, 498-503 (1995). We have also decided to treat Social Security retirement benefits the same as disability income benefits. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, supra </em>at 186 n.4. See also <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>368 Mass. 144, 147 (1975). We agree with the conclusion reached by the judge in this case that the same logic should extend to Social Security death benefits. Survivor\u2019s benefits are to be used for the beneficiary\u2019s \u201ccurrent maintenance,\u201d which includes the \u201ccost incurred in obtaining of food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2040 (a)(1), (c) (2000). The benefits are designed to replace a deceased parent\u2019s income that would otherwise be available for the child\u2019s current maintenance. Those benefits, now totaling $927 a month, as of January 1, 1991, must be considered a credit to the father\u2019s estate in determining child support obligations. See <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>244 Neb. 731, 740 (1993), and cases cited. See generally Annot., 34 A.L.R. 5th 447, 507-513 (1995). The child support order must be modified to reflect this credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The question whether a judge may posthumously \u201cset aside a lump sum in trust as security for future educational support\u201d for the child is a more difficult one. The Legislature has explicitly provided that in some circumstances parents have an obligation to provide educational support for children who have attained the age of eighteen: \u201cThe court may make appropriate orders of maintenance, support <em>and education </em>for any child who has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one, who is domiciled in the home of a parent and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9. As a general rule, support orders regarding the <em>future </em>payment of \u201cpost-high school educational costs are premature and should not be made.\u201d <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, </em>427 Mass. 52, 54 (1998). We have, however, upheld an order creating an educational trust for a minor child who is neither about to attend nor already enrolled in higher education; those cases must be \u201cbased on the particular facts\u201d of the case. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 410 (1988) (child support orders should reflect \u201ccurrent needs\u201d of child).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The judge here appropriately recognized that an order for postminority support for a young child would generally be premature, but relied on our decision in <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passe-mato, supra, </em>to conclude that the \u201ccircumstances of posthumous support\u201d was a valid exception to the general rule because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201c[k]eeping the estate administration open for a decade or more poses significant problems and expense.\u201d We share the judge\u2019s concern that children bom out of wedlock (or whose parents are divorced) and who suffer the death of a parent before they reach majority should not be deprived of access to parental support for their educational needs when they reach the age of eighteen. On the other hand, the Legislature plainly contemplated that a child seeking such support had to \u201cattain age eighteen\u201d before doing so. Additionally, the statute provides that at age of eighteen a child may be entitled to such support only if \u201cdomiciled in the home of a parent\u201d and \u201cdependent upon said parent for maintenance.\u201d G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9. These contingencies make plain the Legislature\u2019s desire that awards for educational support be reserved for those cases where an award would meet the current needs of the child. To allow a judge to secure funds in trust for a child\u2019s future education at a time when the judge cannot foresee whether the award will be warranted under the statute and where, because of death, the parent cannot later challenge the validity of the use of funds held \u201cin trust\u201d for educational needs is beyond what the Legislature may have intended. In that respect this case differs from our holding in <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, supra, </em>where, presumably, the mother could later challenge the expenditure of specific funds set aside for the future educational needs of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Legislature has increased significantly the obligations of parents to support their children, imposing an obligation to provide support for their children\u2019s educational needs after the age of eighteen. Because the statute places limitations on educational support awards and does not limit general support awards for children under the age of eighteen in the same way, we conclude that the establishment of an educational tmst fund while the child is ten years old and where there can be no showing that she presently meets the statutory requirements of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, is not authorized in this case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Our opinion is bolstered by the public policy that a testator should be free to dispense with his estate as he sees fit.

While we have already explained that this interest is not always paramount, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>absent a more clear expression from the Legislature we think a judge in the Probate Court lacks the authority to order future educational support to a child who has not yet attained the age of eighteen, because of the death of her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">5. <em>Answers to reported questions. </em>We conclude that the judge\u2019s questions, as reported, must be answered as follows: (1) a testator survived by a minor child may disinherit that child, pursuant to G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 20, subject to the prior satisfaction of all of his child support obligations, present and future; (2) a minor child\u2019s claim for support is in the nature of a preferred creditor\u2019s claim and must be satisfied prior to any testamentary dispositions; (3) assets in an inter vivos trust containing the terms of the trust at issue here (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>can be reached to satisfy support obligations; and (4) a judge in the Probate and Family Court does not have the authority to enter an order after the death of the obligor to secure postminority educational support for a child who does not presently qualify for such support pursuant to G.

L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent that child support orders are presumed to survive an obligated father\u2019s death unless otherwise provided by a court order or that we can glean that intent from the general legislative policy in favor of parents supporting their minor children or from other statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The court relies on the portion of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1, that provides that a father is responsible for the support of his child bom out of wedlock \u201cfrom . . . birth up to the age of eighteen,\u201d to reason that child support orders continue until the child reaches the age of eighteen regardless of whether the father survives. In my view, the court reads too much into this statutory language. This provision merely states the duration for which a child is eligible to receive support; it is not an indication that the Legislature intended this provision to comprise a comprehensive statement of the circumstances that may cause a support obligation to terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As child support is a creature of statute, see, e.g., G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28; G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, and see also <em>Gediman </em>v. Cameron, 306 Mass. 138, 140 (1940), and cases cited, courts are not entitled to add to the statutory scheme. A policy that support orders shall automatically survive the death of obligors should be based on a clear expression of legislative intent. Had the Legislature intended that such support orders were automatically to survive a parent\u2019s death, it would presumably have provided so expressly. In the absence of such an express statement of intent, I am not prepared to conclude that orders for child support survive the obligated parent\u2019s death by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In the analogous area of alimony, we have long held that orders do not survive the death of the obligated party unless ordered by the court. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Puzo, </em>415 Mass. 54, 56 (1993) (\u201cAs a general rale, an order for the payment of alimony ceases with the death of the party obligated to pay it unless the decree or judgment provides otherwise or arrearages are due and unpaid\u201d), and cases cited. When amending statutes, we presume that the Legislature is aware of the prior state of the law as explicated by the decisions of this court. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>408 Mass. 1215, 1222 (1990), and cases cited. In view of our alimony decisions, it is unlikely that the Legislature would have intended that support obligations continue beyond the obligor\u2019s death without specifically so stating. A provision in the child support statute establishing the age requirements for the child to receive support does not indicate a legislative intent that support orders survive the death of the obligor. This provision is silent regarding circumstances other than age that may terminate the support obligation. If it is a desirable policy to continue support beyond the death of the obligor, it is not for this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to make such policy decisions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. 835, 841 (1993) (court should not substitute its notions of correct policy for that of the Legislature).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The court also relies for its decision on the public policy of this \u201ccommonwealth that dependent children shall be maintained, as completely as possible, from the resources of their parents,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 444, quoting G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1, and various legislative enactments that have increased the obligations of parents to support their children. These general expressions of legislative policy and unrelated statutory changes have little to do with deciding the question before the court. The court is faced with a specific question of statutory interpretation, i.e., whether a child support order is presumed to survive an obligated parent\u2019s death. In the absence of specific language so extending the support obligation, the court\u2019s reliance on unrelated statutory provisions and general policy expressions to reach its conclusion is misplaced and is an attempt to justify what is essentially judicial legislation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court cannot glean from these sources a legislative intent that support orders survive an obligated party\u2019s death. Absent a more direct legislative expression of intent, the general policy of providing support for children, the unrelated child support statutory enactments, and the provision of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1, establishing the child\u2019s age eligibility for support do not compel a decision that support orders survive an obligated party\u2019s death absent an express provision in the support order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Therefore, the only question that remains is whether the Probate Court judge in this case issued a child support order that survived the father\u2019s death. The support order entered against the father states: \u201cDefendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $ 100.00 beginning forthwith and each week thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>as child support. . . . All until further order of the Court.\u201d Ordering the support obligation to remain in effect \u201cuntil further order of the Court\u201d is not an expression by the judge that the order is to continue to be enforced after the father\u2019s death. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 20, provides that in all cases in which a court enters a judgment of support for a child, the court maintains \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d to modify that order in the case of a \u201csubstantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child.\u201d The \u201cuntil further order\u201d expression merely reflects the court\u2019s statutory authority to make future modifications; it is not a statement as to the order\u2019s duration. Consequently, the order at issue in this case does not provide for the payment of child support after the death of the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> The court also cites as authority the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, 9A U.L.A. 102 (Master ed. 1998), which provides: \u201c[Provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child but not by the death of a parent obligated to support the child.\u201d The Legislature is likely aware of the existence of proposed uniform State laws and it has not chosen to adopt the provisions relied on by the court. If the existence of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act is at all instructive, it suggests that the Legislature has chosen not to follow the position advocated by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> It is noted that the possibility of the death of an obligated parent during the support period is addressed by probate judges when they require the obligor to purchase a life insurance policy to cover such eventuality. See <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 885 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
