The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, pro se; a supplemental motion for a new trial and supporting affidavits were filed by his new appellate counsel. After a nonevidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied the motions. The defendant\u2019s appeal from the denials has been consolidated with his direct appeal. He argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that asserted errors in the judge\u2019s instructions concerning the burden of proof related to provocation and manslaughter, excessive force in self-defense, and the malice requirement for premeditated murder created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s arguments are unavailing. We see no basis for ordering a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt using our authority pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We affirm the conviction and the denial of the motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>It is undisputed that on August 3, 1996, after receiving a call from Robert Hippert, the defendant went to an apartment to sell him drugs, as he had done on a number of occasions. Hippert, Joseph Jablonski, and the victim, Norman Poulin, were in the apartment that evening. The defendant refused to sell the crack cocaine for less than his asking price of forty dollars, so the victim and the defendant went upstairs to the victim\u2019s apartment for the victim to retrieve additional money for the drug purchase. They came back downstairs and an argument ensued, escalating into a physical confrontation in which the victim pinned the defendant against a door or wall. Accounts varied as to what happened next, but no one disputes that the victim died as a result of one stab wound inflicted by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Jablonski testified that, when the defendant and the victim came back downstairs, the victim asked Jablonski to come outside with them, they went to the hallway or front door, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the victim pushed the defendant against the outside hallway door. The victim said to Jablonski, \u201cThis guy won\u2019t give me my money back,\u201d complaining that the amount of crack cocaine was too small for forty dollars. Jablonski testified that the victim had his left forearm under the defendant\u2019s chin and had keys in his hand that might have had a pen on it. He heard the defendant say, \u201cWhat are you trying to do, stick me with a knife?\u201d, but testified that the defendant did not seem afraid when he said this. To his knowledge, the victim did not try to rob the defendant of any cocaine. According to Jablonski, after a few seconds, the victim let the defendant go. Jablonski and the victim returned to the apartment. About one minute later the defendant knocked on the door, walked up to the victim, swung his arm once at the victim, and stabbed him. Jablonski testified that the victim said, \u201cWhat did you do? Stab me in the neck?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t stab you with anything.\u201d The victim started bleeding and Jablonski wrapped a towel around his neck. Hippert\u2019s testimony was similar, although he added that the victim may have also slapped the defendant a bit in the initial altercation and stated that the defendant returned to the apartment about five minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Lisa Bergeron, who was in one of the third-floor apartments in the building that night, offered the following testimony. She knew the defendant by face, having seen him three or four times a day for about two months, and knew his car. That night she saw the defendant go to his car out front, fumble around inside for about thirty seconds, put something on the roof of the car, shut the door, and then get the object from the roof. The defendant went back into the building for four or five minutes and then walked quickly back out to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In contrast to those three witnesses, the defendant offered the following testimony. While upstairs with the victim, he felt that something did not seem right; he went back downstairs and told Hippert he had to leave. Hippert tried to talk him into selling the drugs for less money. As the defendant started to leave, the victim grabbed him, pushed him against the wall, pressed something metal against his throat and told him that if he did not give them the drugs he would cut the defendant. After further struggle, the defendant spit out the drugs he was holding in his mouth, but the victim continued to press \u201chis knife into my throat,\u201d and the defendant received \u201clike a slice\u201d on his throat. The defendant, thinking that the victim \u201cwas going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>kill [him],\u201d grabbed a knife that was on top of the television and swung it at the victim, then left the house and went to his sister\u2019s house. When he got out of his car at his sister\u2019s house, he dropped the knife, and testified that he did not know exactly where he dropped it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to present credible corroborative evidence to support the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, failed to have his blood-stained shirt tested, and failed \u201cadequately\u201d to impeach Bergeron \u2014 whom the defense describes as the \u201conly apparently unbiased witness.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because this is a case of murder in the first degree, we inquire whether there was any error or serious failure by trial counsel and, if so, whether the error or failure created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>430 Mass. 252, 255 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681-682 (1992) (\u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d standard for review of ineffective assistance claim is more favorable to defendant than constitutional standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The defendant asserts that his trial counsel should have presented corroborative evidence to support the self-defense claim, particularly concerning his testimony that he received \u201clike a slice\u201d from a metal object the victim held against his neck, because the case turned on the credibility of the defendant. He asserts that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to introduce photographs of the defendant\u2019s neck taken by counsel the day after the victim was killed was manifestly unreasonable,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as was the decision not to call any of the seven witnesses who were ready to testify about the injury to the defendant\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>There is no question that in closing argument the prosecution repeatedly focused on the defendant\u2019s claim that his neck was injured by the victim, asserting that the claim was a \u201cboldfaced lie,\u201d and that this lie revealed the defendant\u2019s lack of credibility concerning the events in the apartment on the night of the stabbing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But defense counsel\u2019s own closing argument effectively anticipated and largely preempted the prosecution\u2019s closing argument on this point.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, we agree with the judge that the critical question in this trial was whether the defendant had an opportunity to escape and avoid combat.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The difficulty for the defendant here is that his credibility concerning whether the victim cut the defendant\u2019s neck had little direct bearing on this central issue, whether the defendant left the apartment, went to his car, and then returned to the apartment before stabbing the victim. Even assuming that the failure to put forward the desired corroborative evidence weakened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>credibility of the defendant generally \u2014 an assumption we are not convinced is sound \u2014 in the face of testimony from three witnesses that the defendant left and then returned before the stabbing, the failure by counsel to put forward this evidence is unlikely to have influenced the verdict. Consequently, it could not have created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, particularly given Bergeron\u2019s testimony. In addition to this general problem with the defendant\u2019s argument, there are specific problems concerning the particular \u201ccorroborative\u201d evidence the defendant argues should have been put forward, as we now examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">a. <em>Additional photographs. </em>The defendant argues that his counsel\u2019s decision not to present additional photographs taken by defense counsel of the defendant\u2019s neck just before the booking photographs was manifestly unreasonable. As the motion judge correctly observed, however, the photographs were a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d with the \u201cpotential to backfire on the defendant,\u201d perhaps outraging the jury that a fatal stabbing would be committed \u201cover an injury this minor.\u201d It could have been risky to introduce the additional photographs because they showed, as appellate defense counsel characterized it, \u201ca pressure point and a scratch,\u201d which the jury could have found was not \u201clike a slice.\u201d According to an affidavit of the defendant, his trial counsel stated that the cut \u201c[ljooked like a cat scratch\u201d in the photographs. The photographs, consequently, could have undermined the defendant\u2019s credibility more than they helped him. Trial counsel\u2019s tactical decision not to submit the photographs as evidence was not manifestly unreasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">b. <em>Witnesses. </em>The defendant faults his counsel for not calling any of several witnesses who could have testified that they saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>an injury to his neck. The jury, however, did have before it evidence that the defendant could have received a cut to his neck: the blood on the defendant\u2019s shirt collar; Jablonski\u2019s testimony that the defendant said, \u201cWhat are you trying to do, stick me with a knife?,\u201d as the victim had keys in his hand; as well as the defendant\u2019s own testimony that his neck was cut by the victim. Given the prosecution\u2019s focus in closing argument on the defendant\u2019s lack of a neck injury, it is arguable that it might have been better for counsel to have called witnesses to support the evidence that the defendant had received a cut or scratch. Counsel\u2019s decision not to do so was not manifestly unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 262 (1996) (assessment of defense strategy is not to be made using advantage of hindsight). In any event, the witnesses\u2019 testimony would not have directly aided the defendant regarding the central issue whether the defendant left the building before the stabbing occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, </em>426 Mass. 405, 407-408 (1998) (no error where counsel did not call additional witnesses but evidence from them would have been cumulative, not dispositive).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">c. <em>Testing blood stains. </em>The defendant states that his trial counsel should have sought court-ordered funds to test the blood on the front collar of his shirt, as the defendant had requested, because proof that the blood was his own would have bolstered his claim that the victim injured his neck. But the defendant concedes that the jury had before them the evidence of blood on the defendant\u2019s collar, and the Commonwealth did not argue that the blood was the victim\u2019s. Identifying the source of this blood, moreover, would not have helped resolve the central issue on which the defendant\u2019s conviction hinged. His attorney\u2019s decision not to request funds for the test was not manifestly unreasonable. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 395 (1997) (counsel\u2019s failure to file motion for blood test of knife manifestly unreasonable where presence of defendant\u2019s blood on knife would seriously weaken if not destroy credibility of alleged victims).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">d. <em>Impeachment of Bergeron. </em>The defendant faults his trial counsel\u2019s failure to call the officer who made the report concerning Bergeron\u2019s initial statements to the police. In that report Bergeron stated that she \u201csaw this guy leaving the building. He was walking real calm.\u201d The report makes no mention of Berg-eron\u2019s saying, when asked if there was \u201canything else that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>can think of that would be of help,\u201d that she saw the defendant go out to his car and then return to the building. At trial, however, Bergeron testified that she saw the defendant go to his car, get something, return to the building, and come back out four or five minutes later. She testified that the defendant \u201cwalk[ed] quickly\u201d to his car and left, spinning and screeching his tires as he did so. The prosecution, in closing, identified Bergeron\u2019s testimony on this point as a \u201cpiece of critical evidence,\u201d and argued that this \u201cgoing out to the car\u201d prior to returning to the building was \u201cwhen the real premeditation takes place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Both Jablonski and Hippert testified that the defendant left after the initial altercation with the victim and then returned to commit the stabbing. But as friends of the victim, with criminal records, who had been drinking that day and were possible participants in the drug deal that led to the altercation, their credibility was not as unassailable as Bergeron\u2019s.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Impeachment of Bergeron was therefore indisputably important to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Bergeron <em>was </em>impeached by the defense, in a cross-examination that highlighted the inconsistency between her earlier statement to the police and her testimony. In addition, the defense called a private investigator to the stand who testified that he interviewed Bergeron by telephone six days after the stabbing and she did not mention that she saw the defendant leave the house twice. Calling the officer who made the report might have added little to the defense and could have been risky. As the judge observed, it was unclear what the officer would say and whether his testimony would help or harm the defendant. The defense itself recognizes that the officer\u2019s testimony <em>\u201cmay . </em>. . have undermined\u201d Bergeron\u2019s credibility. (Emphasis added.) Trial counsel\u2019s failure to summon the officer to the stand did not constitute ineffectiveness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273-277 (1991) (not inef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>fective to fail to call witnesses where any benefit from their testimony would have been largely offset by its harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">3. <em>Asserted errors in the jury instructions. </em>The defendant claims that several errors were made in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. Because defense counsel did not object at trial to the instructions attacked on appeal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we review the instructions to see if any error created a substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">a. <em>Instruction on provocation. </em>The Commonwealth concedes that the judge\u2019s provocation instructions were in error, but argues that the error does not require reversal. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In order to convict the defendant of murder, where the evidence raises the possibility that the defendant may have killed upon reasonable provocation, the prosecution must prove that the defendant did not act upon reasonable provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>430 Mass. 746, 751-752 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 716 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 661 (1989). The judge misstated this burden in portions of her jury instructions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>supra. </em>We conclude, however, that because the evidence did not raise the possibility of provocation this error did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201cA killing is manslaughter if there is \u2018provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 316 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 180 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984). Evidence of heat of passion on reasonable provocation would include evidence \u201cthat something happened which would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his capacity for reflection or restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 728 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The defendant baldly asserts that there was evidence of provocation in this case, but does not point to any specific evidence. In contrast, at trial, the defense argued that the defendant stabbed the victim \u201cin self-defense. He did what he <em>had to </em>do,\u201d (emphasis added) and that the defendant \u201ctried everything that he could to get out[,] . . . [t]he last thing that he did worked\u201d \u2014 that is, stabbing the victim. This argument is based on asserting the defendant\u2019s calculus of survival, not any blindness of heat of passion on reasonable provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 721-722 &amp; n.1 (1998) (provocation not \u201clive\u201d issue where trial focused on reasonableness of defendant\u2019s belief victim was threatening him, force used and failure to retreat, not provocation). In his testimony, the defendant indeed denied being in a rage or having any desire to \u201cget back at\u201d the victim when he acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The defendant did testify that he was \u201cscared\u201d due to the victim\u2019s acts and threats during the altercation, which, if the stabbing had occurred during the altercation, might have raised the issue of provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, supra. </em>It seems obvious from the jury\u2019s conviction of premeditated murder, however, that they did not conclude the stabbing was during the initial altercation, but sometime thereafter during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>return to the building by the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> None of the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s return to the building raises an issue of reasonable provocation. Bergeron testified merely that the defendant fumbled through his car, got something, closed the door to his car, and then went back in. Jablonski testified that the defendant knocked at the apartment door, came in when invited in, said, \u201cWe got to talk,\u201d then walked up to the victim and stabbed him. Hippert\u2019s testimony was almost identical to Jablonski\u2019s on this point. We do not see in this any evidence raising the issue of provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>429 Mass. 271, 278-279 (1999). The judge\u2019s flawed instructions on provocation did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 715 (1998) (error in provocation instructions on burden of proof prejudicial in murder conviction where provocation issue plainly presented by evidence; defendant shot victim while victim was pursuing him with baseball bat).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">b. <em>Instruction on excessive force in self-defense. </em>The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s instruction on excessive force in self-defense, pointing to her instruction that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201canother factor or circumstance which mitigates or reduces murder to manslaughter is when a person kills someone using excessive force in self-defense. If the Commonwealth has proved to you that the defendant used excessive force and that the defendant was not acting in valid self-defense, but the use of excessive force under the circumstances reduces the crime to manslaughter. A person in fear of imminent injury or death who uses excessive force to defend himself, would be acting under a form of provocation, and that would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The defendant complains that \u201c[i]t is unlikely that the jurors thought that imminent injury or death meant anything other than serious bodily injury [or death]\u201d because of the judge\u2019s use of that phrase in her instruction concerning self-defense. The defendant appears to argue that the instruction challenged here improperly limited the type of self-defense to which excessive force self-defense mitigation could be applied to that where the defendant was in fear of imminent serious bodily injury or death. Consequently, the jury would have been improperly precluded from mitigating the crime to manslaughter if they believed that the defendant had a reasonable fear of physical harm or attack, but did not believe that he had a fear of imminent death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The short answer to this argument is that the judge did not frame self-defense in terms of a response to serious bodily injury or death, but rather in terms of a response simply to imminent \u201cinjury or death.\u201d We do not agree that the jurors would have likely thought otherwise. Moreover, the judge repeatedly discussed self-defense broadly, in terms of the right of a person to \u201cdefend himself from physical attack,\u201d and did not limit the general right of self-defense to those circumstances where the defendant reasonably believes he is in imminent danger of serious injury or death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, when the judge later said that \u201cin considering whether any force used in self-defense was reasonable or whether it was excessive\u201d one is to consider all the surrounding circumstances, the jury would have had as its starting point in the assessment of reasonableness the right to defend oneself against physical attack. Viewing the instructions as a whole, the phrasing complained of by the defendant did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">c. <em>Instruction on malice for murder in the first degree by means of deliberate premeditation. </em>The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that they must find \u201cfirst prong malice\u201d in order to find the defendant guilty of murder by means of deliberate premeditation. We explained, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>426 Mass. 582 (1998), a decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>postdated this trial,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cthat it is better to make clear to the jury that \u2018murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation relates only to the first prong of malice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>426 Mass. 548, 553 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, </em>429 Mass. 692, 697 (1999) . But we concluded in <em>Jenks </em>that, even if the judge included instructions on second and third prong malice in such a case, there was not a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where the \u201cjudge\u2019s instruction on deliberate premeditation was correct, clear and emphatic, so that \u2018a reasonable juror could only have understood that a guilty verdict ... by reason of deliberate premeditation required a finding of purposeful conduct that included a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a specific intent to kill.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, supra </em>at 585, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>424 Mass. 242, 247, cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1123 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Here, the judge correctly defined the three prongs of malice, but did not state that only the first prong, specific intent to kill, is relevant to a charge of premeditated murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, supra </em>at 585. The judge clearly stated to the jury, however, that in order to convict the defendant of murder in the first degree, the prosecution \u201cmust prove one additional element, that is, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed with deliberate premeditation . . . that the defendant thought before he acted[,] . . . formed a plan to murder after deliberation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> She repeated this formulation in her supplemental instructions. She instructed the jury at least six times in the main charge that a conviction of murder in the first degree requires proof of deliberate premeditation and at least five times in her supplemental instructions. The instructions, read as a whole, were \u201ccorrect, clear and emphatic\u201d regarding the proof of deliberate premeditation required for this conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jiles, </em>428 Mass. 66, 71 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>424 Mass. 242, 246-247 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">4. <em>Relief pursuant to \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant argues that this court should exercise its authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction to manslaughter, based on the errors and ineffectiveness of counsel discussed above. The defendant further argues that he voluntarily turned himself in to the police and there was no indication he had been violent in the past or went to the apartment with any intent to harm anyone. For the reasons discussed above, and because justice does not require it, we decline to order a new trial or reduce the conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 318-323 (1987) (refusing to reduce verdict or order new trial under \u00a7 33E even though it might have been true defendant did not go to crime scene with intent to murder); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>377 Mass. 709, 715 (1979) (we have regularly denied \u00a7 33E relief where defendant, party to a dispute, leaves the scene, procures weapon, and returns to do murderous work). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Masked, </em>403 Mass. 111, 116-117 (1988) (reducing verdict from murder to manslaughter pursuant to \u00a7 33E where defendant was first shot by victim, and was in deadly fear and in excruciating pain from wound when he shot victim less than one minute later). We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the denial of his motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> The medical examiner who conducted an autopsy determined that the cause of death was a single stab wound that penetrated two inches into the left side of the victim\u2019s neck, cutting his external carotid artery, an injury consistent with a knife wound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> The defendant also argues that it was error for the judge to deny the motions for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. A judge may rule on a motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing if no substantial issue is raised by the motion or accompanying affidavits. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 663 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 260 (1981); Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). We see no error because no substantial issue was raised by the defendant, particularly concerning the central question of whether he left and then returned prior to the stabbing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>426 Mass. 582, 586 (1998) (\u201cOrdinarily we defer to the discretion of the trial judge to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> Booking photographs, taken by the police later that same day, were admitted in evidence. These photographs show no injury to the defendant\u2019s neck, only a red dot. A police sergeant who saw the defendant approximately twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>four hours after the stabbing testified that he \u201csaw no injuries whatsoever on [the defendant\u2019s] face or neck area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> In its closing, the prosecution stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201c[P]erhaps one of the most important pieces of evidence to come in was the [booking] photographs of the defendant. It\u2019s important because it begins to tell you is this defendant telling you the truth when he gets up on that witness stand or is he lying. . . . [T]his jumps out at you as a tremendous aid because it is a photograph or- two photographs. And they show his neck. And there is no injury to his neck. So that is a bold-faced lie. He\u2019s lying to you. You take that lie and you take it to the rest of the case because he\u2019s lying to you about what happened in the apartment, and that\u2019s critical .... Does the crack dealer take a knife into the house when he goes in . . . ? Of course he does. ... It doesn\u2019t come off the television set. You should lump that together with the cut on [his] neck. . . . Look at that photograph of Mr. Vinton\u2019s neck if there is any question in your mind as to who is telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> In his closing, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201cThe suggestion may be made by the prosecution, take a look at those photos, the mugshots [showing] that Mr. Vinton wasn\u2019t hurt. You don\u2019t see marks on his neck. That is not the standard. What the standard is is whether from the defendant\u2019s point of view, his self-defense was reasonable, whether he felt that faced with this attack, that what he did was reasonable to defend himself from death or great bodily injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> The record includes no written memorandum of decision by the judge on the new trial motions, but she expressed her views at the hearing on the motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> The defendant also argues that trial counsel initially thought the defendant\u2019s neck injury was significant enough to photograph and that, if he believed that the photographs did not depict accurately what he himself had observed and did not intend to call others as witnesses who had seen the injury, he should have withdrawn as trial counsel and testified as to his observations. The defendant points to no evidence that the attorney believed that the photographs did not depict the injury accurately. Moreover, counsel had numerous choices for alternative witnesses who saw the defendant when he did and who could have testified concerning the injury or the accuracy of the photographs. The defendant has not shown there was a need for counsel to testify. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413, 416-417 (1979) (ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel did not withdraw when need for testimony was apparent; counsel was only alibi witness who could not be impeached by evidence of criminal record).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> Further undermining the credibility of Hippert and Jablonski, there was also some evidence the two had been trying to locate the defendant and were seeking their own form of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> The defendant also claims it was \u201cserious inattention\u201d of trial counsel to fail to draw the jury\u2019s attention to the video cassette recorder located on top of the television and the fact that its cover was missing. He asserts that it was \u201carguable]\u201d that the cover was oft because it was being worked on by someone, and therefore \u201cplausible\u201d that the defendant could have grabbed a sharp object from there. As the defendant testified that the sharp object he used in the stabbing was a knife, the jury would also have to have believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>that a knife was the sharp object plausibly left there. The failure of trial counsel to try to draw the jury down such an attenuated chain of inferences was not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> Defense counsel only objected to that portion of the judge\u2019s final instruction in the main charge concerning excessive force in self-defense that assertedly implied that the Commonwealth must prove the defendant acted in self-defense, rather than that the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant did not act in self-defense. The judge agreed with the prosecution that she had correctly stated the burden of proof on self-defense many times, and did not repeat the instruction to which the defendant objected. The defendant concedes that there was no objection by trial counsel to that aspect of the excessive force instructions challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\"> The judge instructed the jury that to prove someone guilty of voluntary manslaughter there must be \u201cproved to you beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the defendant injured the victim \u201cas a result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion produced by adequate and reasonable provocation, or by using excessive force in self defense.\u201d At least twice in connection with her instructions on malice, however, the judge correctly stated the burden concerning provocation, telling the jury that to \u201cprove malice the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion and sudden provocation.\u201d But the incorrect instructions on the burden regarding provocation were, in essence, given again in the main instructions and yet again in the supplemental instructions. See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>U.S. 307, 322 (1985) (\u201cLanguage that merely contradicts and does not explain a constitutionally infirm instruction will not suffice to absolve the infirmity\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> We note that if the jury did believe the defendant\u2019s version of events, that he stabbed the victim during the initial altercation, the facts that would have raised the possibility of reasonable provocation also would have raised the question of self-defense. Yet the jury neither acquitted, as they would have if they believed valid self-defense with reasonable, not excessive, force was involved, nor rendered a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, as they would have if they believed self-defense with excessive force was involved. The jury\u2019s failure to render either of these verdicts further indicates they did not believe the defendant\u2019s version of events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> In supplemental instructions, the judge repeated this formulation in very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>similar terms, although she made this central point perhaps more clearly by saying, \u201cIf the Commonwealth has proved that excessive force was used, then the defendant was not acting in valid self-defense. But the use of excessive force under the circumstances would reduce the crime to manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> The judge did use the phrase \u201cimminent danger of death or serious bodily injury\u201d when explaining the circumstances in which a defendant would be justified in using deadly force to defend himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\"> The trial took place in April and May, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> The defendant takes issue with the judge\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cplan to murder,\u201d arguing that it left the impression that any one of the prongs of malice satisfied the requirement for murder in the first degree by means of deliberate premeditation. To the contrary, we think a reasonable juror would have interpreted this phrase as conveying a specific intent to kill. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Williams, 422 Mass. 111, 122 (1996) (discussing \u201cplan to murder\u201d formed within few seconds as sufficient to meet period of reflection needed for deliberately premeditated murder).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
