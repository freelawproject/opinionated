We conclude that the decision taken by a public agency to discharge her must be upheld. We reverse an order of summary judgment in favor of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In September, 1996, Linda M. Pereira commenced this action against the department and its commissioner, in her official capacity and individually, alleging that she had been terminated from her position as a DSS social worker \u201csolely as a consequence of her protected speech\u201d in violation of her rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She brought this action pursuant to G. L. c. 30A (administrative procedure act), G. L. c. 231A (declaratory judgment), G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5 (mandamus), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994) (Federal civil rights statute). She also alleged common-law violations for wrongful termination and infliction of emotional distress. Pereira sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages from the commissioner individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment, which, in October, 1998, a judge in the Superior Court allowed in part and denied in part. He held that Pereira\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 30A; G. L. c. 231 A; and G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, were barred as untimely filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He allowed Pereira\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability as to her civil rights claim against the commissioner in her individual capacity, concluding that she was not entitled to qualified immunity because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>constitutional right of free speech, he said, was \u201cclearly established,\u201d and a reasonable official \u201cwould have understood\u201d that firing Pereira would vi\u00f3late her constitutional rights. He ordered a trial on the issue of damages against her. The judge also determined that Pereira was entitled to injunctive relief against the department on her civil rights claim and ordered the department to reinstate her nunc pro tunc with back pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge determined that Pereira\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress raised issues of material fact that could not be disposed of on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Judgment on the cross motions entered on November 25, 1998. The commissioner, in her individual capacity, took an appeal from the denial of her qualified immunity on Pereira\u2019s claim for monetary damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In February, 1999, the department moved for entry of a separate and final judgment on the order granting Pereira\u2019s claim for equitable relief, which was allowed in March, 1999. Meanwhile, the department and the commissioner jointly moved to stay, pending appeal, the order requiring the department to reinstate Pereira to her former job, the trial on damages for Pereira\u2019s claim against the commissioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and the trial on liability and damages on Pereira\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, all of which the judge allowed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The commissioner\u2019s appeal from the denial of her claim for qualified immunity and the department\u2019s appeal from the judge\u2019s order were consolidated in the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We summarize the facts as stipulated by the parties, supplemented where appropriate by facts appearing in the record that are not disputed. See <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553-554 (1976); Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Pereira was employed by DSS for over twelve years, during which she had an \u201cunblemished\u201d record. At the time of her discharge, Pereira was a \u201cprotective investigator.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Her principal responsibilities required her to review reports of allegations of abuse and neglect of children, screen cases to determine whether the department should proceed with an investigation, and to investigate any abuse allegation within ten days, or within hours if the report indicated an emergency. In consultation with a supervisor, Pereira determined whether in any particular case the removal of a child from home was necessary. To those ends, her investigations involved significant contact with DSS clients, the community, and social service organizations, among others, as she interviewed and investigated those involved with and implicated in the abuse reports. For DSS to carry out its public mandate to protect children who are abused and neglected, Pereira, like other DSS investigators, was required to gain access to the homes of affected families. G. L. c. 18B, \u00a7 3 (B) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In addition to her position with DSS, Pereira had been a member of the Fall River city council from 1991 to 1995, but in the fall of 1995 she lost her bid for reelection. On February 5, 1996, Pereira attended a dinner for the then outgoing Fall River city councillors, an event that is the focal point of this case. The event was hosted by the city clerk and attended by numerous city officials, community leaders of Fall River, and other guests. While a political event, members of the general public were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>invited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the party, Pereira made a distasteful racial comment that the parties characterize as a \u201cjoke.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The following day the press reported that she had made the statement, adding, inaccurately, that it was part of her prepared remarks at the dinner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Two days later, DSS placed Pereira on administrative leave, with pay. On April 10, 1996, following an internal investigation that included a hearing, the commissioner informed Pereira that her service as a DSS employee would be terminated, effective immediately.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">There was widespread publicity of the incident, as a result of which the DSS area director in Fall River \u201creceived numerous complaints from [DSS] clients [and] members of the community.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In an affidavit submitted by the defendants as part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>their cross motion for summary judgment and not disputed by Pereira, the area director states that she received twenty-five telephone calls from people expressing outrage that a department employee would tell a racist \u201cjoke.\u201d It is also undisputed that one DSS employee was refused entrance into a DSS client\u2019s home because of Pereira\u2019s reported comment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We consider first whether Pereira\u2019s speech is protected by the First Amendment, and, if so, whether DSS violated her rights by terminating her employment. The question would not be considered substantial if the view of Justice Holmes, expressed more than a century ago, had prevailed. In <em>McAuliffe </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of New Bedford, </em>155 Mass. 216, 220 (1892), the court dismissed a police officer\u2019s challenge to a police regulation prohibiting the solicitation of political contributions because, \u201c[t]he petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This view has not prevailed. In a long line of cases the Supreme Court has clarified that, when a public employer attempts to discharge or otherwise discipline an employee who exercises a right that is constitutionally protected, the employer is subject to some restraint. See, e.g., <em>Keyishian </em>v. <em>Regents of the Univ. of N.Y., </em>385 U.S. 589, 605-606 (1967), quoting <em>Keyishian </em>v. <em>Regents of the Univ. of N.Y., </em>345 F.2d 236, 239 (2d Cir. 1965) (\u201cthe theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected\u201d). A public employer therefore \u201cmay not discharge an employee on a basis that infringes that employee\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of speech.\u201d <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 383 (1987). See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138 (1983); <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>To decide whether a public employee has an actionable claim for the infringement of her First Amendment rights, we must determine first, based on \u201cthe content, form, and context of [the] given statement, as revealed by the whole record,\u201d <em>Con-nick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 147-148, whether the public employee was speaking \u201cas a citizen upon matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147. The Supreme Court has distinguished between disciplinary actions taken by a public employer that require judicial scrutiny to ensure \u201cthat citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government,\u201d and disciplinary actions for which public employers enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices. See <em>id. </em>\u201cTo be protected, the speech must be on a matter of public concern . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 668 (1994). If a court determines the speech to be on a matter of public concern, then the court must \u201carrive at a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 568. In addition, \u201cthe employee\u2019s interest in expressing herself on [the] matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause\u201d to that interest. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Churchill, supra </em>at 668.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The defendants argue that Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d was not a matter of public concern, and therefore not protected. Pereira takes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>contrary position. The judge in the Superior Court apparently assumed it was; he did not consider the threshold question whether Pereira\u2019s comment constituted speech related \u201cto any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 146. We reach our own determination as to that issue, because in cases raising First Amendment issues \u201can appellate court has an obligation to \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free speech.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d 905, 912-913 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Nahant </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>510 U.S. 1024 (1993), quoting <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984). See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 150 n.10, quoting <em>Pennekamp </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>328 U.S. 331, 335 (1946).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d has little in common with speech the Supreme Court has examined and determined to be of \u201cpublic concern\u201d; there is little to link it to the central purpose of the First Amendment, \u201cprotecting the public marketplace [of] ideas and opinions.\u201d <em>Eberhardt </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>17 F.3d 1023, 1026 (7th Cir. 1994). In <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 566, for example, the Supreme Court determined that a letter written by a public school teacher to a newspaper attacking the school board\u2019s construction bond issue proposals was speech on a matter of public concern. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 595 (1972), considered the case of a State college professor who testified before the Legislature that a college be elevated to four-year status, to same effect. In <em>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977), the Court reached the same conclusion in a case concerning a public school teacher who released to a radio station the substance of a memorandum dealing with teacher dress and appearance. <em>Givhan </em>v. <em>Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 414 (1979), concerned a teacher who complained to a school principal about school board policies and practices relating to racial discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tion. The Supreme Court described these and other matters of \u201cpublic concern\u201d as those \u201cdealing in some way with \u2018the essence of self-government,\u2019 <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964), matters as to which \u2018free and open debate is vital to informed decisionmaking by the electorate,\u2019 <em>Pickering </em>[v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563,] 571-572 [1968], and matters as to which \u2018debate . . . [must] be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 749, 755 (1985) (plurality opinion), quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964). \u201cIn short, speech on matters of public concern is that speech which lies \u2018at the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection.\u2019\u201d <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 395 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting), quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 776 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In contrast to these, Pereira\u2019s comment was an off-the-cuff remark, not concerned with any \u201cpolitical, social, or other concern to the community.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 146. Cf. <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, supra </em>at 393 (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201csingle, offhand comment\u201d directed to coworker concerning an attempted assassination of the President held to be matter of public comment). Prior decisions of this court also suggest that Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d is not a matter of \u201cpublic concern.\u201d See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Trustees of State Colleges, </em>405 Mass. 515, 524 n.10 (1989) (disrespectful remarks by professor to other faculty members, and belittling \u201cnon-physics majors,\u201d did not relate to \u201cissues of public concern\u201d). Cf. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 275-276 (1992) (public employee\u2019s statements on television program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d concerning smokers\u2019 rights was addressing more than her own personal concerns).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Moreover, as Pereira herself insists, she did not intend to express any message by telling her \u201cjoke.\u201d She draws a distinction between the prepared remarks she delivered \u2014 clearly speech on matters of public concern \u2014 and her \u201cjoke\u201d told to humor another guest. We conclude that Pereira\u2019s joke was not speech on a matter of public concern. See <em>Tindle </em>v. <em>Caudell, </em>56 F.3d 966, 970 (8th Cir. 1995) (\u201cAmusing other guests at a private party with no showing of any intended message is not speech on a matter of public concern\u201d). That determination should end our inquiry, for the First Amendment\u2019s protection against adverse personnel decisions extends only to speech on matters of public concern. See, e.g., <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Churchill, supra </em>at 668. See also <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, supra </em>at 395 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Pereira nevertheless argues that, when public employees engage in expression \u201cunrelated to their employment while away from the workplace,\u201d the <em>Pickering-Connick </em>requirement \u201cthat the speech must be addressed to matters of public concern to be protected is not applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> She relies in this respect on decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Seventh, Tenth, and Fourth Circuits, <em>Eberhardt </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>17 F.3d 1023 (7th Cir. 1994); <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>890 F.2d 1557 (10th Cir. 1989); and <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Battaglia, </em>779 F.2d 992 (4th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986). Those cases are not entirely germane. In <em>Eberhardt </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, supra </em>at 1027, the court held that a novel written by an assistant State\u2019s attorney during his off hours and potentially containing office confidences was \u201ccomfortably within the protection of the [First] [A]mendment.\u201d While the court noted that the \u201cless . . . speech has to do with the office, the less justification the office is likely to have to regulate it,\u201d <em>id., </em>a proposition with which we do not quarrel, it did not depart from the \u201cpublic concern\u201d prong of the <em>Pickering </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Munger, supra </em>at 1562, the court found that the \u201cpublic concern\u201d prong was \u201cnearly impossible to logically apply\u201d to a case where an employee \u201cengages in <em>nonverbal </em>protected expression neither at work nor about work\u201d (emphasis added). In that case the employees were part owners of a video rental store that carried sexually explicit videos, and the court found it difficult to understand how the employees were \u201cactually\u201d saying anything, explicitly or implicitly, by part ownership of the store, and nothing more. <em>Id. </em>at 1562-1563. Even if the employees were \u201cimplicitly\u201d making a statement, the court was unclear \u201chow an implicit statement [could] sufficiently inform an issue of public concern or contribute to the debate over sexually explicit films.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1563. On the other hand, it found the \u201cbalancing prong\u201d of the <em>Pickering-Connick </em>test \u201ceasy to apply,\u201d and did so. <em>Id. </em>at 1562. Here, there is no suggestion that Pereira did not \u201cactually say\u201d something nor is it \u201cimpossible\u201d to apply the \u201cpublic concern\u201d prong of the <em>Pickering-Connick </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Finally, in <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Battaglia, supra, </em>the court considered whether a police department could \u201ccondition the continued employment of one of its police officers upon his cessation of off-duty public entertainment performances in blackface that members of Baltimore\u2019s black community found offensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. Although the court acknowledged that the case presented some \u201cconceptual problems\u201d in that the officer\u2019s speech was \u201cwholly unrelated in content to the public employer or its operations,\u201d it found <em>Pickering\u2019s </em>constitutional principles \u201capposite and necessarily controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997. The court held that the performances \u201cconstituted speech upon a matter of obvious public interest to . . . considerable segments of the community\u201d and therefore entitled to First Amendment protection. Proceeding to apply the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test, the court found in favor of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">There is, nevertheless, considerable force to the argument that courts should proceed to the balancing prong of the <em>Pickering </em>test when a public employee speaks away from the workplace, and does not comment on internal office affairs or on her status as an employee, whether or not her speech is on a matter of public concern.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, </em>513 U.S. 454, 465 (1995) (\u201cIn <em>Pickering </em>and a number of other cases we have recognized that Congress may impose restraints on the job-related speech of public employees that would be plainly unconstitutional if applied to the public at large\u201d); <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 154 (\u201cFor it would indeed be a Pyrrhic victory for the great principles of free expression if the Amendment\u2019s safeguarding of a public employee\u2019s right, as a citizen, to participate in discussions concerning public affairs were confused with the attempt to constitutionalize [an employee grievance]\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, supra </em>at 480 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cIn contrast to some of our prior decisions, this case presents no threshold question whether the speech is of public, or merely private, concern. [The public employees] challenge the ban as it applies to off-hour speech bearing no nexus to Government employment \u2014 speech that by definition does not relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u2018internal office affairs\u2019 or the employee\u2019s status as an employee\u201d). Despite our confidence that Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d was neither intended as a statement on a matter of \u201cpublic concern,\u201d nor carries the import of one, we proceed to the second prong of the <em>Pickering </em>analysis, balancing Pereira\u2019s interest in making her statement against the interest of DSS \u201cin promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., supra </em>at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We recognize that a public employee has a strong interest in speaking her mind free from government sanction. But Pereira herself asserts no great interest in telling her \u201cjoke.\u201d Counsel for Pereira characterizes her statement as \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d and \u201cunthinking.\u201d These characterizations are supported by the record: Pereira\u2019s motive was not to engage in debate, raise awareness, or press a position. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, supra </em>at 915 (\u201cmotives for speaking out are properly weighed in the balance under <em>Pickering\u201d). </em>By her own account, Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d was a \u201cracial stereotyping]\u201d retort to a \u201cgrossly sexist and vulgar joke\u201d told by another guest. Her only motive we can discern from the record was to respond in kind to a distasteful comment of another guest. We, therefore, view Pereira\u2019s interest as \u201crelatively insubstantial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, supra </em>at 482 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We balance her interest in making \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d and \u201cunthinking\u201d statements with DSS\u2019s interest in preventing the expression of such statements by its investigators, in circumstances, such as the political event in this case, where there is little likelihood of privacy. The government\u2019s burden in justifying a particular discharge \u201cvaries depending upon the nature of the employee\u2019s expression.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 150. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, supra </em>at 483 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAs the magnitude of intrusion on employees\u2019 interests rises, so does the Government\u2019s burden of justification\u201d). We recognize that, because her comment \u201cdoes not involve the subject matter of Government employment and takes place outside the workplace\u201d the department may not be able to justify Pereira\u2019s dismissal \u201con the grounds of immediate workplace disruption asserted in <em>Pickering </em>and the cases that followed it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>470.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is clear from the record that the impact of Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d was felt and DSS and the commissioner had every reason to conclude that it would interfere with DSS\u2019s goals. Pereira could have had no reasonable expectation that her remarks would not be overheard or acted on: the event was political and public, even though not open to the general public.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Tindle </em>v. <em>Caudell, 56 </em>F.3d 966, 972 (8th Cir. 1995) (\u201cThere was the potential for more direct consequences to the department than if [she] had attended a family or neighborhood party . . .\u201d). While a \u201cshowing of actual disruption is not always required in the balancing process under <em>Pickering,\u201d id., </em>citing <em>Shands </em>v. <em>Kennett, </em>993 F.2d 1337 (8th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072 (1994), there was objective evidence that Pereira\u2019s behavior had affected the integrity of DSS in the Fall River community. The \u201cjoke\u201d carried the \u201cclear potential\u201d for undermining DSS relations with its clients and the larger community where trust and confidence may be critical. See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Even if Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d had not generated the heated public response that it did, we recognize the interest of the department in disciplining Pereira. Investigators, such as Pereira, face the often difficult task of making unwelcome investigations into the lives and homes of citizens. This is the State operating, as it must to protect the lives and well-being of infants and children, in a highly intrusive manner. DSS cannot take the risk that it will be spumed by the community \u2014 or by a single adult \u2014 because its investigators are biased or lack judgment. To be effective, DSS and its investigators must both be, and be perceived to be, impartial and fair. Pereira\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d comment (as she herself characterizes it) undermined those goals. See <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, supra </em>at 390 (\u201cin weighing the State\u2019s interest. . . some attention must be paid to the responsibilities of the employee within the agency\u201d). The commissioner was understandably concerned about the appearance of racial bias in the department\u2019s investigators. At the very least Pereira exhibited outstandingly poor judgment, and poor judgment is inconsistent with the task often fraught with difficulties that investigators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>face every day. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, supra </em>at 494 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (government\u2019s foremost interest is to prevent impropriety and appearance of impropriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We defer to the commissioner\u2019s judgment that a DSS investigator must behave in a manner that \u201cleaves no doubt\u201d as to her ability and willingness \u201cto treat families of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds with respect, dignity, and fairness.\u201d See <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 673 (1994) (Court has \u201cconsistently given greater deference to government predictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee speech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on the speech of the public at large\u201d); <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 151-152 (\u201cWhen close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer\u2019s judgment is appropriate\u201d). We agree with the commissioner\u2019s assessment that Pereira\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d was \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201ctotally at odds with the judgment and sensitivity required to perform [the] duties\u201d of a DSS investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">It is not our task to determine whether the commissioner\u2019s decision to discipline Pereira was wise, or whether the sanction she selected was appropriate. Our task is to decide whether Pereira had the right to say what she did \u201cso that she could not only not be fired for it, but could not be formally reprimanded for it, or even prevented from repeating [her joke] endlessly into the future.\u201d <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, supra </em>at 399 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The great value of the constitutional right of free speech does not require that outcome. A public employee who makes a \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d and \u201cunthinking\u201d remark in circumstances that damage the effectiveness or integrity of her employing agency is not entitled to claim that she is naive about the consequences of her speech and thereby protected from the obvious consequences of her behavior. The department, in our view, has met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The commissioner challenges the judge\u2019s determination that the action did not entitle her to the benefit of qualified immunity. A public official who performs a discretionary function may be shielded from civil liability in an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by the doctrine of qualified immunity. See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 &amp; n.30 (1982). See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973). To overcome a claim of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must show that the State official directly participated in violating a right of the plaintiff that is \u201cclearly established.\u201d See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987) (right must be clearly established so that a \u201creasonable official\u201d would understand that her actions violate the right). In light of our conclusion that no right of Pereira was violated, it follows that she has no claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We need not, therefore, address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the availability of a qualified immunity defense. See <em>Estate of Gilmore </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>787 F.2d 714, 723 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 882 (1986). We note, however, that while her constitutional right of free speech is \u201cclearly established,\u201d the line drawing mandated by <em>Pickering </em>is by no means clear where the speech at issue took place off duty and had nothing to do with the workplace, but had a demonstrable impact on the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment for Pereira on her civil rights claim and denying the commissioner qualified immunity is reversed. Judgment is to be entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> On appeal Pereira has not pursued her claim under the Massachusetts Constitution, and we do not address it.

See note 4, <em>infra. </em>Pereira cannot circumvent the limitation period by framing her action as one for declaratory judgment. See <em>School Comm. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>395 Mass. 800, 807-808 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> In the interim, the parties had commenced arbitration concerning Pereira\u2019s firing. A decision by the arbitrator was issued after the cross motions for summary judgment had been argued, but before the judge issued his memorandum and order. The arbitrator\u2019s decision was not part of the summary judgment record but was filed by the defendants in support of their motion to stay the judgment. The arbitrator ruled that Pereira\u2019s off-duty conduct had a \u201cmeaningful and substantial nexus\u201d to her workplace and warranted some form of discipline. She determined that a one-year suspension, rather than discharge, was \u201csufficient\u201d discipline \u201cto instill in Ms. Pereira a commitment to never repeat the injurious type of statement that she made and to assure the community that the Department does not tolerate any form of racism.\u201d Pereira does not challenge, here, the severity of her discipline. She argues that she is immune from all discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> Although the judge\u2019s order did not conclude Pereira\u2019s action at the trial level, his order denying the commissioner qualified immunity \u201cis final\u201d and \u201cthe question of the validity of the judge\u2019s order is ripe for consideration by this court.\u201d <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 31 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> In allowing the defendants\u2019 motion to stay the order pending appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>judge based his decision on the fact that the arbitrator had come to a conflicting decision.
