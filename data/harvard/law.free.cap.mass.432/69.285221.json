The order requires the defendant to pay child support to the Department of Revenue (DOR), acting on behalf of the mother of the defendant\u2019s children, A.M.R., and the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of Transitional Assistance (DTA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal the parties both agree on the result sought \u2014 the vacating of the child support order. The appeal consequently places both parties in the unusual posture of standing together on the same side of the argument, both ranked against the judicial order and the rationale behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">A.M.R., the defendant, and their three children receive TAFDC benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under State law child support payments from a parent (typically absent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) are paid to the DTA as partial reimbursement for the TAFDC benefits paid to assist his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>children. See G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(b)(2) (1994). What makes this case unusual, and what has provoked this appeal, is that the defendant is not an absent father, but rather lives with and has always supported his children. Consequently, the judge\u2019s order for child support, paid out of the household income to the DTA, has the effect of reducing dramatically the income of the household where the children live. It is a child support order that effectively reduces support for the children who ostensibly were to benefit from it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The defendant appealed from both the initial April, 1998, order and the amended order of November, 1998, based on a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, as noted, the DOR is also arguing against the orders. The appeals were consolidated. We transferred the case on our own motion. We agree with the defendant and the DOR and vacate the judge\u2019s April 2, 1998, order as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant and A.M.R. have lived together since 1990, except for a short period in 1996. They live with their three children, three through five years old at the time of the April, 1998, order. The uncontested evidence is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>defendant has always contributed to his children\u2019s support. The defendant has medical problems connected to a knee condition and is frequently unemployed or underemployed. In April, 1998, he earned only $282.76 and his household was eligible for TAFDC benefits because its total income did not exceed TAFDC eligibility levels.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the defendant has not availed himself of every opportunity to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The Probate Court proceedings concerning the defendant began April 14, 1997, when the DOR, as the subrogee of the DTA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> sought to establish officially the paternity of his three children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no claim that the defendant had ever denied paternity of his three children; they bore the defendant\u2019s surname. As the DOR acknowledged before this court, it had reason to establish the defendant\u2019s paternity, so that in the event he ever left his family, the DOR would be in a position to seek child support from him. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(4)(A) (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(requiring State plan for child support enforcement to provide services relating to establishment of paternity). After a hearing on May 21, 1997, the judge adjudicated the defendant the father of the children, and ordered him to notify the DOR and file a financial statement on securing employment and to report to the family service office (FSO) of the Probate Court with fifteen verified job applications per week. The order did not adjudicate custody of the children, who were living with both parents. The judge\u2019s May 21, 1997, order, docketed June 10, 1997, also stated that the issue of child support may be \u201cmarked up\u201d by motion by any interested party.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On July 22, 1997, the FSO filed a civil contempt complaint against the defendant for violation of the May 21 order because he had not reported fifteen job applications every week. The contempt complaint did not assert that any child support order had been violated and did not seek entry of child support orders. In September, 1997, the defendant found employment. On April 1, 1998, A.M.R. reported to the Probate Court that the household was receiving $741 per month in TAFDC benefits, \u201cdepending on wages\u201d; the defendant reported gross earnings of $260 per week from his job at that time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On April 1, 1998, the judge conducted a brief hearing (the entire transcript is two and one-half pages long) concerning the contempt complaint, at which an attorney for the DOR, a representative of the FSO, A.M.R., pro se, and the defendant, pro se, were present. The judge and the DOR attorney had a brief exchange, in which the DOR attorney informed the judge that they were before the court solely due to the failure of the defendant to report to the FSO. When the judge suggested that the defendant would owe $80.60 under the child support guidelines, the DOR attorney responded that the defendant was part of the household and the DOR could not ask for child support because he was in the TAFDC grant. Before any questioning of either A.M.R. or the defendant, and without providing any opportunity for the defendant to speak on his own behalf, the judge ordered the defendant as follows: \u201cYou\u2019re to resign from the AFDC grant, sir, today and you\u2019re going to pay child support to the Department of Revenue on behalf of these children. . . . [Yjou\u2019re no longer a part of that group, [so] file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>your discharge from that today. I\u2019m going to establish [a child support] order of $80.60 a week and that\u2019s to be paid to the Department of Revenue. That will be by wage assignment . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge issued a written order to this effect that day, docketed on April 2, 1998. The judge did not make any ruling on the contempt complaint. According to the DOR, \u201c[t]he court did not enter any order on the contempt complaints for failure to report job applications, having learned from the DOR attorney and the financial statement that [the defendant] was employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Later, on September 22, 1998, the judge entered \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d The judge \u201cfound\u201d that the defendant and A.M.R. had a combined monthly income of approximately $1,781,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and \u201cfound\u201d that their monthly expenses were $1,060. She concluded that the defendant, although living with his children in the household, was not a \u201ccustodial\u201d parent, and thus could be ordered to pay child support.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As part of her rationale for the judgment the judge stated that the household had \u201cexcess earnings,\u201d which \u201cshould be utilized, in the form of a child support order, to reimburse the coffers of the Department of Transitional Assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge reasoned that it was \u201cagainst public policy for the Court to exempt a non-custodial parent, who has been adjudicated the father of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>minor children and is a wage earner, from paying child support solely because he has the same address as his children and their mother,\u201d and that the level of child support was appropriately set at the amount indicated by the application of the child support guidelines. The judge reasoned that the child support order was \u201cin-line with the public policy expressed by G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1, that children shall be maintained from the resources of their parents, thereby relieving the burden borne by the citizens of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">There is evidence that dire financial consequences followed the order and the consequent garnishing of the defendant\u2019s paycheck. A.M.R., the defendant, and their three young children were unable to pay their rent and were in danger of being evicted. Their gas and electricity were maintained only by borrowing funds from A.M.R.\u2019s grandmother. They were unable to purchase sufficient food for the household. Insurance for their car<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 needed to bring their daughter to medical appointments and to get the defendant to work when his knee is troubling him \u2014 was to be cancelled for nonpayment. Both A.M.R. and the defendant stated that their children were suffering due to the garnishing of C.M.J.\u2019s wages under the child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review child support orders, and decisions on motions for relief from judgment pursuant to rule 60 (b), to determine if there has been a judicial abuse of discretion. See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>G.W.A., </em>412 Mass. 435, 441 (1992); <em>Kalenderian </em>v. <em>Marden, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931 (1999); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 429, 433, 435 (1979). We find merit in many of the arguments advanced by the defendant and the DOR for relief from the child support order and examine in detail only two we consider most significant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">a. <em>Noncustodial parent. </em>The judge premised the child support order on the defendant\u2019s being a \u201cnoncustodial\u201d parent, a conclusion he challenges. The judge held that pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>the mother shall have custody of a child bom out of wedlock, and this custody continues in the absence of an order or judgment of the Probate Court relative to custody. Because there had been no order from the Probate Court awarding the defendant legal or physical custody of his children, nor any petition by him for custody, the judge concluded that the defendant was not a custodial parent and was responsible for paying child support. See <em>id. </em>The judge\u2019s child support order is thus premised on an interpretation of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>that would presume that, \u201c[i]n the absence of an order or judgment of a probate and family court relative to custody, the mother shall continue to have custody of a child after an adjudication of paternity,\u201d whereas the father so adjudicated would not be presumed to have or share custody, that is, would be \u201cnoncustodial,\u201d even though he lived with and supported his children. This is an erroneous interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The resolution of custody questions \u201cnecessarily begins with the premise that parents have a natural right to the custody of their children.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587 (1981). See <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>373 Mass. 178, 185 (1977) (\u201cParents\u2019 claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic to the structure of society; the custody, care and nurture of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>child reside first in the parents\u201d). See also <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., </em>379 Mass. 1, 3 (1979) (right to raise one\u2019s children is basic civil right; interests of parents in their relationship with their children are fundamental and constitutionally protected). Consequently, absent an adjudication of custody to the contrary, a parent, such as the defendant, living in the home with his minor children and supporting those children, is a custodial parent. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The statutory provision the judge cites, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>does not change this conclusion for the following reasons. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>states: \u201cPrior to or in the absence of an adjudication or voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the mother shall have custody of a child bom out of wedlock. In the absence of an order or judgment of a probate and family court relative to custody, the mother shall continue to have custody of a child after an adjudication of paternity or voluntary acknowledgment of parentage.\u201d Notably, the statutory provision does not state that an adjudicated father shall <em>not </em>have custody in the absence of such an order or judgment, nor does it employ the term \u201cnoncustodial\u201d or apply this term to the father. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">To interpret the statute as the judge did, so as to presume that the mother, but not the father, shall have custody in such circumstances, would raise potential constitutional problems. See art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. \u201c[O]ur duty [is] to construe a statute in a way to avoid constitutional problems\u201d if reasonable principles of interpretation permit. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council, </em>425 Mass. 406, 410 (1997). Consequently, we cannot construe this statutory provision to mean that a mother in such circumstances is a custodial parent, but a father is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">We also agree with the defendant that the judge\u2019s interpretation mns counter to other Massachusetts and Federal statutes concerning child support enforcement and custody. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 669b(a) (1994) (regarding grants to programs to support \u201cnoncustodial parents\u2019 access to and visitation of their children\u201d); G. L. c. 62D, \u00a7 10A (commissioner authorized to enter into reciprocal agreements with other States to share lists of <em>absent </em>parents who owe support payments). Cf. G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (court may order support for child <em>aged eighteen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>to twenty-one </em>who is domiciled in home of parent and dependent on that parent). Chapter 209C does not provide a definition of custody, but G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31, does.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 31 provides that \u201csole legal custody\u201d means that \u201cone parent shall have the right and responsibility to make major decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development,\u201d and similarly, \u201csole physical custody\u201d means that \u201ca child shall reside with and be under the supervision of one parent, subject to reasonable visitation by the other parent.\u201d These definitions of sole custody do not square readily with the circumstances here, where the defendant (father), and not solely A.M.R. (mother), has \u201cthe right and responsibility to make major decisions\u201d regarding the children\u2019s welfare, and where the children \u201creside with and [are] under the supervision\u201d of both. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587 (1981). In addition, our courts have regularly applied the term \u201cnoncustodial\u201d parent in circumstances where such a parent did not live with the other parent and the children, but rather had visitation with the children in many cases. See, e.g., <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 182-184 (1998) (parents separated; \u201cnoncustodial\u201d father, living in Texas, granted visitation); <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 479, 486 (1997) (\u201cnoncustodial\u201d parent had supervised visits, visitation rights); <em>Leonardo </em>v. <em>Leonardo, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 573, 576 (1996) (\u201cnoncustodial\u201d parent had schedule to visit children); <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Juskalian, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 202, 202-203, 209 (1992) (\u201cnoncustodial\u201d father resides in Massachusetts; mother\u2019s household is in California with child). Similarly, and significantly, we have said that the subrogation provision of G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 21, concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ing the right of the DTA to collect support payments owed to a welfare recipient, \u201cprotects the public from the burden of assuming the support obligations of an <em>absent </em>spouse who is able to pay\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 485 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We also agree with the defendant that one practical outcome of letting the judge\u2019s flawed interpretation stand, presuming sole maternal custody and labeling the father \u201cnoncustodial\u201d in such cases, would be that unmarried, cooperative, cohabiting fathers would need to seek custody determinations from the Probate Court to protect themselves \u2014 and, in cases such as this, their children \u2014 from child support orders. The judge\u2019s interpretation would therefore spur adjudication in a context in which parents have, thus far, understood that no adjudication was necessary \u2014 a result contrary to our interests in minimizing State interference in the protected zone of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The judge cited G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13 (c), and c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (c), for the proposition that \u201c[i]n any proceeding to establish or modify an amount of child support, the child support guidelines . . . shall apply.\u201d She further observed that, if the court finds that a parent is chargeable with the support of a child, the court must order the parent to pay toward that support, citing G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The judge\u2019s implicit characterization of this as a proceeding to establish or modify child support was incorrect. The contempt complaint did not raise this issue, nor did the FSO or DOR at the hearing. To the contrary, at the hearing the DOR told the judge that they could not ask for child support in this case because the defendant was in the household receiving the TAFDC grant. For similar reasons, the judge\u2019s invocation of the child support guidelines seems inappropriate in such a case. The guidelines state that \u201c[t]here shall be a presumption that these guidelines apply ... in all cases <em>seeking the establishment or modification of a child support </em>order\u201d (emphasis added), Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines, issued by the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court, something that was not taking place here.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Moreover, the child support guidelines cited by the judge contain language that should have cautioned the judge against their application, and against the issuance of a child support order, in such a case. The guidelines expressly refer to the \u201cprinciples\u201d of \u201cmeeting] the child\u2019s survival needs in the first instance\u201d and of \u201cprotecting] a subsistence level of income of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>parents at the low end of the income range whether or not they are on public assistance.\u201d In addition, it is clear that the guidelines are intended to advance the best interests of the child, and that the guidelines may be departed from where they do not serve those best interests. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (c), 20. Given the predictable impact of the child support order here, of reducing the family\u2019s income in direct contravention of these principles, invocation of the guidelines to support the order was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The guidelines also seem clearly intended for situations where the family has broken up or is on the verge of doing so, not those in which the family is intact and the father is directly supporting his children. They state, for example, as principles, \u201c[t]o minimize the economic impact on the child <em>of family </em>breakup\u201d and \u201cto provide the standard of living the child would have enjoyed <em>had the family been intacf </em>\u2019 (emphasis added). The guidelines \u201care based upon traditional custody and visitation arrangements,\u201d and are not applicable where \u201cthe parties agree to shared physical custody,\u201d the court establishes shared physical custody, or where there is split physical custody. Guideline \u00a7 11(D)(1). All this language argues against the application of the guidelines, and, indirectly, against the ordering of parental child support generally, against a parent within an intact family, where the parents are both sharing a household and together raising and supporting the children who are the subject of the support order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">b. <em>Best interests of the children. </em>The DOR makes the additional argument that the child support order offended public policy and was not consistent with our Commonwealth\u2019s policy of advancing the best interests of the children, particularly in the entering of child support orders. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (c). See also <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 20 (child support judgments may be modified only if modification is in child\u2019s best interests); G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1 (Commonwealth\u2019s policy is to direct its efforts to strengthening family life for protection and care of children and to assist use by any family of all available resources to this end); <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>at \u00a7 3 (when department seeks to enforce payment of arrearage for child support, it shall not seek an order that would indirectly result in decrease in amount of current support paid on behalf of child or spouse support is owed to). We agree that a child support order that further impoverishes the household of the children the order was meant to support cannot be in the best interests of those children.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">There was no evidence or argument presented that the defendant was circumventing DTA regulations, or obtaining TAFDC improperly or in excess of an amount properly payable to an assistance unit with an underemployed parent. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>The Probate Court judge seemed to ignore the fact that the household\u2019s already modest TAFDC benefits \u2014 a maximum of $741 per month for a family of five \u2014 were already being reduced because of the defendant\u2019s earnings. Neither equity, public policy, nor statutory provisions required, in effect, a further reduction in the net TAFDC benefits by a child support order that reimbursed the DTA nearly twenty per cent of the family\u2019s already low income.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judge abused her discretion in ordering child support. We vacate the order entered April 2, 1998, as amended. We remand this matter for entry of an order dismissing the civil contempt complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> In that same initial April 2, 1998, order, the judge had also required the defendant to resign from the program, but vacated that provision in an amended order of November 20, 1998. The amended order resulted from the Department of Revenue\u2019s (DOR\u2019s) September 21, 1998, motion for relief from judgment, seeking to vacate the judge\u2019s April 2 order in its entirety. A hearing on the motion took place on November 17, 1998. The amended order left standing the provisions ordering child support. The judge let the child support provisions stand even though the defendant was again unemployed at the time of the November 17, 1998, hearing. In contrast, as the DOR notes, the court did not order support payments at the time of the original 1997 paternity judgment because it recognized the defendant was unemployed at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), administered by the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA), is the successor program to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 640 (2000).

See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Other sections of this Senate report make clear that the Federal concern with enforcing child support for AFDC recipients was focused on collecting support from absent or deserting parents.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth retains the child support as reimbursement for the TAFDC benefits . . . . As a result, the [defendant\u2019s] family has become further impoverished.\u201d One DTA administrator stated that the family would lose $349 per month due to the child support order, although, apparently, pursuant to departmental regulations, $50 of that amount would actually be remitted to A.M.R., meaning a net loss to the family of $299 per month due to the order.

A DTA assistant director stated in an affidavit that, although the defendant had earned income in April, 1998, \u201che was part of [A.M.R.\u2019s] assistance unit because his income did not exceed TAFDC eligibility levels for a family of five.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> TAFDC recipients subrogate to the DTA the right to collect child support payments owed them; the DOR, in turn, acts to collect for the DTA. See G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 21; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 483-486 (1980) (discussing this subrogation). See also G.

We do not construe this query as a timely invitation by the judge to the defendant to present his side of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> This figure is apparently gross income. The $1,781 in gross monthly income found by the judge appears to be based on some unspecified assumption that the family was making $741 in TAFDC benefits per month <em>at the same time </em>it was receiving gross weekly earned income from the defendant of $260 a week or $1,040 a month. As the DTA assistant director\u2019s affidavit, submitted to the court prior to the judge\u2019s amended order of November 20, 1998, makes clear, however, a TAFDC benefit level for a family of five of $741 is for <em>unemployed </em>recipients. When the defendant earned wages, that benefit level was reduced. As the judge herself found, the family\u2019s TAFDC benefits varied monthly depending on the defendant\u2019s wages. Thus, the $1,781 gross income figure is not supported by the record and seems implausible, because it does not appear that the family would have been receiving $741 in TAFDC benefits while the defendant was earning $1,040 a month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\"> See Part 2a, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\"> The judge also gave, as part of the rationale for her order, that the defendant had not reported to the FSO with job applications, had not informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the DOR that he was employed, and did not file a completed financial statement with the Probate and Family Court upon securing employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">There was no evidence that the defendant or A.M.R. had not reported the defendant\u2019s earnings to the DTA once he became employed. Nor does the judge state or imply that any attempt to defraud the DTA was at issue, in terms of improper eligibility for or improper amounts received of TAFDC assistance, in any delayed reporting by the defendant of his employment to the court and another agency (the DOR). To the contrary, the judge found that the \u201cexact amount of TAFDC benefits varied from month to month depending on [the defendant\u2019s] wages,\u201d suggesting that the household was reporting the defendant\u2019s wages to the DTA and their TAFDC benefits were being lowered accordingly in the months prior to the April 1, 1998, contempt hearing. Moreover, the DOR asserted, in its September 21, 1998, motion for relief from judgment, that the \u201cDTA was aware that [the defendant] was working and included him in the budget. The AFDC budget was reduced to account for [the defendant\u2019s] income.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\"> DTA regulations allow TAFDC recipient families to own a car. See 106 Code Mass.

Due process concerns are raised when the parties have not been given notice that will apprise them of the matters the judge will adjudicate. See, e.g., <em>Mullein </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Manuel, </em>428 Mass. 527, 535 (1998). The defendant claims that the failure of the judge to provide the defendant with an opportunity to be heard before ruling also raises potential due process concerns. See, e.g., <em>Massand </em>v. <em>Medical Professional Mut. Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 690, 694 (1995), citing <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 267 (1970). We do not reach the constitutional claim. See <em>American Motorcyclist Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Park Comm\u2019n of Brockton, </em>412 Mass. 753, 758 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b100-5\"> One relevant regulatory definition of \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d would lead to circular reasoning in this case and is not helpful. It defines a noncustodial parent as \u201can individual. . . who owes or may owe a duty of support, or who is liable under a child support obligation, or who is alleged . . . to be the parent of a child to whom a duty of support is owed.\u201d 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 18.18A.1. Because parents ordinarily owe a duty of support for their minor children, see, e.g., G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 8, this regulatory definition of noncustodial parent, read too literally, might appear to apply to any parent \u2014 an unsupportable result. Nor would we find it supportable for a judge to use this regulatory definition to transform a parent living with and supporting his children into a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d through the simple bootstrapping technique of issuing a child support order to create \u201cliabfility] under a child support obligation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Payments in support of the children from agencies, absent parents, or others with a duty of support, may of course still be appropriate even if the children are in a reconstituted or otherwise intact family. An obligation for child support owed by a noncustodial parent does not automatically become void if the noncustodial parent returns to the household, assumes custody of the child, or resumes cohabitation with the custodial parent.
