Code Civ. Proc., sec. 457; <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co., </em>78 Cal. 181; <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>30 Cal. 489.) If the finding that appellant\u2019s obligation to pay eight hundred and thirty-five dollars was not dependent on the sale be true, the instrument casts no obligation upon plaintiff at all. <em>(Manly </em>v. <em>Howlett, </em>55 Cal. 96; <em>Sloss </em>v. <em>Allman, </em>64 Cal. 48.) Relief must not necessarily he denied because there is a conflict of testimony. <em>(Sullivan </em>v. Moorhead, 99 Cal. 161; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Moriarty, </em>88 Cal. 211; <em>Higgins v. Parsons, </em>65 Cal. 280; <em>Cleghorn </em>v. <em>Zumwalt, </em>83 Cal. 156; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Waterman, 85 </em>Cal. 503.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-8\"><em>C.

Deacon, not later than one year after date, the sum of eight hundred and thirty-five dollars; said sum to be sooner paid if realized from the sale of the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section six, township thirty-one S., range twenty-nine east, which said tract of land I hereby place in the hands of said Deacon exclusively for the said term of one year, for sale at a minimum price of forty-five dollars per acre. Said Deacon to receive a commission on said sale of five per cent. Said Deacon to use diligent effort to obtain the best price possible in excess of said price of forty-five dollars per acre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">Nov. 23, 1892. H. A. Blodget.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The complaint\u2014filed March 21,1894\u2014set out a copy of said instrument, and alleged its execution by defendant, and that no part of said sum of eight hundred and thirty-five dollars has been paid, but contained no averment that plaintiff had sold or endeavored to sell the land therein described. Defendant contends that the pleading was insufficient; that the contract imposed on plaintiff the obligation to use diligent effort to sell the land before the expiration of one year at forty-five dollars per acre or more, and that he should have alleged such effort in the complaint. This is so if such endeavor on the part of plaintiff is a condition precedent to the duty of defendant to pay said sum of eight hundred and thirty-five dollars, but we think it clearly is not such a condition. Stipulations in a contract are not construed as conditions precedent, unless that construction is made necessary by the terms of the contract. <em>(Front Street etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Butler, 50 </em>Cal. 577.) The instrument sued on contains two engagements on the part of defendant: one to pay plaintiff the sum of eight hundred and thirty-five dollars not later than one year from date; the other authorizing plaintiff to sell the land described; and the only connection or dependence between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>them is that the accomplishment of a sale in virtue of the latter would entitle the plaintiff to earlier performance of the former; plaintiff's obligation to use diligence relates entirely to the second contract and not to the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">One or two other points are made, but they are unimportant; we find no error in the record available to appellant. The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Vanclief, O., and Searls, 0., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Temple, J., McFarland, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
