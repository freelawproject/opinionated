J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">NTS Technical Systems, Inc. (NTS), and ETCR, Inc. (ETCR) (collectively, appellants),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment entered in an eminent domain action by the City of Santa Clarita (City). They contend the judgment must be reversed, because the trial court erred in finding they failed to show any qualifying goodwill loss; in excluding expert valuation testimony; and in computing the value of the \u201cpart take\u201d (i.e., taking of a portion of the condemnee\u2019s property).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The City\u2019s project entailed construction and operation of a major arterial public road about 116 feet wide denominated Golden Valley Road (GVR).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In furtherance of its project, the City condemned an unimproved portion of ETCR\u2019s property, which consisted of 148.33 acres in then a relatively remote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and rural section of the City. NTS operated its Saugus/Santa Clarita facility on the property, which it leased. The condemned portion consisted of 0.461 acres (fee simple), 5.176 acres (slope/drainage easement), and 1.61 acres (temporary construction easement).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On August 3, 1999, City filed its eminent domain complaint, and made a probable compensation deposit of $48,175 based on an appraisal of Scott Lidgard. ETCR was served on August 14, 1999, with the immediate possession order. On October 14, 1999, appellants filed a joint answer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The court trial began on December 9, 2002. The statement of decision was issued on May 23, 2003. The trial court found the proper date of valuation was August 3, 1999, the date of the probable compensation deposit. The court further found appellants failed to show any goodwill loss caused by GVR. The amount of $48,917.53 was the just compensation for the \u201cpart take.\u201d On June 17, 2003, judgment was entered, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">I. <em>Loss of Goodwill Caused by GVR Not Shown</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Appellants contend the jury, not the court, determines whether the loss of goodwill was \u201ccaused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.510, subd. (a)(1); hereinafter, section 1263.510(a)(1))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that they made the requisite showing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\u201cGoodwill\u201d in this context \u201cconsists of the benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location, reputation for dependability, skill or quality, and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage.\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510, subd. (b).) The property owner has the initial burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that there was a loss of goodwill \u201ccaused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510(a)(1)). (See, e.g., <em>Redevelopment Agency of San Diego v. Attisha </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 357, 367-368 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 126]; <em>Regents of University of California v. Sheily </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 824, 831 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 84] <em>(Sheily); Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 469, 475 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">We conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to allow a jury to decide the issue of whether the prerequisite conditions for compensation existed. Compensation for goodwill loss involves a two-step process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Whether the qualifying conditions for such compensation (\u00a7 1263.510(a)) have been met is a matter for the trial court to resolve.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **Only if the court finds these conditions exist does the remaining issue of the value of the goodwill loss, if any, go to the jury. (See, e.g., <em>Emeryville Redevelopment Agency v. Harcros Pigments, Inc. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1119 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 12]; accord, <em>Sheily, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 830.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">II. <em>August 3, 1999, Proper Date of Valuation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in finding August 3, 1999, the date of City\u2019s original deposit, to be the date of valuation, because \u201cCity failed to deposit the true and real amount of probable compensation for ETCR\u2019s property when it commenced this action in 1999, and has <em>never </em>deposited any compensation on behalf of NTS.\u201d (Original italics.) Also, \u201cit would be an unconstitutional denial of due process to value ETCR\u2019s property on a date <em>three years prior </em>to\u201d the determination that City was entitled to take (not simply possess) that property. (Original italics.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Alternatively, appellants argue that, if the date of valuation is the \u201cdate of deposit,\u201d this date should be the date of City\u2019s supplemental deposit, which was September 12, 2002. We find appellants\u2019 positions unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">A property owner has a constitutional right to \u201cjust compensation,\u201d which is the fair market value of the property \u201cat the time the taking occurred\u201d by the public entity. <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Gilmore </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 790, 796-797, 801 [214 Cal.Rptr. 904, 700 P.2d 794] (iGilmore); see also U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In a straight eminent domain action (no pretrial possession sought), the statutory date of valuation is the date the action began if trial on the compensation issue is commenced within one year; on the other hand, the statutory date of valuation is the date when trial on that issue commenced if trial is not brought within one year after the action began. (\u00a7\u00a7 1263.120, 1263.130; <em>Leaf v. City of San Mateo </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 1184, 1190-1191 [198 Cal.Rptr. 447], overruled on another ground in <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 292 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259].)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Nonetheless, the statutory date of valuation does not control where its effect would deprive the owner of \u201cjust compensation.\u201d <em>(Gilmore, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 797.) In this situation, the valuation date would be the date that affords the owner \u201cjust compensation.\u201d (See <em>Saratoga Fire Protection Dist. v. Hackett </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 895, 905-906 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 696]; cf. <em>Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. United States </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 1, 17 [81 L.Ed.2d 1, 104 S.Ct. 2187] [\u201cconvention of using the date of the commencement of the trial as the date of the valuation\u201d violates Fifth Amendment \u201cif the result of that approach is to provide the owner substantially less than the fair market value of his property on the date the United States tenders payment\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In contrast, the date of valuation under the \u201cquick take\u201d or \u201cearly possession\u201d law (\u00a7 1263.110 et seq.) is a date on which the condemner deposits \u201cprobable just compensation\u201d for the property, which entitles condemner to seek immediate possession. (See, e.g., <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As we shall demonstrate, the appropriate date for valuation of the property was August 3, 1999, rather than September 12, 2002, the date City voluntarily increased its original deposit, or December 9, 2002, the date of trial, which was more than a year after the action was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">On August 3, 1999, City deposited $48,175, which represented the \u201cprobable compensation\u201d based on Lidgard\u2019s appraisal. Based on this date, D. Michael Mason, City\u2019s trial appraiser, valued the property at $80,250. On September 12, 2002, City voluntarily increased its deposit to reflect this amount. (See \u00a7 1255.030, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">At trial, the court ruled August 3, 1999, was the date of valuation. The court rejected appellants\u2019 argument that the date of valuation had to be changed in light of City\u2019s supplemental deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Initially, we conclude the trial court did not err in finding August 3, 1999, to be the date of valuation under the \u201cquick take\u201d statutory scheme. It is undisputed that City made its deposit of \u201cprobable compensation\u201d on August 3, 1999 (\u00a7 1263.110, subd. (a)), and on September 10, 1999, the court issued an order of immediate possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">We further conclude City\u2019s supplemental deposit on September 12, 2002, did not require the date of deposit to be changed to this later date. Appellants have not cited any persuasive authority for the proposition that the date of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>voluntary supplemental deposit supersedes the date of the original deposit. Moreover, such a conclusion is not compelled by law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Under the \u201cquick take\u201d statutory scheme, the condemner or \u201cany party having an interest in the property for which the deposit was made\u201d is entitled to make a motion requesting the court to \u201cdetermine or redetermine whether the amount deposited is the probable amount of compensation that will be awarded in the proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.030, subd. (a).) \u201cIf the [condemner] has taken possession of the property and the court determines that the probable amount of compensation exceeds the amount deposited, the court shall order the amount deposited to be increased to the amount determined to be the probable amount of compensation. If the amount on deposit is not increased accordingly within 30 days from the date of the court\u2019s order, or any longer time as the court may have allowed at the time of making the order, the [condemnee] may serve on the [condemner] a notice of election to treat that failure as an abandonment of the proceeding. If the [condemner] does not cure its failure within 10 days after receipt of such notice, the court shall, upon motion of the [condemnee], enter judgment dismissing the proceeding . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1255.030, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">A plain reading of these provisions does not support an inference that the date of deposit, and thus date of valuation, transforms into the date of a supplemental deposit. Rather, the designated consequence of the condemner\u2019s refusal to increase the original deposit to the amount determined by the court is the possible dismissal of its eminent domain action. In other words, if appellants had invoked the procedure to increase the deposit, they might have obtained a ruling that $48,175 was insufficient; that this amount had to be increased to the actual probable compensation amount; and that if City failed to do so, they were entitled to move for dismissal. Appellants elected not to proceed in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In another section, the \u201cquick take\u201d statute provides that the condemner \u201cmay at any time increase the amount deposited without making a motion under this section.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.030, subd. (f).) We consider this particular section in the context of the entire statutory framework. (See, e.g., <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Stostad </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 23, 32 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 360, 939 P.2d 760].) Nowhere does the statute address the valuation date in the context of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>voluntary increase. We infer from this silence that the Legislature did not intend the date of a supplemental deposit to become the date of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that under the \u201cquick take\u201d statute, the original \u201cprobable compensation\u201d deposit date is the date of valuation irrespective of any increase of deposit by the condemner.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 claim, it is inconsequential that NTS was not named as a defendant in the complaint filed on August 3, 1999, the same date the original deposit was made. It is ETCR, the owner, which is entitled to just compensation for land taken for public use. As a lessee, NTS is merely entitled \u201cto share in the condemnation award to compensate for the value of his or her leasehold interest. (\u00a7 1265.150; <em>City of Vista v. Fielder </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 612, 616 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 861, 919 P.2d 151].)\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency of San Diego </em>v. <em>Attisha, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th 357, 366.) Apportionment is a matter between ETCR and NTS. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Accordingly, under the \u201cquick take\u201d statute, the date of valuation is the date of the \u201cprobable compensation\u201d deposit without regard to the existence of any leasehold. Thus, it was not required that the probable compensation deposit be made on or after the date NTS became a party to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We find unpersuasive appellants\u2019 remaining claim that to allow the date of deposit to stand as the date of valuation would operate to deprive them of their constitutional right to \u201cjust compensation.\u201d They fail to support their claim with any applicable authority or record references. (See, e.g., <em>Shelly, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at pp. 826-827, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Saratoga, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 895, is misplaced. Under section 1263.120, the valuation date was the date the proceeding commenced. The <em>Saratoga </em>court concluded it would be unconstitutional to use this valuation date where \u201cunusual circumstances which, if believed by the trier of fact, would make it unjust to apply section 1263.120 to defendant\u2019s award.\u201d <em>(Saratoga, </em>at pp. 905-906.) The court concluded it was error to exclude evidence that the fair market value of the property at the time of trial, 11 months after the action commenced, had substantially increased, i.e., from $2 million to $3.2 million. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 906.) <em>Saratoga, </em>however, is factually inapplicable for the reasons that it was a straight condemnation, not a quick-take action and, unlike here, there was no deposit of probable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Moreover, if appellants believed that the \u201cprobable compensation\u201d was an amount greater than the original deposit, they could have made a motion for redetermination of the appropriate amount of deposit, which they elected not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>to do. (See <em>Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. U.S., supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 17-18 [no violation of Fifth Amendment where there exists \u201ca procedure for modifying a condemnation award when there is a substantial delay between the date of valuation and the date the judgment is paid, during which time the value of the land changes materially\u201d]; see also <em>Whittier Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Oceanic Arts </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1052, 1060 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 396] [trial court authorized to order an increase in the probable compensation deposit pending appeal from judgment by developer which acquired prejudgment possession of property, and amount of judgment exceeded amount deposited].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">III. <em>Exclusion of Expert Testimony Not Abuse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Appellants contend the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of Scott Delahooke based on his third appraisal and denying their motion for relief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There was no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On June 11, 2002, the exchange date, appellants produced Delahooke\u2019s first appraisal with a $230,000 fair market value based on May 20, 2002, and indicated that he could use August 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">On July 11, 2002, when Delahooke was deposed, appellants produced a second appraisal in which Delahooke again used May 20, 2002, but this time gave $815,000 as the fair market value and reiterated his offer to use the date of August 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">On December 11, 2002, day three of trial, City was served with Delahooke\u2019s third appraisal, which was dated November 22, 2002, and gave $410,000 as the fair market value based on August 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">City objected and made a motion in limine to exclude any valuation testimony by Delahooke, particularly his opinion based on his third appraisal. City essentially took the position that appellants acted in bad faith by instructing Delahooke, as a strategic tactic, to base his first and second appraisals on the May 20, 2002, date of valuation and that City was substantially prejudiced by the third appraisal which was belatedly served after trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Appellants filed both opposition and a companion motion to allow Delahooke to testify (\u00a7\u00a7 575.2, subd. (b) [failure to comply with local rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>not chargeable to client where noncompliance responsibility of counsel], 1258.290 [discretion to permit testimony on matters not set forth in statement of valuation data]). They conceded the motion only pertained to the third appraisal, because the earlier valuations based on the May 20, 2002, date were irrelevant in view of the court\u2019s ruling that August 3, 1999, was the correct valuation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The trial court granted City\u2019s motion and denied appellants\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The trial court\u2019s rulings were not an abuse of discretion. (See, e.g., <em>City of San Diego v. Barratt American Inc. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 917, 936 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 527] [abuse of discretion standard applicable to exclusion of valuation of property expert testimony]; see generally <em>Dart Industries, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1059, 1078 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 52 P.3d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The statement of valuation must include, among other data, \u201c[t]he date of valuation used by the witness\u201d and \u201c[t]he sales, contracts to sell and purchase, and leases supporting the opinion.\u201d (\u00a7 1258.260; see also \u00a7\u00a7 1258.240, 1258.250.) Upon objection, \u201c[n]o witness . . . may testify on direct examination during the case in chief of the party who called him to any opinion or data required to be listed in the statement of valuation data . . . unless such opinion or data is listed in the statement served except that testimony that is merely an explanation or elaboration of data so listed is not inadmissible . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1258.280, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Nonetheless, the trial court is imbued with discretion to permit a witness to testify regarding opinions or data which should have been included but were omitted from the statement \u201cupon such terms as may be just\u201d and under the circumstances that the party calling the witness made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements for exchange of valuation data (\u00a7\u00a7 1258.210-1258.260); he diligently gave notice to the opposing party after determining \u201cto have a witness called by him testify ... to any opinion or data required to be listed . . . but which was not so listed\u201d (\u00a7 1258.270, subd. (a)(2)); and the omission of the opinion or data was the product of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d (\u00a7 1258.290, subd. (a).) The trial court also is required to \u201ctake into account the extent to which the opposing party . . . will be prejudiced if ... the testimony concerning such opinion or data is given.\u201d (\u00a7 1258.290, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Additionally, a statement of valuation data must be exchanged between the parties in a timely manner. (\u00a7\u00a7 1258.220, 1258.230, subd. (a).) The trial court is vested with \u201cwide discretion in determining whether or not good cause has been shown for the delay in presenting valuation data to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>opposing party.\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. First Christian Church </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 690, 700 [189 Cal.Rptr. 749].) The court\u2019s ruling will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Appellants do not dispute that service of the third appraisal on City did not comply with the date agreed upon for exchange and that such service was not on \u201ca date 90 days prior to commencement of the trial on the issue of compensation or [a] date set by the court on noticed motion of either party establishing good cause therefor.\u201d (\u00a7 1258.220, subd. (a).) Delahooke\u2019s third appraisal therefore was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s findings of lack of good faith, absence of requisite notice, and inexcusable delay are supported by ample evidence. The court impliedly found the omission from the first and second appraisals of Delahooke\u2019s opinions and valuation data based on a August 3, 1999, date of valuation and the tardy service of the third appraisal were the product of a deliberate decision of appellants to obtain a strategic advantage over City, rather than the inadvertence or neglect of their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Appellants\u2019 decision to base their first and second appraisals on a date other than the statutory date of valuation, i.e., August 3, 1999, necessarily was based on an informed choice. On their face, the first and second appraisals reflect that, if requested, Delahooke would value the property based on August 3, 1999, the date of deposit. In his deposition, which was before his third appraisal, Delahooke, an experienced appraiser, admitted that he had never before used a date of valuation other than the date of deposit. He acknowledged that appellants\u2019 counsel, contrary to his advice, directed him to value the property as of May 20, 2002, instead of the date of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">With respect to the third appraisal, appellants do not claim that they were precluded by City or otherwise from serving City with a pretrial statement of valuation data based on August 3, 1999. Instead, appellants relied on the declaration of their counsel, Michael Maher, to justify the omission of the opinion and valuation data from the earlier two appraisals and the late service of the appraisal. He explained the choice of a date other than August 3, 1999, was based on uncertainty about the proper valuation date and that the third appraisal was necessitated by the trial court\u2019s determination of August 3, 1999, as the <em>correct date. It </em>is not for us to rejudge the trial court\u2019s determination that this explanation was not worthy of credit. (See, e.g., <em>Bazaure </em>v. <em>Richman, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 218, 221-222 [336 P.2d 1014].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Similarly, abundant evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that service of the belated third appraisal was prejudicial. The purpose of exchanging statements of valuation data in advance of trial is to foster fairness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>judicial economy. \u201cIn condemnation proceedings this has taken the form of an exchange of reports of experts during the final pretrial proceedings immediately in advance of trial. The key element is mutuality.\u201d <em>(Swartzman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 195, 203-204 [41 Cal.Rptr. 721].) This purpose would be subverted if one party were allowed to confront the other party with a statement of valuation data for the first time during trial based simply on the excuse of earlier indecisiveness. (See, e.g., <em>Swartzman, supra, </em>at p. 204 [genuine disclosure pretrial inhibited where party could merely \u201cprofess indecision until the day of trial\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Moreover, the untimely service of the statement might deprive the other party of the opportunity to counter its contents and effect. (See, e.g., <em>Bonds v. Roy </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 140, 148 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 289, 973 P.2d 66] [\u201cAllowing new and unexpected testimony for first time at trial\u201d inconsistent with requirement of \u201ctimely disclosure of the general substance of an expert\u2019s expected testimony\u201d in order for \u201cparties . .. properly [to] prepare for trial\u201d].) This is the situation here. Contrary to appellants\u2019 claim, the third appraisal was not simply a nonprejudicial \u201cmathematical recalculation\u201d of already known information. Rather, it was based on two new sales which were not listed in the earlier appraisals. One was the sale of the 38.26-acre Ruether Avenue parcel<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the other was the sale of the 16.02-acre 20976 Golden Triangle parcel. Moreover, Delahooke opined these were \u201cthe only truly comparable sales\u201d and that they were \u201cthe most comparable to the subject in location, date of sale and physical conditions . . . .\u201d (Cf. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Kling </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 916, 922-923 [99 Cal.Rptr. 642] [value opinion testimony admissible where answer already placed condemner on notice of owner\u2019s opinion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Mason declined to include the 20976 Golden Triangle sale as a comparable in his pretrial valuation. This fact, however, does not cure the City\u2019s loss of opportunity to prepare in advance of trial to counter the underpinnings of Delahooke\u2019s new valuation opinion. The first appraisal value of $230,000 was based on a 2002 date while the third appraisal value of $410,000 was based on a 1999 date. This almost doubling of valuation was peculiar: real estate prices rose from 1999 to 2002. (Cf. <em>State of California ex. rel. Public Works Bd. </em>v. <em>Bragg </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1018, 1028, 1029-1030 [228 Cal.Rptr. 576] [preclusion of valuation evidence not appropriate where prejudice showing questionable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>IV. <em>Amount of $48,917.53 as Just Compensation Not Error</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
