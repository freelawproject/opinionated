Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 459\u2014count 1); petty theft with a prior conviction (\u00a7 484\u2014count 2); and resisting, delaying or obstructing a peace officer (\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1) (hereafter section 148(a)(1))\u2014count 3), a misdemeanor. Prior to trial, the court had received Christopher\u2019s admission of allegations in the information that he had suffered a prior burglary conviction in June 2001 and had a prison prior (\u00a7\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) &amp; 668).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The court sentenced Christopher to the middle term of two years for the burglary conviction (count 1) and to a consecutive one-year term for the prison prior, resulting in an aggregate term of three years in state prison. The court imposed a concurrent middle term of two years for the petty theft conviction (count 2), but stayed that sentence under section 654. As to count 3 (\u00a7 148(a)(1)), the court imposed a concurrent sentence of 162 days, which Christopher had already served.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">In his appellant\u2019s opening brief, Christopher contends (1) his conviction of resisting, obstructing or delaying a peace officer in violation of section 148(a)(1) (count 3) should be reversed because the court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury with an \u201cimpermissible mandatory conclusive presumption\u201d that giving a false name to a peace officer constitutes \u201cwillfully resisting, obstructing or delaying\u201d a peace officer; and (2) his conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>that offense should also be reversed because there is insufficient evidence to show he willfully resisted, delayed or obstructed the police in the performance of their duties. In his appellant\u2019s supplemental brief,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Christopher also maintains (3) that he should not have been convicted, and the court should not have instructed the jury that it could convict him, of violating section 148(a)(1) because the only alleged conduct by Christopher offered by the prosecution on that charge\u2014giving a false name to a peace officer\u2014would support a conviction under section 148.9, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 148.9(a)) (discussed, <em>post), </em>and thus the language in 148(a)(1) itself barred his conviction of resisting, obstructing or delaying a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We conclude that (1) Christopher forfeited his claim of instructional error; (2) substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that he resisted, delayed or obstructed a peace officer by falsely identifying himself as Donald Christopher Brown; and (3) his claim that his conviction of violating section 148(a)(1) is barred on the ground that \u201cother punishment\u201d was prescribed by section 148.9(a), is unavailing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQ2\">A. <em>The People\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In June 2004 Carmelita Carter, a loss prevention employee at a J.C. Penney\u2019s department store in San Diego, was monitoring the sales floor with closed-circuit television cameras in the security office for the purpose of preventing shoplifting. Carter observed Christopher enter the men\u2019s department carrying a tote bag and a backpack. When she observed Christopher place the tote bag behind a shelf, she became suspicious and notified her supervisor, Joseph Hawley, who was also in the security office.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">While Hawley was walking to the men\u2019s department, Carter saw Christopher select three pairs of jeans and two shirts, wrap the jeans in the shirts, and place the clothing on a shelf. Christopher then picked out two more shirts, grabbed the previously wrapped clothing, and went into the men\u2019s fitting room area wearing his backpack. Carter observed Christopher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>leave the fitting rooms wearing his backpack, which was Ml and bulging out, but carrying no clothes in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Hawley testified he Mlowed Christopher into the fitting room area and waited in a nearby stall for Christopher to leave. He saw Christopher leave. Hawley went into the stall that Christopher had been in and found no clothing, but found three clothing security ink tags that had been separated into a total of six pieces. Hawley then followed Christopher, who picked up his tote bag and left the store without stopping at a cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Hawley and another store employee stopped Christopher outside the store. Hawley identified himself and asked Christopher to return to the store. After a brief struggle, Christopher complied and allowed Hawley and the other employee to escort him into the store. As they approached the security office, Christopher tried to run out the door, but he was stopped by Hawley and other employees. After Christopher was brought into the security office, the four shirts and three pairs of jeans, as well as a pair of pliers and a pair of wire cutters, were found in his backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">When the police arrived on the scene and took custody of Christopher in the security office, Christopher falsely identified himself to the officers as Donald Christopher Brown. Christopher told them he had no identification on his person. The police transported Christopher to police headquarters. During this time period, Christopher never identified himself by any name other than Donald Christopher Brown. At police headquarters, the police took Christopher\u2019s fingerprints, ran the prints through a computer system, and determined he went by the name of Christopher Carrea, Jr.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">B. <em>The Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Upon direct examination by Christopher, who represented himself at trial, his fianc\u00e9e Barbara Brown testified she saw Christopher put a couple of shirts, a couple of pairs of pants and some tools in his backpack before he left home on the morning of the incident. She stated he told her he was taking one of the shirts back because it was too small.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Defense investigators Alex Amigo and Gerry McMurray testified they went to the J.C. Penney\u2019s department store to investigate, but the store did not permit them to take pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>INSTRUCTIONAL ERROR (COUNT 3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Christopher first contends his misdemeanor conviction of resisting, obstructing or delaying a peace officer (count 3) should be reversed because the court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury with an \u201cimpermissible mandatory conclusive presumption\u201d that giving a false name to a peace officer constitutes \u201cwillfully resisting, obstructing or delaying\u201d the officer within the meaning of section 148(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Christopher maintains that by inserting the phrase \u201cin that the defendant identified himself to the police officer by giving a false name\u201d in the modified version of CALJIC No. 16.102 (discussed, <em>post) </em>it gave to the jury, the court impermissibly lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof by removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the essential statutory element of \u201cwillfully resisting], delaying], or obstructing]\u201d a peace officer set forth in section 148(a)(1) in the event the jury found that he had given a false name to the police. He further asserts that \u201c[i]n effect, by instructing with modified CALJIC No. 16.102, the [court] told the jury not to consider any other evidence pertaining to the issue [of] whether [Christopher] \u2018willfully [resisted], delayed, or obstructed\u2019 the police officers from their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The People argue that Christopher waived<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> his claim of instructional error by accepting the modified version of CALJIC No. 16.102 and that, in any event, the court properly instructed the jury. We conclude that Christopher forfeited his claim of instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">1. <em>Modified CALJIC No. 16.102</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The court instructed the jury, without objection by Christopher, on the elements of the crime of resisting, delaying or obstructing a peace officer (\u00a7 148(a)(1)) by giving the following modified version of CALJIC No. 16.102: \u201c[Christopher] is accused in count 3 of having violated [section 148(a)(1)]. HQ Every person who willfully resists, delays or obstructs any peace officer in the performance of his duties, and who knows, or reasonably should know that the other person is a peace officer engaged in the performance of his duties, is guilty of a violation of [section 148(a)(1)]. [1] In order to prove the crime charged in count 3, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements: [f] One, on or about June the 1st, 2004, [Christopher] willfully resisted, delayed or obstructed a peace officer <em>in that [he] identified himself to the police officer by giving a false name, </em>[ffl Two, at the time the peace officer was engaged in the performance of his duties. Three, [Christopher] knew, or reasonably should have known, that [(a)] the other person was a peace officer, and (b), was engaged in the performance of his duties.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">2. <em>The jury\u2019s note seeking clarification of the jury instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking, \u201cDoes willfully giving a false name to a peace officer constitute \u2018obstruction\u2019 as defined by [section 148(a)(1)]?\u201d The court provided to Christopher and the prosecutor the court\u2019s proposed response to the jury\u2019s question. The proposed response indicated that the question of whether Christopher\u2019s identifying himself by giving a false name constituted resisting, delaying or obstructing a peace officer within the meaning of section 148(a)(1) was a question for the jury to decide. Specifically, the court\u2019s proposed response stated: \u201cIt is for the jury to decide whether the prosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a peace officer was resisted, delayed, or obstructed by [Christopher\u2019s] identifying himself by <em>giving a false name. </em>If the jury so finds, then it is for the jury to decide whether the prosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Christopher] acted \u2018willfully.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">3. <em>Christopher\u2019s acceptance of the court\u2019s written response to the jury\u2019s note</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Christopher, who represented himself at trial, indicated to the court that he had read the jury\u2019s note and the court\u2019s proposed response to it, and stated he did not need more time. Both Christopher and the prosecutor reviewed the language of CALJIC No. 16.102.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Christopher initially expressed concern that the phrase \u201cgiving a false name\u201d in the court\u2019s proposed response did not appear in either CALJIC No. 16.102 or section 148(a)(1). He stated, \u201cI think we are rewriting the law by putting [in] this [phrase], \u2018giving a false name.\u2019 It\u2019s not part of [section 148(a)(1)]. I mean, I don\u2019t see \u2018giving a false name\u2019 in that subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The court told Christopher that it put that language in the proposed response to the jury\u2019s question because the court was concerned the jury might convict him of a violation of section 148(a)(1) \u201cbased upon what you did with the security guards,\u201d and the court \u201cwanted to differentiate as much as [it] possibly could that your conduct with the security guard[s] has nothing to do with count 3.\u201d The court stated that it wanted to \u201cfocus the jury in on the evidence that was there\u201d and that \u201cthe only evidence that I could see that related to resisting or delaying or obstructing was you[r] <em>giving a false name\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The court also informed Christopher that \u201c[t]he instruction in CALJIC [No. 16.102] and the statutory provision [did] not spell out what it is a defendant has to do to resist or delay or obstruct. Rather, it\u2019s anything that resists, delays or obstructs. It\u2019s the jury that decides [whether] the alleged conduct constitutes resisting, delaying or obstructing [a peace officer], [f] Therefore, if you had done something other than giving a false name, that would be in there rather than reference to giving a false name. But it\u2019s designed to let the jury know what the charge is so they don\u2019t convict you wrongfully of something else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Christopher immediately indicated to the court that he would submit to the giving of the proposed response, stating simply, \u201cSubmit.\u201d The court sought to clarify the meaning of Christopher\u2019s response by asking him, \u201cAre you giving up or do you understand what I just told you?\u201d Christopher replied, \u201cI understand what you say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The court continued its inquiry and asked Christopher, \u201c[A]s to the response to the question concerning obstruction, that portion of the Jury Note [No.] 1, as to my proposed response, you\u2019re submitting on the matter, Mr. Christopher?\u201d Christopher replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Normally, a defendant forfeits the right to appeal alleged errors \u201c \u2018by failing to make an appropriate objection in the trial court; however, an appellate court may review any instruction given even though no objection was made in the lower court if the substantial rights of the defendant are affected. [Citation.] The cases equate \u201csubstantial rights\u201d with reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>error, i.e., did the error result in a <em>miscarriage of </em>justice? [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rivera </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 141, 146 [207 Cal.Rptr. 756], italics added.) Furthermore, the California Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to a court\u2019s response to a jury request for clarification of a jury instruction should bar the defendant from challenging the response on appeal. <em>(People v. Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 901-902 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Here, the record shows that the court instructed the jury with the modified version of CALJIC No. 16.102 (discussed, <em>ante) </em>without any objection by Christopher. The record also demonstrates that contrary to his claim on appeal, Christopher did not object to the court\u2019s proposed response to the jury\u2019s note requesting clarification of CALJIC No. 16.102. Although he initially challenged that response, Christopher discussed the matter with the court and then accepted the response by repeatedly informing the court that he would submit to the court\u2019s giving of the response to the jury. The record shows the court gave the response to the jury without any further objection by Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Because Christopher did not object when the court instructed the jury under the modified version of CALJIC No. 16.102, and he accepted the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification of that instruction, we must conclude he has forfeited his claim of instructional error unless he has demonstrated a miscarriage of justice in this matter. <em>(People v. Rivera, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. 146; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 901-902.) For reasons we shall now discuss, we fiirther conclude that Christopher has failed to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Christopher implicitly contends he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice, and thus this court \u201cshould find preserved\u201d his claim of instructional error because the court \u201ccommitted reversible error by instructing the jury with a mandatory conclusive presumption.\u201d Specifically, as already noted, Christopher contends that by instructing the jury to decide whether he \u201cwillfully resisted, delayed, or obstructed a peace officer <em>in that [he] identified himself to the police officer by giving a false name\u201d </em>(italics added), the court created an impermissible mandatory conclusive presumption by removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the essential element of willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer, as set forth in section 148(a)(1), in the event the jury found (as it implicitly did) that Christopher gave a false name to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In support of his claim that the court\u2019s instruction removed an essential element of the charged offense (\u00a7 148(a)(1)) from the jury\u2019s consideration and resulted in a miscarriage of justice, Christopher relies principally on <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Quiroga </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 961 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 446] <em>(Quiroga). </em>He asserts that \u201c[according to <em>Quiroga, </em>a defendant who <em>gives a false name </em>after arrest but before booking!,] without evidence the <em>false name </em>delayed or obstructed the officers!,] cannot be held to violate section 148[(a)(l)].\u201d (Italics added.) Christopher misconstrues both the facts and the holding in <em>Quiroga.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In <em>Quiroga </em>the police arrested the defendant for possession of cocaine. <em>(Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 964-965.) After his arrest, the defendant <em>refused to give his name </em>although a police officer repeatedly asked him for identification both in the patrol car while he was being transported to the police station and at the police station. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 965.) In refusing to give his name, the defendant repeatedly said, \u201c \u2018Puddin\u2019 Tane, ask me again I\u2019ll tell you the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Upon his arrival at the jail, the defendant persisted in refusing to give his name during the booking process. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After about 30 minutes, one of the correctional officers recognized the defendant and provided his identity. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">On appeal, the defendant in <em>Quiroga </em>maintained there was no evidence to support his conviction of resisting a peace officer in violation of section 148(a). <em>(Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 965.) The Court of Appeal rejected that contention and affirmed his conviction under that subdivision, holding that although the defendant\u2019s refusal to give his name en route to the jail did not violate section 148(a), his \u201cact of <em>refusing to disclose his </em>identity\u201d during the booking interview at the jail \u201cunquestionably served to resist, delay and obstruct the responsible peace officer in the discharge of his duties\u201d and did violate that section. <em>(Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 966, 972, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Quiroga </em>is distinguishable. Here, Christopher did not simply refuse to disclose his identity. The undisputed evidence shows that he, unlike the defendant in <em>Quiroga, </em>affirmatively and intentionally sought to mislead the law enforcement authorities in the discharge of their public duties by <em>falsely identifying himself </em>as Donald Christopher Brown from the time he was arrested at the department store until after he arrived at police headquarters. Such conduct may properly be characterized as a willful act of obstructing a peace officer in the discharge of his or her duties within the meaning of section 148(a)(1). The fact that the police succeeded in identifying Christopher through the use of fingerprints despite his willful attempt to obstruct the identification process following his arrest, both before and after his arrival at the police station, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Christopher acknowledges that his act of falsely identifying himself to the police following his arrest was a misdemeanor offense. Specifically, he states that his act of giving a false name to the police \u201cwould support a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>under section 148.9[(a)].\u201d Section 148.9(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny person who <em>falsely represents or identifies </em>himself. . . <em>as another person or as a fictitious person to any peace officer . . . upon a lawful detention or arrest of the person, </em>either to evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.) \u201cThe purpose of this law is to require the defendant to give \u2018sufficient information to allow law enforcement to locate the person if he or she does not appear in court.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Kelly W. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 468, 471 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 536].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Sections 148(a)(1) and 148.9(a) are codified in the same chapter of the Penal Code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a violation of either statute is punishable as a misdemeanor. Christopher\u2019s postarrest act of willfully obstructing the police by misleadingly identifying himself with a false name, unlike the <em>Quiroga </em>defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation in refusing to identify himself, was a criminal offense under either statute. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Christopher has not shown, and cannot demonstrate, he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we conclude he forfeited his claim of instructional error. <em>(People v. Rivera, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Christopher next contends his conviction of violating section 148(a)(1) should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence to show he willfully resisted, delayed or obstructed the police in the performance of their duties. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">At trial, San Diego Police Officer Brian Lucchesi testified that when he and his partner Officer Robert Stites arrived on the scene and took custody of Christopher in the security office of the department store, Christopher identified himself as Donald Christopher Brown. Christopher told the officers he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>had no identification on his person. Officer Lucchesi stated that he was with Christopher in the security office for about half an hour and during this time period Christopher never identified himself by any name other than Donald Christopher Brown. The officer also testified that Christopher was transported from the security office to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Officer Stites also testified. When the prosecutor asked him whether he was \u201cable at any time to identify [Christopher] by a name other than Donald Brown,\u201d Officer Stites replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The following exchange took place between Officer Stites and the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor.] How did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201c[Officer Stites.] Once we left and finished our investigation at JC Penney\u2019s, we proceeded to headquarters to do the [identification]. Basically, we take fingerprints of an individual and run them through a computer system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor.] At that time what was identified as Donald Brown, did you determine his true name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201c[Officer Stites.] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor.] What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">\u201c[Officer Stites.] The name came back as Christopher Carrea, Jr.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">\u201cIn assessing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, our \u2018task is to review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Kelly W., supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at pp. 471-472, citing <em>People v.

[Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] The offense is a general intent crime, proscribing only the particular act (resist, delay, obstruct) without reference to an intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Muhammed C. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1329 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 21], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u201cSection 148 is most often applied to the physical acts of a defendant. [Citation.] For example, physical resistance, hiding, or running away from a police officer have been found to violate section 148. [Citations.] But section 148 \u2018is not limited to nonverbal conduct involving flight or forcible interference with an officer\u2019s activities. No decision has interpreted the statute to apply only to physical acts, and the statutory language does not suggest such a limitation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Muhammed C., supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1329-1330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Here, Christopher does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to show that when he falsely identified himself to the police officers as Donald Christopher Brown, the officers were engaged in the performance of their duties, and he knew they were peace officers engaged in the performance of their duties. Thus, his sufficiency of the evidence challenge in this matter is directed solely at the first essential element of the section 148(a)(1) offense charged as count 3, i.e., whether he willfully resisted, delayed, or obstructed a peace officer by giving the false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Christopher relies solely on <em>Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 961, for the proposition that \u201c[e]vidence of giving a false name to [a] police officer before booking cannot support a conviction for resisting an officer under [section 148(a)(1)].\u201d He asserts that here, \u201cthe prosecution introduced no other evidence besides the giving of the false name during arrest to attempt to prove [he] resisted arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">As previously discussed, Christopher misconstrues both the facts and the holding in <em>Quiroga, </em>and thus his reliance on that case is unavailing. In <em>Quiroga, </em>the defendant did not give a false name to the police; he merely refused to identify himself. <em>(Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Christopher has cited no California case authority, and we are aware of none, which holds that evidence showing the defendant falsely identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>himself to the police following a lawful arrest cannot support a conviction for willful obstruction of a peace officer in the discharge of, or attempt to discharge, his or her duties within the meaning of section 148(a)(1). For reasons already discussed, such an act may properly be characterized as a willful act of obstructing a peace officer in the discharge of his or her duties within the meaning of that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Here, the prosecution presented substantial evidence showing that when the police arrested him and asked for his identification, Christopher gave them a false name, and he continued to use that false name from the time of his arrest until sometime after he arrived at police headquarters. Based on this evidence, we conclude that any jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Christopher sought to mislead the police by falsely identifying himself, and that he thereby willfully obstructed a peace officer in the discharge of, or attempt to discharge, his duties within the meaning of section 148(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>CONVICTION UNDER SECTION 148 NOT BARRED BY SECTION 148.9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In his appellant\u2019s supplemental brief, Christopher contends his conviction of resisting, delaying or obstructing a peace officer in violation of section 148(a)(1) was barred by the \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d provision set forth in that subdivision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because \u201cother punishment\u201d for his act of giving a false name to the police following his arrest was provided by section 148.9(a). We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">A. <em>Applicable Principles of Statutory Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u201cFamiliar canons of statutory construction require that, in construing a statute, a court ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining that intent, we consider the statute read as a whole, harmonizing the various elements by considering each clause and section in the context of the overall statutory framework. [Citations.] We must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224] <em>(Jenkins).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Christopher maintains that the phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d in section 148(a)(1) has been judicially interpreted \u201cto mean that only when <em>no other punishment is provided by statute </em>will conduct [that] amounts to willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing a public officer be punishable under section 148.\u201d (Italics added.) In support of this contention, Christopher relies on <em>In re Bacon </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 34, 53 [49 Cal.Rptr. 322], disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612, 624 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017], in which the Court of Appeal interpreted the phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d in section 148(a)(1) to mean that conduct amounting to willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer is punishable under section 148(a)(1) \u201conly when no other punishment is provided by statute.\u201d Christopher also relies on <em>Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at page 971, in which the Court of Appeal stated the phrase can be reasonably interpreted to mean \u201c \u2018when no other provision in the Penal Code is applicable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Citing <em>In re Bacon </em>and <em>Quiroga, </em>Christopher contends that because his act of giving a false name to the officers following his arrest in this matter was punishable under section 148.9(a), his conviction of violating section 148(a)(1) based on that same conduct was barred by the phrase \u201conly when no other punishment is provided by statute\u201d in that section (\u00a7 148(a)(1)), and thus his conviction of count 3 should be reversed. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Section 148.9(a), as it applies to the facts of this case, provides: \u201cAny person who falsely represents or identifies himself... as another person or as a fictitious person to any peace officer ... upon a lawful detention or arrest of the person, <em>either to evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer </em>is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Italics added.) A conviction for a violation of section 148.9(a) thus requires a showing that a lawfully arrested defendant not only falsely identified himself to a peace officer, but did so \u201cto evade the process of the court, or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer . . . .\u201d Unlike a conviction under section 148(a)(1), a conviction for a violation of section 148.9(a) does not explicitly require a showing that the defendant willfully resisted, delayed, or obstructed a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">We hold that where, as here, the alleged criminal conduct of the defendant consisted of giving a false identity to a police officer following the defendant\u2019s lawful arrest, the prosecution may charge the defendant either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>(1) under section 148(a)(1), to punish the defendant for willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing the officer in the discharge of, or attempt to discharge, any duty of his or her office or employment; or (2) under section 148.9(a), to punish the defendant for evading his or her proper identification by an investigating officer. Accordingly, we also conclude that the availability of punishment under section 148.9(a) for Christopher\u2019s act of falsely identifying himself to the police following his lawful arrest does not bar his conviction of a violation of section 148(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Our conclusions find support in the text of section 148 read as a whole. In construing the meaning of the phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d contained in section 148(a)(1), we are required to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>{Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 246.) In determining that intent, we must consider section 148 \u201cread as a whole, harmonizing the various elements by considering each clause and section in the context of the overall statutory framework.\u201d <em>{Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Reading section 148 as a whole, we note that subdivisions (b) through (d) of that section prescribe other punishments for various other prohibited acts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>For example, whereas a violation of section 148(a)(1) is punishable as a misdemeanor, a violation of subdivision (c) of that section, which prohibits the removal or taking of a firearm from the person of, or immediate presence of, a public officer or peace officer during the commission of an offense described in subdivision (a)(1), is punishable as a felony. Also, a violation of subdivision (b) of section 148, prohibiting the removal or taking of any other type of weapon under the same circumstances, is a \u201cwobbler\u201d that is punishable either as a misdemeanor or as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Thus, upon reading section 148 as a whole, it is apparent the Legislature intended that a person who commits one of the specific offenses listed in subdivisions (b) through (d) of section 148 is to be punished under the applicable subdivision that prohibits such offense, rather than under the more general subdivision (a)(1). In those cases, \u201cother punishment\u201d is prescribed for purposes of the phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d set forth in section 148(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Under this interpretation of the phrase in question, the misdemeanor punishment prescribed by section 148(a)(1) for a willful act of resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer in the discharge of, or attempt to discharge, any duty of his or her office or employment applies \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d by the <em>other </em>subdivisions of section 148. Our interpretation of that phrase is consistent with the language contained in subdivision (e) of section 148, which states in part: \u201cA person shall not be convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) in addition to a conviction of a violation of subdivision (b), (c), or (d) when the resistance, delay, or obstruction, and the removal or taking of the weapon or firearm or attempt thereof, was committed against the same . . . peace officer . . . .\u201d The phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d in subdivision (a)(1) of section 148, when read together with subdivision (e) of that section, evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent that when punishment is available for a conviction of a violation of subdivision (b), (c), or (d) of section 148 (discussed, <em>ante) </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>connection with an offense committed against a given peace officer, the defendant cannot also be punished under subdivision (a)(1) for the same act.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In construing the meaning of the phrase \u201cwhen no other punishment is prescribed\u201d in section 148(a)(1), we must also avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences. (See <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 246.) Adoption of Christopher\u2019s interpretation of that phrase, under which his conviction of violating section 148(a)(1) would be barred because \u201cother punishment\u201d was available under another statute (\u00a7 148.9(a)), could lead to absurd consequences. For example, under Christopher\u2019s interpretation of the phrase, a defendant who fought with a police officer trying to lawfully arrest him could not be convicted of willfully resisting the peace officer in violation of section 148(a)(1), because such conduct is punishable under either section 243, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which prohibits the commission of a battery against the person of a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, or section 241, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which prohibits the commission of an assault against the person of a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties. California case law, however, holds that such conduct is indeed punishable under section 148(a)(1) notwithstanding the applicability of another Penal Code section prescribing punishment for the crime of battery. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bugg </em>(1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 174, 175-176 [179 P.2d 346] [evidence supported a conviction of resisting police officers in the discharge of their duties during a lawful arrest in violation of section 148(a)(1) where it was shown the defendant had also committed the crime of battery upon the officers]; see also 2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Crimes Against Governmental Authority, \u00a7 18, pp. 1103-1104, citing <em>People v. Bugg, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.2d 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that on the facts of this case, the availability of punishment under section 148.9 did not bar Christopher\u2019s conviction of violating section 148(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>RIGHT TO SELF-REPRESENTATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">McConnell, P.
