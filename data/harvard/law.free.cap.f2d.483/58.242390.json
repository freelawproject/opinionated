We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-24\">In September 1968, after the parties had conducted negotiations in Louisiana and Mississippi, Fred Hale Machinery entered a contract with Laurel Hill to design, furnish plans for, and supply the component parts of a log conveyor and debarker system for use at Laurel Hill\u2019s sawmill in Mississippi. In addition, Fred Hale later agreed to supervise the assembly and the installation of the components. Pursuant to this agreement, Fred Hale designed the system and purchased components to meet Laurel Hill\u2019s specifications from manufacturers in Mississippi and Georgia. The contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>called for Laurel Hill to purchase the components from Fred Hale Machinery \u201cf.o.b. point of manufacture\u201d; Fred Hale Machinery apparently had no part in transporting the components from the places of manufacture in Georgia and Mississippi to Laurel Hill\u2019s sawmill. Fred Hale employees, however, played a large role in assembling the components once they arrived at the sawmill; and, in addition to supervising the installation of the system, Fred Hale employees worked intermittently at the sawmill performing various other jobs during the installation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It is undisputed that the system functioned poorly after installation was completed in May 1969; but a sharp dispute developed at trial over the cause of the troubles. Laurel Hill blamed Fred Hale\u2019s failure to design and supply components in accordance with contract specifications. Witnesses for Fred Hale, on the other hand, claimed that the difficulties were caused by Laurel Hill\u2019s use of logs that were too large for the system to accommodate, and by its reliance on unskilled and inexperienced employees to operate the system. In any event, Laurel Hill stopped making payments under the contract, claiming that malfunctions in the system were causing it considerable losses due to shut-down time and expenses for replacement parts and labor. Fred Hale sued in the court below to foreclose a laborer\u2019s and mate-rialman\u2019s Jien on the sawmill premises, or alternatively to recover the amount due under the contract. Laurel Hill counterclaimed, seeking incidental and consequential damages for Fred Hale\u2019s alleged breach of express and implied warranties covering the design and operation of the system. From a jury verdict in Fred Hale\u2019s favor, Laurel Hill appeals, raising two contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">First, Laurel Hill argues that Fred Hale was prohibited from bringing the instant suit by a Mississippi statute, Miss.Code \u00a7 5309-239, which prohibits a foreign corporation not qualified to do business in Mississippi from bringing suit \u201cin any court of this State.\u201d It is without dispute that, at the time of the execution of the contract in question, Fred Hale, a Louisiana corporation, was not qualified to do business in Mississippi. It is equally clear that the phrase \u201cin any court of this State\u201d precludes an unqualified corporation\u2019s resort, not only to Mississippi state courts but also to federal courts in Mississippi, with regard to actions arising out of purely intrastate activities. Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949). Such statutes as this one, however, cannot be enforced if their application would unreasonably burden interstate commerce by prohibiting suits growing out of transactions in interstate commerce. York Manufacturing Co. v. Colley, 247 U.S. 21, 38 S.Ct. 430, 62 L.Ed. 963 (1918); Transit Bus Sales v. Kalamazoo Coaches, Inc., 6th Cir. 1944, 145 F.2d 804. For reasons adequately stated in the trial court\u2019s Memorandum Order of June 30, 1972, denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we believe that the facts of this case'\u2014 that negotiations were conducted in Louisiana and Mississippi, that appel-lee arranged to supply components from manufacturers in Mississippi and Georgia, and that appellee sent its employees to Mississippi in connection with the assembly and installation of the system\u2014 gave this transaction an interstate character, and that application of Miss.Code \u00a7 5309-239 would in this case create an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Accordingly, we hold that the Mississippi statute did not bar Fred Hale from filing the instant suit in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> Secondly, Laurel Hill claims that it was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that, if Laurel Hill had \u201caccepted\u201d the system by making use of it, then it was barred from all recovery on its counterclaim for breach of express and implied warranties governing the design and operation of the system. The jury, however, found that the system was \u201cdesigned, manufactured and installed in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>manner that it could be used for its intended purpose,\u201d and that the plans and specifications for the system were \u201cadequate for the purposes for which prepared in accordance with the explanations and instructions\u201d of the president of Laurel Hill. In our view, these findings are tantamount to a determination by the jury that the express and implied warranties governing the sale of the system were not breached. Even if Laurel Hill had not, under Mississippi law, waived its right to assert breach of warranty by \u201caccepting\u201d the system, it could not recover on its counterclaim if it failed to prove that Fred Hale had breached a warranty. In short, the challenged jury instruction was, at most, harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
