Service of process on the defendant was obtained pursuant to Minnesota\u2019s \u201clong-arm\u201d statutes, M.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 303.13<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>543.19,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as permitted by Rule 4(e), Fed. R.Civ.P. The defendant, appearing specially, moved to dismiss the action or, alternatively, to quash the return of service on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court was without personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The District Court ruled that it had personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and certified the issue for an interlocutory appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The pertinent facts, for the most part, are the following which were found by the trial court: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201c1. Plaintiff, Solar Industries, Inc., is a Minnesota corporation having its principal place of business at * * * Osseo, Minnesota 55369.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201c2. Defendant, B &amp; J Manufacturing Co., is an Illinois corporation having its principal place of business at Glen-wood, Illinois.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201c3. On September 15, 1971, process was served on the Minnesota Secretary of State, pursuant to M.S.A. \u00a7 303.13, who thereafter mailed a copy of the process to the defendant at Glenwood, Illinois.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\"><em>\u201c4. </em>On September 27, 1971, personal service was made on Mr. W. E. Jensen, Executive Vice President of defendant, by a United States Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">\u201c5. Defendant is not licensed to do business in Minnesota, and does not maintain a bank account or inventory here, or own, use or possess any real property located here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-15\">\u201c6. Defendant has not and does not maintain any offices or place of business in Minnesota, and does not have any employees in Minnesota. Defendant does have \u2018sales service personnel\u2019 which travel all over the country (presumably including Minnesota) visiting retread shops to make sure defendant\u2019s products are performing properly. The last employee to be in Minnesota was such a technical representative who was here in August, 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-16\">\u201c7. Defendant has sold its line of Rocket rasps, its line of carbide wheels and tools, and its pollution control equipment in Minnesota. Defendant has made such sales to * * * [six] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Minnesota companies in the last two years:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">* * * -x- -x- -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cIn addition to the above, drop shipments were made in the State of Minnesota for the accommodation of buyers outside of Minnesota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201c8. These sales totaled $15,903.09 from July 19, 1969 to December 31, 1969, $50,549.85 in 1970, and $41,287.-03 from January 1, 1971 to November 19, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u201c9. The vast majority of the sales were made to N. R. Hansemann Co. which is defendant\u2019s distributor in Minnesota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\u201c10. Defendant advertises in various national publications which are distributed in Minnesota, and Minnesota readers of these publications who make inquiry are sent informative literature by defendant\u2019s sales department and advised to contact defendant\u2019s local distributor. In some cases, N. R. Hansemann Co. is directly informed of the inquiry. Defendant is certain that some sales have resulted from this process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\u201c11. Defendant\u2019s products sold in Minnesota are sent to defendant\u2019s plant in Glenwood, Illinois for any needed repairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">\u201c12. N. R. Hansemann Co. was provided with certain of defendant\u2019s catalogs, imprinted with defendant\u2019s name, address and various trademarks and tradenames, to be used in making sales of defendant\u2019s products in Minnesota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">\u201c13. N. R. Hansemann Co. carries a complete line of defendant\u2019s products except the tire bead seater of the type disclosed by Patent Number 3,552,469, the subject of this suit. The reasons for this are that N. R. Hansemann Co. has not ordered any such tire bead seaters and that defendant does not want plaintiff to be able to establish jurisdiction over defendant in this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">\u201c14. Defendant purchased the patent in question from Bruce Caulkins, Inc. of Harper Woods, Michigan in July 1971. Prior to such purchase, Bruce Caulkins, Inc. manufactured the tire bead seater in question and distributed it in Minnesota through a distributor. Defendant began to market the tire bead seater on October 4, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">\u201c15. Defendant has instituted a patent infringement action involving Patent Number 3,552,469 in the Northern District of Ohio against one of the plaintiff\u2019s distributors who handles plaintiff\u2019s tire bead seaters. In addition, defendant has threatened such actions against other distributors of plaintiff's tire bead seater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">\u201c16. Plaintiff and defendant have had no direct business or contractual relationships in Minnesota.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">The District Court found personal jurisdiction under both of the cited statutes. - Initially, it indicated that the Minnesota Supreme Court has interpreted these statutes to extend the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Minnesota courts to its maximum reach consistent with the constitutional limitations of due process. Next, it reviewed Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958); McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957); and International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), and concluded that the defendant had sufficient contacts with Minnesota in the instant case so that personal jurisdiction could be obtained over it without offending \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">The plaintiff makes alternative arguments for jurisdiction. First, the plaintiff contends that service of process was made consistent with due process and that it is not necessary to tie the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of jurisdiction to specific provisions in the <em>\u201clong-arm\u201d </em>statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, Japan Gas Lighter Association v. Ronson Corp., 257 F.Supp. 219, 231-232 (D.N.J.1966). Plaintiff maintains this approach is proper because the Minnesota Supreme Court specifically stated that the legislature by enacting the \u201clong-arm\u201d statutes intended \u201cto extend jurisdiction of [the state's] courts to the maximum limits consistent with constitutional limitations.\u201d Hunt v. Nevada State Bank, 285 Minn. 77, 172 N.W.2d 292, 304 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 1239, 25 L.Ed.2d 423 (1970). See also, Ellwein v. Sun-Rise, Inc., 295 Minn. 109, 203 N.W.2d 403 (1972); Mid-Continent Freight L. v. Highway Trailer Indus., 291 Minn. 251, 190 N.W.2d 670, 673 (1971). Defendant, in turn, strenuously argues that the language of statutes must be closely adhered to and that in every instance where the Minnesota court has found personal jurisdiction, one of the statutory elements relating to the acts enumerated in the statute has been found to exist by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Plaintiff, in the alternative, argues that the defendant performed acts in Minnesota which make jurisdiction proper under two of the instances enumerated in M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19. First, relying on an unpublished opinion of Judge Larson, the plaintiff contends that the threat of enforcement of a United States patent against a Minnesota resident was the use of personal property within Minnesota and, thus, satisfied M.S.A. \u00a7 543.-19, subd. 1(a). See, Imperial Products Inc. v. Zuro, et al., No. 4-70-Civ. 471 (D.Minn. July 1, 1971). The defendant, on the other hand, reasons that the situs of a patent is limited to the residence of its holder \u2014 here, Illinois \u2014 and that, therefore, there was no ownership, use or possession of the patent in Minnesota. Second, the plaintiff contends that the defendant transacted business in Minnesota by charging the plaintiff with patent infringement and demanding that it cease manufacturing its product. This act, of course, is that enumerated in M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19, subd. 1(b). See, n. 2, <em>supra. </em>The defendant, however, without further reasoning, maintains that this did not constitute the transaction of business in the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">We do not find it necessary here to rule on each of the possible grounds for jurisdiction which are asserted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>plaintiff. Rather, we are convinced the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose from the defendant\u2019s transaction of business in Minnesota and, therefore, personal jurisdiction was properly obtained in accordance with M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19, subd. 1(b). Our review is accordingly limited, and we express no opinion as to the validity of the other grounds asserted by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In view of the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court has indicated that M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19 should be interpreted broadly to \u201cafford maximum protection to [the] state\u2019s residents injured by acts of nonresidents,\u201d Hunt v. Nevada State Bank, <em>supra, </em>172 N.W.2d at 304, it is proper to employ a liberal construction in determining whether the cause of action has arisen from the transaction of business in Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">It is undisputed that the plaintiff\u2019s action arose directly from the fact that through their attorneys, the defendant and the assignor of its patent advised the plaintiff, by letters received in Minnesota, to refrain from infringing on the \u201ctire bead seater\u201d patent and, further, threatened that a suit for infringement would be brought against the plaintiff if it refused to discontinue the manufacture and sale of its competing product. Regardless of the valid- \u2019 ity of the defendant\u2019s patent, there is no doubt but that the requests and threats were designed to reduce competition and thereby improve defendant\u2019s marketing and economic position. As such, we are convinced that the sending of these letters did, in a very real sense, constitute a transaction of business in Minnesota. Moreover, we note that the defendant is no stranger to Minnesota, and that it had a number of related contacts in the forum. The defendant advertised its products in national publications which were distributed in Minnesota, and it sold a number of its other products to independent distributors located in the state. It maintained \u201ctrouble shooters\u201d who were available to visit the state when necessary to aid users of the firm\u2019s products, and the firm also repaired its products, though these ha&lt;j to be shipped to the firm\u2019s Illinois office for such service. Furthermore, it is significant that prior to the defendant\u2019s acquisition of the patent, its assignor had threatened the plaintiff with an infringement suit; that the assignor had sold the disputed product in Minnesota; and that the assignor and the defendant, as well, had discussed the question of licensing the patent with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">The fact that the defendant has, itself, not directly or indirectly <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sold the \u201ctire bead seater\u201d in the state because it did not wish the plaintiff to be able to obtain jurisdiction over it in this action hardly defeats jurisdiction here. Rather, the extensive contacts, taken together with the admonition of the Minnesota court in <em>Hunt, </em>compel the conclusion that service of process was properly made and jurisdiction over the defendant was obtained pursuant to M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19, subd. 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">We are also satisfied that the District Court\u2019s assumption of personal jursdiction over the defendant did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process. See, Aftanase v. Economy Baler Company, 343 F.2d 187 (8th Cir. 1965). It is evident from the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that the quantity, quality and nature of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the jurisdiction are substantial. The defendant has voluntarily entered into a number of business transactions, including the acquisition of the patent and attempts at enforcement, which it knew would have consequences in the state. Moreover, in view of the defendant\u2019s extensive contacts with the forum, we believe that the contacts are sufficiently connected with the cause of action to satisfy due process. See, <em>Id., </em>at 196; 2 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 4.25 [5] (2d ed.1970). Furthermore, Minnesota most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>certainly has an interest in providing a forum for a resident who claims that a foreign corporation is attempting to prevent it from manufacturing and marketing its product. This is especially true in the instant ease as the defendant has threatened and brought independent actions against a number of the plaintiff\u2019s customers and distributors in other states. And finally, while it may be more convenient for the defendant to litigate in Illinois, the convenience of all parties must be considered. No exceptional hardship is suffered by the defendant having to litigate in Minnesota, and we are satisfied that it is in the best interests of all to have the case heard in Minnesota. Thus, we are convinced that the subjection of the defendant to <em>in per-sonam </em>jurisdiction comports with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-15\">. <em>\u201c303.13 Service of Process</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-16\"><em>\u201cSubdivision 1.

The unpublished opinion and order of the District Court was filed by Judge Miles <em>W. </em>Lord on November 17,1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\">. The trial court apparently adopted this theory, <em>albeit sub silentio, </em>in finding personal jurisdiction in the instant case. Moreover, this same theory involving the Missouri parallel to M.S.A. \u00a7 543.19 was recently discussed by Chief Judge Matthes in R. H. Fulton, etc. v. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company et al., 481 F.2d 326, at 334 n. 5 (8th Cir. 1973) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cA third independent ground for finding the long-arm statute applicable here could be the view taken by the Sixth and Seventh Circuits of similar statutes. See Fisons Ltd. v. United States, 458 F.2d 1241 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1041, 92 S.Ct. 1312, 31 L.Ed.2d 581 (1972) ; Southern Machine Co. v. Mohasco Industries, Inc., 401 F.2d 374 (6th Cir. 1968). In those cases, the courts dealt with the long-arm statutes of Illinois and Tennessee, respectively, which are marketedly similar to the Missouri statute <em>sub judioe. </em>The courts of both those states had construed their statutes \u2018to assert jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to tlie extent permitted by the\u2019 Constitution. 458 F.2d at 1250. Consequently, the federal courts held they should not view the statutes as merely erecting a few enumerated, inflexible circumstances in which service could be effected, but as establishing one broad flexible test, to wit: if the service satisfies the Constitution, it satisfies the statute. Since Missouri has likewise construed \u00a7 506.500 as intended to reach the constitutional limits, Missouri ex rel. Deere <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Pinnell, <em>supra, </em>we could also adopt this test and avoid \u2018a pedantic quibbling with the wording of the statute,\u2019 401 F.2d at 378, making it unnecessary to ask whether only g 506.500 (1) (3) applies, whether it applies only to tort actions, whether a Carmack claim sounds in tort, etc. However, considering the answers to those questions given above, we find it unnecessary to take this expansive view of a state statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\">.
