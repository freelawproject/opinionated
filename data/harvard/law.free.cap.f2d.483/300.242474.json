BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">This case demonstrates once again that \u201cthe shortest way around is often the longest way through.\u201d Webb v. Standard Oil Co., 5 Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 284, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Suit was filed by the appellant Burns under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e et seq. and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against his former employer, the Thiokol Chemical Corporation, both in an individual capacity and as a \u201cprivate attorney-general\u201d representing a class of aggrieved Blacks. The complaint sought appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief against Thiokol because of its alleged discriminatory promotion policies against the class and specific relief on behalf of Burns in this regard. It also sought damages for the Company\u2019s alleged failure to grant medical treatment to Burns after he sustained minor injuries during the course of his employment, and, finally, reinstatement with back pay due to the Company\u2019s reprisal discharge of Burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">After trial on the merits, the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law holding against Burns in every respect. On appeal, Burns asserts that the trial court erred in (i) sustaining Thiokol\u2019s objections to certain F.R. Civ.P. 33 pre-trial interrogatories, (ii) holding that the evidence would not support a finding of class discrimination, and (iii) holding that Burns\u2019 discharge was for poor work rather than in reprisal for his registering of complaints against the Company\u2019s alleged discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Finding Burns\u2019 first contention to be exceedingly meritorious, we reverse and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">\n<em>A Gadfly In The Porridge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">Neither party challenges the factual accuracy of the statement that over the course of his fourteen years in the employ of Thiokol, Claxton Burns developed \u201cbad chemistry\u201d with management. Indeed, both parties seek to use this fact to their advantage. Thiokol expends a considerable amount of space in its brief urging that not only did Burns develop such caustic personality and attitudinai traits that he became incapable of adequately performing his job, but also that he was a bellicose maverick without sufficient rapport with his fellow Black workers to represent them as a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-17\">The District Court found that Burns\u2019 attitude and his actions were anathema to the management of Thiokol. The Court also held that Burns was discharged, not because of his race, but because he spread false rumors around the business community about Thiokol\u2019s alleged failure to render medical aid to him after he collapsed as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>working with some chemicals on November 21, 1968 in violation of a Company-rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Normally, this finding would be entitled to the protection of the \u201cbuckler and shield\u201d of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Because we hold here, however, that the Court\u2019s view of the context of the case was necessarily circumscribed by its own restrictive policy towards Burns\u2019 discovery efforts, the issue must be tried again. See note 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">\n<em>Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">In an effort to amass statistical evidence and define the contours of his case, Burns propounded interrogatories to Thiokol under F.R.Civ.P. 33<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on May 14, 1970. Among other things, the interrogatories sought information regarding the name, age, sex, educational background, and employment history of all white employees at Thiokol\u2019s Huntsville plant dating from January 1, I960;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>list of both permanent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and temporary<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> job vacancies within the Huntsville plant and background information on both those applicants who competed for the jobs and those who were selected; and a job description of each non-bargaining unit job at the Huntsville plant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Company filed timely objection to these interrogatories contending, <em>inter alia</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that they sought irrelevant information and that they would be unduly burdensome to answer. Because the District Court sustained these objections in an oral, unrecorded order, we are unable to determine which \u2014 if either \u2014 -of these grounds for objection was the basis for its decision. But it matters not, for neither will suffice on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">The discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow the parties to develop fully and crystalize concise factual issues for trial. Properly used, they prevent prejudicial surprises and conserve precious judicial energies. The United States Supreme Court has said that they are to be broadly and liberally construed. Hickman v. Taylor, 1947, 329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S.Ct. 385, 391, 91 L.Ed. 451, 460; Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 1964, 379 U.S. 104, 114-115, 85 S.Ct. 234, 240, 13 L.Ed.2d 152, 161-162.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-22\">Because discovery matters are committed almost exclusively to the sound discretion of the trial Judge, appellate rulings delineating the bounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>discovery under the Rules are rare. But the Judge\u2019s discovery rulings, like his other procedural determinations, are not entirely sacrosanct. If he fails to adhere to the liberal spirit of the Rules, we must reverse. See Wallin v. Fuller and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 5 Cir. 1973, 476 F.2d 1204 [1973]. And this is especially true in Title VII eases where courts have refused to allow procedural technicalities to impede the full vindication of guaranteed rights. Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 455, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The only pertinent discovery-type appellate decisions which we have found in the Title VII area are those in which an appellate tribunal has been called upon to consider the propriety of a District Court\u2019s order either granting or denying the enforcement of an EEOC Demand for Access to Evidence. See e. g. Georgia Power Co. v. EEOC, 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 462; Local No. 104, Sheet Metal Workers International Association v. EEOC, 9 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 237; Graniteville Co. v. EEOC, 4 Cir., 1971, 438 F.2d 32; Blue Bell Boots, Inc. v. EEOC, 6 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 355. All have uniformly upheld EEOC\u2019s right of access to the requested information. Any information relevant \u2014 in a discovery sense \u2014 to an EEOC investigation is likewise relevant to the private attorney-general, either in his individual role or in his capacity as the claimed representative of a class. H. Kessler and Co. v. EEOC, 5 Cir., 1973, 472 F.2d 1147 [1972] (En Banc).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\n<em>Relevancy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u201cIn the problem of racial discrimination, statistics often tell much, and Courts listen.\u201d Alabama v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 304 F.2d 583, 586, aff\u2019d, 1962, 371 U.S. 37, 83 S.Ct. 145, 9 L.Ed.2d 112. Our wide experience with cases involving racial discrimination in education, employment, and other segments of society have led us to rely heavily in Title VII cases on the empirical data which show an employer\u2019s overall pattern of conduct in determining whether he has discriminated against particular individuals or a class as a whole. See generally Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158; Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 5 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 348; United States v. Hayes International Corp., 5 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 1038; Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., 5 Cir., 1971, 444 F.2d 687; United States v. Georgia Power Co., 5 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 906 [1973].</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">One of the first legal questions precipitated by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in this regard was the extent to which pre-Act discriminatory conduct was to be taken into account in evaluating post-Act charges. There can no longer be any quarrel that pre-Act conduct is relevant to the extent that it sets in motion a chain of consequences which effects the status of the Black employee in the post-Act period, for \u201cCongress did not intend to freeze an entire generation of Negro employees into discriminatory patterns that existed before the act.\u201d Quarles v. Philip Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ris, Inc., E.D.Va., 1968, 279 F.Supp. 505, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 418, we held that although evidence of preAct discrimination did not establish a <em>per </em>se violation in the post-Act era, the history did bear directly on the probability that similar conduct would continue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASR\">\u201cIn a Title VII \u2018pattern or practice\u2019 cases, an employer\u2019s failure to hire or promote one Black may prove nothing. Once the single or isolated barrier is passed determination of the existence <em>vel non </em>of a racially discriminatory pattern or practice must depend on the quantum of proof presented in each case. No precise mathematical formulation is workable, nor did Congress intend to impose .any racial constants. Certainly, however, an employer\u2019s failure to hire or promote all or the great majority of Blacks <em>while he concurrently hires or promotes Whites </em>may well indicate racial discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>Jacksonville Terminal, supra, </em>451 F.2d at 441 (emphasis added). Cf. United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., 5 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 221. We then proceeded to make an exhaustive analysis and comparison of the employment statistics regarding both Blacks and Whites. Only by this juxtaposition of factors could the Court effectively determine whether the employer had preferred one class of employees over another. \u201cDiscrimination on the basis of race or sex is <em>class discrimination,\" </em>Georgia Power Co. v. EEOC, 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 462, 468, although the manifestations may frequently be individualized. Flax v. Potts, 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 284, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The importance of obtaining an overall statistical picture of an employer\u2019s practices with regard to both Black and White employees does not depend on the presence of an alleged \u201cpattern or practice\u201d or a valid charge of class discrimination or class action. We categorically rejected this notion in Georgia Power v. EEOC, supra. There the EEOC sought historical, statistical information regarding both Black and White employees of Georgia Power. The company objected to EECO\u2019s Demand for Access to this evidence contending that because EEOC was only investigating the charge of an individual party that he was refused employment solely because of his race that the only relevant evidence was that relating to the filling of that particular vacancy. Disagreeing, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cCertainly this information is relevant, but we cannot agree that it was the only relevant evidence. Discrimination on the basis of race or sex is class <em>discrimination. </em>The EEOC cannot reasonably be expected to discern such discrimination by examining data relating to two individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Georgia Power Co. v. EEOC, <em>supra, </em>412 F.2d at 468. Even though a suit seeks only individual relief for an individual instance of discrimination, and is not a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d suit by the government or a class action, the past history of <em>both </em>Black and White employees is surely relevant information. Id.; Marquez v. Omaha District Sales Office, 8 Cir., 1971, 440 F.2d 1157, 1160; Gran-iteville Co. v. EEOC, 4 Cir., 1971, 438 F.2d 32, 42; Blue Bell Boots, Inc. v. EEOC, 6 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 355, 358. It is therefore discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Without making any pretense of exhaustively cataloguing possible uses of this information to Burns we note that one of Thiokol\u2019s chief witnesses was the personnel manager of its Huntsville Plant, Charles G. Babcock. Mr. Babcock testified at length about the employment practices of Thiokol during his fourteen year association with the Company. He undertook to give certain data relating to the size of the Thiokol work force during various periods of time, and the general manner in which vacancies were filled. On cross-examination of Babcock, Burns\u2019 counsel was obviously unable to ask intelligent, informed questions relating to any specifics. Perhaps the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>sought by their interrogatories would have served to bolster Babcock\u2019s exculpatory testimony in behalf of the Company. Then again, it might have allowed plaintiff\u2019s counsel to pin the witness down to some unexplainable particulars. We do not know. The point is that open disclosure of all potentially relevant information is the keynote of the Federal Discovery Rules. In this case, that focal point has been ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>Jacksonville Terminal, supra, </em>we said that \u201cdeprived of an historical overview in these situations, Justice would 'surely be blind,\u201d 451 F.2d at 441. Were Justice to be deprived of an historical overview of the industrial context in which Claxton Burns was discharged, she could not \u2014 -as she <em>must </em>\u2014 be color blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>The Burden</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Thiokol argues that even if the information sought by Burns\u2019 interrogatories is somewhat relevant to his claim, that the onerous burden of compiling, assimilating, and synthesizing voluminous employment records into cogent, responsive answers to the interrogatories outweighs the utility of the information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Of course, the extensive listing of information required to fully answer the interrogatories is somewhat cumbersome. But, as the Ninth Circuit has pointed out, the fact that an interrogatory calls for a list does not make it improper :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201cLocal 104 contends there is something unique about an order to compile lists. Local 104 is mistaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXs\">Local No. 104, Sheet Metal Workers International Association v. EEOC, 9 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 237, 243. The law requires a company to provide a prospective union with a list of employees in the unit. Excelsior Underwear, Inc., 1966, 156 N.L.R.B. 1236; NLRB v. Wy-man Gordon, 1969, 394 U.S. 759, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709. Similarly, it requires a company to furnish shareholder lists in a proxy context, Studebaker Corp. v. Gittlin, 2 Cir., 1966, 360 F.2d 692, 698. And the law can compel an employer who is a defendant in a Title VII suit to furnish lists of employees, Georgia Power Co. v. EEOC, 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 462; Local No. 104, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Of course the particular details of the discovery process are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Knowing, by virtue of our mandate, that the information is relevant, and therefore, discoverable, the judge may wish to require full answers to the interrogatories. But that is not his only option.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Since his initial ruling in this case, a new rule, F.R.Civ.P. 33(c) has been promulgated. It gives Thiokol the option to \u201cspecify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">The judge may also exercise the full extent of his discretionary powers under F.R.Civ.P. 26(c) with appropriate protective orders as to time, place, manner, etc., in which the interrogatories will be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">Finally, our determination of the relevancy of this information does not irrevocably commit the judge and the parties to the process of discovery by interrogatories under Rule 33. If the judge determines that this particular manner of disseminating the information is in fact unduly burdensome on Thiokol, he may direct that alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>means be employed. Our paramount concern is that the information be available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">. In Sanders v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 5 Cir., 1970, 451 F.2d 1097, we held that the pre-existing, non-vivified remedy under this section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, was not pre-empted by the passage of Title VII ninety-eight years later. <em>Accord, </em>Waters v.

Because we reverse on the basis of unduly restrictive discovery rulings we need not reach the merits of the Company\u2019s contention and Burns\u2019 rejoinder in this respect.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. Rule 33 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">(a) Availability ; Procedures for Use. Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Interrogatories may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of the summons and complaint upon that party.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after the service of the inter-rogaipries, except that a defendant may serve answers or objections within 45 days after service of the summons and complaint upon that defendant. The court may allow a shorter or longer time. The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under Rule 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">(b) Scope; Use at Trial. Interrogatories may relate <em>to </em>any matters which can be inquired into under Rule 26(b), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pre-trial conference or other later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">The permissible scope of interrogatories under Rule 33 is governed by the provisions of F.R.Civ.P. 26(b) which says:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-18\">(b) Scope of Discovery.

Thiokol\u2019s copious grounds for objection included the argument that the interrogatories called for immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent <em>evidence, </em>and <em>evidence </em>not embraced within the issues involved in the trial of the case.. Obviously, Thiokol failed to take account of the difference in degrees between the quantum of \u201crelevancy\u201d which will support an effort to discover background information and the more demanding degree of \u201crelevancy\u201d exacted by the trial Judge at the evidentiary tender, as reflected by the statement in Rule 26(b) that \u201cIt is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Ultimate admissibility is simply not the test for relevancy of material to be discovered.

In <em>Kessler </em>we held that the provisions in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(a), 2000e-8(e) prohibit the EEOC from \u201cmaking public\u201d the information obtained as a result of its investigatory efforts would not prevent EEOC from divulging such information to the charging party. In addition to the historic grounds which compelled this construction of these statutes, we also drew support from the public policy in favor of enabling the private attorney-general to effectively don the \u201cmantle of the sovereign\u201d, Jenkins v.

Thiokol correctly demonstrates that Subsection (c) was not in effect until July 1, 1970, long after the date upon which it was obligated to furnish the answer to Burns\u2019 interrogatories. This option will be available on remand if Thiokol should choose to elect it \u2014 subject, of course, to the judge\u2019s approval. But see Sutter, Current Procedural and Eviden-tiary Considerations Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Ready for the Defense, 6 Ga.L.Rev.- 505, 512-14 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b368-13\">. Since we liold that the information sought by plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories was discoverable, we have withheld ruling on the merits of Burns\u2019 appeal on issues (ii) and (iii). On remand, the trial court should allow the parties to proceed directly to properly complete the discovery process, and then reevaluate Burns\u2019 class action in light of the information available to him at that time, in accordance with Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 1122. See also Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 8 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 421. This would also include any guidance that might be furnished by the en banc court in Huff v. N. D. Cass Company of Alabama, 5 Cir., 1972, 468 F.2d 172, currently under submission to the full Court. Because of the importance of the determination of Burns\u2019 qualification to serve as the representative of the class, the court should resolve the issue \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. F.R.Civ.P. 23(c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-22\">Ordinarily we accord great latitude to the District Court in situations which call for a retrial as to the extent to which the record of the first trial may be used in the second with appropriate supplementation. Because most of the testimony bearing on Burns\u2019 individual claim was given without the benefit of necessary discovery, however, we believe that in this instance the entire claim must be tried in full again. In this regard, we note that Thiokol has consistently urged on appeal that a prior arbitration of Burns\u2019 discharge was dispositive of that issue. The extent to which reliance shall be placed upon that proceeding must be determined in the first place by the trial court in accordance with the principles enunciated by this Court in Rios v. Reynolds Metals Co., 5 Cir., 1972, 467 F.2d 54.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
