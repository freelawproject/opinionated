Because of a tip from a reliable informer that appellant possessed \u201ca certain quantity of marihuana or hashish\u201d in his car and had just \u201c \u2018smoked a joint\u2019 . . . with another person [the informer],\u201d he was stopped by rangers upon entering Yosemite National Park. Both his vehicle and person were searched, the latter yielding the marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The only substantial issue raised contests the legality of the warrantless arrest of Branch. The argument seeks to distinguish an arrest and search for a suspected misdemeanor from an arrest and search for a suspected felony. According to this argument, the informer\u2019s tip was ambiguous as to whether, under federal law, appellant was committing a felony (possession of marihuana or hashish with intent to distribute, 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 841), or a misdemeanor (simple possession, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844). Turning to the state law of wairantless arrests, see United States v. DiRe, 332 U.S. 581, 589, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948), appellant construes section 836 of the California Penal Code as authorizing a peace officer to make a warrantless \u201cfelony\u201d arrest \u201c[w]henever he has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a felony.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 836(3), but to authorize him to make a \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d arrest only when he has \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe the offense is being committed \u201cin his presence,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 836(1). Appellant further contends that \u201creasonable cause\u201d under this latter section must be based on the officer\u2019s personal knowledge and cannot rest on a third-party tip. <em>See, e. g., </em>5 Cal.Jur.2d, Arrest \u00a7 25, at 226 (Rev.1967); 5 Am. Jur.2d, Arrest \u00a7 31 at 721 (1962); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 32, at 723. From these premises appellant concludes that section 836(3) was unavailable to the arresting officers because they had no reason to believe appellant\u2019s crime was any more than a misdemeanor, and section 836(1) was unavailable because their \u201creasonable cause\u201d was based on information from others and not personal knowledge. Hence the arrest and subsequent search were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Assuming appellant is correct in his premises that section 836 is applicable, and that, for purposes of that section, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 defines a \u201cfelony\u201d while 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 defines only a \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d we nonetheless do not agree with his conclusion that the arrest was invalid under section 836(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">Even if the information received by the officer as to the quantity of controlled substance involved was not sufficient to support an inference of distribution or intent to distribute, the additional information that appellant had \u201c \u2018smoked a joint\u2019 . . . with another person [the informer]\u201d was. That information brought appellant\u2019s conduct within the \u201cdistribution\u201d ban of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">It was possible that appellant\u2019s conduct might eventually be found to have been only a misdemeanor in view of subsection (b) (4) of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. According to that subsection, \u201cany person who violates subsection (a) of this section by distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration shall be treated as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of section 844 of this title.\u201d Thus, if it turned out that appellant had \u201cdistributed\u201d only this one illegal cigarette, that it contained no controlled substance other than marihuana and marihuana derivatives, that appellant had not intended to distribute any more marihuana, and that he had not been paid, it might eventually appear that he had not \u201ccommitted a felony\u201d within the meaning of California Penal Code \u00a7 836(3). But the possibility of subsection (b)(4)\u2019s applicability was one of mitigation only. At least absent some affirmative reason apparent at the time of arrest to believe that subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>(b)(4) would apply to appellant\u2019s \u201cdistributional\u201d activities, the rangers were entitled to treat him under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
