S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-552 (Supp. 1971) ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State v. Hill, 254 S.C. 321, 175 S.E.2d 227, 232 (1970). The sentencing judge was doubtless influenced, and properly so, by Wood\u2019s prior criminal record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Whatever may be our subjective view of the matter, we fail to discern here objective factors establishing dispropor-tionality in violation of the eighth amendment. <em>See </em>Hart v. Coiner, 483 F. 2d 136 (4th Cir. 1973), decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">The decision of the district court will therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"AGx\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\">. Until amended in 1967, maximum incarceration was six months. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-552.1 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-26\">. Wood was serving a sentence for burglary at the time he placed the calls. His prior record included convictions for larceny and automobile theft.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
