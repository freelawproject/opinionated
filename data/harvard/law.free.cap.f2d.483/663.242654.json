J. Hughes, warden of the Milan Institution, subsequently reported to the trial judge that although Sawyer was an addict, it was unlikely that he would be rehabilitated by the NARA drug abuse program and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>that his presence might be detrimental to others in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">After receiving the Warden\u2019s letter, the trial judge ordered Sawyer to appear in court on January 15, 1973 and advised him that resentencing was set for January 17, 1973. On this latter date, Sawyer was resentenced to five years imprisonment with a special parole term of three years following the imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, Sawyer raises three contentions, each of which we deem to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Sawyer\u2019s first contention is that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 (1970), which provides for a 15 year maximum sentence, is arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminatory against him and others similarly situated. Premising his argument on the characterization of his importation as merely incidental to possession, he claims that discrimination inheres in the fact that addicts residing close to the border are more likely to be involved in importation for personal use and hence subject to stiffen penalties under 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 960 (1970) than addicts residing in the interior of the United States whose unlawful possession brings merely a one year sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ,While his factual observation may be irrefutable, his legal conclusion is not, and hence we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Sawyer\u2019s second and equally unavailing contention is that the imposition of a sanction against him for importation violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment' in that it punishes him for a status, that of being a narcotics addict. A similar argument was offered and rejected in United States v. Drotar, 416 F.2d 914, 916-917 (5th Cir. 1969). We find no compelling reason to repudiate that eon-elusion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">Sawyer\u2019s final contention is that he was denied due process at the sentencing phase of the trial. The thrust of this argument is that because the factual determination of guilt required to be made under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) (1970) and the attendant sentencing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 (1970) presented issues distinct from those arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252 (1970), he should have been accorded a full panoply of due process rights at the resentencing hearing, including confrontation of witnesses, reasonable notice and compulsory process under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">Admittedly, the factual determination required to be made under the former statutes \u2014 whether the accused unlawfully imported heroin \u2014 does not coincide with the determinations required to be made under the latter statute \u2014 whether the accused is an addict, amenable to rehabilitation under NARA programs. Whether this difference alone renders Specht v. Patterson, <em>supra, </em>dispositive of Sawyer\u2019s due process contention need not, however, be decided, in this case, for here, Sawyer consistently maintained that he was not an addict and hence not eligible for the NARA treatment program in the first instance. Moreover, since the record is devoid of any evidence to suggest that Sawyer sought and was denied access to the warden\u2019s report at the resentencing hearing, we need not entertain this contention on appeal. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Hord, 459 F.2d 1003, 1004 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Carroll, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 178, 436 F.2d 272, 274 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7952 (a) (1970) :</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">(a) It shall be unlawful to import into the customs territory of the United States from any place outside thereof (but within the United States), or to import into the United States from- any place outside thereof, any controlled substance in schedule I or II of subchapter I of this chapter, or any narcotic drug in schedule III, IV, nr V of subchapter I of this chapter. . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252 (1970) :</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">If the court believes that an eligible offender is an addict, it may place him in the custody of the Attorney General for an examination to determine whether he is an addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment.
