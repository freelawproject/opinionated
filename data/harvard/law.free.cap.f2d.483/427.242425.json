The automobile was not Gam-boa\u2019s and it had no registration paper. But it did have a lot of seconal secreted in the panels of the body of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">Narcotics \u201cintelligence\u201d is stored in some sort of a government computer. A government agent signals in the number of an automobile\u2019s license plate. If there is a record, he gets back what is called a \u201ccadpin\u201d printout.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-24\">When the car driven by Gamboa came across the border, the computer was queried by submitting the car\u2019s license number. Back came a \u201cprintout\u201d alerting the border agent, a careful search of the car following. The search was rewarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">The district court, the United States attorney, and we have seen the printout. Defendant and his counsel have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-26\">Naturally, the government does not want to put its information on the bulletin board. While the printout is confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>dential, we think we can use common sense and partially reveal its contents and also state what it does not contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The printout did not mention Gamboa at all. The information went into the computer about six weeks prior to the event of September 2, 1972. It did mention another, presumably the car\u2019s owner, and some of his associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Anyway, there is nothing to suggest that there was an informer as to Gam-boa\u2019s particular transaction. Thus, disclosure of the cadpin report could not have served the interest of Gamboa very well. Public interest therefore outweighs any position Gamboa has.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In sum, there was no informer on Gamboa or the day\u2019s events. If Gamboa did not know the owner of the car, he could have obtained his name from the California Motor Vehicle Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">On the question of sufficiency of the evidence, we find it adequate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
