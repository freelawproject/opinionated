Miss Zuniga admitted her delinquency and was sentenced. Appellant was tried by the court without a jury and found guilty. She raises two issues here: the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutional validity of the search. In view of our reversal on the evidence issue, we need not reach the latter point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\"> There is no evidence that appellant actually possessed the mescaline. In support of the conviction, the government argues that constructive possession was established by her presence during several conversations between Miss Zuniga and the undercover agent concerning the sale, by comments made by Miss Zuniga and the police\u2019s informant allegedly linking appellant to the sale, and by appellant\u2019s own remarks concerning her past use of drugs. Such evidence, at most, may show appellant\u2019s knowledge of the sale of the illegal drug. It does not indicate that appellant took an active part in the sale, much less that she ever exercised any dominion or control over the drug. To establish constructive possession, however, there must be proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>dominion and control. Garza v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 899; Smith v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 34. We think this case is squarely governed by the rule that \u201cmere presence in the area where the narcotic is discovered or mere association with the person who does control the drug or the property where it is located, is insufficient to support a finding of possession.\u201d United States v. Stephenson, 5th Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1353 [1973], The evidence here is clearly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
