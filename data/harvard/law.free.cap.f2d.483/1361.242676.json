The prosecution stemmed from an \u201cairport search\u201d in which the marihuana was discovered in appellant\u2019s luggage. Following discovery of the marihuana, appellant forcibly resisted the attempts of two federal Customs agents to arrest him. Appellant challenges his conviction for possession on the ground that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. He challenges his conviction for assault on the ground that he was privileged to use reasonable force to resist his allegedly unlawful arrest. We agree with the first contention, but reject the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">The facts relevant to the lawfulness of the search are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-16\">Appellant approached the Continental Airlines check-in counter at Tucson International Airport with the apparent intention of boarding Flight 75. Mr. Kohlhoff, Continental\u2019s ticket agent, observed that appellant was extremely nervous. When Mr. Kohlhoff asked for identification, appellant produced a medical care identification card, an identification card for federal food coupons, and half of a New York driver\u2019s license, all bearing the name \u201cAlan C. Mahoney.\u201d Appellant\u2019s air ticket was issued to \u201cA. Mahoney.\u201d None of the identification documents included information as to Mr. Mahoney\u2019s height or weight, or the color of his hair or eyes. Appellant had no other identification. Mr. Kohlhoff asked Mr. Padalino, a Customs agent assisting in the check-in process, to help determine whether appellant was in fact Mr. Mahoney. In response to Agent Padalino\u2019s questions, appellant stated that his birthdate was October 14, 1951, although the medical card showed Mr. Mahoney\u2019s birthdate as \u201cOctober 1950\u201d; he said he did not know Mrs. Mahoney\u2019s given name (\u201cCatherine\u201d on one of the identification cards), but recalled her \u201cnickname\u201d; and he correctly identified the city and street of Mr. Mahoney\u2019s residence, but was unable to recall the street number. Agent Padalino told the Continental employees that in his opinion appellant was not Mr. Mahoney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-17\">Since appellant could not identify himself satisfactorily as the person to whom the airline ticket had been issued, Mr. Kohlhoff told him he would not be' allowed to board the plane. Agent Padali-no and Customs Agent Hemerka (who was also standing nearby) were told that appellant had been denied boarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>Appellant demanded the return of his two suitcases. Mr. Kohlhoff left to retrieve them from the plane. According to the agents appellant became increasingly agitated: sweating, trembling, eyes dilated and \u201cglassy,\u201d speech slurred. Agent Padalino testified that appellant appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or to be ill. Mr. Kohlhoff returned with the two suitcases. The agents noticed that masking tape had been applied around one of the bags and over the keyholes of the other. Appellant took the bags and left hurriedly. As he moved away, he dropped his still-refundable ticket. The agents followed, calling out that they had his ticket, but he did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The agents caught up with appellant and drew him aside to an unoccupied boarding area. They informed him his bags would have to be searched, and asked him to open them. Appellant produced a key. The agents unlocked one of the bags. Appellant then opened the bag and showed the agents the section containing clothing and personal effects. They asked him to open the other half of the suitcase. He declined, holding down the interior divider. Agent He-merka pushed him away, opened the compartment, and discovered the marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">The agents then sought to place appellant under arrest. He resisted, assaulting Agent Padalino in a successful effort to free himself, and fled. He was soon recaptured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">Appellant\u2019s bag was not searched as part of an administrative screening search of airline passengers\u2019 carry-on luggage such as was approved in United States v. Davis, 482 F.2d 893 (9th Cir. 1973). Appellant did not seek to personally carry his bag aboard the plane, and clearly indicated his desire to relinquish the opportunity to board the flight before the search was made. <em>Id. </em>at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\"> The search cannot be justified as a permissible \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d within the limits established by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The circumstances may have warranted stopping appellant to inquire into the possibility of criminal activity. It is less clear that the agents could justify a <em>Terry </em>\u201cfrisk\u201d by pointing to \u201cparticular facts from which . . . [they] reasonably inferred that [appellant] was armed and dangerous.\u201d Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 64, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1903, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968). But even if a <em>Terry </em>\u201cfrisk\u201d were warranted, it could extend no further than \u201ca carefully limited search of the outer clothing of . [appellant] in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault [the agents],\u201d Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1885, and thus could hardly include an investigation of the contents of appellant\u2019s locked suitcase. <em>See </em>United States v. Davis, <em>supra, </em>482 F.2d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">Finally, the record does not support the government\u2019s theory that the agents had probable cause to arrest appellant, and that the search of his bag was therefore a lawful search incident to a valid arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">\u201cProbable cause at the time of arrest is determined by examining \u2018whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within . . . [the agents\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Selby, 407 F.2d 241, 242-243 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>quoting </em>Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964). Suspicious conduct is not enough. <em>See, e. g., </em>Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 101, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959). Probable cause is lacking if the circumstances relied on are \u201csusceptible to a variety of credible interpretations not necessarily compatible with nefarious activities.\u201d United States v. Kandlis, 432 F.2d 132, 136 (9th Cir. 1970), <em>quoting </em>United States v. Sel-by, <em>supra, </em>407 F.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-15\">Appellant\u2019s conduct was no more than suspicious. His nervousness, confusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>and extreme forgetfulness were consonant with intoxication induced by alcohol or drugs, ill health, or extreme but innocent anxiety engendered by a discomforting personal confrontation with the airline employees and government agents. <em>See, e. g., </em>Valenzuela-Garcia v. United States, 425 F.2d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>cf. </em>Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 482-484 &amp; n. 10, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); Rios v. United States, 364 U.S. 234, 255-256, 261-262, 80 S.Ct. 1431, 4 L.Ed.2d 1688 (1960). His lack of documentary identification containing a physical description did not contribute materially to an implication of guilt. <em>See, e. g., </em>Jones v. Peyton, 411 F.2d 857, 861 (4th Cir. 1969). The presence of the masking tape was odd, but scarcely sinister. Nothing in the record indicates that appellant knew he had dropped his ticket, or understood the agents\u2019 efforts to inform him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">As we have said, appellant may have been a sufficiently \u201csuspicious individual\u201d that the agents might have stopped him briefly, \u201cin order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information.\u201d Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). But they lacked sufficient trustworthy information \u201cto warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d Beck v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 91, 85 S.Ct. at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">The motion to suppress should have been granted; appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of marihuana with intent to distribute cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">The right to resist an unlawful arrest was well established at common law. \u201cIf the officer have no right to arrest, the other party might resist the illegal attempt to arrest him, using no more force than was absolutely necessary to repel the assault constituting the attempt to arrest.\u201d John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529, 535, 20 S.Ct. 729, 731, 44 L.Ed. 874 (1900). \u201cOne has an undoubted right to resist an unlawful arrest, and courts will uphold the right of resistance in proper cases.\u201d United States v. DiRe, 332 U.S. 581, 594, 68 S.Ct. 222, 228, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">We assume this principle remains valid, although much criticized of late.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also assume its availability as a defense to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Kartman, 417 F.2d 893, ,895 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1969); United States v. Grimes, 413 F.2d 1376, 1378-1379 (7th Cir. 1969). We conclude, nonetheless, that it is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">The privilege asserted is available only if the arrest was \u201cunlawful.\u201d The parties agree that appellant was arrested after the agents discovered the marihuana in his suitcase. The agents then had probable cause to believe that a felony was being committed in their presence. The warrantless arrest was therefore lawful, in itself. It was \u201cunlawful\u201d only in the exclusionary-rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>sense that it was \u201cfruit\u201d of the prior unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">We have been cited no authority, and have found none, that permits resistance to an arrest that is unlawful only in this derivative sense. We are unwilling to initiate such an extension of the privilege, at least where, as here, there is no claim of bad faith, unreasonable force, or provocative conduct on the part of the arresting officer. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Vigil, 431 F.2d 1037, 1042-1043 (10th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">The purposes of the privilege would not be served by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">One such purpose is to deter abuses of police authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The risk of possible physical resistance to a subsequent arrest can have little tendency to deter the prior unlawful search. The relationship is too remote to add measurably to the deterrent effect of the officers\u2019 presumed knowledge that the arrest will be futile in any event since the evidence resulting, directly or indirectly, from the unlawful search will be suppressed. There may be a slightly greater possibility that the availability of the privilege would deter the arrest itself, but it is questionable whether it would be desirable to discourage an officer from making an arrest after a serach, albeit unlawful, has demonstrated that a felony is being or has been committed. At that point the resolution of often difficult issues relating to the lawfulness of the search are surely best left to subsequent court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">The second general purpose of the privilege is to preserve the sense of personal liberty and integrity inherent in our system of constitutional government by protecting from punishment persons who reasonably resist unlawful intrusions by government agents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But again, where a search has disclosed that a felony is or has been committed, a subsequent arrest for that offense is hardly a proper occasion for self-righteous resistance \u2014 excluding, of course, instances of bad faith, unreasonable force, or provocative conduct by the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">The conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is reversed. The conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v.

One such reason is that the proposed change might possibly foster conditions inherent in a police state. The new law could be an instrument of oppression. Armed with such a statute a policeman, even for reasons of prejudice or whim, could attempt to make a patently false and provocative arrest and thereby infuriate the average citizen into some form of resistance. Thereafter, the citizen could be charged with resisting arrest, which would be a crime regardless of the invalidity of the initial attempted arrest.\u201d Note, The Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest, 31 La.L.Rev. 120, 122-23 (1970). <em>See </em>Chevigny, The Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest, 78 Yale L.J. 1128, 1128, 1138 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">. \u201cThe right to resist unlawful arrest memorializes one of the principal elements in the heritage of the English revolution: the belief that the will to resist arbitrary authority in a reasonable way is valuable and ought not to be suppressed by the criminal law. In the face of obvious injustice, one ought not to be forced to submit and swallow one\u2019s sense of justice. More importantly, it is unconscionable to convict a man for resisting an injustice. This is indeed a value judgment, but the values are fundamental.\u201d Chevigny, The Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest, 78 Yale L.J. 1128, 1137-38 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">\u201cThe freedom to refuse to obey a patently unlawful arrest is essential to the integrity .of a government which purports to be one of laws, and not of men. Unless it is desirable to kill the imxiulse to resist arbitrary authority, the rule that such an arrest is a provocation to resist must remain fundamental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1147.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
