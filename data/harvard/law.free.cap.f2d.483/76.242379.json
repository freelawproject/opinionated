Citizens Casualty Company of New York, et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b136-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b136-22\">The question here is whether the trial court abused its rather broad discretion in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for severance. Appellant contends that, though initial joinder may have been proper and in accord with F.R.Crim.P. 8(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Government\u2019s use of certain out-of-court admissions of his co-defendant, who did not take the stand and which tended to inculpate Appellant, amounted to violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness against him and should have compelled severance pursuant to that discretion vested in the Court under F.R. Crim.P. 14<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that Bruton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, supports the validity of Appellant\u2019s contention, and that, therefore, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed with directions to grant Appellant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Government argues that, if in fact the prosecution\u2019s use of the inculpating statements are to be construed as error, it has to fall under F.R.Crim.P. 52(a) as harmless error since no substantial rights of Appellant were prejudiced. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">As this ease developed, the defense counsel found himself in the unenviable position of having two clients, a father and a son, which conflicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the trial the Government put on the stand Special Agent Starr of the FBI and Pauline Yates, the sister of Appellant\u2019s father. Both of these witnesses related damaging statements purportedly made by James Howard Holt, inculpating the Appellant, William Marvin Holt. Defense counsel could not place James Howard Holt on the stand to deny or explain away the statements as his record would subject both his son and him to being placed in a bad light before the jury. Neither could counsel attack the Defendant Howard Holt\u2019s veracity as he was representing him. Here the Court should have known that this hearsay evidence could not be combatted by open confrontation. Similarly to <em>Bruton, </em>the introduction of the co-defendant\u2019s statements \u201cadded substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the Government\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, since [the co-defendant] did not take the stand.\u201d Bruton v. United States, <em>supra, </em>391 U.S. at 128, 88 S.Ct. at 1623, 20 L.Ed.2d at 480. Thus, under <em>Bruton, supra, </em>Appellant was denied his constitutional right to cross-examination, secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. Consequently, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed with directions to grant a new trial. Gray v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-14\">.

Appellant William Marvin Holt had initially filed a motion for severance pursuant to F.R.Crim.P. 8(b), the ground being that his co-defendant father, James Howard Holt, had a criminal record and to require him to stand trial jointly with his father would prejudice his case if the record of his father was brought out. This motion was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
