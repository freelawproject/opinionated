Because suit was not filed until 224 days after the last act of discrimination alleged by plaintiff, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the 180-day period of limitations contained in \u00a7 812 of the Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3612(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed the <em>entire </em>complaint. We conclude that plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1982 was <em>not </em>barred by limitations, although his alleged cause of action under the Fair Housing Act was. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-19\">Although the district court was plainly correct in ruling that plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3606 was time-barred, recent cases revitalizing the long dormant \u00a7 1982 make it clear that the broad effect of that and similar early civil rights statutes was not meant to be circumscribed by modern civil rights acts. \u201cThe Civil Rights Act of 1968 does not mention 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1982, and we cannot assume that Congress intended to effect any change, either sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>stantive or procedural, in the prior statute.\u201d Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 417 n.20, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2191, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968). <em>See </em>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969). Thus, plaintiff\u2019s failure to assert a timely claim under the Fair Housing Act will have no effect on whatever cause of action he may have under \u00a7 1982. Young v. AAA Realty Co. of Greensboro, Inc., 350 F.Supp. 1382, 1387 (M.D.N.C.1972); James v. Hafler, 320 F. Supp. 397 (N.D.Ga.1970); MeLaurin v. Brusturis, 320 F.Supp. 190 (E.D.Wis. 1970). Indeed, the language of the Fair Housing Act so provides.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Similarly, in the analogous situation of the relationship between 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5, which bans, <em>inter alia, </em>racial discrimination in employment, courts have held that the running of the statute of limitations under the 1964 Act will not bar claims under \u00a7 1981. Sanders v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 431 F.2d 1097 (5 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 935, 28 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971); Haekett v. McGuire Brothers, Inc., 445 F.2d 442, 444 n.1 (3 Cir. 1971). <em>See </em>Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association, Inc., 410 U.S. 431, 93 S.Ct. 1090, 35 L. Ed.2d 403 (1973). The legislative history of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, P.L. 92-261, which amended portions of Title VII of the 1964 Act, reinforces the view that the recent civil rights acts do not affect existing rights granted by previous legislation. <em>See </em>H.R. Report No. 92-238, 1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2154 (1971); 118 Cong.Rec.S. 1458-1459, 1523, 1526, 1791-1797 (Daily ed. Feb. 8, 9 and 15, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\"> The statute of limitations applicable to an alleged \u00a7 1982 cause of action is the state statute of limitations expressly, or most nearly, applicable to the type of claim which is asserted. Allen v. Gifford, 462 F.2d 615 (4 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 876, 93 S.Ct. 128, 34 L.Ed.2d 130 (1972); Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200 (4 Cir. 1972); Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, 420 F.2d 1191 (7 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 42, 27 L.Ed.2d 49 (1970). The minimum period of limitations under South Carolina law for <em>any </em>cause of action is one year. Code of Laws of South Carolina, \u00a7\u00a7 10-127, 10-142, 10-143, 10-147, 10-148 (1962). Plaintiff asserted his alleged \u00a7 1982 cause of action within less than one year after he claims that it arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-17\">It follows that the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1982 claim as time-barred must be reversed; plaintiff is not barred by limitations from asserting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-11\">.
