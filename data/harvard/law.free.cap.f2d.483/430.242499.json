We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">1. The Court correctly held the civil service rule excluding aliens from employment to be unconstitutional. Sugarman v. Douglass, 413 U.S. 634, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973). The unconstitutionality of excluding aliens being the only issue in the case, the District Court\u2019s order striking Rule V, Section 3 of the City of Miami Civil Service Rules and Regulations must be construed to affect only the clause pertaining to citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-22\">2. There was no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in finding that $2,800 was sufficient compensation to be awarded the cross-appellants\u2019 attorneys, which amount was supported by the affidavits introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">3. The City of Miami and the City of Miami Civil Service Board were properly dismissed from the suit due to improper service of process: wives are not authorized to receive service for the respective chief executive officers in their official capacities. F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (6) ; F.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 48.111 and 120.071.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-24\">4. The cause is remanded to the District Court for consideration of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for the prosecution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">Affirmed and remanded for consideration of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
