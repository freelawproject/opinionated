BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">After suffering injury through the alleged negligence of a fellow employee on an offshore drilling rig located on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of Louisiana Employee-Appellant suffered summary judgment in the District Court through the asserted error of the trial Judge in incorrectly determining that in an action invoking the Louisiana Direct Action Statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (i) the Longshoremen\u2019s .and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (L &amp; H) was the exclusive remedy for appellant and (ii) L &amp; H\u2019s grant of tort immunity to both the employer and the fellow employees of an injured worker (\u00a7 933(i))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>is a non-personal defense which can be maintained by the employer\u2019s insurance carrier. We agree with the District Court and hold that he was clearly correct as to both (i) and (ii) and affirm for the further reason that we find the Louisiana Direct Action Statute to be inapplicable to causes of action based upon occurrences on artificial islands or structures on the Continental Shelf.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The facts, which are not disputed, show that Employee was injured while working on an oil drilling platform located some 40 miles from the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. Employee was working for Employer (Coral Drilling Company) at the time of the accident as was his co-worker, the defendant, W. W. Morris.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Insurer (American Motorist Insurance Company) a defendant due to the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, is the liability and compensation insurer of Employer. American Motorist was thereby the liability insurer of Morris under the omnibus provisions of its general liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">\n<em>Tinkers-To Evers-To Chance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjcA\">As Employee cannot ignore the plain language of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 et seq., which expressly prescribes the application of L &amp; H <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the exculpatory terms of \u00a7 933, note ,3, <em>Supra, </em>his theory is necessarily a complex, if not too sophisticated, one.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">First, to export onto International waters, the land-based Louisiana right of an injured employee to sue a fellow employee for injuries caused by negligence of such fellow worker <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he has to find a way for Louisiana law to apply either extraterritorially or as <em>Rodrigue </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> surrogate law. He does that by invoking \u00a7 1333(a)(2) of OCSLA which provides that \u201cto the extent that they are applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ble and not inconsistent with this sub-chapter or with other Federal laws and regulations\u201d state laws shall be applied as surrogate federal law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To make that leap in the face of \u00a7 1333(c) OSCLA and the exculpation of 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 933(i), he asserts that the occurrence was either in the twilight zone or the concurrent light zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">All the while, he must be fully aware that L &amp; H, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 through \u00a7 950, provides a comprehensive scheme for determining who shall pay, how much money,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> after which occurrences, for what duration, to which persons, and provides the machinery for enforcing these determinations. It provides what record keeping practices must be maintained, penalties for failure to follow its requirements and prohibitions, safety rules and regulations for the protection of the workers that it covers and appropriations for its enforcement. The import of this will be \u2014 we hope \u2014 made clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\"><em>Not Equal </em>\u2014 No <em>Sequel</em></p>\n<p id=\"At4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 1917, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086, ruled that state compensation acts could not provide compensation for maritime injuries. In Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, 1921, 257 U.S. 469, 42 S.Ct. 157, 66 L.Ed. 321, following closely on the heels of its decision in Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 1921, 257 U.S. 233, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210, the Supreme Court held that state compensation acts could not compensate maritime injuries unless they were \u201cmaritime but local\u201d (257 U.S. at 242, 42 S.Ct. 89). After the enactment of the L &amp; H in 1927 the question of whether there would be compensation under a state act shifted to whether compensation would be state or federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">In Davis v. Department of Labor, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246, 1942 A.M.C. 1653, the Court dealt with a situation where the physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>location of an accident created uncertainty as to whether state or L &amp; H compensation would apply. The Court introduced one of those figuratives that may make the problem worse, not easier. It held that in the twilight zone a determination that state compensation was applicable would not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, \u201ctwilight\u201d began to take on the appearance of an \u00e1rea where either system might- operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368, 1962 A.M.C. 1413, the Supreme Court made it clear that there existed an area in which both state and federal compensation systems were competent to provide a remedy. Appellant would have us describe this as a sphere of \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Mike Hooks, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we referred to it as \u201cthe doctrine of the last <em>chance.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Mike Hooks </em>adequately describes the erratic voyage of the humane compensation remedy through the shoals left by <em>Jensen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\"><em>Calbeck </em>applied the doctrine \u2014 whatever its proper appendage \u2014 to new construction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And the area of multiple choice remedies extends to injuries sustained in working around marine railways, which, though they are on dry land, are covered by L &amp; H through the specific command of \u00a7 902(4), that the L &amp; H shall cover drydocks. Holland v. Harrison Brothers Drydock and Repair Yard, 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 369, 1963 A.M.C. 1343.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <em>Holland </em>Court was not dissuaded from locating the injuries there within the twilight zone by the fact that the injuries occurred on the land appurtenant to the railway, necessarily occupied by those repairing the ship,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 306 F.2d at 372, and not on the railway or the barge resting on the railway. Appellant would have us hold that the platform here was such an area of concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">The argument is a nice try, but it doesn\u2019t work for a number of reasons. This occurrence did not take place within the territorial limits of the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Louisiana. The accident occurred far beyond even the wildest claim of territorial sovereignty the state of Louisiana might make. Specifically the accident occurred upon the \u201cOuter Continental Shelf\u201d as that area is characterized and defined by Congressional act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Employee recognizes this but invokes <em>a la </em>Rodrigue<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the surrogate law provision, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In a way our analysis requires, as is often done in jurisdictional quests, that we assume momentarily that Louisiana law applies and would not be inconsistent with OCSLA. On that approach there is neither \u201cmaritime but local\u201d nor twilight zone. The injuries were sustained wholly on the drilling platform. Although transported forty or more miles to sea the incident was the parallel of a longshoreman being injured on a permanent pier in a land locked harbor,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> with no mixture of sea and land.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Here the L &amp; H applies not because the injuries were maritime but not local but because the statute expressly so states. And there can be no twilight where the physical location and the consummation of the injuries were on this Congressional extension of the underlying seabed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">A beguiling argument could be made that by OCSLA\u2019s incorporation of L &amp; H Congress gave a mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation to the jurisdictional language launched by <em>Jensen </em>to afford federal coverage only where disability or death stems from an injury occurring upon navigable waters, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and recovery for the disability or death through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings might not validly be provided by the adjacent state. However we cannot believe that Congress had any such purpose.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-18\">As with numerous overseas military bases Congress knew that in the area of industrial injuries which were bound to occur often in such new and hazardous operations a specific code for adequate compensation benefits for employees <em>vis-a-vis </em>employers had to be ordained. Several factors pointed directly toward the rejection of any notion that this could be attained through a sometime application of adjacent state compensation laws. First was an awar\u00e9ness that the ease by case post <em>-Jensen </em>history had not been an inspiring one. Next, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>pointed out <em>in Snipes, note 29, infra, </em>OCSLA prescribes federal standards for industrial safety to be promulgated and enforced by the \u201chead of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Domestic employers under the L <em>&amp; </em>H are regulated with regard to safety practices by the Secretary of Labor.) <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Even more significant in construction of the act is the fact that OCSLA, in its incorporation of L &amp; H, did not speak in terms of injuries occurring <em>on </em>such platforms so as to distinguish them from those <em>off </em>the platforms. The incorporation, \u00a7 1333(c), note 5, <em>supra, </em>refers to \u201coperations described in subsection (b)\u201d which thereby incorporates the broad scheme of \u00a7 1333(b).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Obviously Congress purposefully established a system that would apply without regard to physical location.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">To cap it off, ever since <em>Calbeck </em>the proviso of \u00a7 903(a) has had little or no operative effect with respect to occurrences within the legislatively described sphere. There it was an injury occurring on navigable waters (in connection with the building of a new vessel). Here the physical operation covered is that of \u00a7 1333(b) OCSLA, note 22, <em>supra, </em>which pertains to injuries (i) <em>on </em>the platform or (ii) in connection with the exploration for or exploitation and removal of the natural resources of the Outer Continental Shelf. And for the Outer Continental Shelf Congress faced no <em>Jensen-like </em>constitutional problems. When OCSLA was enacted the national government\u2019s \u201cparamount jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> had already been declared by the decision which sparked the years-on-end effort to salvage something for the adjacent states in the tidelands. Congress was unfettered. Deference to adjacent states was for practical, not constitutional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">L &amp; H applies during the dark of night, at the break of dawn and in the twilight too. And it would be a mistake to find a new twilight zone which surrounds the United States at a distance beyond a marine league from its shores. Twilight by its definition is a time when it is difficult to see. For this limited problem the shorelines of our nation and their relation to federal and state jurisdiction are already obscure enough without our producing a new fog bank to prolong, intensify or increase the dimensions of the reduced visability. We can hope that the 1972 amendments to \u00a7 903(a) will burn away the fog. <em>Cf., </em>note 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Although this is no <em>Erie </em>pursuit we find assurance in Louisiana\u2019s rejection of one-if-by-land, two-if-by-sea. For the Louisiana courts have held that their Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is not applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf and specifically the fixed platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\n<em>Not Surrogate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"> Employee\u2019s contention that the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act with its freedom to sue fellow employees is \u201capplicable\u201d as surrogate federal law is too frail a craft to venture to the Outer Continental Shelf. OCSLA declares, \u00a7 1333(a)(2), that the laws of the adjacent state shall apply \u201c[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent,\u201d note 8, <em>supra, </em>and Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty Co., 1969, 395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360, 1969 A.M.C. 1082, has charted our course in this area. As we said in <em>Continental Oil </em>Co.,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the recurring theme of <em>Rodrigue </em>\u201crequires that \u2018applicable\u2019 be read in terms of necessity \u2014 necessity to fill a significant void or gap.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> L &amp; H is clearly a sufficient system and its provisions as to the liability of fellow employees must \u2014 along with the entire remainder of L &amp; H \u2014 be the law for workers injured in connection with operations involving removal or development of natural resources from the Outer Continental Shelf.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">For the purposes of this case on the question of what Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute should be applied <em>Rodrigue </em>means that there must exist a gap before state law can be applicable. In light of the specific adoption of L &amp; H to cover maritime, non-maritime or ambiguous amphibious claims for injuries to employees <em>Rodrigue </em>does not either suggest or require that because of the non-maritime nature of the claim adjacent state law is to be employed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">And what we conclude today on fresh examination of the statutes and historical background follows our previous holdings, whatever remains of Huson v. Otis Engineering Corp., 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 27, 1970 A.M.C. 1978,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> after its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>partial affirmance and remand, 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296, 1972 A.M.C. 20 and <em>Rodrigue\u2019s </em>rejection of our earlier prediction in Snipes<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which dealt with adoption or non-adoption of adjacent state law in third party situations. We are firm in the view that as between employee and employer (or fellow employee) L &amp; H is the sole measure and this excludes a land based damage action against the fellow employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Civil Law </em>\u2014 The <em>In Solido Doctrine and L &amp; H Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Undaunted by our refusal to construe OCSLA and L &amp; H to his satisfaction Employee now turns to the Louisiana law. He asks us to make another big leap, this time from the Outer Continental Shelf to the Civil Law of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">\n<em>Inherent Or Personal Defense?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">Even though L &amp; H is employee\u2019s exclusive compensation remedy and it provides that fellow servants of an injured employee are exonerated from liability and that no remedy exists against them,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Employee contends that under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and Codal Art. 2098 <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> of the Louisiana Civil Code Insurer is liable. The Direct Action Statute provides that the insurer and the assured are debtors <em>\u201cin solido\u201d </em>which brings into play Art. 2098 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>provides that defenses which are personal to a debtor <em>in solido </em>cannot be asserted by his co-debtor. The upshot of this in Employee\u2019s eyes is that the freedom of the fellow employee from liability provided by 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 933(i) is personal to that fellow employee and is no defense to the employee\u2019s liability insurer for its vicarious liability under the Direct Action Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">If the defense inheres in the nature of the obligation then Insurers have Employers fellow-employees \u00a7\u00a7 905, 933(i) absolute exculpation. If not, Insurer has the vicarious liability if \u2014 and the if is a giant one \u2014 the Direct Action Statute jumps from shore to the Outer Continental Shelf.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We have twice dealt with this quaint Codal provision concerning defenses resulting \u201cfrom the nature of the obligation.\u201d In <em>Nebel </em>Totving<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> this Court held that the shipowner\u2019s Limitation of Liability Act<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> was a personal defense and that shipowner\u2019s insurer could be forced to pay the full damages even though no personal judgment could be taken against the assured shipowner beyond the limited value in the \u201cvessel and her freight then pending.\u201d Accepting this as the controlling law, there is nothing in that case that requires or suggests that we hold that the absolute tort immunity between an injured employee and his employer and fellow employees is a personal defense not inhering in the nature of the obligation. As the Court there emphasized it is the shipowner <em>alone </em>who can limit. This is a peculiar statutory defense which seldom has anything to do with the underlying liabilities <em>vis-a-vis </em>the parties. Except for the procedural concursus the right to limit comes long after the event. It does not obliterate the right. Under L &amp; H the liability of employer and fellow employee which is insulated by \u00a7\u00a7 905, 933(i) is that arising from the nature of the relationship of the parties under pertinent law (maritime or common) had exculpation not been granted. In <em>Nebel </em>we held the statutory right to limit was personal, but we came nowhere close to fellow servant liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Indeed <em>Nebel </em>was a prescient forecast of our holding. To the contention that treating the right to limit as personal would compel the result sought here under L &amp; H, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201cThe appellant\u2019s attempt to analogize the limitation act to the' Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. (1964), must fail. Since the Longshoremen\u2019s Act destroys the right to relief outside the statutory coverage, it would follow that a claimant could not proceed against the insurer on a non-existent right to relief. The Limitation Act merely provides a specific benefit to shipowners; it does not destroy the right to relief.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Sections 905(a) and 933 (i) of L &amp; H completely obliterates the rights at common, civil or maritime law against Employer and fellow employee. Congress in its unlimited power has determined that the relationship gives rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>only to compensation liabilities. The nature of the obligation is that there is no \u2014the word is <em>no </em>\u2014 obligation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">But <em>Nebel </em>not only does not compel the Louisiana rule sought. It does not stand alone as authority on the proposition. In Alcoa Steamship Company v. Charles Ferran and Company, 5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 250, 1971 A.M.C. 1161 we held that the Red Letter Clause of a ship repair contract which limited liability of ship repairer to $300,000 was a defense which inhered in the nature of the obligation. We emphasized that the contract set forth the scheme of obligations, liabilities and created the relationships between the parties.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In this case the relationship between the parties is contractual in the sense of the relationship of master-servant and fellow servant. And it is on that relationship and congressional awareness of the certainty of frequent and serious industrial injuries that it has mandated a structure in emphatic terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">L &amp; H is comprehensive. It has adjusted and rearranged the rights of maritime and other specifically covered workers. We could not hold that the L &amp; II merely cut off the remedy against the fellow employee and that since the amendment in 1959 there has subsisted a remedy-less right against the co-worker which had no utility until the passage of the Direct Action Statute and OCSLA with its surrogate out-reach. We think that the comprehensive scheme known as the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act is the <em>whole </em>source of rights and remedies.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>And in construing this Codal language we arrive at _ the same result as do the Louisiana courts. In Dandridge v. Fidelity and Casualty Co., La.App., 1939, 192 So. 887, the court faced the question of whether the defense of the employer granted by the workmen\u2019s compensation act was \u201cinherent in the nature of the obligation\u201d and thus could be asserted by the liability insurer. The Court of Appeal held that it could.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Unnecessary </em>\u2014 Hence <em>Inapplicable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In <em>Continental Oil Company, supra, </em>we held the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, note 1, <em>supra, </em>to be inapplicable to a collision between a vessel and a fixed platform on the outer continental shelf. On reasoning that since <em>Rodrigue </em>was stated not only in terms of applicable, meaning not inconsistent, but also in terms of applicable \u2014 meaning necessary to fill some gap in federal law \u2014 we ruled that the Direct Action Statute was unnecessary and hence inapplicable. Since that case was clearly a maritime claim under the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and the maritime law provided a comprehensive body of law including rights, remedies and procedures for their enforcement the Direct Action Statute was unnecessary as there was no gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Here there is no gap \u2014 not even a tiny one. L &amp; H is complete and self-sufficient. It affords specific rights by imposing specific responsibilities. In return for sometimes awesome obligations it extends to the employer and fellow employees an absolute civil immunity. Under a scheme of permissible underwriting of the employer\u2019s sweeping obligations \u2014 as directed by L &amp; H \u00a7 935\u2014 there is an effectuation of the congressional scheme. There is no need to impose outside state oriented obligations on the insurer \u2014 especially in a sophisticated world, that has to be aware that in the long run it is the employer who pays the fare.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">More than that, in this structure, to allow these claims would inevitably reflect on the employers claims loss record, thus, to permit enforcement of the Direct Action Statute would be inconsistent with federal law.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>Rodrigue </em>has made it clear that maritime principles are inapplicable to injuries occurring to oil workers on the Outer Continental Shelf. However, we have just as comprehensive a body of law to regulate the liabilities of those who injure oil workers as the court had in <em>Continental </em>to regulate collisions of ships with platforms. Clearly the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act is a complete body of law, a legislative island unto itself. There is no need to bring aboard the state Direct Action Statute to cause liability to be fixed where Congress never intended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">. The Louisiana Direct Action Statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">\u201cNo policy or contract of liability insurance shall be issued or delivered in this state, unless it contains provisions to the effect that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured shall not release the insurer from the payment of damages for injuries sustained or loss occasioned during the existence of the policy, and any judgment which may be rendered against the insured for which the insurer is liable which shall have become executory, shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the insolvency of the insured, and an action may thereafter be maintained within the terms and limits of the policy by the injured person, or his or her survivors mentioned in the Revised Civil Code Article 2315, or heirs against the insurer. The injured person or his or her survivors or heirs here-inabove referred to, at their option, shall have a right of direct action against the insurer within the terms and limits of the policy; and such action may be brought against the insurer alone, or against both the insured and insurer jointly and in solido, in the parish in which the accident or injury occurred or in the parish in which an action could be brought against either the insured or the insurer under the general rules of venue prescribed by Art. 42, Code of Civil Procedure.

But even though it is covered, the liability of the insurer is restricted to that afforded by the insurance contract, with only one exception of moment here \u2014the \u201cNo Action\u201d clauses are ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">For example, in Finn v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., La.App., 1962, 141 So.2d 852, 864, the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cNor do we find any merit in the contention that the direct-action statute created separate or distinct causes of action, one against the insurer alone and another against the insurer and the insured. The statute is remedial in character, rather than substantive, and does not create causes of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Similarly in Mock v. Maryland Casualty Co., La.App., 1942, 6 So.2d 199, 201-202, the Court declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u201cThe statute merely affords a remedy and permits a direct action not under any theory that by the contract of insurance any right is created in plaintiff against the insurer but merely on the ground that, by the tort, rights are created which are permitted to be asserted directly against the insurer of the party at fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">All of our cases sound the same note. We emphasize this in Ex Parte Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 113, 116:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">\u201cAnd we are now clear that the direct action insurer stands as a party-litigant in exactly the same shoes as the assured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">We phrased it this way in Degelos v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 809, 815:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">\u201cUnder the Direct Action Statute, the case may proceed against the insurer, but liability depends on legal liability of the assured. Whether, as the Act permits, the assured is joined with the insurer, the standard for recovery is identical.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b648-18\">. In Alcoa Steamship, <em>supra, </em>we said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-19\">\u201cWhatever else might be said by the protagonists about <em>Nebel Towing, </em>or what else it may portend, neither our holding therein that the statutory limi- \u201c tation of shipowner\u2019s liability is a defense personal to the assured shipowner nor the elucidation of it, transfers to a contractual limitation [here we might read in statutory limitation], contained in the agreement which is the principle (if not whole) source of rights and obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">443 F.2d at 253.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b648-21\">.

In the 1972 amendments to L &amp; H, note 30, <em>supra, </em>in prohibiting indemnity claims by vessel against stevedore though nominally against insurers, Congress recognized that <em>Ryan indemnities, </em>Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, 1956, 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133, 1956 A.M.C. 9, are paid by the employer-contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b649-15\">. AVe said in <em>Continental Oil </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-16\">\u201cOn such reading the necessity for state law (in the sense of a right being lost in its absence) is not the significant factor. State law becomes merely a matter of affording some gain or benefit or advantage not available if state law can not be invoked. Such a reading, of course, puts almost 100% emphasis on the \u201cnot inconsistent * * * with federal laws\u201d element of \u00a7 1333(a) (2)\u2014 a problem which the platform owners circumnavigate by not only moving the Louisiana law out to sea but moving the occurrence back into Louisiana as though it had taken place on inland waters. That is a lot of fictionalizing. And in more austere words it imputes to Congress the purpose generally to export the whole body of adjacent law onto the Outer Continental Shelf for automatic application to any and all occurrences <em>unless </em>\u2014 with the <em>unless </em>being limited to (a) specific provisions within the Act or (b) inconsistent federal law. By whatever characterization expressed, in determining what law is to govern, that approach accords initially a superiority to adjacent state law\u2014 the question of federal law comes into play only after this process excludes state law. This is hardly in keeping with the course of legislative history in which the notion of supremacy of state law administered by state agencies was expressly rejected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-19\">Keeping in mind that the tidelands controversy had deep political and emotional currents centered around the clash between national sovereignty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>states\u2019 rights \u2014 a dispute in which geography separated the adversaries as inland states sought compensating advantages to offset those claimed by coastal states as historically and exclusively theirs \u2014 the deliberate choice of federal law, federally administered, requires that \u201capplicable\u201d be read in terms of necessity \u2014 necessity to fill a significant void or gap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-16\">This is the recurring theme of <em>Rod-rigue. </em>Thus, early in the opinion the Court states since \u201cFederal law, because of its limited function in a federal system, might be inadequate to cope with the full range of potential legal problems, the Act supplemented <em>gaps </em>in the federal law with state law through the \u2018adoption of State law as the law of the United States\u2019.\u201d 335 U.S. at 357, 89 S.Ct. at 1838, 23 L.Ed. 2d at 365 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b650-32\">.
