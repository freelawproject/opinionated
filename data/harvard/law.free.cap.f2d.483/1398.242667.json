We need not review the facts inasmuch as they are carefully set forth in the Tax Court\u2019s Opinion, reported at 55 T.C. 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-22\">The rule is that assets such as those here involved must be shown to have a determinable useful life in order to qualify as depreciable property. Since the franchises originally acquired by the taxpayers were renewed, prior to their expiration on terms not grossly disparate to those embodied in the original franchise contracts, the Tax Court held that the taxpayers had not, and could not, establish that the original franchises had a determinable useful life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-23\">The critical issue in a case such as this is factual. The Tax Court based its critical findings upon a stipulation of the parties and extensive evidence, both documentary and testimonial. While we recognize that the issue was not capable of easy resol\u00fation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are not persuaded that the Tax Court\u2019s dispositive factual findings were without substantial evidentiary support and, thus, clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the Tax Court\u2019s decisions in' these eases should be, and they hereby are,</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1458-25\">.
