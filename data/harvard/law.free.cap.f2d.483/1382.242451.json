R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc. (Squibb), a major manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. The order also denied Squibb an evidentiary hearing before the FDA at which Squibb alleges it would produce substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of those drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-17\">Consideration of the appeal was deferred with the concurrence of the parties, pending resolution by the U.S. Supreme Court of Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (June 18, 1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An understanding of the bearing of <em>Hynson </em>on this case requires a brief explication of the procedures adopted for evaluating drugs offered for sale to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-18\">Prior to 1962, a company desiring to market a \u201cnew drug\u201d was required by statute to submit to the FDA evidence demonstrating that the drug was safe for its intended use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1962 the law was amended to insure that drugs sold would not only be safe but effective as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Manufacturers of drugs that had been marketed before 1962 were given a period of time, after which they were required to prove the effectiveness of the drugs or have their certifications withdrawn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The 1962 amendment directed that the NDA be revoked \u201cif \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 that the drug is effective for its intended use is lacking.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 355(d) of the statute defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-19\">\u201c. . . evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved. \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-22\">Faced with the necessity of reviewing the effectiveness of several thousand drugs that were on the market,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>FDA promulgated regulations providing for summary procedures for evaluating the drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The companies that manufacture the drugs in question were required to submit \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of effectiveness. To carry out the statute\u2019s instruction that the investigations were to be \u201cadequate and well-controlled,\u201d the FDA\u2019s regulations prescribed, with some specificity, the format and procedures to be followed in the studies submitted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A submission in conformity with the FDA\u2019s regulations was considered to establish a prima fa-cie showing of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d entitling a manufacturer to a hearing before the agency on the drug\u2019s asserted efficacy. Failure to conform to the standards was deemed to preclude a finding that there was substantial evidence, of effectiveness. Such a determination would result in the conclusion that there existed no disputed issue requiring a hearing, and the drug\u2019s approval would be withdrawn summarily by the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">Operating pursuant to these regulations, the FDA ordered manufacturers to furnish the studies required by \u00a7 355(d) and the FDA\u2019s regulations. In response, Hynson submitted evidence of effectiveness and moved for a hearing. The FDA held that Hynson\u2019s submission was inadequate and denied the requested hearing and sought to withdraw approval. Hynson challenged this denial, alleging that its submission met the standards entitling it to a hearing, and that in any event the regulations promulgated by the FDA were improper. The Supreme Court approved the FDA regulations, but held that Hynson\u2019s submission was sufficient to warrant a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">As to the assault on the FDA\u2019s regulations, the Supreme Court pointed out that the administrative summary judgment procedure created by the regulations, and the standards established to determine the propriety of such a judgment, constituted an appropriate administrative interpretation of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">The Supreme Court went on to state the role of a court of appeals in reviewing orders of the FDA refusing hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pAIr\">\u201cIn reviewing an order of the Commissioner [of the FDA] denying a hearing, a court of appeals must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings accurately reflect the study in question and if they do, whether the deficiencies he finds conclusively render the study inadequate or uncontrolled in light of the pertinent regulations.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">Squibb, like Hynson, made a submission to the FDA in support of a request for a hearing. Its request was rejected. The FDA\u2019s order denying the hearing cited shortcomings in the literature provided by Squibb to prove efficacy. To apply the standard of review articulated by the Supreme Court, we must determine the correctness of the FDA\u2019s findings that the deficiencies conclusively establish that the studies submitted by Squibb did not conform to the standards enunciated in the FDA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">The material found adequate in <em>Hynson </em>is not fully described in the opinion of the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, however, provides a somewhat more detailed description.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A comparison of the description of the evidence provided by Hynson with Squibb\u2019s submission indicates that, in some respects, the materials proffered may be similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>To fulfill the directive of the Supreme Court, this Court would have to determine \u201cwhether the deficiencies [found] conclusively render the [Squibb] study inadequate.\u201d The submission in <em>Hynson </em>appears to be a matrix, or a bench-mark, against which other submissions may be assayed. However, the <em>Hynson </em>study, and its alleged shortcomings, have not been presented to this Court. Moreover, both the <em>Hynson </em>study and its critique and the Squibb study and its critique appear to be couched in terms more familiar to a scientific organization than to a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">These factors suggest that satisfactory adjudication of this appeal mandates that a meaningful comparison be made between the <em>Hynson </em>study and the Squibb study. Only on the basis of such an analysis, or a comparable evaluation, can the order of the FDA be reviewed in a thoughtful and proper fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">In ordering the withdrawal of Squibb\u2019s products without a hearing, the FDA bottomed its action not only on an absence of substantial evidence of efficacy but also on a lack of \u201cadequate data demonstrating safety.\u201d In this respect the case differs from <em>Hynson </em>where the question of safety did not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-16\">To review the FDA\u2019s summary action based on considerations of safety, this Court must navigate in a relatively uncharted channel. The section of the regulations outlining the summary judgment procedure, 21 CFR \u00a7 130.14(b), by its language is not limited to dispositions based on efficacy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, the regulation dealing with withdrawal of NDAs, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.27, states clearly that the summary judgment procedure is available \u2014 implying that summary judgment is applicable for lack of effectiveness <em>or </em>lack of safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-17\">However, the statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the FDA\u2019s interpretive regulation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> appear to indicate that the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, as defined in the statute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> elaborated upon in the regulations,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and discussed in <em>Hynson, </em>is directed only to questions of efficacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-18\">A different standard seems to apply when questions of safety arise. The standard adopted both by the statute,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the regulation<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is not the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>The safety standard was not directly involved in <em>Hynson. </em>However, the FDA order here appealed from, dealt with both efficacy and safety and did not appear to shift standards when the inquiry moved from efficacy to safety. Because <em>Hynson </em>does indicate the necessity for a remand on the issue of efficacy, and because the standard applied to determine the propriety of summary judgment on the issue of safety has not been made clear by the FDA, remand for reconsideration of that question as well appears warranted.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">Before this Court may affirm an action taken by summary judgment, it must be certain that no genuine issues as to any material facts are in dispute, that no questions remain unanswered. This principle, applicable in all summary judgment procedures, would appear to gain content when applied to the present case. If a judicial tribunal harbors a doubt about any factual issue, it may not approve a disposition by summary judgment. The information before the Court, because of the highly esoteric and scientific terms employed, does not afford us a satisfactory basis on which to affirm or reverse the FDA\u2019s summary order. Rather, the record would appear to demand amplification and clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">Accordingly, this case is remanded to the FDA to measure the Squibb submission against the <em>Hynson </em>submission, to apply an articulated standard on issues of safety, and to take whatever further action, if any, such proceedings dictate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1443-10\">.

This Court recognizes that a finding that the drug is either unsafe or ineffective will result in the drug\u2019s removal from the market. Thus, a remand for a determination of the propriety of summary judgment on efficacy, and a finding of ineffectiveness, may well moot questions of safety. The reverse is, of course, also the case. Nonetheless, a reconsideration of the summary disposition of this matter would appear to be a sounder course.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
