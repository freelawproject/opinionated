Appellant, Affiliated Food Distributors, Inc. (\u201cAffiliated\u201d) brought this action pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185 (1965). On motion of the appellee, Local Union No. 229, the district court ordered a stay of the action pending arbitration. Affiliated appealed from this interlocutory order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and urges that the. collective bargaining agreement between the parties does not require arbitration of its damage claim. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> There is a clear congressional policy favoring private, extra-judicial resolution of labor-management disputes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In furtherance of this policy, the Supreme Court of the United States issued the following mandate in United Steel Workers of America v. Warrior and Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960):</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">An order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">However, even in the presence of this clear congressional policy, it remains the rule that parties are bound to arbitrate only those disputes which, under a fair construction of their collective bargaining agreement, they have bound themselves to arbitrate. As the Supreme Court noted in Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 241, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 1320, 8 L.Ed.2d 462 (1962) :</p>\n<p id=\"Az_\">Under our decisions, whether or not the company was bound to arbitrate, as well as what issues it must arbitrate, is a matter to be determined by the Court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties. . \u201c [Arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">At the heart of this matter, therefore, is the intention of the parties when they negotiated and signed their collective bargaining agreement. The parties chose the following words to evidence their agreement regarding arbitration:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">Article XXIII \u2014 Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">Any difference, grievance, or dispute between the Company and the Union arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, or its interpretation or application, or the enforcement thereof, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be subject to the following procedure:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">A. Any grievance which arises may be taken up by the Union Steward (s) with a representative of the department involved, or with an official of the Company. Grievances must be presented in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">B. In the event that the grievance should not have been resolved within three (3) working days, the Business Representative of the Union shall take the subject matter up with the Employer. If the Business Representative of the Union and the Employer cannot reach a satisfactory agreement within three (3) working days, the subject matter shall be referred to arbitration immediately. The arbitrator may be selected by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. If no agreement is reached on the selection of the arbitrator within five (5) days, the arbitrator shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>be selected from a panel of the American Arbitration Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It is to be clearly understood that the Arbitrator shall not have the power to alter any of the terms of the Agreement. Decisions of the Arbitration Board shall be final and binding on both parties. Pending the decision of the Arbitration Board, the Union will not permit any strikes or interferences with the regular routine of business. The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties to this Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The court below observed that \u201cthe preamble clause in and of itself is broad enough to cover the issue of whether there was a violation of the no-strike clause.\u201d It then noted Affiliated\u2019s contention that \u201cthe procedure through which \u2018any difference, grievance or dispute\u2019 must pass provides only for the initiation of Union grievances.\u201d The district court concluded, however, that the contract provisions relating to procedure did not \u201csupply the \u2018positive assurance\u2019 requisite to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to stay.\u201d It held:</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">After careful study of the arbitration clause presented here as well as the cases which have attempted to interpret similar clauses, we are unable to ascertain the true intent of the parties and therefore hold that since it is not certain that the company\u2019s claim for damages resulting from a violation of the no-strike clause is not subject to arbitration, the Union\u2019s motion to stay must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The principle that doubt should be resolved in favor of arbitration does not relieve a court of the responsibility of applying traditional principles of contract interpretation in an effort to ascertain the intention of the contracting parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When a contract, fairly read with these principles in mind, is susceptible of a construction that dictates arbitration, the congressional policy favoring that form of dispute resolution may require the denial of judicial relief despite the possibility of fairly reading the contract to evidence a contrary intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, there is no occasion to resort to this congressional policy in a case where the contract, fairly read as a whole, is not susceptible of a construction that the parties bound themselves to arbitrate the dispute before the court. We conclude that this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">It is, of course, well, established that contract language must be read in context and that \u201ca subsequent specification impliedly limits the meaning of a preceding generalization.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A careful reading of this agreement and an application of these principles to it, lead us to the firm conviction that the parties bound themselves to arbitrate only employee grievances. Article XXIII does not state that \u201cany difference, grievance or dispute arising out of, or relating to this agreement, or its interpretation or application or the enforcement thereof\u201d shall be the subject of arbitration. Rather it provides that any such difference, grievance or dispute \u201cshall be subject to the following procedure.\u201d The procedure that follows, as articulated in paragraphs A and B can fairly be read only as applying to employee grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">These paragraphs specify three successive steps in an arbitration process. \u201cThe grievance\u201d referred to in the first sentence of paragraph B must be the written grievance presented pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>paragraph A and the third party-arbitrator provisions of the second sentence of paragraph B, read in context, must refer to grievances unresolved after the two preceding steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Initially, any grievance \u201cmay be taken up by the Union Steward(s) with a representative of the department involved, or with an official of the Company.\u201d At the second stage, \u201cthe Business Representative of the Union shall take the subject matter up with the Employer.\u201d Thus, at both stages the initiative is with the union. It would be a strained construction at best which would attribute to the parties the thought that a company official would refer an <em>employer\u2019s </em>grievance to a union steward who would, in turn, refer the grievance to \u201ca representative of the department involved\u201d or to \u201can official of the com-, pany\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In short, we think it may be said with positive assurance, as in <em>Atkinson, </em>that the arbitration clause of this collective bargaining agreement is not susceptible of a fair construction that the parties bound themselves to arbitrate employer grievances of the kind here involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The order of the district court granting appellee\u2019s motion to stay will be vacated and this case will be remanded for further proceeding consistent with the views we have here expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-18\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 171 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">.

Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the application of that mandate to the present case compels this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">The district court, confronted with the employer\u2019s suit seeking damages from the union for violation of a no-strike clause, stayed that action pending arbitration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority, holding that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement did not require the employer to submit its claim to arbitration, reversed the district court. I believe that the collective bargaining agreement, read with the admonitions of <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>firmly in mind, requires that this dispute be submitted to arbitration. Therefore, I would affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">As the majority points out, the arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement controls the determination whether or not a particular type of dispute is to be arbitrated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Explicit language in the agreement committing a question to arbitration or withholding it from arbitration is determinative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is in the absence of such specificity that problems arise. Such is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\"><em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>states the Supreme Court\u2019s basic understanding of Congress\u2019 philosophy in favor of resolution of disputes through the machinery of arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">To achieve the Congressionally required end, the Supreme Court has promulgated strict rules for the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tion of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cApart from matters that the parties <em>specifically exclude, </em>all of the questions on which the parties disagree must therefore come within the scope of the grievance and arbitration provisions of the collective agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201cAn order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied <em>unless it may be said with positive assurance </em>that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cIn the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think <em>only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude </em>the claim from arbitration can prevail, particularly where, as here, the exclusion clause is vague and the arbitration clause quite broad.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Rules of contract construction applicable in a normal commercial context are to be eschewed in the interpretation of the arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">It is against these dictates of <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>that the arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement in issue must be measured. First, Article XXIII is titled \u201cArbitration,\u201d not \u201cGrievance Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, the preamble of Article XXIII, by its terms, includes \u201cAny difference, grievance, or dispute between the Company and the Union. .\u201d However, as the majority points out, the procedures outlined in paragraphs A and B of Article XXIII appear to be directed towards the resolution of employee grievances. Applying \u201ctraditional principles of contract interpretation,\u201d the majority concludes that the presence of the detailed procedure gives \u201cpositive assurance\u201d that the arbitration clause \u201cis not susceptible to a fair construction that the parties bound themselves to arbitrate employer grievances of the kind here involved.\u201d I do not believe that <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>states that such a construction is dispositive. Rather, it appears to command that the arbitration clause be \u201cnot susceptible of <em>an </em>interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added). The clause in question here, I believe, is susceptible to <em>an </em>interpretation that would cover the matter in dispute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement, only employee grievances would be included within the arbitration process. This would exclude all differences, grievances and disputes raised by the employer. Yet, these items are explicitly included in the arbitration Article. Such a combined construction would appear to be a limitation on the arbitration article arguably not warranted by the language of the Article. Indeed, the thrust of the preamble, as well as its specific language, indicates a more spacious role for arbitration. While the majority\u2019s interpretation might be the better one were ordinary rules of contractual construction applicable, the teachings of <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>require that if an ambiguity exists, and I believe that there is such an ambiguity, the clause must be interpreted to remit the parties to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Analysis of cases dealing with the question of the sweep of an arbitration clause reveals that there are available to drafters of \u2019 collective bargaining agreements an apparently limitless variety of combinations of headings, inclusions, exclusions and procedures. Detailed disr cussion of these cases is not fruitful in connection with our problem. Similarities to the present case and differences from the present case can be found in opinions holding that questions are within the arbitration clause and those holding that a question is without.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The conclusion that may properly be drawn is that each arbitration clause must be examined independently, with the mandates of <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>firmly in mind. Having done this, I believe that the issue raised in the district court is within the scope of the arbitration article of the collective bargaining agreement present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-12\">.
