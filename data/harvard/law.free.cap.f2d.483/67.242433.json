However, Savage\u2019s court-appointed counsel failed to file a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court after we affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, United States v. Savage, 459 F. 2d 60 (5th Cir., 1972), despite the fact that it now appears his counsel promised Savage that this would be done.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">In a recent case very similar on its facts, we took action to accord the appellants their right to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari. Lacaze v. United States, 457 F.2d 1075 (5th Cir. 1972). That is what we now do in this case by recalling our mandate in Savage\u2019s direct criminal appeal cited above and by simultaneously issuing a new mandate reaffirming our prior affirmance of the judgment of conviction. Appellant Savage is hereby advised of his renewed right to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari to review this Court\u2019s affirmance of his direct appeal. Since the appellant has proceeded without counsel in this <em>forma pauperis </em>appeal, we also appoint counsel to assist him in prosecuting his application for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">The original judgment of this Court on direct appeal is vacated and a new judgment is entered reaffirming the judgment of conviction, and counsel is appointed for the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-12\">. The Appellant attached to his brief a Xerox copy of a letter addressed to him from his court-appointed counsel to this effect, in support of the allegation made in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
