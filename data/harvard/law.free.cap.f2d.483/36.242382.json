Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 431 F.2d 409, Part I (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b96-26\">Defendant was convicted by a jury on a charge of receiving, concealing, and storing stolen property, the property having been transported in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315. The property consisted of eleven antique firearms, stolen in Texas, and possessed by defendant in Georgia. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-27\">The evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict under the standard of Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1940), which requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-28\">The court\u2019s charge as to the inference of knowledge that might be drawn from the unexplained possession of recently stolen property was proper. United States v. Gordon, 421 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1970); Hale v. United States, 410 F.2d 147 (5th Cir. 1969); Thur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>mond v. United States, 377 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1967). Although the defendant argues that this is a judicially-created \u201cinference without legislative investigation and determination of its factual basis,\u201d relying on the reasoning in Commonwealth v. Owens, 441 Pa. 318, 271 A.2d 230 (1970), and United States v. Rispo, 338 F.Supp. 662 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>cf. </em>United States v. Taylor, 334 F.Supp. 1050 (E.D.Pa.1971), the Supreme Court has recently sustained such a charge against constitutional attack. Barnes v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 [1973]. Thus, United States v. Cameron, 460 F.2d 1394 (5th Cir. 1972), has been devitalized as a contrary precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In any event, the defendant continued to possess the guns for a month after he was advised by a gun dealer that they were stolen, which would furnish a sufficient evidentiary base for the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">A review of the record reveals that any error that may have occurred in the district attorney\u2019s final argument was cured by proper instructions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
