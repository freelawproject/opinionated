The complaint rests on an assertion of denial of procedural due process. But even read through rosy Conley<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> glasses it makes no serious factual contention that as a probationary teacher<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he had such expectancy of re-employment as to entitle him to these safeguards for reemployment under the <em>Roth-Sindermann </em>principle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\">.
