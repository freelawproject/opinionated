Giordano v. Stubbs, N.D.Ga. 1971, 335 F.Supp. 110; Giordano v. Stubbs, N.D.Ga.1973, 356 F.Supp. 1041. Judge Edenfield\u2019s rulings were supported by able and thorough opinions in which he meticulously traced the circuitous procedural progress of the case and the difficult questions of state procedure. Any further discussion by this Court was rendered superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">Confining our holding strictly to the doctrines of res judicata and full faith and credit, we hold that the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court in Giordano v. Stubbs, 1971, 228 Ga. 75, 184 S.E.2d 165 (appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction; treating the appeal as petition for certiorari, certiorari denied 1972, 405 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 960, 30 L.Ed.2d 779), and the entry by the DeKalb County Superior Court of an order making the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court the judgment of the Superior Court, prevent the federal courts from deciding the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. On those issues we agree with and adopt Judge Edenfield\u2019s reasoning. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"afl-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
