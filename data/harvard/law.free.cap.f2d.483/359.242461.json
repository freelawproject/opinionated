A suspended five year confinement sentence, followed by a two year term on special parole was imposed as to Count Two. We reverse because the trial judge took over the prosecution to an extent preventing a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In essential particulars this case is governed by our decision in United States v. Lanham, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 1140. <em>Lanham </em>involved a charge under the Dyer Act, Title 18 U.S.C. Section 2312, of interstate transportation into Texas of a stolen Volkswagen which had disappeared without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent from the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Proof of the defendant\u2019s possession of the stolen car was based on its being found on a parking lot in Houston a day or so after it vanished in New Orleans. <em>Lanham </em>and a co-defendant, Larson, were arrested shortly thereafter in a white Volkswagen in Terrell County, Texas. ' The white VW in turn had been stolen from the Houston parking lot where the red VW was found. At <em>Lan-ham\u2019s </em>separate trial both he and Larson testified that they had hitch-hiked to Houston in a black Ford with a Mr. Wilson, and were also hitch-hikers in the white VW. They disclaimed connection with the red VW.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">We reversed because the \u201ctrial judge improperly injected himself into the trial below in such manner and to such extent as to deny the appellant a fair and impartial trial,\u201d citing specifically Gomila v. United States, 5 Cir. 1944, 146 F.2d 372; Hunter v. United States, 5 Cir. 1932, 62 F.2d 217, and Adler v. United States, 5 Cir. 1910, 182 F. 464; and generally 23 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 987, p. 996; Bollenbach v. United States, 1946, 326 U.S. 607, 612, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350, 354; Starr v. United States, 1894, 153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841; United States v. Link, 3 Cir. 1953, 202 F.2d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">The extent to which the trial judge took over the prosecution in Lanham was shown by actual count of the questions asked Larson and Lanham <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by defense counsel, prosecutor, and judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Despite court-appointed counsel\u2019s failure to object in <em>Lanham, </em>we found that \u201cplain error\u201d, Rule 52(a), F.R.Crim.P. had occurred and reversed saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">\u201c * * * The impartial trial atmosphere, the \u2018cold neutrality of an impartial judge\u2019, the defendant Lan-ham\u2019s credibility, his presumption of innocence, and any chance whether guilty or innocent, that he had of a successful defense, all were demolished, along with his Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of his liberty without due process of law.\u201d * # *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">The situation here presents a close parallel. to <em>Lanham </em>with the addition that, as noted infra, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>twice preserved the point by objection to the court\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Hoker was stopped for inspection at the International Bridge in Laredo, Texas on September 16, 1972 travelling in a 1955 green Chevrolet pick-up truck with Texas plates. The Quarantine Inspector who initially halted Hoker called in U.S. Customs Inspector McManus, who advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At that point, Hoker said, according to the agent present, \u201cInspector, you are going to search my vehicle. If you find any hard stuff in that vehicle will it go harder with me than if they just find plain weed in it?\u201d. The truck contained six concealed compartments under its fenders and body, from which the 446 pounds of marijuana were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The appellant denied knowledge of the presence of the marijuana in the truck, both to Customs agents and at trial. His defense was that a chance acquaintance in a bar in Nuevo Laredo on the Mexican side offered him two hundred dollars to drive the truck to Houston. As his funds were low and he had no job, he accepted the offer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Whether Hoker\u2019s constructive possession of the marijuana was knowing and intentional with intent to distribute was the key issue before, the jury as to Count One. His possession, since he was alone and driving the truck, was not subject to dispute. As to Count Two, the importation count, inasmuch as he was seen driving the truck across the International Bridge and was in sole control of the truck, the central jury issue was whether or not the importation of the marijuana from Mexico was done knowingly and intentionally. Hoker\u2019s credibility and the reasonableness of his testimony were thus pivotal to his attempt to defend against both charges. Guilty knowledge and intent were the only issues present.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">Following 70 questions to Hoker by his counsel and 238 questions on detailed and tortuous cross-examination by the prosecuting attorney, the trial judge entered the fray with 79 searching questions of his own, in addition to seven or eight clarifying questions from the court during the government\u2019s cross-examination. Midway in this examination, Hoker\u2019s counsel objected, and was summarily overruled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">The only witnesses called by the defense, all of whom appeared on the stand before he did, were Hoker\u2019s mother, Manual Martinez, who testified as to his former ownership of the truck and its sale to a man named Sam Perez, and Miss Garcia, a customs employee who had had custody of the truck and its parts. Mrs. Hoker corroborated her son\u2019s testimony as to his age, his employment since finishing high school, and the fact that he had left Houston on September 15, 1972 as a hitch-hiker. Her testimony preceded that of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">After the defense rested, the government proceeded to call two rebuttal witnesses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the principal one being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>night clerk of the El Rio Motel in Nuevo Laredo, where Hoker had testified he was registered in Room 128 on September 14, and again on September 15. This witness, Adolfo Fonseca, had some language difficulties. He testified in part without an interpreter and in part through an interpreter. He produced first a daily combined registration record from the motel which failed to show Hoker registered in Room 128 on September 14 at all. It was registered to Miguel Rasc\u00f3n. Hal Sparks of Houston was in Room 132, and several other young men were in adjoining rooms, all from Houston. Neither was the appellant registered for the 15th.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">When Fonseca\u2019s examination ended, the prosecuting attorney, still on rebuttal, called the appellant as a witness \u201cfor further cross-examination.\u201d Permission for this procedure was not sought and its propriety was not questioned by the court or by defense counsel. 67 questions were put to the appellant by the prosecutor, probing the discrepancies between Hoker\u2019s original testimony and that of Fonseca, and establishing appellant\u2019s prior acquaintance with Sparks and his arrival at the motel with Sparks, among other matters. The trial judge again took over the inquisition for 47 questions before defense counsel interposed an unavailing objection. The objection and the ruling are set forth in the margin along with the court\u2019s examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8a\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Following the objection, the court\u2019s examination of Hoker proceeded for an-</p>\n<p id=\"ADo\">other 27 questions as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Six questions by the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tor followed and Hoker\u2019s counsel was then permitted to attempt his rehabilitation in \u201credirect examination\u201d consisting of 21 questions. The appellant related that he and Sparks were both Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, acquainted through church activities, and that since Sparks was in no way involved in the marijuana offenses, he was reluctant to bring Sparks\u2019 name into his earlier testimony. At this point the jury was excused and the trial judge afforded defense counsel ah opportunity to expand his objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cTHE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">Now you may take any exceptions you wish to my interrogating the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">MR. TATUM (defense counsel):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">I have nothing for the record, and I want the court to know that I have no disrespect, but it is a tremendous disadvantage to the defendant when there is no opportunity to make objections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-30\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-31\">I think you know that you have objections. <em>I tried to ask innocuous questions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-32\">MR. TATUM:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-33\">I do want to place a standing objection to continued interrogation by the court to which the defense\u2019 may not have ample opportunity to object. We feel that it does bias the jury and there is no cure for it. Respectfully submitted.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-34\">The brief of the United States, at page 5, in comparing this case with <em>Lan-ham, </em>asserts: \u201cIn the case at bar, the court asked Hoker only 51 questions as opposed to the 94 asked by defense counsel and 313 asked by the prosecutor. No other witness was examined by the court and the court called no witnesses of its own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-35\">This statement is incorrect in every particular save its assertion that the court called no witnesses of its own. The number of questions of the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>lant asked by the court was 153, by our count, not 51, although there may be some mis-attribution by the court reporter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The tenor of the court\u2019s questions rather than their bare number is the more important factor. One would be hard put to conceive a more inaccurate or inapt characterization than the trial judge\u2019s reference to his questions as <em>innocuous, </em>(quoted, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As we said in Hunter v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cThe assignments of error based on the district judge\u2019s cross-examination of appellant are in our opinion well taken. While that method of cross-examination, if it had been conducted by the district attorney, might have been proper, a district judge ought never to assume the role of a prosecuting attorney and lend the weight of his great influence to the side of the government. It is the judge\u2019s duty to .maintain an attitude of unswerving impartiality between the government and the accused, and he ought never in any questions he asks go beyond the point of seeing to it, in the interests of justice, that the case is fairly tried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The exact number of questions by the defense counsel and by the assistant U. S. Attorney prosecuting is less significant, but here again we do not find record support for the figures given by the brief of the United States of 94 questions by defense counsel and 313 by the government attorney. Our count is respectively 91 and 411 questions. Further, mainly for clarification of their testimony, the court interrogated briefly several other witnesses, both government and defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">But the brief and cursory questions put to other witnesses tended the more strongly to emphasize to the jury that the judge\u2019s concern with credibility, indeed his expressed doubts as to credibility, were limited to the defendant. This refutes the comment in the government brief at page 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\"><em>\u201cIn </em>Hunter v. United States, 62 F.2d 217 (C.A. 5, 1932), this court found reversible error in <em>the trial judge\u2019s severe cross-examination of the defendant </em>and his lengthy comments on defendant\u2019s credibility without comments on the credibility of the state\u2019s witness. Such one-sidedness was not present in the case at bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Further parallel exists between this case and <em>Hunter </em>in that in the present case also the charge to the jury centered on Hoker\u2019s credibility without questioning that of the government witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>What we noted in <em>Hunter, </em>supra, applies with equal force to the situation in the trial below:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cThe judge\u2019s charge was not as objectionable as was his cross-examination of appellant, but it was erroneous in that it was one sided, and placed undue emphasis on the testimony of appellant which the judge himself had brought out by his questions. If the trial judge com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ments on the evidence, as he has a right to do so, he should call attention to the evidence in favor of as well as that against the accused. O\u2019Shaughnessy v. United States (C.C.A.Ala.) 17 F.2d 225. That the district judge did not intend to be unfair is beside the question. The case was tried in such a way that the jury, in considering as a whole the judge\u2019s questions and charge, might well have reached the conclusion that he was not impartial, but was insisting upon a conviction. It is vastly more important that the attitude of the trial judge should be impartial than that any particular defendant, however guilty he may be, should be convicted. It is too much to expect of human nature that a judge can actively and vigorously aid in the prosecution and at the same time appear to the layman on the jury to be impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We think we have written enough to reflect our conclusion that the trial judge formed an opinion that the appellant was lying and set out to demonstrate that this was so. The position of a trial judge carries such overpowering weight before a jury that we can not be certain that the verdict was that of the jury uninfluenced by a desire to bring in a verdict calculated to please the judge. No amount of boiler plate instructions to the jury \u2014 not to draw any inferences as to the judge\u2019s feelings about the facts from his asking questions, or that they are free to disregard factual comment by the judge, or as to the presumption of innocence \u2014 could be expected to erase from a jury\u2019s mind the part taken in this trial by the district judge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hoker is entitled to be retried in an atmosphere where the impartial neutrality of the presiding judge is not open to serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">As to the further issue appellant raised on appeal, the trial judge\u2019s refusal either to permit defense counsel to question the prospective jurors with reference to prior service in criminal cases, or to propound such questions himself, we suggest simply that the voir dire examination was rather severely restricted, and that more latitude should be allowed upon retrial. This point standing alone would probably not rise to the lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>el of reversible error, and requires no discussion in this opinion. The exact situation presented is unlikely to recur in the trial of this or another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-1\">. Title 21, U.S.C.

As to the witness Larson, Lanham\u2019s counsel asked him 36 questions on direct, the prosecuting attorney asked 55 questions on cross-examination, whereupon the trial judge asked 119 questions in a probing, searching, type of examination. The defendant Lanham received the same treatment. His counsel asked him 23 questions, the government attorney 17 questions, and the trial judge followed with 66 questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Unlike what happened in the case at bar, the trial judge examined an FBI agent extensively and also called in rebuttal as a court witness, Louis Teal, a co-inmate of Lanham and Larson in the Harris County Rehabilitation Center, the thrust of whose testimony was to impeach the defendant Lanham by statements allegedly made to him at the Center. But this simply added fuel to the fire. The crucial judicial conduct requiring reversal was the close and extended court cross-examination of Lanham and Larson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">.

Later, on further cross-examination by defense counsel, after the extended examination of Hoker related infra, Fonseca brought into court the actual registration cards for Room 128, Room 132, and adjoining rooms for September 13 through September 16. The card for Room 132 showed Hoker\u2019s name added for September 14 as an additional occupant to Sparks\u2019. But Hoker\u2019s presence in the motel on the night of September 15 was not indicated by any registration record.

I figured that he put my name on the registration slip. But it is definitely, I signed it on the 15th, I definitely signed it, because he wasn\u2019t there.

Such confusion was eminently possible. The questions of both court and government attorney were marked by similar prosecutorial zeal, and often as well by thinly veiled intimation of disbelief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">. At one point in the cross-examination of Mr. McManus, the U.S. Customs Inspector, a question was propounded regarding a conversation with Martinez, who reportedly said he had formerly owned the Chevrolet truck and sold it to a man in Dallas: \u201cDid he tell you the man\u2019s name?\u201d The court interrupted to inquire of government counsel, \u201cAre you going to object to hearsay, Mr. District Attorney?\u201d, but was told that the testimony was not objectionable to the government. This incident, perhaps trivial in itself, indicates a degree of court willingness to intercede in the conduct of a trial ordinarily not manifested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b426-16\">. The jury instructions, insofar as they touched on the testimony, were as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-17\">\u201cNow, what are the facts in the case? You heard it all yesterday afternoon and today elicited from the witnesses by the lawyers, and I do not purport to dwell on it at length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-18\">The government\u2019s case tends to show that the young man came across the bridge in an old, 17 or 18-year-old vehicle, alone, no luggage. The inspector at the primary station where he asked \u2018are you an American Citizen, what are you bringing from Mexico\u2019, almost immediately became'suspicious and referred the vehicle to secondary. The young man was examined. Nothing was found in his pockets or in his personal effects\u2014 no contraband, I mean. But it was apparent that the vehicle had at least one or more secret compartments. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>put it up on a hoist or lift and took it apart and the evidence shows six secret compartments loaded with marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">The young man, when he learns that the (192) vehicle is to be dismantled or carefully searched, states or asks of the customs officer there, as I understood his testimony, \u2018Will it go harder for me if they find hard stuff in there than if it is only grass?\u2019 or possibly \u201cWeed\u201d was the word. He did not use \u201cMarijuana\u201d as I recall it, but if it is just grass or just weed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">He denied any knowledge of the contraband in the vehicle. He has testified in his own behalf as a witness. Briefly, his testimony, as I recall it, was that he is a young man who had a good job and worked for a good company in Houston. He left of his own accord and before going back to work in a new position, he decided to take a vacation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">When interrogated as to why a young man of that age would take a vacation of this sort alone, wouldn\u2019t it have been more fun if he had a friend or buddy to accompany him, his answer was that this roommate got married and the defendant decided to come down by himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">He hitchhiked, he brought no luggage except one T-shirt. He hitched a couple or three rides and got to Laredo. He walked most of the way, I believe he said, from the highway intersections north of the city down to the bridge, paid his fare (193) and walked across the bridge and walked a quarter or half-mile south where he again was hitchhiking and purely by coincidence and accident the man that picked him up was a man from Houston whom he had gone to church with and apparently knew fairly well, at least from that source. They go to the motel and take a room. There has been much argument from the lawyers as to whether or not the defendant testified truthfully and accurately about his registration and when he registered and what room he was in and if he tried to secret the fact that this friend was with him and if so, why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">All of which I leave to you in your own weighing and consideration of your testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">In any event, he is caught at the bridge, his reason or his explanation was that he had met a stranger in the bar the second night, as I recall it. The acquaintance came about simply because they were sitting at the same table having drinks and the defendant commented that he was about out of money and the friend said, T will give you a job, you can make $200. I have a truck I want driven to Houston.\u2019 Without further discussion or inquiry, as I understood it, they made a deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">So, as I see the evidence, the real question for you ladies and gentlemen to decide is (194) that of knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">Without in any way undertaking to tell you what you should determine, it seems to me you might consider first whether any portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony about the trip is accurate, whether perhaps he may have come down with Sparks with the express purpose of bringing back a load of marijuana, whether his luggage may not have been in Sparks\u2019 car the whole time and that is why it was not with him when he was caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">Second, is his testimony accurate insofar as the method of his coming, meeting the stranger in the bar and if so, whether circumstances surrounding the arrangement for the defendant to drive the truck back, were they such that he must have known in his heart that he was bringing contraband back across the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-18\">On the other hand, is his testimony true that he had no knowledge and that the circumstances were not such that he actually knew in his heart that he was doing anything wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-19\">I instruct you that knowledge in the sense that I have defined it to you is an essential element. The government must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. If you have a reasonable doubt, (195) you should acquit. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did what he did, driving the truck with the marijuana in it, and that this was done knowingly and intentionally and that he had it in his possession with the intent to distribute it knowingly and intentionally, if you so find beyond a reasonable doubt, then it would be your duty to convict.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">. We reproduce the court\u2019s jury instructions in these respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In this court, I should tell you, too, that the judge is permitted, if he elects to do so, to comment upon the evidence, by that, I mean I am allowed to tell you what I think about the witnesses (185) or their credibility or what I think the facts are, or even to tell you what verdict I think you should return.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">I have no expectation of doing that, but I instruct you now, that if from the course of my remarks, you draw some feeling as to my own \u2014 you draw some conclusions or inferences as to my feelings about the facts of the case,</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">I do not intend it as an effort to tell you or to direct you as to what your verdict should be. Anything I say about the facts or about the credibility of the witnesses is intended only to be of help to you in your consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">It is not binding on you in any respect, and you are at perfect liberty to disregard anything I say about the facts or the witnesses or their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The law of the case you will take from the Court\u2019s Charge and be governed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">Ineidentally, and in connection with that same matter, I will instruct you that in the course of the examination of the witnesses I have seen fit to ask certain questions of certain witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">I do that on occasion when I think that certain matters need to be further explored, in areas that perhaps the lawyers have not touched. You should not draw any inference or conclusion about my feelings about the facts of the case because I chose to ask certain (186) questions of witnesses. But you should simply consider the answers made in the light of any other answers made and give the testimony of that witness in that regard such credit as you think it is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">Now, this defendant, ladies and gentlemen, as is true of every defendant brought to trial in this court, is presumed at the outset to be innocent. The defendant starts off with a clean slate, and by pleading not guilty as he has done here, has imposed upon the government the burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-16\">In another setting, these charges would be unobj ectionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
