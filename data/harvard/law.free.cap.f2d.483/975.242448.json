We hold that the debtor constructively possessed the fund when it filed its bankruptcy petition and thus that the bankruptcy court had summary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">United General Wood Products Corporation, the debtor, factored its accounts with Trans-West Factors (\u201cTrans-West\u201d). In June 1969, it recorded a financing statement evidencing Kalof Aluminum Company\u2019s (\u201cKalof\u201d) security interest in the accounts. Two months later the debtor authorized Trans-West to pay Kalof the proceeds of the receivables. In October 1969, when the balance of the proceeds was $2303.28, the Government, to whom the debtor owed taxes, served notice of levy on Trans-West. The debtor filed its voluntary bankruptcy petition on December 12, 1969. The trustee instituted a turnover proceeding to recover the fund. Over the Government\u2019s protest, the referee exercised summary jurisdiction and, after a hearing, held that the Government\u2019s interest in the fund was subordinate to the trustee\u2019s. Kalof did not protest the proceedings. Trans-West at all times was solely a stakeholder. The district court did not reach the merits because it decided that the referee erred in asserting summary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The bankruptcy court had summary jurisdiction if United General had constructive possession of the fund when it filed its bankruptcy petition. (Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co. (1940) 309 U.S. 478, 60 S.Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed. 876; <em>see </em>Engelbrecht v. Wildman (9th Cir. 1959) 268 F.2d 133, 134.) Constructive possession \u201cexists where the property was in the physical possession of the debtor at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, but was not delivered by him to the trustee; where the property was delivered to the trustee, but was thereafter wrongfully withdrawn from his custody; where the property \u2022 is in the hands of the bankrupt\u2019s agent or bailee; <em>where the property is held by some other person who makes no claim to it; </em>and where the property is held by one who makes a claim, but the claim is colorable only.\u201d (Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox (1924) 264 U.S. 426, 432-433, 44 S.Ct. 396, 398, 68 L.Ed. 770 (Brandeis, J.). Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">The case falls squarely within the italicized language of Taubel, because Trans-West, which had actual possession of the fund when the debtor filed its petition, made no claim whatever to the fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the bankruptcy court had summary jurisdiction to adjudicate the conflicting claims to the fund. <em>{Accord, </em>2 Collier, Bankruptcy 505 (14th ed. 1972).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">The Government\u2019s contentions to the contrary are that the debtor\u2019s constructive possession was destroyed either by its assignment to Kalof or by the Government\u2019s notice of levy. Neither argument is sound. For jurisdictional purposes, a debtor constructively possesses an asset in which he has any colorable interest when the person in actual possession does not himself assert any interest in it. Claims of third persons to the same asset are irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">The Government attempts to escape the impact of <em>Taubel </em>by creating its own fiction that either the assignment to Kalof or its notice of levy transferred the debtor\u2019s, interest to those creditors. No actual transfer ever took place. We are bound by <em>Taubel, </em>and we refuse to substitute the Government\u2019s fiction for the Supreme Court\u2019s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Cf. </em>In re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Brewster-Raymond Co. (6th Cir. 1965) 344 F.2d 903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The Government\u2019s alternative fiction is that service of its notice of levy reduced the fund to its possession by operation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331, Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Section 6331 must be stretched beyond its elasticity to reach the Government\u2019s result. But even if we could read it the Government\u2019s way, we would reject the argument because we adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s admonishment against transferring tax fictions into bankruptcy cases. <em>(See </em>United States v. Randall (1971) 401 U.S. 513, 91 S.Ct. 991, 28 L.Ed.2d 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The creation of legal fictions is not a sport for the unwary. The pastime should be steadfastly avoided when the result is, as here, to fragment and to delay the administration of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">. Thompson v. Dachner (9th Cir. 1954) 214 F.2d 922 and Goggin v. Consolidated Liquidating Corp. (9th Cir. 1951) 190 F.2d 553 are not in point because the actual possessors of the assets asserted claims against the assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">. The Government\u2019s reliance on San Fernando Restaurants, Inc. (S.D.Cal.1964) 236 F. Supp. 777; Rosenblum v. United States (1st Cir. 1962) 300 F.2d 843, and United States v. Eiland (4th Cir. 1955) 223 F.2d 118 is misplaced. None of them involves the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">To the extent that the broad language of <em>San Fernando Restaurants, Ine., </em>implies that a fictional transfer affects the jurisdictional determination, we disapprove the implication.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
