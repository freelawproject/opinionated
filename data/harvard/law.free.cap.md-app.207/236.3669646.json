On December 20, 2010, Crippen filed a Motion for a New Trial, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-331,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which did not contain any grounds for the motion, but included a request that the court hold the motion <em>sub curia </em>until a written brief could be filed. On March 15, 2011, Crippen filed a memorandum in support of his Motion for a New Trial, wherein he asserted the following grounds in support of the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(1) newly discovered evidence, in the form of an affidavit of Daryl Wise, which contradicted Tamar Cutler\u2019s trial testimony that Cutler had observed Crippen firing a chrome handgun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">(2) the evidence was insufficient to convict Crippen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">(3) the potential gun used in the shooting had been found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">(4) the State incorrectly identified a potential witness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">(5) the charges were unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On April 8, 2011, Crippen was sentenced. He noted this appeal on April 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Shortly thereafter, Crippen retained new counsel, and, on June 6, 2011, Crippen filed an Amended Motion for a New Trial. In his amended motion, Crippen raised an ineffective assistance of counsel argument for the first time. On August 5, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on Crippen\u2019s motion. At the hearing, the court requested that Crippen clarify which provision of Maryland Rule 4-331 he was relying on for making his ineffective assistance of counsel argument. On August 17, 2011, Crippen filed a supplemental memorandum in which he argued that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constituted newly discovered evidence for the purposes of Rule 4-331(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On September 20, 2011, the circuit court denied Crippen\u2019s motion. Although in his brief Crippen states \u201cthis appeal follows,\u201d Crippen did not file a notice of appeal following the court\u2019s September 20, 2011 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Crippen, in an effort to fuse the trial record with the Motion for a New Trial record, presents the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">Was [Crippen] denied effective assistance of counsel where defense counsel affirmatively introduced and subsequently failed to object to otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements of the victim and the State thereafter used those out-of-court statements to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, which was essential to proving the State\u2019s theory of the case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The State has filed a motion to dismiss arguing that Crippen\u2019s appeal of the September 20, 2011 denial of the Motion for a New Trial is not properly before this Court because Crippen did not file a notice of appeal following the trial court\u2019s decision to deny his motion. We agree with the State and shall dismiss Crippen\u2019s appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 8\u2014602(a)(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the extent that he is appealing the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ruling of September 20, 2011, because Crippen did not file a timely notice of appeal from the denial of his Amended Motion for a New Trial, as required by Maryland Rule 8-202.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, we will not reach Crippen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as the trial record is insufficient to permit this Court to review the claim on direct appeal. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On June 14, 2010, Crippen was indicted on charges of first-degree murder; attempted first-degree murder; attempted second-degree murder; first-degree assault; second-degree assault; use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence; wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun; and reckless endangerment. The indictment arose from Crippen\u2019s alleged involvement in the murder of Reginald Handy, Jr., and the attempted murder of Torrance Daws during the May 26, 2010 shooting at 503 Laurel Street. According to the indictment, Crippen used a handgun during the attack; however, prior to trial, the State received a ballistics report which indicated that Handy was killed by a .223 caliber rifle bullet fired by a second shooter. Therefore, on December 1, 2010, the State <em>nol prossed </em>the first-degree murder charge against Crippen.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>I. Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">On December 6, 2010, Crippen waived his right to a jury trial, electing instead to be tried by the court. The court conducted a two-day bench trial ending on December 7, 2010. In its order denying Crippen\u2019s Amended Motion for a New Trial, the court summarized the evidence presented at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">The evidence [at trial] revealed that at 9:59 P.M. on May 26, 2010 a bullet was fired striking Reginald Handy, Jr. in the back and killing him. Mr. Handy was one of a group of mostly young men gathered in the side and front yards of 503 Laurel Street in Pocomoke City. A street camera mounted on Laurel Street captured some of the events on Laurel Street and in the area of 503 Laurel [Street] before, during and shortly after the time Handy was shot. The camera video was received into evidence. It showed that within seconds after the shot killing Reginald Handy was fired, a man firing a handgun moved across the front of 503 Laurel Street near the front sidewalk, then ran into the street and out of the camera\u2019s view. The shell casings recovered at the scene established that the man was firing a .380 handgun. The video did not reveal at whom the gunman was firing as the target of his shots was not within camera view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">The police, at first, believed that Handy was shot and killed by a .380 caliber bullet, presumably fired by the man depicted on the video. Shortly before trial, the investigation revealed that Handy was killed by a .223 caliber rifle bullet. That bullet is believed to have been fired from a .223 caliber rifle found the day after the shooting, hidden in the yard of a house near 503 Laurel Street. The court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Alexander Crippen was the gunman firing the .380 caliber handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Twelve witnesses testified for the State. Six were police officers involved in various aspects of the investigation. One police officer, Det. Sgt. Lupiwok, related the contents of his interview with Crippen. Four witnesses were persons at or near the scene at the time of the shooting. Three of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>those were in the front or side yard of 503 Laurel Street. The fourth \u201con-scene witness\u201d was across the street and some distance down from 503 Laurel Street. Two of the on-scene witnesses (Torrance Davis and Tamar Cutler) identified Crippen as the man firing the handgun. Torrance Davis said that Crippen was shooting at him. Tamar Cutler said that, while he was standing on the front porch or stoop of his house, he saw Crippen firing a chrome colored handgun. He placed Crippen\u2019s location while firing the handgun as in the front of 503 Laurel Street. Two other on-scene witnesses (Kavron Rowley and Lorenzo Davis) identified Crippen as having been in the area of 503 Laurel Street at the time of the shooting and described some of the events which transpired. They were not in a position to see who fired the shots. Two other witnesses (Kimberly DeShields and Vera Byrd) testified to an event occurring only hours before the shooting. Kimberly DeShields said she saw Crippen brandish a silver-colored handgun while threatening Vera Byrd. Ms. Byrd corroborated the testimony of Ms. DeShields, but said she did not actually see the gun in Crippen\u2019s hand. She testified that when she heard Ms. DeShields exclaim \u201cOh, he\u2019s got a gun\u201d (referring to Crippen), she was too frightened to move and did not look at Crippen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In addition to identifying Crippen as one of the shooters, Davis testified that he had been involved in a few altercations with Crippen during the prior summer, and that, about a week before the shooting, he had been in another altercation with Crippen. Davis further testified that, following the shooting, he went to the Peninsula Regional Medical Center where Handy, his cousin, was taken. Davis stated that, while at the hospital, he spoke with Sergeant Scott Brent, a Maryland State Police Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On cross-examination, Crippen\u2019s attorney asked Davis about statements he had made to the police regarding his recollection of the shooting. A recording of the statements which were made at the hospital by Davis to Sgt. Brent was also played during cross-examination. In that statement, Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>identified Crippen as the shooter and asserted that Crippen had shot at him. After playing Davis\u2019s statement for the court, Crippen\u2019s attorney introduced the recording into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Later in the trial, the State called Sgt. Brent to testify about the conversation that he had at the hospital with Davis. Sgt. Brent testified that Davis appeared to be very upset, and that Davis said he would cooperate if he could see Handy\u2019s body. Sgt. Brent further testified that after Davis was permitted to see Handy\u2019s body, Davis provided a statement about the incident. Sgt. Brent recorded that statement. On cross-examination, Crippen\u2019s attorney asked Sgt. Brent about his interaction with Davis on the night of the shooting. During the exchange between Crippen\u2019s attorney and Sgt. Brent, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: Okay. When you arrived at the hospital do you remember what time that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">[Sgt. Brent]: The time I arrived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">[Sgt. Brent]: I got the call at 22:10 hours which is 10:10 p.m. I was there\u2014I walked in the room at 22:39. The time I walked in was the time they declared Reginald Handy deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: What time was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">[Sgt. Brent]: 22:39 [10:39 p.m.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: Okay. And how soon after did you see Mr. Davis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">[Sgt. Brent]: I would say approximately 15 to 20 minutes, approximately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: Now, did you take his recorded statement immediately, or did you interview him about the events first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-15\">[Sgt. Brent]: When he came back with me, as soon as\u2014 after he leaned over the body, I said, \u201cYou said you would cooperate with me.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He looked directly at me with tears in his eyes and says, \u201cAlex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Crippen, I saw him pull the gun out. I saw him shoot him. I saw him even try to shoot me, too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">[Crippen\u2019s attorney]: And in fact [Davis] says that he saw [Crippen] shoot his cousin in the back, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">[Sgt. Brent]: He says, exact words, \u201cI saw him pull the gun out. I saw him point it. I saw him shoot it.\u201d He said, \u201cHe even tried to shoot at me, too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Crippen\u2019s attorney did not object to the above testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">During his closing argument, Crippen\u2019s attorney asserted that Davis was not a credible witness, relying on Davis\u2019s statement which he had made at the hospital to support this claim. Crippen\u2019s attorney played the statement several times for the court and discussed the portions of the statement which he believed to be lies. In the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecution also relied on Davis\u2019s statement which he had made at the hospital to corroborate his testimony that Crippen had shot at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In rendering its verdict, the court summarized the evidence before it and acknowledged that Davis had some credibility issues. However, the court found Davis\u2019s testimony to. be credible as to the ultimate issue of whether Crippen had shot at him. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Parts of Torrance Davis\u2019 testimony and Tamar Cutler\u2019s testimony the Court finds more troubling. Torrance Davis clearly embellished his testimony with a falsehood when he claimed that the gun he saw Crippen shooting was a .380. Davis clearly was untruthful when he denied firing the .45 caliber pistol about one minute after Handy was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">The physical evidence recovered and the testimony of Shanna Harmon indicate that about one minute after Handy was shot and after the .380 shooter had already fled, someone, and that someone was almost certainly Torrance Davis, began wildly shooting a .45 caliber handgun from near the location of Reginald Handy\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">Some other things impact Davis\u2019 credibility also. For example, his conviction for making a false statement to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>police officer, his invocation of the Fifth Amendment when questioned about a shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">The essence of Davis\u2019 testimony, however, was entirely credible to the Court. Indeed the part of this testimony\u2014 his testimony that dealt with Crippen firing a handgun at 503 Laurel [Street] at about 9:59 [p.m.] on May the 26th, 2010, was consistent with what he told Sergeant Brent only ... one hour after his cousin was shot to death and at a time when, according to all the witnesses who testified on that subject or gave information, he was extremely upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">At that time he, like the police, was unaware that Handy had been killed with a bullet from a .223 which was fired at essentially the same time as the second gunman opened fire with the .380.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">As Sergeant Brent said when questioned by the defense, quote \u201cHe looked directly at me\u201d ... referring to Davis talking\u2014\u201cHe looked directly at me with tears in his eyes and says, \u2018Alexander Crippen. I saw him pull the gun out. I saw him shooting. I saw him even try to shoot me,\u2019 \u201d end quote. That statement and the part of Torrance Davis\u2019 testimony that was consistent with his statement to Sergeant Brent, as well as his testimony about his location, was entirely truthful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Based on the entirety of the evidence presented at trial, the court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Crippen was the person who shot at Torrance Davis at 503 Laurel Street on May 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">II. Post-trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">On December 10, 2010, the court rendered its verdict and convicted Crippen on all counts. On December 20, 2010, Crippen\u2019s attorney filed the initial Motion for a New Trial pursuant to Md. Rule 4-331. On April 8, 2011, Crippen was sentenced. On April 13, 2011, Crippen noted this appeal. On June 6, 2011, after hiring a new attorney, Crippen filed an Amended Motion for a New Trial, in which he claimed that he should be granted a new trial because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(1) his trial counsel was ineffective;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">(2) he had newly discovered evidence in the form of Daryl Wise\u2019s previously mentioned affidavit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">(3) the State failed to disclose prior to trial a threatening statement that Crippen made to Davis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">(4) the State failed to timely reveal that it intended to call Lorenzo Davis as a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">On August 5, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on Crippen\u2019s motion, at which time Crippen\u2019s trial counsel and Daryl Wise testified. During the trial, Crippen\u2019s trial counsel testified regarding his cross-examination of Sgt. Brent. Counsel admitted that he should have objected to and moved to strike Sgt. Brent\u2019s testimony, regarding the contents of Davis\u2019s hospital statement, because Sgt. Brent\u2019s answer was unresponsive to the question Crippen\u2019s trial counsel had asked. Daryl Wise testified as to what he observed on the night of the shooting and with whom he spoke following the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">At the start of the hearing, the trial judge asked Crippen\u2019s new attorney to clarify which subsection of Maryland Rule 4-331 he was relying on to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In response, Crippen\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfU\">Yes and although it is\u2014although it is arguable that at the time we first prepared that, we thought we were, (a) as extended by <em>Campbell [v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 821 A.2d 1 (2003),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] but I certainly agree with Your Honor, in the alternative, please read our pleadings broadly such as to put us within one of the other sections. And I agree that we\u2019re probably good under two sections [ (b) and (c) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">On September 20, 2011, the court issued an order denying Crippen\u2019s Motion for a New Trial. The court ruled that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>exercising its discretion, it would consider the motion under subsections (b) and (c). However, it concluded that none of the grounds that Crippen raised in his motion met the requirements for a new trial under either subsections (b) or (c). As to Crippen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court determined that the claim did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d as required by Md. Rule 4-331(c). Crippen did not file a timely notice of appeal regarding the court\u2019s decision to deny his Amended Motion for a New Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On appeal, Crippen argues that he is entitled to a new trial because he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. Specifically, Crippen asserts that his trial counsel erred by introducing Davis\u2019s hospital statement into evidence. Crippen also asserts that his trial counsel erred when he played that statement during his closing argument. Furthermore, Crippen contends that his trial counsel erred by failing to object to Sgt. Brent\u2019s testimony regarding Davis\u2019s hospital statement because Sgt. Brent\u2019s answer was unresponsive to the question posed by Crippen\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The State responds that Crippen\u2019s appeal should be dismissed for two reasons. First, because Crippen failed to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the court\u2019s ruling on his Motion for a New Trial as required by Maryland Rules 8-201(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 8-202(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, because he failed to include any argument in his brief attacking his conviction and sentence as required by Maryland Rules 8-502, 8-503, and 8-504.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In the alternative, the State argues that, should this Court reach the merits of Crippen\u2019s claim, Crippen\u2019s ineffectiveness of counsel argument was not raised before the circuit court, and, therefore, was not preserved for appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State further contends that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Crippen was not entitled to a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331(c) because his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel did not constitute newly discovered evidence as required by subsection (c) of the rule. The court noted that, even if it did constitute newly discovered evidence, Crippen would not have been prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We agree with the State that Crippen failed to file a timely notice of appeal following the circuit court\u2019s denial of his Motion for a New Trial. Therefore, to the extent that Crippen\u2019s appeal challenges the circuit court\u2019s ruling on his motion, we shall dismiss the appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-602(a)(3) because the appeal was not filed within 30 days of the order denying the motion. Moreover, to the extent that Crippen\u2019s appeal challenges his conviction, we conclude that the record lacks a sufficient factual basis to permit a review of Crippen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. Therefore, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that when a notice of appeal is filed <em>before </em>a final judgment is issued, the appeal is of no force and effect and cannot confer jurisdiction to an appellate court to review the circuit court\u2019s decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>See Blucher v. Ekstrom, </em>309 Md. 458, 463, 524 A.2d 1235 (1987) (\u201cUnder a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions, when an order of appeal is filed <em>before </em>the appealable judgment, the order of appeal is of no force and effect. There must still be an order filed <em>after </em>the appealable judgment to confer appellate jurisdiction.\u201d) (Emphasis in original) (citations omitted); <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 413, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986) (\u201cThe requirement of [Rule 8-202], that an order of appeal be filed within thirty days of a final judgment, is jurisdictional; if the requirement is not met, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d) (Citations omitted). Thus, the notice of appeal filed on April 13, 2011, does not authorize this Court to review the circuit court\u2019s order denying Crippen\u2019s Amended Motion for New Trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Crippen failed to file an <em>amended </em>notice of appeal <em>after </em>the circuit court denied his motion, there is no jurisdictional basis for this Court to review the circuit court\u2019s September 20, 2011 decision. Therefore, we must dismiss Crippen\u2019s appeal to the extent that it challenges the circuit court\u2019s order denying his belated Amended Motion for a New Trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>As to Crippen\u2019s challenge to his conviction of December 10, 2010, such a challenge would more properly be raised in a post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he right to counsel includes the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Tetso v. State, </em>205 Md.App. 334, 377, 45 A.3d 788 (2012) (citing <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 465-66, 30 A.3d 914 (2011)). \u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Generally, in Maryland, a defendant\u2019s attack of a criminal conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel occurs at post-conviction review. <em>Id. </em>This is because a post-conviction hearing presents \u201cthe opportunity for further fact-finding____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 45 A.3d 788. The Court of Appeals has consistently held that \u201cthe \u2018desirable procedure\u2019 for presenting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is through post-conviction proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-78, 45 A.3d 788 (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 434, 439 A.2d 542 (1982)) (internal citation and quotations omitted). Further, the Court of Appeals has explained the reasoning for preferring post-conviction over direct appeal for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">In essence, it is because the trial record does not ordinarily illuminate the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel, that a claim of ineffective assistance is more appropriately made in a post conviction proceeding!.] Moreover, under the settled rules of appellate procedure, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel not presented to the trial court generally is not an issue which will be reviewed initially on direct appeal, although competency of counsel may be raised for the first time at af] post conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>proceeding. Upon such a collateral attack, there is presented an opportunity for taking testimony, receiving evidence, and making factual findings concerning the allegations of counsel\u2019s incompetence. By having counsel testify and describe his or her reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of, the post conviction court is better able to determine intelligently whether the attorney\u2019s actions met the applicable standard of competence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>292 Md. at 434, 439 A.2d 542) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We have explained the extremely rare situations where ineffective assistance of counsel claims will be evaluated on direct appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">The rare instances in which we have permitted direct review are instructive, because they indicate our willingness to entertain such claims on direct review only when the facts in the trial record sufficiently illuminate the basis for the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. As we explained in <em>In re Parris W. </em>[363 Md. 717, 727, 770 A.2d 202], direct review is an exception that applies only when \u201cthe critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 378, 45 A.3d 788 (quoting <em>Mosley v. State, </em>378 Md. 548, 566, 836 A.2d 678 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Relying on the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. 717, 770 A.2d 202 (2001), and our decision in <em>Ruth v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 358, 757 A.2d 152 (2000), Crippen argues that addressing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal is appropriate in this case. Crippen argues that the testimony taken during the hearing on his Amended Motion for a New Trial established a sufficient record for this Court to review the performance of his trial counsel. Crippen requests that we combine the evidence received at the motions hearing and the evidence received at trial and to consider the two separate proceedings as one. We conclude that neither of the decisions cited by Crippen support addressing his claim on direct appeal in this manner. In both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of those cases, the basis for the defendant\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel was plain on the trial record. Here, by contrast, Crippen\u2019s claim requires an examination of his attorney\u2019s actions. The actions were not in any way explained until Crippen\u2019s motions hearing. The motions hearing is not part of the trial record in this appeal. Therefore, we cannot examine his attorney\u2019s actions in light of the record available for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In <em>In re Parris W., </em>the Court of Appeals stated that the ordinary rule that ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be raised in post conviction proceedings \u201cis not absolute and, where the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim, there is no need for a collateral fact-finding proceeding, and review on direct appeal may be appropriate and desirable.\u201d 363 Md. at 726, 770 A.2d 202 (citations omitted). There, Parris W. was charged as a juvenile with assault and trespassing. <em>Id. </em>at 720, 770 A.2d 202. At Parris W.\u2019s adjudicatory hearing, his attorney requested a continuance on the grounds that he had issued subpoenas to Parris W.\u2019s alibi witnesses that contained the <em>wrong date. Id. </em>(Emphasis added). The court denied Parris W.\u2019s request, and, as a result, Parris W.\u2019s attorney was unable to produce the witnesses on the day of the hearing to corroborate Parris W.\u2019s testimony regarding his alibi. <em>Id. </em>at 721-22, 770 A.2d 202. Therefore, Parris W.\u2019s counsel\u2019s error was readily apparent from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In <em>Ruth, </em>the defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel because his attorney also represented the co-defendant in that trial. <em>Ruth v. State, </em>133 Md.App. at 366-67, 757 A.2d 152. The defendant argued that his attorney\u2019s representation of both him and his co-defendant constituted an inherent conflict of interest which was prejudicial to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>We stated that there, \u201c[bjecause we are presented with a full record, we shall entertain the question posed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 757 A.2d 152. Although we acknowledge that the circuit court heard testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the hearing on his Motion for a New Trial, that testimony was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>necessary to establish the factual basis for the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Ruth, </em>there was no need for further fact finding to determine whether defendant\u2019s trial counsel represented both defendants, nor was there any need to determine trial counsel\u2019s reason for representing both defendants because, if a conflict existed, the representation was inappropriate regardless of trial counsel\u2019s reasoning. Thus, as in <em>In re Parris W., </em>the trial counsel\u2019s error in <em>Ruth </em>was plain on the record before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The Court of Appeals addressed a similar set of facts in <em>Duvall v. State, </em>399 Md. 210, 923 A.2d 81 (2007). In <em>Duvall, </em>the defendant was represented by an attorney from the Montgomery County Office of the Public Defender. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 923 A.2d 81. The defendant denied the charges against him and claimed that another individual, represented by the same office on unrelated charges, was in fact responsible for the crimes with which Duvall had been charged. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 923 A.2d 81. Upon learning of the conflict, Duvall\u2019s attorney filed a motion for a continuance. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 923 A.2d 81. Despite the apparent conflict of interest, the administrative judge denied defense counsel\u2019s request for a continuance. <em>Id. </em>Upon review, the Court held that, because there existed a conflict of interest and because defense counsel requested a continuance prior to trial, the administrative judge erred, as a matter of law, in failing to grant the postponement to give defense counsel reasonable time to resolve the conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 923 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In explaining that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel ordinarily should be addressed in a post-conviction proceeding, <em>see Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 706, 759 A.2d 764 (2000); <em>Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 227, 686 A.2d 274 (1996); <em>Walker v. State, </em>338 Md. 253, 262, 658 A.2d 239 (1995), the Court in <em>Duvall </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">[t]he main justification for the rule is that, generally, the trial record does not provide adequate detail upon which the reviewing court could base an assessment regarding whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance because the character of counsel\u2019s representation is not the focus of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>proceedings and there is no discussion of counsel\u2019s strategy supporting the conduct in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 239, 923 A.2d 81 (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 200, 905 A.2d 315 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Court further stated that review of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on post-conviction is unnecessary where the record is clear and the necessary facts are contained in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 923 A.2d 81. There, the Court held that the record was clear and, thus, there was no need for a post-conviction hearing. Clearly, the trial court\u2019s actions caused the adverse effect on the defendant\u2019s representation. <em>Id. at </em>240-41, 923 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Here, we are obligated to separate the trial record from the record developed at the Motion for a New Trial hearing and review only the trial record. Unlike in <em>In re Parris W., Ruth, </em>and <em>Duvall, </em>the basis for Crippen\u2019s claim is not apparent on the record at trial, and therefore, additional fact-finding is necessary to evaluate Crippen\u2019s claim. During trial, Crippen\u2019s trial attorney did not admit to any error nor did Crippen raise the issue of ineffective assistance at trial. In fact, Crippen did not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim until June 6, 2011, when he filed his Amended Motion for a New Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">As discussed above, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the circuit court\u2019s order denying Crippen\u2019s Amended Motion for a New Trial as Crippen did not appeal that decision. Despite our lack of jurisdiction to review the circuit court\u2019s order, Crippen asks that we still consider the testimony presented, to the circuit court during its review of his Amended Motion for a New Trial, in deciding whether a sufficient factual basis exists to permit review of Crippen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. We cannot do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only judgment before this Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Crippen\u2019s conviction for the crimes arising from the shooting on May 26, 2010. Thus, the only facts that we can consider in reviewing the circuit court\u2019s judgment are those facts which were before the circuit court when it entered the judgment from which this appeal lies. As the trial record does not contain sufficient facts to substantiate Crippen\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm his conviction. Crippen may proceed with a post-conviction proceeding to address his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">APPEAL OF THE SEPTEMBER 20, 2011 ORDER DISMISSED.

Had Crippen filed a notice of appeal <em>following </em>the court\u2019s denial of his Motion for a New Trial, Crippen\u2019s claim challenging the court\u2019s ruling would be subject to the more stringent \u201cabuse of discretion standard,\u201d <em>see Buck v.
