Goss Trucking, LLC and operated by Wayne H. Goss (\u201cGoss\u201d or \u201cappellants\u201d). Jennings\u2019 estate, the estate of his mother, and three beneficiaries (\u201cappellees\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a wrongful death/survival action against Goss in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Later, they amended their complaint to include claims against the DOC and the State Highway Administration (\u201cSHA\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe State\u201d). In turn, Goss filed a third-party complaint against the State, and the State filed a cross-complaint against him, with both parties seeking contribution or indemnification against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In the jury trial that followed, Goss and the State moved for judgment at the end of plaintiffs\u2019 case and at the close of all the evidence. The court initially denied the motions, but reserved judgment on the renewed motions made at the close of all the evidence. The jury then returned a verdict against Goss and the State in the amount of $2,025,000, which represented the sum of the damages awarded in the survival action ($350,000) and the wrongful death action ($1,675,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Goss and the State moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOY). Goss also moved for a new trial and remittitur. The court granted the State\u2019s motion, denied Goss\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>motions and reduced the damage award to <em>$1.37 </em>million, prompting this appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">At the June 14, 2010 trial, the evidence adduced that, on the morning of August 23, 2007, Jennings and at least two other inmates, Denard Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) and Christian Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d) were driven by a correctional officer in a DOC van to pick up litter along the southbound shoulder of 1-495. Another SHA employee accompanied the crew in an SHA dump truck. Upon arriving at the intersection of 1-495 and Route 202, the inmates were discharged from the van, donned bright green fluorescent safety vests and began walking southbound on the shoulder of 1-495. Shortly thereafter, Jennings, Taylor and Thomas crossed the exit ramp by foot and entered into the gore<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> area of the beltway.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">I. The Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Lee Bayersdorfer, who was driving a tractor-trailer in the lane closest to the exit ramp, observed that immediately before the accident, Goss accelerated, passed him on the left, and cut in front of him to take the Route 202 exit. At this time, and when he was at a distance of approximately 75 feet from the exit, Goss saw the inmates walk across the exit ramp and into the gore and sounded his horn to \u201cwarn\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Upon hearing the horn, the inmates in the gore turned around to see both Goss\u2019 dump truck and Bayersdorfer\u2019s tractor-trailer \u201cbearing down on [them] at a high amount of speed.\u201d Thomas observed Goss\u2019 dump truck \u201cspeeding up [and] trying to get over\u201d to the exit lane and then \u201cspeeding] ... up in front of the other truck,\u201d as it \u201ccut all the way over to the right.\u201d Both men believed that the dump truck was going to enter the gore where they were standing. Nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>less, they remained stationary because the horn put them in a \u201cstate of shock,\u201d freezing them in place. Although Taylor thought about escaping Goss\u2019 apparent path by \u201cslip[ping] between [the vehicles],\u201d the trucks were so close to the gore that he was afraid he would be \u201csuck[ed] in....\u201d He \u201cthought [he] was going to die\u201d and would have run if he had been positioned closer to the exit ramp. But, given his position in the gore, \u201cthere was nowhere to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">When Goss\u2019 dump truck was about five to eight feet away from him, Jennings ran from the gore back across the exit ramp. According to Taylor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[W]e was [sic ] in the middle [of the gore] when we saw the trucks coming, there was really nowhere for us to run to, you know, but [Jennings] tried to\u2014he did a movement like this and he tried to go back across the ramp where we had come from. And I grabbed after him, but he was a little bit bigger than me so he got away from me. And [Goss\u2019 dump] truck just came right through and met him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">At that point, Goss \u201creally\u201d applied the truck\u2019s brakes, but was unable to avoid striking Jennings, who later died from accident-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">II. The Post-Accident Inspection</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">After the accident, Maryland State Troopers Mallon and Sliffer directed Goss to drive to a nearby shopping center where they could conduct a post-accident inspection. Mallon slid underneath the truck on his back, looking up at the bottom of the truck to inspect its brakes. Sliffer remained outside of the dump truck and recorded the brake measurements on 3x5 cards, as Mallon shouted out the measurements to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The State Troopers then directed Goss to drive to a weigh station, where they determined that the truck weighed 78,400 pounds, in violation of the 70,000 pound weight limit imposed by Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Article (TA) \u00a7 13-919.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Using a computer at the station, Sliffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>entered the data from the 3x5 cards and prepared a report which reflected Mallon\u2019s finding that three of Goss\u2019 brakes were out of adjustment. Maflon reviewed the inspection report for accuracy and confirmed that it contained the same measurements he had orally conveyed to Sliffer. He then provided the report to the police crash team, which transferred the data into its post-collision inspection report. Over Goss\u2019 objection, both reports were admitted into evidence as plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">III. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">David Stopper, who testified as an expert in commercial trucking, accident reconstruction, and the proper operation of commercial motor vehicles, opined that, based on his review of the police paperwork, depositions, accident scene photos, safety manuals, and Mallon and Sliffer\u2019s post-accident inspection reports, on the day of the accident, the truck was in \u201can out-of-service condition which mean[t] that ... the vehicle ... [was] likely to cause an accident or breakdown.\u201d Stopper concluded that the two largest brakes on Goss\u2019 dump truck were \u201csignificantly\u201d out of adjustment, resulting in a loss of more than 25% of the truck\u2019s braking efficiency. As a result, the truck was \u201cnot safe to operate\u201d on the day of the accident, which should have been apparent to Goss during a pre-trip inspection. According to Stopper, Goss\u2019 failure to maintain his brakes in proper working order was a violation of the standard of care applicable to commercial vehicle operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Stopper also testified that the weight of Goss\u2019 truck on the day of the accident violated standard limits, and, together with the defective brakes, \u201cdecreased [the] truck\u2019s ability to stop.\u201d Stopper opined that Jennings \u201cwould have cleared the truck\u201d if Goss\u2019 brakes had been in working order and the truck weighed 8400 pounds less. In making this conclusion, Stopper assigned to Jennings a speed of 7.5 feet per second, which approximates the pace of a 60-year-old male jogger. Stopper explained that, though Jennings was 28 years old at the time of the accident, this pace was appropriate because Jennings was heavyset.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>IV. The Horn Demonstration</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Additionally, Stopper testified that the way in which Goss used his truck\u2019s air-horn on the day of the accident violated the applicable standard of care. Over Goss\u2019 objection, Stopper conducted an outdoor demonstration of the same kind of air horn that was on Goss\u2019 truck and blew it at a distance of 75 feet from the jury. In Stopper\u2019s opinion, Goss created the dangerous condition which required him to use his horn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">[I]f Goss had been slowing down appropriately and fallen in behind the other vehicle and used the exit ramp and had been coming on it at the appropriate speed ... there would be no reason for him to be sounding his horn and warning others because he should have been able to stop in the distance he could see.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">V. The Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At the close of all the evidence, Goss and the State renewed their earlier motions for judgment, and the court reserved ruling until after the jury returned a verdict against both parties in the amount of $2,025,000. This award represented the sum of $350,000 and $1,675,000 in noneconomic damages for the survival action and wrongful death claim, respectively. Thereafter, Goss asserted that he was entitled to cross-judgment against the State and filed motions for JNOV, a new trial, and a remittitur. With respect to the remittitur, Goss argued that under CJP \u00a7 11-108, when there are two or more beneficiaries in a death claim, the cap is set at 150% of $680,000 or $1,020,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also urged the court to reduce the entire damage award to that amount, essentially eliminating the $350,000 award in the survival action, along with more than $650,000 for the wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The State also moved for JNOV, arguing that it breached no duty to Jennings, that it was not the proximate cause of his death and that he was contributorily negligent. It also argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d), Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article (SG), \u00a7 12-101, <em>et seq. </em>and particularly \u00a7 12-104(a)(2), its liability could not exceed a total of $200,000 for any and all claims made against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On September 24, 2010, the court heard and denied Goss\u2019 motions and granted the State\u2019s motion for JNOV. Specifically, the circuit judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">I don\u2019t see where the State was negligent as a matter of law. Now, I\u2019ll contrast this later with the other case, but the fact is he was moved from the one side and across the ramp to the gore area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">If we look at from your blocking vehicle or moving in the ramp while they cross or if we look at putting them in a van to take them across, it\u2019s a moot point. They got from point A to point B without a problem. They did. It\u2019s a fact. They moved from point A to point B without issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">If we say, okay, we need to have a blocking vehicle then at the gore area to protect them there, that\u2019s moot because they weren\u2019t hit in the gore area. He wasn\u2019t hit in the gore area. He was hit on the ramp. The State did nothing in this case that was negligent. It\u2019s incontrovertible. They got him across the ramp. He wasn\u2019t hit in the gore area. The State did nothing negligent and I\u2019m going to grant [its\u2019] Motion for Judgment.... [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The court\u2019s rulings left the $350,000 survival action judgment intact and reduced the wrongful death awards to 150% of $680,000 or $1,020,000. Goss noted this appeal. The State and the other appellees cross-appealed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Goss presents four questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">1. Did the trial court erroneously deny Goss\u2019 motion for JNOV when the undisputed evidence established Jennings\u2019 negligence by suddenly darting into the path of Goss\u2019 truck, and the absence of proximate causation between Goss\u2019 negligence and Jennings\u2019 death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">2. Did the trial court commit reversible errors in allowing irrelevant evidence of the truck\u2019s gross weight, hearsay evidence of the condition of its brakes, and an irrelevant horn demonstration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">3. Did the trial court erroneously impose two statutory caps in granting Goss\u2019 requested remittitur when only one cap applied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">4. Did the trial court improperly grant the State\u2019s motion for JNOV and deny Goss\u2019 cross-judgment against the State?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The appellees\u2019 cross-appeal presents this additional issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATm\">Whether the Circuit Court erred by (A) granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the State of Maryland, where the jury\u2019s findings that the State\u2019s negligence proximately caused Jennings\u2019 injuries and death were supported by the evidence, and (B) ruling that the State\u2019s total liability to all claimants is capped at $200,000, when the plain language of the Maryland Tort Claims Act applies the $200,000 cap to each \u201csingle claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">For the following reasons, we answer all of Goss\u2019 questions in the negative. We answer part A of appellees\u2019 question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the negative and decline to reach part B. Thus, we affirm the rulings of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">I. Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Goss\u2019 challenge to the jury verdict is premised on two grounds. First, he argues that Jennings\u2019 decision to run from the gore made him contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Second, he asserts that Jennings\u2019 flight into the exit ramp was a superseding cause of the accident that relieves him of liability for negligence. We reject both contentions and hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Maryland has a \u201cvery restrictive rule\u201d about removing negligence cases from the jury. <em>Campbell v. Montgomery County Bd. of Education, </em>73 Md.App. 54, 62, 533 A.2d 9 (1987). If there is \u201cany evidence, however slight, legally sufficient as tending to prove negligence,\u201d then the trial judge must leave the weighing and evaluating of that evidence to the jury. <em>Moore v. Myers, </em>161 Md.App. 349, 363, 868 A.2d 954 (2005). Upon review of the circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion for JNOV, we apply the same standard, and \u201cconsider all the evidence, including inferences reasonably and logically drawn therefrom, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Romero v. Brenes, </em>189 Md.App. 284, 290, 984 A.2d 346 (2009). We will affirm the court\u2019s decision to submit the issue to the jury if we find that \u201cevidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion\u201d sufficiently supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Campbell, </em>73 Md.App. at 63, 533 A.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">B. Contributory Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">When a defendant raises a claim of contributory negligence against a plaintiff who has died in the underlying action, a presumption applies that the decedent \u201cexercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ordinary care for his own safety in accordance with the natural instinct of human beings to guard against danger.\u201d <em>Baltimore Transit Company v. State, </em>194 Md. 421, 434, 71 A.2d 442 (1950). Contributory negligence will not be decided as a matter of law unless the evidence overcomes this presumption and demonstrates \u201csome prominent and decisive act which directly contributed to the accident and which was of such a character as to leave no room for difference of opinion thereon by reasonable minds.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Here, whether Jennings exercised proper caution in running across the exit ramp is not so obvious that we can say as a matter of law that the jury was unjustified in finding him free from fault. Although Taylor \u201cgrabbed after\u201d Jennings to prevent him from leaving the gore, Taylor testified that he, too, would have run he had been standing closer to the exit ramp. Moreover, contrary to Goss\u2019 assertion that Thomas and Taylor remained in the gore because they appreciated their relative position of safety, both men testified that they were \u201cstuck\u201d or \u201cfrozen\u201d in the gore after hearing the horn and watching the truck barrel down on them. The fact that Jennings was struck on the exit ramp does not establish his negligence as a matter of law. Whether his decision to run was negligently or carelessly made was a question for the jury. It was not error for the circuit court to rule otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">C. Proximate Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\"> Goss\u2019 next contention is that Jennings\u2019 dash into the travel portion of the roadway was an intervening cause of the accident that relieves the appellants of liability for negligence. Generally, intervening conduct will break the chain of causation when the act is neither intended by the initial actor nor foreseeable as the probable result of his conduct. <em>See Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 337, 624 A.2d 496 (1992). Accordingly, the linchpin of whether an intervening act breaks the causal chain is foreseeability. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 624 A.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Here, we find sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Jennings\u2019 death was the reasonably foreseeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>consequence of Goss\u2019 negligence. The jury heard evidence that Goss was speeding, traversing lanes, sounding a loud horn, and apparently heading directly toward the inmates. The totality of this evidence created a jury question as to the foreseeability of Jennings\u2019 flight, and it was permissible for them to conclude that Goss\u2019 conduct created the chain of events that caused Jennings\u2019 death. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Goss\u2019 motion for JNOV on this basis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">II. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded by Goss\u2019 argument that the court abused its discretion by (1) admitting evidence of a gross weight violation; (2) allowing the horn demonstration; and; (3) admitting evidence of post-crash brake measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 583, 976 A.2d 300 (2009). We will not set aside the court\u2019s ruling unless the error \u201ccausefs] substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 92, 854 A.2d 1180 (2004). Accordingly, an evidentiary ruling, even if manifestly erroneous, will not be disturbed if it was harmless. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-103(a). To the extent an evidentiary ruling involves resolution of a question of law, we review that decision <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>B. Evidence of Weight Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Goss argues that his violation of TA \u00a7 13-919 should not have been disclosed to the jury because Jennings was not a member of the class the statute was designed to protect. Given the totality of the evidence regarding the manner in which Goss approached and entered the ramp, loaded his truck, and maintained his brakes, we believe that the introduction of the weight violation cannot reasonably be understood as the pivotal evidence that tipped the verdict in favor of the appellees. In short, assuming an error did occur, we conclude that it was harmless as a matter of law. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the judge abused his discretion in admitting the evidence or that the evidence so prejudicially affected Goss\u2019 rights that he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">C. Horn Demonstration</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Citing <em>Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 25, 811 A.2d 282 (2002), Goss next contends that the court\u2019s failure to require appellees to establish \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d between the horn demonstration and the actual event renders the demonstration irrelevant, misleading, and grounds for new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The record reflects that the purpose of the horn demonstration was to assist the jury in understanding the difference in decibel levels between an average car horn and the air-horn on Goss\u2019 truck. The test was intended for the jurors to \u201chear what this horn is and how it\u2019s different than the horn in their common experience.\u201d Appellees simply wanted the jury to hear the \u201cloud blast of a loud horn.\u201d With this purpose, it would make no difference whether the horn demonstration occurred inside the courtroom, at the scene of the accident, or at a location determined by the trial court. We cannot say that the horn demonstration significantly affected the outcome of Goss\u2019 case, particularly when he, too, acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a truck horn. It\u2019s supposed to be loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>D. Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Goss next submits that the lower court committed reversible error in allowing appellees to introduce inadmissable hearsay testimony and documentary evidence regarding the dump truck\u2019s purportedly faulty brakes (the post-accident reports). He argues that the \u201crecord is replete with indicia of untrustworthiness\u201d which preclude the admission of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Even if State Trooper Mallon\u2019s testimony was inadmissible hearsay evidence, we find that any such error in its admission was harmless. Even without this testimony, appellees presented sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Appellees\u2019 expert witness testified that two of the truck\u2019s largest brakes were out of adjustment, resulting in a 25% loss in braking efficiency, and he opined that these defects should have been apparent to Goss. Eyewitness testimony indicated that Goss was negligent in the angle, speed, and direction at which he entered the exit ramp. In light of all the evidence, we hold that the jury verdicts were not substantially swayed by the admission of Mallon\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Moreover, although the post-accident reports were hearsay, they were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5\u2014803(b)(6). The rule provides that records kept in the ordinary course of business are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>The nature of the records may be established by a \u201cqualified witness\u201d who has sufficient knowledge of the record-keeping system and the creation of the contested record to establish their trustworthiness. <em>See id.; see also Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md.App. 378, 417, 700 A.2d 798 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Here, Mallon testified that he routinely inspected vehicles and made such reports; that the reports \u201care generated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>part of [his] function as [a member of] the police department,\u201d that they are kept in the \u201cordinary course of business;\u201d and that he had personal knowledge of the process involved in making them. Hence, Mallon was a qualified witness who properly authenticated the post-accident reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We note further that a record of a regularly conducted activity that meets the foundational requirements of Md. Rule 5\u2014803(b)(6) is presumptively trustworthy, and the burden to prove that the proffered evidence was generated under untrustworthy circumstances rests upon the party opposing its admission. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 116, 604 A.2d 47 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Contrary to Goss\u2019 assertion, the presumption of trustworthiness is particularly robust here because the reports were prepared as part of the official duties of Maryland State Police employees. In addition, Mallon testified that he reviewed the post-accident reports, verified their accuracy, and was \u201cpositive\u201d that the brake measurements were correct. We fail to see any basis for concluding that the reports were so untrustworthy that the court abused its discretion in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">III. Non-Economic Damage Cap</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Goss\u2019 next contention is that the court\u2019s decision to apply separate statutory caps to the survival and wrongful death actions was not authorized by CJP \u00a7 11-108. His claim hinges on the notion that, while the survival action and wrongful death claims are two separate causes of action, they result in one loss that should be subject to one cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is <em>de novo. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 181, 909 A.2d 694 (2006). We often resolve issues of statutory construction by considering \u201cthree general factors: 1) text; 2) purpose; and 3) consequences.\u201d <em>Town of Oxford v. Koste, </em>204 Md.App. 578, 585-86, 42 A.3d 637 (2012). <em>Koste </em>notes that: \u201c[t]ext is the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, viewed in context, considered in light of the whole statute, and generally evaluated for ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted). Legislative purpose, either manifested in the text or gleaned from other sources, often informs, and may even control, our interpretation of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 42 A.3d 637. Finally, our examination \u201cof interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted). This is one of those cases where the text of the relevant provisions is the predominate factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">When first enacted in 1986 in response to an insurance crisis, the noneconomic damage cap applied in \u201cany action for damages for personal injury.\u201d Although several years later, this Court concluded that this statutory language covered a wrongful death action, <em>Potomac Electric v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 558 A.2d 768, <em>cert. denied </em>317 Md. 393, 564 A.2d 407 (1989), in 1993, the Court of Appeals disagreed. In <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993), noting, among other things, the absence of any reference to wrongful death in the damage cap statute and the limited nature of the damages subject to the cap, the Court concluded that CJP \u00a7 11-108 did not apply in a wrongful death case. In passing, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">The damages referenced in the cap statute would be recoverable in a survival action because a survival action allows for compensation for the pain and suffering endured by the deceased, as well as for loss of earnings and medical- expenses, between the time of injury and the time of death. Damages recoverable under the Wrongful Death Act are measured by the value, pecuniary and otherwise, of the life of the deceased to the person entitled to damages. The cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>statute does not reference this latter type of damage, either expressly or by implication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">329 Md. at 544, 620 A.2d 905.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The General Assembly quickly responded to <em>Streidel </em>in 1994 with legislation that can only be described as a compromise. <em>See </em>Chapter 477, <em>Laws of 1994 </em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rather than redefining an \u201caction ... for personal injury\u201d in CJP \u00a7 11-108 to include a wrongful death action, the Legislature distinguished between the two causes of action in all key sections of the cap statute. For example, in the definitional section, \u00a7 11\u2014108(a)(2)(i), the statute defined noneconomic damages as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">1. In an action for personal injury, pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, loss of consortium, or other nonpecuniary injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">2. In an action for wrongful death, mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, care, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>or education, or other noneconomic damages authorized under Title 3, Subtitle 9 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Nothing in this definition changed the nature of the damages recoverable in a survival action, <em>see </em>n. 10 and accompanying text, or altered the specific statutory provisions, <em>see </em>n. 1 <em>supra, </em>or caselaw on the distinctions between a wrongful death and a survival action. Although overruling Streidel\u2019s holding that the cap could not apply to a wrongful death action, the General Assembly left undisturbed the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that a survival action was one for \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d 329 Md. at 544, n. 9, 620 A.2d 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">A key battleground in this case is the impact of the Legislature\u2019s addition of the following language in \u00a7 11-108(b)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(i) The limitation established under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall apply in a personal injury action to each direct victim of tortious conduct and all persons who claim injury by or through that victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(ii) In a wrongful death action in which there are two or more claimants or beneficiaries, an award for noneconomic damages may not exceed 150% of the limitation established under paragraph (2) of this subsection, regardless of the number of claimants or beneficiaries who share in the award.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Goss argues that this language requires the aggregation for cap purposes of the damages in survival and wrongful death actions. Such a contention does violence to the text of the statute. Because the 1994 legislation did not erase the distinction between the two causes of action to reach Goss\u2019 proffered solution, we would have to somehow merge both paragraphs of \u00a7 ll-108(b)(3), contrary to the intention of the Legislature and applicable caselaw.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Each paragraph of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00a7 11\u2014108(b)(3) stands alone, with a survival action falling under paragraph (i) and a wrongful death action being confined to paragraph (ii). Although paragraph (i) deals with multiple claimants in a personal injury case, it has no impact here because no \u201cdirect victim\u201d is suing along with a derivative party. There is and could only be one plaintiff in the survival action\u2014Jennings\u2019 personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">This construction of \u00a7 11-108 in no way offends the general purpose of the statute in promoting the availability and affordability of liability insurance in Maryland. <em>See Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 34-35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995). While the 1994 legislature, like its 1986 predecessor, focused in part on this rationale in capping wrongful death damages, the State made no fundamental change to damage awards in personal injury cases, including a survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Finally, our conclusion that the \u00a7 11-108 damage cap applies separately to damage awards in survival and \u2019wrongful death actions, does not conflict with our recent decision in <em>Leake v. Johnson, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 40 A.3d 1127 (2012).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There we said that for purposes of the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), CJP \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq., </em>and its $200,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>limitation on liability, damages for survival actions and for wrongful death were required to be aggregated. However, that conclusion turned on the particular language of the LGTCA, where the cap was keyed to claims that arise from \u201cthe same occurrence.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-303. Quite simply, Leake\u2019s holding flowed from the extremely narrow language of the LGTCA. The text and history of CJP \u00a7 11-108 are vastly different and they account for a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Accordingly, under CJP \u00a7 11-108(b)(3)(i), the $350,000 personal injury/survival action award here remains intact because it did not exceed the cap. Under \u00a7 11\u2014108(b)(3)(ii), the combined wrongful death awards of $1,675,000 were properly reduced to 150% of the applicable cap. Thus, the circuit court did not err in establishing the total damage award at $1.37 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">IV. The State\u2019s Motion for JNOV</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Finally, both Goss and appellees assert that the circuit court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion for JNOV because the State: (1) mishandled the work crew and work zone safety; (2) failed to provide the inmates with proper protection; and (3) did not adequately train the inmates on how to safely cross the roadway. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Again, upon review of the grant of a motion for JNOV, the sole issue before us is whether substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Romero, </em>189 Md.App. at 290, 984 A.2d 346. In this case, it is apparent that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that State personnel were negligent. Although some evidence was presented to suggest that it was unsafe for an inmate to cross the ramp into the gore on foot, it is undisputed that Jennings was fatally injured <em>after </em>he finished crossing the ramp, entered the gore and then ran back across the exit ramp into the path of Goss\u2019 dump truck. Thus, none of Jennings\u2019 evidence about the State directing an allegedly improper ramp crossing into the gore, or the methods used to train inmates or protect them while crossing the ramp into the gore and while working in the gore constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>evidence from which the jury could reasonably determine that State personnel were negligent. Accordingly, the court properly granted the State\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">V. MTCA Damage Cap</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Although conceding the issue was moot as a result of his ruling on the State\u2019s Motion for JNOV, the circuit judge went on to interpret the language of SG \u00a7 12\u2014104(a)(2), which provides that under the MTCA, \u201c[t]he liability of the State and its units may not exceed $200,000 to a single claimant for injuries arising from a single incident or occurrence.\u201d The court concluded that under this provision, if the State were liable, a damage award would be limited to $200,000 despite the presence of multiple plaintiffs in the case. The court focused on the fact that there was one victim and one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Appellees and Amicus Curiae Maryland Association for Justice argue that the plain language of \u00a7 12\u2014104(a)(2) establishes the cap for each \u201cclaimant\u201d and that this case involves multiple claimants who are each entitled to a $200,000 award. The State emphasizes the word \u201csingle\u201d in the statute and relies on a regulation of the State Treasurer, COMAR 25.02.02.02(D)(1) (\u201c[A]ll persons claiming damages from ... [bjodily injury to, or the death of, any one person shall be considered to be one claimant\u201d) and decades of State Budget Bill language declaring that the appropriation of State monies for MTCA judgments is \u201climited by State Treasurer\u2019s regulations\u201d to payments of no more than $200,000 to a single claimant for injuries arising from a single incident or occurrence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Chapter 482, <em>Laws of 2010 </em>at Section 9(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The parties have not devoted a great deal of attention to the impact of this budget bill language and no one has argued that a limitation like Section 9(A) would constitute impermissible \u201clegislating in the budget.\u201d <em>See Bayne v. Secretary of State, </em>283 Md. 560, 576, 392 A.2d 67 (1978) (Although the budget bill is a \u201claw\u201d under Article III, \u00a7 52 of the Maryland Constitution, a budget condition may not amend substantive legislation).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Needless to say, our affirmance of the circuit court\u2019s granting of the State\u2019s motion for JNOV obviates any need to address these important questions. We will not consider them prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED. FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT; ONE-FIFTH OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID BY CROSS-APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. A wrongful death action is authorized by CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3-901-3-904. The statutory sources for a survival action are CJP \u00a7 6-401 and Md.Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts Article \u00a7 7-401(y).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">. For ease of reference, we will use the term \"appellees\u201d to refer to these parties, who were the plaintiffs below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">. A gore is a narrow, triangular area of land where an exit lane veers away from the travel portion of the lane and becomes an exit ramp.

Section 13-919(c)(2) provides that the maximum gross weight limitation for a four-axle dump truck is 70,000 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. Under \u00a7 11\u2014108(b), the cap increases by $15,000 each year. The $680,000 figure was the one applied at the time of this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. Although acknowledging that the issue was moot, the circuit court addressed arguments concerning the MTCA damage cap, finding that if State liability were imposed in this case, it could not exceed $200,000:</p>\n<p id=\"ARs\">If you start from the theory that the State has sovereign immunity, then any recovery has to come by statute, and starting with no recovery and then moving to whatever the statute gives you would appear to me that there has to be something clear and unambiguous in the statute that would make this a multiple cap ... or a multiple of $200,000. I don\u2019t see that. When I see a single claimant per occurrence if Mr. Goss had hit three people, for example, then we would have three claimants. In fact, he hit one person. I don\u2019t have to g\u00e9t to the issue, but it seems to be clear that the $200,000 cap would apply if the State were negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b185-13\">. The State has abandoned its cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">. We note briefly that the cases upon which Goss relies are inapplicable to the facts at hand.

Pruitt, </em>187 Md. 174, 49 A.2d 537 (1946), we are not asked to decide whether the evidence was sufficient to raise the issue of vehicle speed as a jury question. And in <em>E.H. Koester Bakery Co. v. Poller, </em>187 Md. 324, 332, 50 A.2d 234 (1946), the cause of a collision between a streetcar and a truck was \"clearly the unexpected, and unforeseeable, entry of the truck upon the tracks at a point where the collision could not have been avoided.\u201d Given the facts before us, we cannot state with similar decisiveness that Jennings\u2019 entry onto the exit ramp was as \"clearly\u201d unforeseeable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">. Because we find that these records were properly admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, we need not address whether they were also properly admitted under the public records exception. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-803(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. This Court has also noted these key differences between survival and wrongful death actions in <em>Jones v. Flood, </em>118 Md.App. 217, 702 A.2d 440 (1997):</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">In Maryland, two separate actions arise from a death caused by the negligence of another: a survival action and a wrongful death action. In a wrongful death action, specified persons may recover for injury to them as a result of the death of the tort victim. In a survival action, the personal representative may bring suit to recover for pain and suffering sustained by the decedent between the time of injury and death....</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Although originating in the same wrongful act or neglect, the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being embraced in the other. One is for the wrong to the injured person and is confined to his personal loss and suffering before he died, while the other is for the wrong to the beneficiaries and is confined to their pecuniary loss through his death. One begins where the other ends, and a recovery upon both in the same action is not a double recovery for a single wrong but a single recovery for a double wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 702 A.2d 440. (Citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b193-13\">. For a comprehensive discussion of the legislative history of the 1994 legislation, <em>see Green v.

Our holding is likewise not inconsistent with the decisions in <em>Figgie International, Inc. v. Tognocchi, </em>96 Md.App. 228, 624 A.2d 1285 (1993), and <em>John Crane, Inc. v. Scribner, </em>369 Md. 369, 800 A.2d 727 (2002). In <em>Figgie, </em>which was tried before <em>Streidel </em>was decided, a manufacturer unsuccessfully argued in the circuit court that awards in a survival and wrongful death action should have been aggregated for purposes of applying the cap. 96 Md.App. at 235, 244, 624 A.2d 1285. Because by the time the case arrived here, <em>Streidel </em>had been decided and the 1994 legislation was not yet in place, we remanded the case for the circuit court to reinstate the full damage verdict and expressed no view on the aggregation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In <em>Scribner, </em>a post <em>-Streidel </em>mesothelioma case, a circuit court applied the cap separately to damage awards in a wrongful death action and a survival action. After indicating that the wrongful death damages were appropriately capped under the 1994 legislation, the Court determined that damages in the survival action were impermissibly capped because the injury occurred before the enactment of the 1986 statute. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 620 A.2d 905. At no time did the Court suggest that if the cap had applied to the survival action, the two awards would have to have been aggregated and subjected to a single cap.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
