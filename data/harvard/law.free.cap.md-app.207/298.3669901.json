On April 27, 2011, appellant sought a continuance in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County so that appellant\u2019s alleged juvenile co-perpetrator, Jerquan H., could testify at trial. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance, and, following a two-day jury trial, appellant was found guilty of first degree burglary and was acquitted of conspiracy to commit first degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">On May 9, 2011, appellant moved for a new trial on three grounds: (1) the verdict was \u201cirreconcilably inconsistent\u201d; (2) the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance violated his Sixth Amendment rights; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the first degree burglary conviction. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial in an order dated May 31, 2011. On June 15, 2011, appellant was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but 18 months suspended, and five years probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">On appeal, appellant presents three questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">II. Did the trial court violate appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights when it admitted an audiotape of Jerquan\u2019s interrogation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">III. Was the evidence legally insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for first degree burglary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">For the reasons set forth herein, we answer all of the above questions in the negative and therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>The Incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Because appellant is challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction for first degree burglary, we review and recite the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">On December 29, 2010, Mildred Detwiler called 911 to report that two men were breaking into her house. Detwiler testified at trial that \u201ctwo young black men\u201d rang her doorbell at approximately 11:30 a.m., and when she did not answer, she observed the two men walk around to the back of her house. As Detwiler walked to the back of her house, she saw one of the men attempt to push up on the dining room window in the back of the house, and then saw both of them walk around to the back porch and look through the lattice underneath the porch. Both men then walked onto the deck and looked at two other windows. While one man stayed on the deck, the other walked up the steps to her back porch screen door and pushed his hand through the screen on the bottom of the door. According to Detwiler, after pushing his hand through the screen, the man was \u201cfeeling up the side of the [ ] door to see ... what was holding the door\u201d and \u201cfound the latch on the door.\u201d While this was occurring, the other man was \u201cjust standing\u201d on the deck. Detwiler called 911 and went across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the street to her neighbor\u2019s home. Once Detwiler arrived at her neighbor\u2019s home, the police arrived \u201calmost immediately,\u201d and she observed a police officer jump out of his car and start running.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Officer Michael Kane responded to Detwiler\u2019s 911 call and, upon arrival, observed two \u201cblack male subjects standing on the side yard.\u201d Officer Kane made eye contact with the two men, who were walking toward him, and told them to stop. At this point, the two men turned and ran in the opposite direction and Officer Kane pursued them. Officer Mauricio Veiga was off-duty in the area and observed two men running and \u201clooking back at the cruiser\u201d driven by Officer Kane. Officer Veiga pursued the two men and saw them run into the backyard of a townhouse, bang on the sliding glass door, look back, and then gain entry into the house. After verifying the address of the townhouse, Officer Veiga called for assistance and, eventually, the two men came out of the townhouse in different clothing. The two men, appellant and Jerquan, who was then 17 years old, were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Following their arrest, appellant and Jerquan provided separate recorded statements to Detective Thomas Dufek. In his statement, Jerquan initially denied any \u2022wrongdoing, but later stated that \u201cwe did crawl through the screen,\u201d but \u201cI didn\u2019t try to break in\u201d and \u201cI wasn\u2019t never going to go in the house.\u201d Jerquan also stated that \u201cI just crawled through the door\u201d and that appellant was \u201cnot really in this.\u201d In recounting the events of that day, Jerquan used both \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cI.\u201d In his statement, appellant said that their \u201cintentions [weren\u2019t] to hurt [any]body,\u201d that they did not think anybody was home, and that they \u201cmessed up\u201d and \u201c[were] leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\n<em>Motion for a Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Appellant\u2019s trial was scheduled for April 27, 2011, while Jerquan\u2019s juvenile proceedings were scheduled for June 28, 2011. On the first day of appellant\u2019s trial, defense counsel moved for a continuance before the Administrative Judge, because Jerquan, who \u201cstill ha[d] a 5th Amendment privilege,\u201d refused to testify until after his adjudication. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>defense counsel, Jerquan would testify that appellant \u201chad no involvement in this incident.\u201d The State opposed the continuance and offered to stipulate to the contents of Jerquan\u2019s statement, which the State characterized as both exculpatory and incriminating. The State also cited to Maryland Rule 2-508(c), a rule of civil procedure regarding continuances and absent witnesses, for the proposition that, if \u201cthe parties are willing to stipulate what the actual witness would testify to, the Court may deny the motion.\u201d Defense counsel and the State were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the stipulation and on a new trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Administrative Judge denied the motion for a continuance. In doing so, the court found that Jerquan was not \u201cabsent\u201d under Rule 2-508(c) and that the State was \u201cwilling to stipulate to substantially everything that [defense counsel] wanted [Jerquan] to have said if he didn\u2019t assert the 5th [Amendment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>The Trial and Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">At the end of the first day of trial, the State indicated that it planned to introduce an audiotape of Jerquan\u2019s interrogation. In response, defense counsel stated: \u201cI\u2019m accepting the statement being played, but I\u2019m not giving up any rights that I had as a result of the continuance, when I wanted the live body here.\u201d The State then indicated that it planned to play the interrogation as part of its case-in-chief, and the trial judge stated that it would come in \u201csince both sides want it.\u201d Jerquan was then called to testify and invoked his Fifth Amendment right to silence, and the court found him to be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The next day, the State introduced into evidence the audiotape of Jerquan\u2019s interrogation during its direct examination of Detective Dufek. The State also played a portion of the audiotape of appellant\u2019s interrogation. When each of these audiotapes were offered into evidence, defense counsel stated that he had \u201c[n]o objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief and at the close of all evidence, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal; both motions were denied. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of first degree burglary and not guilty on the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree burglary. On May 9, 2011, appellant moved for a new trial, which was denied on May 31, 2011. The court also denied appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As previously stated, on June 15, 2011, appellant was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but 18 months suspended, and five years probation upon release. This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth herein to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court denied his rights under the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights when it denied his motion for a continuance to obtain Jerquan\u2019s exculpatory testimony. According to appellant, under <em>Jackson v. State, </em>214 Md. 454, 459, 135 A.2d 638 (1957), a trial court abuses its discretion in denying a continuance when the requesting party has shown: (1) \u201cthat he had a reasonable expectation of securing the evidence of the absent witness or witnesses within some reasonable time\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the evidence was competent and material, and he believed that the case could not be fairly tried without it\u201d; and (3) \u201cthat he had made diligent and proper efforts to secure the evidence\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Appellant argues that he made a sufficient showing of each of the <em>Jackson </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">First, appellant argues that \u201c[t]here was a reasonable likelihood that [Jerquan] would have been available within a reasonable amount of time.\u201d In support of this proposition, appellant notes that Jerquan\u2019s trial was scheduled for the end of June 2011, two months after appellant\u2019s trial date. Appellant claims that \u201cthere was a reasonable likelihood that [Jerquan] would cease to have a Fifth Amendment basis for refusing to testify after that point.\u201d Because \u201cthe alleged co-perpetrator was likely to have the charges against him resolved within a timely period,\u201d appellant concludes that \u201ca continuance was entirely reasonable and warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">With respect to the second <em>Jackson </em>criteria, appellant argues that \u201c[t]he case could not be fairly tried without [Jerquan]\u2019s testimony,\u201d as the testimony \u201cwould have confirmed the heart of the defense ... that [appellant] was present, but not a participant in the burglary.\u201d According to appellant, Jerquan\u2019s recorded interrogation was not an \u201cadequate substitute for [appellant\u2019s] right to call [Jerquan] as a live witness,\u201d because: (1) defense counsel\u2019s proffer of Jerquan\u2019s likely testimony \u201cwas more exculpatory than the tape alone\u201d; (2) \u201ca videotape is not an adequate or constitutionally sufficient substitute for live testimony\u201d; and (3) Jerquan would have been able to clarify his inculpatory use of \u201cwe\u201d in his videotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Finally, appellant asserts that defense counsel was diligent in his efforts to secure Jerquan\u2019s testimony. Appellant notes that defense counsel prepared a subpoena and contacted Jerquan\u2019s mother prior to trial, and that Jerquan was already under subpoena by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In response, the State argues that \u201c[t]he trial court was within its discretion in denying a defense continuance request.\u201d With respect to the three <em>Jackson </em>requirements, the State makes the following arguments: (1) appellant failed to show that he had a reasonable expectation of securing Jerquan\u2019s live testimony in a reasonable time, because one codefendant does not have the right to be tried before or after another co-defendant and Jerquan was not going to trial for two months and had many available remedies to exhaust before he could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence; (2) Jerquan\u2019s testimony was not \u201cnecessary,\u201d as it \u201cwould be substantially the same as his recorded statement to the police\u201d; and (3) it is unclear whether appellant subpoenaed Jerquan prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201cThe decision of whether to grant a request for continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 329, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006) (citing <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 706, 759 A.2d 764 (2000)). A trial court\u2019s ruling on a continuance will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion, which was prejudicial to the party requesting the continuance. <em>Jackson, </em>214 Md. at 459, 135 A.2d 638. To show an abuse of discretion, the party that requested the continuance must show: (1) \u201cthat he had a reasonable expectation of securing the evidence of the absent witness or witnesses within some reasonable time\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the evidence was competent and material, and he believed that the case could not be fairly tried without it\u201d; <em>and </em>(3) \u201cthat he had made diligent and proper efforts to secure the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Fontaine v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 275, 298, 759 A.2d 1136 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In our view, appellant failed to carry his burden to show (1) that he had a reasonable expectation that Jerquan would testify within some reasonable time, and (2) that the case \u201ccould not be fairly tried\u201d without Jerquan\u2019s live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Under <em>Jackson, </em>the first factor that appellant must show in order to be entitled to a continuance is that \u201che had a reasonable expectation of securing the evidence of the absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>witness or witnesses within some reasonable time.\u201d 214 Md. at 459, 135 A.2d 638. Here, it is undisputed that Jerquan was not going to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege and testify at appellant\u2019s trial. In <em>Tann v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 544, 548, 406 A.2d 448 (1979), this Court held \u201cthat where the absent witness is also a co-defendant and there is no showing that he will waive his privilege against self-incrimination and exonerate the appellant, the trial judge may deny the postponement of a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Appellant, nevertheless, asserts that, because Jerquan\u2019s trial was scheduled only two months after appellant\u2019s trial, \u201cthere was a reasonable likelihood that [Jerquan] would cease to have a Fifth Amendment basis for refusing to testify after that point.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention overlooks the fact that Jerquan\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege would not end with his trial, unless he was found not involved. If Jerquan was found involved, his Fifth Amendment privilege would continue through disposition and <em>all subsequent appeals. </em>Any appeal to this Court could take anywhere from nine months to over a year. At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance, there was no indication that Jerquan was going to enter a plea of involved. Therefore, because Jerquan was not going to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege to testify at appellant\u2019s trial and there was no indication that he would enter a plea of involved, we conclude that appellant failed to show that Jerquan would be available to testify \u201cwithin some reasonable time.\u201d <em>See Jackson, </em>214 Md. at 459, 135 A.2d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Regarding the second <em>Jackson </em>factor, the State advised the trial court, at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance, that it was willing to stipulate to the entirety of Jerquan\u2019s recorded interview. Defense counsel responded, however, that \u201c[t]here\u2019s lots more to it than just the bare statement.\u201d The following colloquy then ensued among the court, defense counsel, and the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">THE COURT: ... So, the reason I\u2019m asking is if there is a specific proffer of testimony I\u2019ll be glad to, you know, hear that and see if the State will stipulate to it. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>there\u2019s not a specific proffer of testimony, it seems to me that there\u2019s a pretty comprehensive statement made by this potential witness and that that statement seemed to cover the Defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor\u2014I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">THE COURT: So, absent some specific proffer of something that\u2019s not in that statement that the State is not willing to stipulate to, I\u2019m inclined to deny the request for a postponement, so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, I can supply the date\u2014 Just one\u2014The Court\u2019s indulgence. That my client and what would be the co-defendant spent the night together. That they were together the entire day before this event occurred. That there was no discussion between them whatsoever about breaking into anyone\u2019s house, including the particular victim in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">That my client was merely just standing there. That the whole idea in breaking into the house was solely that of the juvenile codefendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Except for the last statement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">THE COURT: All right, well hold on a second. And are you telling, are you representing to me that you have a good faith basis to represent that that would be the testimony of this witness were he to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I do based on the statement, based on conversations that I\u2019ve had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">THE COURT: All right. And [prosecutor], you take exception to some part of that proffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: I wouldn\u2019t, I have no problem with everything [defense counsel] said up to the point where he said, \u201cand the whole idea was by [Jerquan],\u201d and I don\u2019t think, he can state the last quote again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And was solely, I think I said it was solely his idea and my client had no involvement with it whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you can, again, if you take out that last part I\u2019ll stipulate. I think he said seven or eight things. That last part, how could we, you know, I can\u2019t stipulate to that because you know, [appellant] is on the scene too. To put that information in front of the jury, and I don\u2019t think, I think defense counsel may have a good faith belief to say that, but that\u2019s kind of just a defense, with all due respect to Professor Drew, that\u2019s a defense attorney just trying to across the board make a statement to influence the jury that will be sitting in a box in a couple of hours or a couple of months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: But I agree with everything up to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">THE COURT: Well, the \u201cno involvement whatsoever\u201d it ' seems to me is, you know, painting with a brush. The specifics are you said that he didn\u2019t plan it. He didn\u2019t participate in it. They didn\u2019t discuss it. And if the State is willing to stipulate that that would be the statement of this witness I think that\u2019s sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And the idea was the juvenile\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">THE COURT: [The prosecutor] says that that\u2019s part of his stipulation, if I understood it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">Yes, but [defense counsel is] going beyond what\u2019s in the interview. [Defense counsel] is saying if I call him to testify he would say X. So, it\u2019s not just, he\u2019s not limiting it to what\u2019s in that interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: In the interview at one point [Jerquan] says, \u201cI was the one who crawled through the screen. My cousin didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d I mean, that is the essence of the defense. And he says in the interview, \u201cMy intention was just to look in the house.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>And he talks about I, I, I. He basically in the interview he says these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cMy cousin\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d you know, \u201cmy cousin [ (appellant) ] didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d So, I think that covers it when he says, \u201cmy cousin didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d To go beyond it and take that statement and say it five more times, you know, I am willing to stipulate ... but I\u2019m not willing to take that one statement and have it parsed into 10 different ways to say it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Those are pretty powerful words. [Jerquan] says, \u201cI was the one who crawled through the screen. My cousin [ (appellant) ] didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I can go as far as to stipulate to everything he said, except to say that the juvenile would have said he wasn\u2019t involved in any way because the juvenile does say that they were together. They rang the doorbell together. They were present at the scene. So, I\u2019m willing to go almost the whole distance, but I just want some limiting thing so the door, open the door but some limiting thing so the jury won\u2019t hear that not only did, would this person have said he didn\u2019t do anything but that he wasn\u2019t involved and he wasn\u2019t present and there was no conversation. You know, the presence issue is very important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">When defense counsel refused to accept the State\u2019s stipulation and was unable to agree upon a trial date with the State within the <em>Hicks </em>rule, the Administrative Judge referred back to Maryland Rule 2-508(c). The court concluded that Jerquan was not \u201cabsent\u201d under the rule and denied the continuance. Defense counsel then noted an objection followed by the court\u2019s response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: For the record we are objecting. It would violate my client\u2019s 6th amendment right to a fair trial, to call witnesses, and to present a defense in this case; for what that\u2019s worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>THE COURT: All right, I\u2019ll respectfully disagree. I think that [Jerquan] is not absent and I think that the State is willing to stipulate to substantially everything that you wanted the witness to have said if he didn\u2019t assert the 5th [Amendment]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Based upon our review of the above transcript, defense counsel\u2019s proffer was insufficient to show that there was a material difference between Jerquan\u2019s potential live testimony and the content of Jerquan\u2019s recorded interview. The Administrative Judge observed that the State, which was relying on the content of Jerquan\u2019s recorded interview, was \u201cwilling to stipulate to substantially everything\u201d in defense counsel\u2019s proffer. The State admitted that the recorded interview contained exculpatory statements with respect to appellant, which was \u201cthe essence of the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">There were apparently only two statements to which the State would not stipulate. First: \u201c[T]he whole idea in breaking into this house was solely that of [Jerquan].\u201d That statement, however, was essentially contained in Jerquan\u2019s interview, wherein Jerquan stated that \u201che\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] not really in this.\u201d Second: Appellant \u201chad no involvement with it whatsoever.\u201d As the prosecutor correctly noted, that statement was contradicted by Jerquan\u2019s recorded interview. In the interview, Jerquan tells the detective that he and appellant were together at the scene of the crime\u2014they were together on the deck in the back of the victim\u2019s house; they left together; they immediately encountered the police; and they ran. Because there was no material evidence in addition to, and not contradicted by, the evidence contained in the recorded interview, defense counsel failed to show how the case \u201ccould not be fairly tried\u201d without the live testimony of Jerquan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>For the aforementioned reasons, appellant did not meet his burden to show all three <em>Jackson </em>criteria, and the trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Appellant argues that the audiotape of Jerquan\u2019s interview, offered by the State in its case-in-chief, was inadmissible testimonial evidence under <em>Crawford. </em>Appellant claims that the audiotape was prejudicial to him in two ways: (1) the statements implied that appellant aided Jerquan in the burglary; and (2) the audiotape provided the prosecution with evidence that Jerquan intended to commit a theft. Although appellant concedes that he did not object to the admission of the audiotape, appellant maintains that he did not consent to its admission, because he \u201ccould only present [Jerquan\u2019s] exculpatory statements\u2014which were the heart of his defense\u2014by waiving his rights under <em>Crawford.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even if appellant did waive his right to contest the admission of the audiotape on appeal, appellant argues that the <em>Crawford </em>error was \u201csufficiently plain and sufficiently prejudicial to merit reversal on plain[ ]error review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The State\u2019s response is two-fold: (1) appellant both consented to the introduction of the audiotape by the State and failed to object to its introduction, which constitutes a waiver of any error on appeal; and (2) even if the audiotape was admitted in error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The State disputes that appellant was forced to waive his Sixth Amendment rights, noting that the \u201csubstance of [appellant\u2019s] appellate complaint on this issue is not that the tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>was introduced, but that it was introduced by the State, and not by [appellant] himself.\u201d The State further argues that any error from playing the statement as part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief was harmless, because the statement would have been introduced by appellant \u201ca few moments later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Under Maryland Rule 4-323, \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. <em>Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Moreover, under Rule 8-131(a), an appellate court will not decide an issue unless it plainly appears to have been raised in or decided by the trial court. Thus, under Rules 4-323 and 8-131, unless the record reveals an objection by trial counsel to the admission of a particular piece of evidence, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Acquah v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 29, 43, 686 A.2d 690 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In the instant case, when the State introduced an audiotape of Jerquan\u2019s interview into evidence, defense counsel did not object to its admission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Detective Dufek, I\u2019m showing you what\u2019s been marked as State\u2019s Exhibit 13. Could you tell me what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">[DETECTIVE]: It\u2019s a DVD copy of an interview that I conducted with Jerquan [ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And when did you conduct that interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">[DETECTIVE]: On December 29th of 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, Your Honor, I\u2019d like to move and play State\u2019s Exhibit 13 into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">THE COURT: Any objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">THE COURT: It\u2019s received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">Furthermore, appellant consented to the admission of the audiotape. At the end of the first day of trial, the trial court asked what evidence the State would be presenting the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>day. The State indicated that it intended to introduce Jerquan\u2019s interview. After hearing a description of the interview, the trial court asked defense counsel if he wanted the entire interview to be played:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">THE COURT: So, the State wants the entire statement. How about you? We started this that you wanted at least a piece of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I, I\u2014okay. I\u2019m accepting the statement being played, but I\u2019m not giving up any rights that I had as a result of the continuance, when I wanted a live body here. So, yes, I want the entire statement in answer to your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">THE COURT: Does [the] State want to play the statement in it\u2019s case-in-chief?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">THE COURT: Okay. So, what else do I need to do? I mean, I can, I can let him invoke. He\u2019ll invoke. He\u2019ll be unavailable. I\u2019ll come in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Under that rule [of evidence 5-804],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">THE COURT:\u2014since both sides want it. There\u2019s something in it for everybody, as I\u2019m hearing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">The next day, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">THE COURT: What does the State have left, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, we are going to play the 9-1-1 tape which is about two minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-16\">Four minutes, excuse me, four minutes. Then we\u2019re going to call on Detective Dufek. We\u2019re going to ask him a few questions. We\u2019re going to play the portions of the statements we\u2019ve agreed to which are probably about 15 minutes each. One of Jerquan [ ] and one of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>THE COURT: Okay, [defense counsel], what are you anticipating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m not anticipating doing anything else other than this statement that\u2019s played in the State\u2019s case in chief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Because appellant failed to object and consented to the admission of the audiotape into evidence, appellant\u2019s argument on appeal that its admission violated his Sixth Amendment rights is unpreserved. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 4-323, 8\u2014131(a); <em>Jefferson v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 190, 200, 4 A.3d 17 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Moreover, even if appellant\u2019s objection had been preserved, any \u201cerror\u201d from the admission of the interview was harmless. \u201cReversible error will be found and a new trial warranted <em>only </em>if the error was likely to have affected the verdict below.... If [the error] is merely harmless error, [then] the judgment will stand.\u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 160, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999) (citations and quotations omitted) (alterations in original). Defense counsel indicated that it wanted the \u201centire statement\u201d to be played and did not anticipate introducing any additional evidence in his case \u201cother than this statement that\u2019s played in the State\u2019s case[-]in[-] chief.\u201d Furthermore, appellant\u2019s only stated reservation against the admission of the audiotape was to preserve any \u201crights that [he] had as a result of the continuance, when [he] wanted a live body here.\u201d Thus the admission of the audiotape during the State\u2019s case-in-chief was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Finally, appellant argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for first degree burglary. Appellant asserts that there was no evidence of an agreement between appellant and Jerquan, and \u201cmere physical presence is not, by itself, sufficient to prove guilt under an aiding and abetting theory.\u201d Furthermore, appellant contends that, by acquitting him of the conspiracy charge, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>jury necessarily determined that [appellant] did not enter into any agreement with [Jerquan] to assist him in the commission of a burglary,\u201d and that \u201cthe burglary was aborted long before any act of theft was attempted.\u201d Appellant concludes that the evidence cannot support a conviction for first degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The State responds that \u201cthe fact that a jury acquitted [appellant] of conspiracy is irrelevant,\u201d and the issue is \u201cwhether there was sufficient evidence presented that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that [appellant] was guilty of burglary, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Specifically, the State contends that the evidence adduced at trial \u201csupported an inference that Jerquan and [appellant] had conspired to burglarize [the victim\u2019s] home, and that [appellant] at the very least assisted Jerquan when they first \u2018cased\u2019 and then broke into the home.\u201d The State also claims that appellant\u2019s flight from the home and Detwiler\u2019s testimony regarding the behavior of Jerquan and appellant \u201cgave rise to the permissive inference that [appellant] ... was aware of what Jerquan was attempting and was assisting him in his endeavor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We review a claim for insufficiency of the evidence to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 184, 999 A.2d 986 (2010) (citations and quotations omitted). Throughout this inquiry, \u201c[w]e do not re-weigh the evidence, but we do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial,\u201d and \u201c[a] valid conviction may be based solely on circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 430, 842 A.2d 716 (2004) (citations and quotations omitted). Finally, a \u201creview of a claim of insufficiency is available only for the reasons given by appellant in his motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 153, 159, 926 A.2d 805 (2007) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">First degree burglary is defined as \u201cbreaking] and entering] the dwelling of another with the intent to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>theft or a crime of violence.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 6-202(a). If the State proceeds under a theory of aiding and abetting, the State must present evidence that the alleged aider and abettor participated by \u201cknowingly associating with the criminal venture with the intent to help commit the crime, being present when the crime is committed, and seeking, by some act, to make the crime succeed.\u201d <em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions </em>\u00a7 6:01.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant argued that there was no evidence that appellant aided or abetted Jerquan in the commission of the burglary. According to appellant, there was \u201cabsolutely no testimony that [appellant] did anything to either encourage [Jerquan], to lend support to [Jerquan], to in any way come within the definition of an aider and an abetter.\u201d Instead, appellant claimed that, \u201cat best, he was present,\u201d but \u201c[t]here has to be more than mere presence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We disagree and hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that appellant aided and abetted Jerquan in the commission of first degree burglary. If believed by the jury, there was sufficient evidence that appellant (1) knowingly associated with Jerquan with the intent to help commit the burglary, (2) was present at the scene of the incident, and (3) acted to \u201cmake the crime succeed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In her testimony at trial, Detwiler stated that she observed \u201ctwo young black men\u201d ring her front doorbell and walk to the back of her house, look through the lattice underneath her porch, go up on the deck, and look into two of her windows. Detwiler also saw one of the men attempt to push up on her dining room window unsuccessfully. Detwiler then saw one of the men stand on the deck while the other walked up to the porch door and pushed his hand through the screen. These two men then ran when confronted by Officer Kane and changed clothes before being arrested. The suspects were later identified as appellant and Jerquan.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Appellant\u2019s statements from his interrogation also supported an inference that appellant was involved in the burgla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ry and was not merely present at the scene of the crime. Appellant stated that he and Jerquan did not know that anybody was home and that their \u201cintentions [weren\u2019t] to hurt [anybody], and that Detwiler \u201cdidn\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Finally, Jerquan\u2019s statements from his interview supported a finding of appellant\u2019s involvement in the burglary. Although Jerquan stated that appellant was \u201cnot really in this,\u201d Jerquan also used the word \u201cwe\u201d multiple times in describing the incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">[DETECTIVE]: The police come to your house prior to you getting back, what happened, where were you all at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">[JERQUAN]: We was at, standing outside getting a cigarette.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[DETECTIVE]: So you guys were walking around. Who was the other guy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">[JERQUAN]: Me and, I mean he\u2019s not, you know what I mean, he\u2019s not really in this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">[JERQUAN]: Officer, look, we did crawl through the screen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">[DETECTIVE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">[JERQUAN]: But I didn\u2019t try to break in. I just looked, I just looked through the door honestly. I just looked in her back room and then we left because I said no, I\u2019m not doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">[DETECTIVE]: Yeah, show me (unintelligible) the back porch, what happened there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">[JERQUAN]: When I got in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">[DETECTIVE]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">[JERQUAN]: I mean, I just crawled through the door. I didn\u2019t rip it open. It was already broken at the bottom. [DETECTIVE]: The screen was already broken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>[JERQUAN]: Yeah, the (unintelligible) so I just crawled through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">[DETECTIVE]: When you got through into the inside of the screened-in part, then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">[JERQUAN]: I looked through the window like this and then I left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[DETECTIVE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[JERQUAN]: I said I\u2019m not going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">[DETECTIVE]: Okay, and then that\u2019s when you encountered the police officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">[JERQUAN]: Yeah, that\u2019s when we walked down the steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">We just ran, even though we didn\u2019t do anything, you know what I\u2019m saying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">If believed by the jury, the statements by Jerquan and appellant, as well as the testimony of Detwiler and Officers Kane and Veiga, were sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for first degree burglary on a theory of aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">. In his brief, appellant also argues that his conviction for first degree burglary should be reversed, because it was \"irreconcilably inconsistent\u201d with his acquittal on the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree burglary. Appellant has since conceded that this argument is without merit in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 recent decision in <em>McNeal v. State, </em>426 Md. 455, 44 A.3d 982 (2012), which permits factually inconsistent verdicts in criminal jury trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\">. Appellant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider any of the above three factors in denying appellant's continuance, and instead denying the motion because Jerquan was not \"absent\u201d under Maryland Rule 2-508. Appellant asserts that Rule 2-508, a rule of civil procedure, is not applicable to the instant criminal case. However, it is \"well established that an appellate court will normally affirm a trial court on a ground adequately shown by the record, even though that ground was not the one relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 503-04, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979); <em>see also Pope v. Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs of Baltimore City, </em>106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Md.App. 578, 591, 665 A.2d 713 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996) (stating that \"it is within our province to affirm the trial court if it reached the right result for the wrong reasons\u201d). As explained <em>infra, </em>because appellant did not meet his burden to show all three factors required by <em>Jackson v. State, </em>214 Md. 454, 459, 135 A.2d 638 (1957), there is a sufficient legal basis for upholding the trial court's denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">. There is no authority for the proposition that a defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial is violated where substantially similar testimony of a witness is admitted via audio or videotape instead of live in court. Moreover, to the extent that any proffered live testimony contra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>diets the witness\u2019 prior statement, such statement can be admitted as substantive evidence under Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\">. Appellant is apparently arguing that he was entitled to have the exculpatory portion of Jerquan\u2019s interview admitted into evidence, but at the same time have the incriminating statements in the interview excluded under <em>Crawford. </em>Appellant cites no authority for this proposition, nor have we found any.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
