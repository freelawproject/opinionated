The court imposed a sentence totaling twenty years imprisonment: ten years for the third degree sexual offense; ten years for false imprisonment, to be served consecutively; and ten years for the conviction of sexual solicitation of a minor, to be served concurrently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also ordered appellant to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have reordered and rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">1. Was it prejudicial error to allow the detective to remain in the courtroom as the State\u2019s representative during the victim\u2019s testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of third degree sexual offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">3. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of sexual solicitation of a minor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">4. Does sexual solicitation of a minor to engage in a third degree sexual offense merge into the third degree sexual offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">For the reasons set forth below, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for sexual solicitation of a minor, and therefore, we shall reverse that conviction, but otherwise, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The victim, K.G.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that, on June 27, 2009, she was visiting Ocean City from Kansas with her 4-H group. She was 15 years old at the time. At approximately 10:00 or 11:00 a.m., she was at a lemonade stand on the boardwalk. Appellant approached her, introduced himself as \u201cLeroy,\u201d and asked for her name. She gave him her name, and he gave her his business card, which indicated that he was a personal trainer. Finding the incident \u201cridiculous,\u201d Ms. G. laughed. about the encounter and returned to the beach with her friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">After a few hours, Ms. G. returned to the lemonade stand. A posted sign indicated that the stand was temporarily closed, but the stand worker would return in five minutes. Ms. G. decided to go into the store next door to pass the time. When she entered the store, \u201cthe guy behind the counter asked me if I was looking for Leroy, and I said no.\u201d The man then put his arm around her and tried leading her to the back of the store. Ms. G. said: \u201c[N]o, I\u2019m just going to look at these belts,\u201d and the man said \u201cokay\u201d and returned behind the counter. She had never seen the man behind the counter before.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Appellant then walked in and told Ms. G. that he had wanted to show her something earlier. She testified that appellant then \u201cled me to the back with his arm behind me, guiding me to the back, and I just kind of went with it, because I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She had no idea where he was taking her or what was happening, and appellant \u201cwas behind me and he was just kind of pushing me there, but not being really forceful but still leading me there.\u201d He did not say anything. He took her to a closet, shutting the door behind him and locking it. He then \u201cpushed me into the bathroom with him,\u201d and shut that door and locked it. The bathroom was an interior room within the closet. She described the bathroom as \u201c[rjeally, really small,\u201d \u201cvery crowded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>and really grossly dirty.\u201d There was no one else around. Appellant\u2019s body blocked the door to the bathroom, which was the only exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Once they were inside the bathroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">He had me up against the wall, and it was really small so I couldn\u2019t move around him, and he is huge compared to me. So I couldn\u2019t move around him. And he just told me that I was really beautiful. And he would try lifting up my dress that I had over my swim suit, and I told him no, and I did tell him that I was 15, because I didn\u2019t know how old he was. And I just said, I could get you in a lot of trouble for what you are doing. And he kept trying to kiss me. And he like touched my hair a lot. And he wound up lifting my dress up and putting his hand in my pants and ... fingering my vagina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">During the encounter, appellant continued telling Ms. G. that she was beautiful, and \u201che was apologizing, ... saying I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re just so beautiful.\u201d She asked him his age \u201cbecause I could see white stubble,\u201d and he had told her earlier that he was in his late twenties. Appellant then pushed her down to the toilet seat, unbuttoned his pants, and started fondling himself with his hand on the outside of his underwear. She described how the encounter ended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">He was fondling himself, and I ... kept asking him to stop, and he wouldn\u2019t, and he would just apologize. And I told him if you are so sorry you are not showing it, and he finally apologized, and ... re-did his pants, and tried kissing me again, and he pushed his face up against mine and looked in the mirror and said we look beautiful together. And then he opened the door and he led me out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The entire incident lasted approximately ten minutes. She testified that she was \u201c[tjerrified. Like, I couldn\u2019t handle the situation. I didn\u2019t know what was going to come of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">She \u201cfelt that if [she] screamed or something it would make him angry, which could have made things worse.\u201d Appellant tried talking to her and \u201cgetting my phone number, and he got my phone number by going through my phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Appellant said that he hoped to see her again. He later sent her a text message, stating \u201cgood afternoon,\u201d but she did not reply. The text message was the last contact that she had with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Detective Nicholas Simpson, a member of the Ocean City Police Department, testified that he initiated an investigation of the incident after a sexual assault complaint had been brought to his attention by the police department in Ms. G\u2019s home state. He obtained appellant\u2019s business card and then attempted to contact appellant, who declined to be interviewed. After conducting several interviews and running appellant\u2019s name through a police database, Detective Simpson was able to identify appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The State rested. Counsel for appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to all counts, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Appellant then took the stand, testifying that he had no recollection of anything that happened on the day that Ms. G. said she met him. He did not recall meeting Ms. G. During cross-examination, he stated that he would be \u201c46 in a couple of weeks,\u201d and he was 6'5\" tall, weighing 260 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Defense counsel then renewed the motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing specifically that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for third degree sexual offence and sexual solicitation of a minor. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">As indicated, the jury convicted appellant of third degree sexual offense, fourth degree sexual offense, false imprisonment, second degree assault, and sexual solicitation of a minor. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Sequestration</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">Before trial began, defense counsel asked the court to sequester the two witnesses who would be testifying for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>State, the victim and Detective Simpson. The prosecutor responded: \u201c[T]he State would ask that Detective Simpson remain in the courtroom as the State\u2019s representative. And I believe [Ms. G.] has a right to remain in the courtroom as a victim in the crime.\u201d The court denied the motion, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">During Detective Simpson\u2019s testimony, the State asked what information Detective Simpson gathered about Mr. Poole during his investigation, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">DETECTIVE SIMPSON: I was able to learn, after speaking with [Ms. G.] on the telephone and conducting a telephone interview of the story that she\u2019s basically explained to the jury this morning, she was on the boardwalk with a 4-H trip. It was her first time ever to Ocean City\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: We would object to this. This would be hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Appellant argues that the court erred in denying his motion to sequester Detective Simpson. He contends that a detective who is a State\u2019s witness should be subject to sequestration \u201cto discourage fabrication, inaccuracy and collusion.\u201d Appellant asserts that \u201cthe prejudice caused by the error is clear,\u201d arguing that the detective \u201cimproperly bolstered\u201d Ms. G\u2019s credibility with the jury by testifying that, \u201cafter speaking with [Ms. G.] on the telephone and conducting a telephone interview,\u201d he was able to learn \u201cthe story that she\u2019s basically explained to the jury this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The State contends that the trial court properly permitted Detective Simpson to remain in the courtroom as the State\u2019s representative. It points to Maryland Rule 5\u2014615(b)(2), which excludes from the sequestration requirement \u201can officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney,\u201d arguing that this rule encompasses \u201cinvestigative agents of the government in criminal cases,\u201d including Detective Simpson. The State further argues that, even if the court did err, \u201cany error is harmless,\u201d noting that Detective Simpson made only one reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>what K.G. told him, and appellant\u2019s objection on hearsay-grounds was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We agree with the State that there was no error. As explained below, the court properly denied the motion to sequester Detective Simpson pursuant to Rule 5\u2014615(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Maryland Rule 5-615(a) provides, in part, as follows: \u201cExcept as provided in sections (b) and (c) of this Rule, upon the request of a party made before testimony begins, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d The Court of Appeals has explained the purpose of this sequestration rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">The general purpose of the sequestration of witnesses \u201chas been to prevent ... [witnesses] from being taught or prompted by each other\u2019s testimony.\u201d Additionally, the object of Maryland Rule 5-615 \u201cis to prevent one prospective \"witness from being taught by hearing another\u2019s testimony; its application avoids an artificial harmony of all the testimony; it may also avoid the outright manufacture of testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\"><em>Tharp v. State, </em>362 Md. 77, 95, 763 A.2d 151 (2000) (citations omitted). <em>Accord Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 200, 388 A.2d 926 (1978) (noting that the purpose of the sequestration rule in effect at the time was \u201c \u2018to prevent a prospective witness from being taught or prompted by the testimony of another\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brown v. State, </em>272 Md. 450, 477, 325 A.2d 557 (1974)). Pursuant to Rule 5-615(a), when a party requests sequestration prior to the beginning of testimony, the court is required to grant the motion to sequester witnesses, subject to certain exceptions. <em>Tharp, </em>362 Md. at 97, 763 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Rule 5-615(b) &amp; (c) set forth the exceptions to the rule of mandatory exclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">(b) Witnesses not to be excluded. A court shall not exclude pursuant to this Rule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">(1) a party who is a natural person,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">(2) <em>an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>(3) an expert who is to render an opinion based on testimony given at the trial,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">(4) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause, such as an expert necessary to advise and assist counsel, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">(5) a victim of a crime or a delinquent act, including any representative of such a deceased or disabled victim to the extent required by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">(c) Permissive non-exclusion. The court may permit a child witness\u2019s parents or another person having a supportive relationship with the child to remain in court during the child\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Here, we address whether the State, which is not a natural person, may designate a law enforcement officer as its representative pursuant to Maryland Rule 5\u2014615(b)(2), thereby excluding that officer from the otherwise mandatory sequestration rule. This question involves an issue of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Pinkney v. State, </em>427 Md. 77, 88, 46 A.3d 413 (2012) (\u201cOur interpretation of the Maryland Rules is a question of law; as such, we review a trial court\u2019s determinations on matters of interpretation without deference.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">The Court of Appeals recently reiterated the principles we use when construing the Maryland Rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">When we interpret the Rules of Procedure, we use the same canons and principles we use to construe statutes. <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 206, 896 A.2d 973, 980 (2006); <em>Brown v. Gress, </em>378 Md. 667, 676, 838 A.2d 362, 367 (2003). In <em>Brown, </em>Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court, summarized the principles we apply as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">In our effort to discern the meaning of a rule, we look first to the words of the rule. When the words are clear and unambiguous, ordinarily we need not go any further. Only when the language of the rule is ambiguous is it necessary that we look elsewhere to ascertain legislative intent. We are also to give effect to the entire rule, neither adding, nor deleting, words in order to give it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>meaning not otherwise evident by the words actually used. Finally, we seek to give the rule a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Knox v. State, </em>404 Md. 76, 85-86, 945 A.2d 638 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Although we ordinarily end our inquiry with the text, \u201c[w]e are not ... precluded from looking at the purpose of the\u201d rule or \u201cother material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative goal or purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731 (1993) (citations and quotations omitted). This is because \u201cwe do not read the language in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 327, 872 A.2d 681 (2005). Instead, we construe the rule \u201cwithin the context of the ... scheme, considering the \u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>Accord In re Damien F., </em>182 Md.App. 546, 566, 958 A.2d 402 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">As indicated, Maryland Rule 5-615(b) states that \u201c[a] court shall not exclude pursuant to this Rule ... (2) an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney.\u201d There is no dispute that the State of Maryland qualifies as \u201ca party that is not a natural person.\u201d <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1257 (9th ed.2009) (defining \u201cperson\u201d as \u201c[a] human being,\u201d \u201c[a]lso termed <em>natural person </em>\u201d). And the legislative history of the Rule makes clear that a law enforcement officer, such as Detective Simpson, falls within the exception for an \u201cofficer or employee of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Prior to the adoption of Maryland Rule 5-615 in 1993, the sequestration rule included an exception only for an expert witness, and there was no exception for a police officer. <em>Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 197, 388 A.2d 926 (\u201csequestration of witnesses is mandatory and [ ] there is no exception in it for a principal investigator\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>[I]n Maryland no exemption from the operation of the rule on witnesses exists for a witness who is a detective or police officer assisting in the preparation or presentation of the State\u2019s case. If the State elects to have the detective or officer remain in the courtroom despite a rule on witnesses, then he may not testify in its case in chief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Nickerson v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 660, 668, 325 A.2d 149, <em>cert. denied, </em>273 Md. 722 (1974). The Court of Appeals noted that the Maryland rule was \u201cin sharp contrast\u201d to Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which had been construed to permit investigative agents to sit at counsel table throughout the trial, even if the agent was a witness. <em>Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 199 n. 2, 388 A.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In adopting Rule 5-615, years later, the Court of Appeals used language very similar to that used in Federal Rule 615. <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.Evid. 615 (mandatory sequestration rule does not authorize excluding \u201can officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person, after being designated as the party\u2019s representative by its attorney\u201d), <em>with </em>Md. Rule 5\u2014615(b)(2) (court \u201cshall not exclude\u201d an \u201cofficer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The source note for Maryland Rule 5-615 indicates that the rule \u201cis derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 615.\u201d Thus, in determining the meaning of the Maryland Rule, the interpretation of the federal rule is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>structive. <em>See Perry v. Maryland, </em>381 Md. 138, 145, 848 A.2d 631 (2004) (Where a Maryland rule of evidence is derived from a federal rule \u201cjudicial interpretations of the federal rule are persuasive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The legislative history of the federal rule makes clear the intent that an investigating officer is not subject to mandatory sequestration. The Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule 615 sets forth the Notes of the Committee on the Judiciary, which explicitly addressed the issue whether law enforcement officers fall within the \u201cofficer or employee\u201d exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">Many district courts permit government counsel to have an investigative agent at counsel table throughout the trial although the agent is or may be a witness. The practice is permitted as an exception to the rule of exclusion and compares with the situation defense counsel finds himself in\u2014he always has the client with him to consult during the trial. The investigative agent\u2019s presence may be extremely important to government counsel, especially when the case is complex or involves some specialized subject matter. The agent, too, having lived with the case for a long time, may be able to assist in meeting trial surprises where the best-prepared counsel would otherwise have difficulty. Yet, it would not seem the Government could often meet the burden under rule 615 of showing that the agent\u2019s presence is essential. Furthermore, it could be dangerous to use the agent as a witness as early in the case as possible, so that he might then help counsel as a nonwitness, since the agent\u2019s testimony could be needed in rebuttal. Using another, nonwitness agent from the same investigative agency would not generally meet government counsel\u2019s needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">This problem is solved if it is clear that investigative agents are within the group specified under the second exception made in the rule, for \u201can officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney.\u201d It is our understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>that this was the intention of the House committee. It is certainly this committee\u2019s construction of the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">Fed.R.Evid. 615 (quoting S.Rep. No. 93-1277).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Based on the legislative history of Federal Rule 615, federal courts have held that the \u201cofficer or employee\u201d exception includes a law enforcement officer, and therefore, the trial court \u201chas a right to make an exception from a general rule of sequestration in favor of the chief investigating agent of the government involved in a trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Parodi, </em>703 F.2d 768, 773 (4th Cir.1983). <em>Accord United States v.

In 1993, the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (the \u201cRules Committee\u201d), in its One Hundred Twenty-Fifth Report to the Court of Appeals, submitted proposed Rule 5-615, which included in subsection (b) the \u201cofficer or employee\u201d exception, with the following language: \u201cA court shall not exclude pursuant to this Rule ... (2) an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, <em>except that in a criminal case the State may not be so represented.\u201d </em>20 Md. Reg. 15 (July 23, 1993) (emphasis added). This language was consistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that \u201csequestration of witnesses is mandatory and [ ] there is no exception in it for a principal investigator.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 197, 388 A.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The Court of Appeals, however, deleted the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, leaving the current form of the Rule: \u201cA court shall not exclude pursuant to this Rule ... (2) an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person designated as its represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tative by its attorney.\u201d 21 Md. Reg. 1 (Jan. 7, 1994). This change occurred after the Court of Appeals held several hearings on the Rules Committee\u2019s Report on the proposed Rules of Evidence, during which arguments were made that Maryland should adopt the federal practice of permitting the chief investigator to remain at the prosecutor\u2019s table during trial to aid with criminal prosecutions. Tape of Court of Appeals Hearing (October 4, 1993). In deleting the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, which precluded the ability of the State in a criminal case to be represented by an officer or employee, the Court clearly intended to adopt the federal approach to sequestration.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Notable Maryland treatise authors similarly have construed the scope of Rule 5-615(b)(2). <em>See </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Rules of Evidence 146 (3d ed.2007) (\u201cThe Rule departs from former Rule 4-321 and the Maryland case law, <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 388 A.2d 926 ... and follows the federal rule.... Thus, the State may so designate a representative to remain in the courtroom.\u201d); Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook 99 (4th ed.2010) (Maryland Rule 5-615(b)(2) \u201ccreates a \u2018case agent\u2019 exception for criminal cases. Prosecutors are now entitled to have an \u2018advisory witness\u2019 at the trial table.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Accordingly, we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a] detective who is a State\u2019s witness is not immune to sequestration as the States\u2019s representative.\u201d We hold that a law enforcement officer involved in a criminal prosecution falls within the \u201cofficer or employee\u201d exception to the mandatory sequestration requirement of Rule 5-615(a), and pursuant to Rule 5-615(b), the officer may remain in the courtroom if designated as the State\u2019s representative. The circuit court did not err in denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to sequester Detective Simpson.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for third degree sexual offense. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>third degree sexual offense statute states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u00a7 3-307. Sexual offense in the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">(l)(i) engage in sexual contact with another without the consent of the other; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">(ii) 1. employ or display a dangerous weapon, or a physical object that the victim reasonably believes is a dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">2. suffocate, strangle, disfigure, or inflict serious physical injury on the victim or another in the course of committing the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">3. threaten, or place the victim in fear, that the victim, or an individual known to the victim, imminently will be subject to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">(4) engage in a sexual act with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old, and the person performing the sexual act is at least 21 years old....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Md.Code (2009 Supp.) \u00a7 3-307(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for third degree sexual offense focuses primarily on \u00a7 3-307(a), the portion of the statute prohibiting sexual contact without consent. He argues that, although the acts described constituted \u201csexual contact,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there was insufficient evidence that any of the aggravating factors set forth in \u00a7 3\u2014307(a)(1) were present. Appellant disagrees with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>State\u2019s argument that he placed Ms. G. in fear of \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d He asserts that, although Ms. G. testified that she \u201cfeared that [ajppellant would overpower her and continue fondling her, or commit some sexual act,\u201d this \u201cis not the legal equivalent of the \u2018fear\u2019 of \u2018serious physical injury.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">As indicated, appellant\u2019s seven page sufficiency argument is based almost entirely on \u00a7 3-307(a)(l), addressing sexual contact without consent. In one footnote, however, appellant argues that his actions did not violate \u00a7 3-307(a)(4), involving a sexual act with a victim who is 14 or 15 years old, asserting that his actions did not constitute a \u201csexual act,\u201d as defined by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The State contends that appellant\u2019s argument \u201call but ignores \u00a7 3-307(4), which classifies as a third-degree sexual offense any person over the age of 21 engaging in a sexual act with a victim who is 14 or 15 years old.\u201d With respect to the one sentence footnote, which states that there was insufficient evidence to show a violation of this statutory provision, the State argues that we should not address this issue. It notes that appellant \u201ccites no authority and makes no argument in support of [his] bald conclusion,\u201d and it contends that, because the issue was not raised below, it is not preserved for appellate review. In any event, the State argues, there was sufficient evidence to prove both prongs of third degree sexual offense: (1) that appellant engaged in sexual contact while placing Ms. G. in fear of imminent serious physical injury; and (2) that he was over the age 21 and engaged in a sexual act with a 15-year-old girl.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the third degree if he \u201cengages in a sexual act with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old, and the person performing the sexual act is at least 21 years old.\u201d Here, Ms. G. testified that, on the day of the incident, she was 15 years old, and appellant told her that he was \u201cin his late twenties.\u201d She testified that, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>sexual assault, appellant inserted his fingers into her vagina. Appellant testified in his own defense that he was 45 years old on the day of trial, making him 44 years old on the date of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Appellant does not dispute that the age requirements for a sexual offense in the third degree were satisfied, but he argues that he did not engage in a sexual act with Ms. G. A \u201csexual act\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201can act in which an object penetrates, however slightly, into another individual\u2019s genital opening .... \u201d and \u201ccan reasonably be construed to be for sexual arousal and gratification.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-301(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant states, in a single sentence in a footnote, that \u201cthis is not a case in which \u2018an <em>object ... </em>penetrates ... into another individual\u2019s genital opening.\u2019 \u201d This argument was not raised below, and it is not supported by any legal authority. Accordingly, we shall not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case tried by a jury is predicated on the refusal of the trial court to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>State v. Rich, 415 Md. </em>567, 574, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010) (quoting <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 302, 951 A.2d 87 (2008)). Maryland Rule 4-324 requires a defendant to \u201cstate with particularity all the reasons why the motion [for judgment of acquittal] should be granted.\u201d Md. Rule 4-324(a). \u201cThis means that a defendant must \u2018argue precisely the ways in which the evidence should be found wanting and the particular elements of the crime as to which the evidence is deficient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arthur v. State, </em>420 Md. 512, 522, 24 A.3d 667 (2011) (quoting <em>Starr, </em>405 Md. at 303, 951 A.2d 87). \u201cThe issue of sufficiency of evidence is not preserved when appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal is on a ground different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>than that set forth on appeal.\u201d <em>Anthony v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 119, 126, 699 A.2d 505, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 205, 703 A.2d 147 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Here, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. Appellant argued: (1) that the State had not proved any of the aggravating factors in \u00a7 3-307(a)(1); and (2) there was no evidence proving appellant\u2019s age, an element of \u00a7 3-307(a)(4). Appellant did not argue, as he does on appeal, that the State did not prove that he committed a \u201csexual act,\u201d as statutorily defined. At the close of all the evidence, after appellant testified regarding his age, defense counsel renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, stating that he was raising \u201cthe same argument.\u201d Thus, the argument that appellant makes on appeal, that there was insufficient evidence to show that his actions constituted a \u201csexual act,\u201d is unpreserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Moreover, as noted, appellant\u2019s argument in this regard is made in one sentence, in a footnote, with no supporting argument. For this reason as well, we will not consider this contention. <em>See Assateague Coastkeeper v. Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>200 Md.App. 665, 670 n. 4, 28 A.3d 178 (2011) (\u201cAppellants failed, however, to present any argument on this issue. Therefore, we will not address it.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 Md. 291, 35 A.3d 488 (2012); <em>Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, </em>150 Md.App. 604, 618, 822 A.2d 551 (refusing to address argument because appellants failed to adequately brief the argument), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 Md. 544, 831 A.2d 4 (2003). <em>Accord </em>Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5) (brief shall contain \u201c[ajrgument in support of the party\u2019s position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Appellant\u2019s next contention involves his conviction for sexual solicitation of a minor. Section 3-324 of the Criminal Law Article provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">A person may not, with the intent to commit a violation of \u00a7 3-304, \u00a7 3-306, or \u00a7 3-307 of this subtitle or \u00a7 11-304, \u00a7 11-305, or \u00a7 11-306 of this article, knowingly solicit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>minor, or a law enforcement officer posing as a minor, to engage in activities that would be unlawful for the person to engage in under \u00a7 3-304, \u00a7 3-306, or \u00a7 3-307 of this subtitle or \u00a7 11-304, \u00a7 11-305, or \u00a7 11-306 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">C.L. \u00a7 3-324(b). The statute defines \u201csolicit\u201d as \u201cto command, authorize, urge, entice, request, or advise a person by any means.... \u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-324(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of this offense. Specifically, he argues that he did not solicit Ms. G. to engage in a third degree sexual offense, but rather, according to Ms. G\u2019s testimony, \u201che simply did the acts he wanted to do.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The State contends that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of sexual solicitation of a minor. It asserts that the evidence supported a finding that appellant solicited Ms. G. \u201cby initiating contact with her, leading her into a small back room under false pretenses, and attempting to gain her agreement to engage in sexual contact with her by complimenting her appearance.\u201d It further asserts that, when Ms. G. refused, appellant \u201cused force to sexually assault her,\u201d and after that, he \u201ccontinued to try and entice [Ms. G.] into a future encounter by obtaining her telephone number, telling her that he hoped to see her again, and contacting her later that day via text message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by determining \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>Accord Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348 (2009); <em>Reeves v. State, </em>192 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Md.App. 277, 302, 994 A.2d 469 (2010). \u201cIf the evidence \u2018either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u2019 then we will affirm the conviction.\u201d <em>Bible, </em>411 Md. at 156, 982 A.2d 348 (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Even with this deferential standard of review, we agree with appellant that there was insufficient evidence that appellant solicited Ms. G. Prior to the assault in the locked room, appellant\u2019s contact with Ms. G. consisted of telling her that he wanted to show her something, putting his arm behind her back, and guiding her to the room he locked. He then told her that she was beautiful, and he touched her hair. Appellant did not \u201ccommand, authorize, urge, entice, request, or advise\u201d Ms. G. to engage in any sexual activity with him. Instead, he just acted, cornering Ms. G. and inserting his fingers in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">After the incident, appellant obtained her phone number and told her that he hoped to see her again. He later sent her a text message, which said \u201cgood afternoon.\u201d She did not reply to it. Nothing in this conduct qualifies as solicitation to engage in sexual activity. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for sexual solicitation of a minor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY AFFIRMED, IN PART, AND REVERSED, IN PART.
