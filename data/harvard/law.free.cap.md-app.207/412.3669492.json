On December 1, 1994, this Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 376, 649 A.2d 1173 (1994). On November 22, 1995, Kulbicki was again convicted, by a jury, of murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>as well as a related handgun charge. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. On December 20, 1996, this Court affirmed Kulbicki\u2019s convictions, and on April 9,1997, the Court of Appeals denied Kulbicki\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>345 Md. 236, 691 A.2d 1312 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On or about March 17, 1997, while his request for certiorari review was pending, Kulbicki filed a petition for postconviction relief. After filing several amendments and repeatedly seeking postponements of his postconviction proceedings, Kulbicki filed an amended petition for postconviction relief on April 4, 2006. Following a five-day hearing in April 2007, the circuit court denied postconviction relief through an opinion and order dated January 2, 2008. Kulbicki then filed an application for leave to appeal the denial of postconviction relief, which this Court granted on March 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"pAkB\">We have rephrased and renumbered the questions presented by Kulbicki, as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">1. Where Kulbicki alleged that his conviction was based on unreliable, false, and misleading scientific evidence, did the postconviction court correctly conclude that he did not have a cognizable due process claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">2. Where Kulbicki alleged that the State used perjured, false, and misleading expert ballistics testimony in se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>curing his conviction, did the postconviction court correctly find that he was not denied a fair trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">3. Did the postconviction court correctly conclude that Kulbicki failed to establish his ineffective assistance of counsel claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The testimony at Kulbicki\u2019s 1995 trial established that at about 8 a.m. on Sunday, January 10, 1993, Walter Kutcha was walking his dog near the archery range at Gunpowder State Park when he saw a body lying by one of the trash cans. Suspecting \u201cfoul play,\u201d Kutcha went to a park ranger\u2019s cabin and came back with Ranger Ross Harper. Upon their return, Kutcha and Ranger Harper discovered that the body was that of a deceased woman, lying on her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Officers of the Baltimore County Police Department responded to the scene at approximately 8:30 a.m. Detective William Ramsey, a member of the Baltimore County Police Department\u2019s Homicide and Missing Persons units, testified that he arrived at 10:18 a.m. and began his investigation. He observed blood on the victim\u2019s forehead, around her nose, and on the right side of her shoulder. Det. Ramsey also noted that the victim\u2019s jewelry had not been removed. Upon turning the body over, Det. Ramsey saw a wound near the back of the victim\u2019s head, but no blood on the ground underneath. Based on the leaves and debris under the victim\u2019s jacket, the position of her clothes and arms, the disturbance of the leaves and debris in an area leading toward the body, as well as the absence of bullets and shell casings on the surrounding ground, Det. Ramsey concluded that the victim had \u201cbeen killed somewhere else and taken there and ... dragged there and dumped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Det. Ramsey unzipped the victim\u2019s jacket and saw that she was wearing a Royal Farms store smock with a name tag that said \u201cGina.\u201d While Det. Ramsey was conducting his investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tion, he received a call from the Baltimore City Police Department instructing him to contact the city\u2019s Homicide Unit. Upon doing so, Det. Ramsey was informed that the city police were \u201cinvestigating a missing girl from Baltimore City.\u201d Eventually, the Baltimore City Homicide Squad arrived at the crime scene, along with \u201ca subject ... who identified the victim as Gina Marie Neuslein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Geraldine Neuslein, Gina\u2019s mother, testified that she last saw Gina on Saturday, January 9, 1993, when Gina left to walk to work at around 3:30 p.m. At about 4:10 p.m., Geraldine received a call from Gina\u2019s employer, stating that Gina never arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">During Det. Ramsey\u2019s investigation, he received \u201cinformation over the radio that there was an individual who might have some information relative to the crime.\u201d Det. Ramsey sent an officer to interview that witness, Barbara Clay. At trial, as a witness for the State, Clay testified that at approximately 3 p.m. on January 9, 1993, she and her son went to the archery club at Gunpowder State Park. As they were leaving the parking area around 4:40 p.m., she saw a black Ford pickup truck coming down the road with its headlights on. When the truck turned into the parking area, it passed parallel to Clay\u2019s vehicle, about four feet away. With her window down, Clay raised her hand, \u201cyelled and [ ] said hi.\u201d The driver of the truck \u201c[sjlowly looked at [her] full face\u201d but did not respond. Clay identified the driver as Kulbicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">After passing the truck, Clay drove about one third of a mile down the road and parked, hoping to see some deer. After waiting approximately fifteen minutes, Clay left with her son. She did not see the truck leave, nor did she see any other vehicles enter the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The next morning, Clay heard information from a television news program that prompted her to call the Baltimore County Police Department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon calling the authorities, Clay re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>layed information that was not provided on the news. Specifically, she told an officer that she \u201chad seen a white male in his mid-thirties driving a Ford longbed pickup truck\u201d at the archery range parking lot at Gunpowder State Park. Clay added that the driver had dark hair and \u201cwas wearing a dark jacket -with a contrasting lighter shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On the evening of January 13, 1993, Clay saw a television broadcast showing a man in shackles being arrested. Because of the man\u2019s \u201cvery distinctive profile, [and] very distinctive nose,\u201d Clay \u201cwithout doubt, [ ] knew that was the man that [she] saw at Gunpowder State Park.\u201d Thus, Clay called the police and told them that she \u201crecognized that man that they had arrested ... as being the man that [she] saw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Shortly after Det. Ramsey concluded his investigation at the park on January 10, 1993, he received information that prompted him to visit the home of James Kulbicki, a sergeant of the Baltimore City Police Department, to ask questions about Gina. Det. Ramsey was accompanied by his partner, Detective Robert Capel. Kulbicki told the detectives that \u201che did know Gina and has been friends with her for about four years.\u201d Without prompting, Kulbicki added that he and Gina were \u201cvery good friends, although they\u2019ve never had a sexual relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Kulbicki stated that he last saw Gina at around 3:30 p.m. on Friday, January 8, 1993, when he picked her up close to her house and drove her to work. Kulbicki also stated that he last spoke to Gina when she called him on \u201cFriday night at midnight into early Saturday morning.\u201d When Det. Capel informed Kulbicki that Gina\u2019s body was found in Baltimore County, Kulbicki said he suspected that was the case, because the detectives admitted they were from the Homicide Squad. Kulbicki did not ask where and how Gina was killed. According to Det. Capel, Kulbicki \u201cjust said he didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The detectives asked Kulbicki about an upcoming paternity hearing scheduled for the following Wednesday as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>genetic tests indicating that Kulbicki was the father of Gina\u2019s 18-month old child. In response, Kulbicki said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Well, that\u2019s absolutely impossible that I\u2019m the father. I don\u2019t believe in genetic tests. And the only reason why they\u2019d even be closest, because we\u2019re both Slavic.... I\u2019ve never had sex with her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">When the detectives first interviewed Kulbicki, his black Ford pickup truck was parked outside the house. The following day, the police returned with a warrant. They seized, among other things: Kulbicki\u2019s pickup truck, which had not been moved since the detectives\u2019 prior visit; a denim jacket taken from a hall closet; and a fully loaded .38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver with a two-inch barrel and its leather holster.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Detective Patrick Kamberger, a Crime Lab mobile technician with the Baltimore County Police Department, processed Kulbicki\u2019s truck on January 11, 1993. Det. Kamberger testified that the truck, a 1988 Ford F250, had a \u201cfilthy\u201d exterior, but \u201cinside the truck appeared to be clean.\u201d The first thing he noticed when he opened the door was \u201ca smell [of] household cleaner.\u201d According to Det. Kamberger, there was no surface dust on the dashboard or around the steering wheel, and the floorboard underneath the driver\u2019s floor mat was damp, although the mat itself was dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Det. Kamberger noticed that a piece of red plastic molding was missing from the rear passenger-side window, revealing a rubber strip that had metallic marks. Beneath the rubber strip, Det. Kamberger noticed \u201can impact area\u201d or \u201ci[n]dentation.\u201d Subsequent chemical testing of the rubber strip established that the rubber was struck by something made of lead. A piece of red plastic fitting the damaged molding area was found in the truck bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Inside the cab, there was no blood visible to the naked eye. Preliminary examination of the truck using ultraviolet light, however, indicated the possibility that blood stains were present. Therefore, Det. Kamberger requested the assistance of a serologist from the Maryland State Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The serologist, Matthew Abbott, was accepted by the circuit court as an expert in the area of forensic serology. He testified that fourteen blood stains were found on seven areas of the truck, including the driver\u2019s side door, floor mat, seat belt, bench seat, rear bench seat, rear floor mat, and underneath the rear floor mat. According to Abbott, the stains found on the cloth seat belt, the seat belt\u2019s plastic cover and tags, bench seat, underneath the bench seat, and underneath the rear floor mat were human and bore genetic markers consistent with the victim\u2019s blood and inconsistent -with Kulbicki\u2019s. Additional stains on the seat belt, seat belt patch, bench seat, back of the bench seat, rear bench seat, and rear floor mat indicated human blood, but further testing was not possible. Similarly, due to the small samples found on the driver\u2019s side door and floor mat, Abbott was able to detect the presence of blood on those areas, but could not conclude anything further.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The denim work jacket seized from Kulbicki\u2019s hall closet had what appeared to be blood stains clearly visible on the left sleeve. Det. Capel testified that when Kulbicki had reviewed the list of property being taken, he asked, \u201cThe jacket that you\u2019re taking, is that my jean work jacket?\u201d Kulbicki did not ask about any of the other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Linda Watson, a Forensic Chemist Supervisor in the Biology DNA Unit at the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, stated that she extracted DNA from the blood stain found on the jacket. After processing the sample, she concluded that \u201cthe DNA type obtained from the blood stain on the jacket matche[d] the DNA profile developed from the blood of Gina Marie Neuslein.\u201d According to Watson, the probability of a random match in the Caucasian population was one in seven million.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Assistant Medical Examiner James Locke testified that he had performed an autopsy on the victim at 9 a.m. on January 11, 1993. Locke stated that the victim, a twenty two-year-old white female, died of \u201ca contact gunshot wound to the head,\u201d and that the manner of death was homicide. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Locke, the abrasions on the victim\u2019s body and the condition of her clothing were consistent with having been dragged over the ground. Although the time of Gina\u2019s death could not be precisely determined, Locke stated that a time of \u201cfour or [five] o\u2019clock in the afternoon, January the 9th of 1993, is [ ] consistent\u201d with his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Locke testified that the fatal bullet traveled diagonally, from front to back and left to right, through Gina\u2019s head. The entrance wound had a \u201ckeyhole fracture,\u201d indicating that \u201cthe bullet entered at a very sharp angle and not directly perpendicular to the skull or to the scalp.\u201d Therefore, \u201ca portion of the skull entered into the brain and, also, a portion of the skull may have exited from the body.\u201d There was also an exit wound from which \u201ca piece of bone ... or a piece of the bullet had exited from the scalp.\u201d A fragment of the bullet was recovered from one side of the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Locke added that evidence of burning on the margin of the entrance wound indicated that the barrel of the gun was placed directly against the victim\u2019s head. Extensive bleeding and bruising under the scalp on the right side indicated that Gina\u2019s head had hit a hard surface. According to Locke, evidence from the autopsy was \u201cconsistent with the passenger of the car being shot by a driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">When police searched Kulbicki\u2019s vehicle, they found a small object near the rear passenger seat. Subsequent testing established that its major components were calcium and phosphorus, the major components of bone. The fragment also contained \u201csome lead.\u201d While vacuuming the truck, the police found three other bone chips and a smaller bone fragment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Dr. Douglas Owsley, a curator and division head for the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, examined the larger bone fragment using a \u201cstereo zoom microscope\u201d and determined that it was part of the outer layer of a human skull. According to Dr. Owsley, fractured edges indicated that \u201ca tremendous amount of traumatic force ... caused the evulsion of this bone fragment.\u201d In addition, the presence of embed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ded lead and carbon deposits was \u201cconsistent with a contact gunshot wound.\u201d Testing of the smaller bone chips also revealed metallic particles embedded in the bone, as well as soot deposits and evulsion fracturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Karen Quandt, a senior molecular biologist who was admitted as an expert in DNA profiling, testified that she performed RFLP<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DNA testing on the skull fragment and PCR<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DNA testing on the three bone chips. Four of the seven band patterns revealed by the RFLP testing matched those of Gina. Because other bands could not be visualized due to sample degradation, Quandt testified only that Gina could not be excluded as the source of the bone fragment. PCR testing, which can be performed on smaller or more degraded samples, likewise indicated that Gina could not be excluded as the source of the bone chips. According to Quandt, the frequency of the PCR type found in the bone chips was 1 in 640 among Caucasians.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The State also presented the testimony of Ernest Peele, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) who was admitted as an expert in bullet and lead pellet composition analysis, also known as Comparative Bullet-Lead Analysis (\u201cCBLA\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Peele explained that, by performing trace element analysis, CBLA allowed comparison of the bullet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>fragment recovered during the autopsy and the bullet fragment found in Kulbicki\u2019s truck, as well as six unfired cartridges seized from Kulbicki\u2019s handgun. Peele testified that the bullet fragments from Gina\u2019s brain and Kulbicki\u2019s truck exhibited \u201cthe same amounts of each and every element ... detected,\u201d and were thus \u201canalytically indistinguishable.\u201d Peele added that the results were \u201cwhat you\u2019d expect if you were examining two pieces of the same bullet, they are that close, two pieces of the same source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">After comparing one of the bullets from Kulbicki\u2019s handgun, labeled Q-6, to the bullet fragments, labeled Q-l and Q-2, Peele concluded that the Q-6 bullet was \u201cmeasurably different,\u201d but \u201cunusually close in that that\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect, unless there\u2019s some association between the two groups,\u201d such as \u201cbeing made by the same manufacturer on or about the same time.\u201d Nonetheless, Peele opined that the Q-6 was \u201cclose enough that I have seen those differences, ... but, certainly, they are also different enough that I can\u2019t really include [it] as well as I would Q-l and 2 to each other.\u201d Peele further stated that although the composition of the six unfired cartridges, labeled Q-4 through Q-9, differed, \u201cthese differences are not very large.\u201d According to Peele, the differences \u201ccan be expected\u201d as \u201cthere are usually a number of different compositions in one box.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On cross-examination, defense counsel concentrated on differentiating the unfired cartridges from the bullet fragments. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Q: [W]hen compared to Q-6, which was a bullet which was provided to you or a cartridge for your examination for comparison with Q-l and Q-2, that, you\u2019ve testified, is measurably different, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">A: Yes, sir. The amounts of arsenic and copper are slightly different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">Q: Well, slightly different, is that something else [than] measurably different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">A: No, sir. The same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Q: However, you cannot state that samples Q-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are consistent with Q-l and Q-2 as having come from the same box, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">A: Q-6 is much more so than any of the rest. Q-6 is so close that, certainly, that could have been in the same box.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Q: It, it could have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">A: Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">Q: But you\u2019re not sure of that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">A: No, sir, I\u2019m not sure of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Joseph Kopera, an examiner with the Maryland State Police Firearms Unit, was presented as an expert in the field of firearms identification. Before he was admitted as an expert, he was asked a few qualifying questions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">Q: Okay. Were you a graduate of this profession as a result of formal school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">A: There are no colleges or universities here in the United States at all that offer a degree in the field of firearms identification for ballistics. All expertise is obtained through on-the-job training. I served an apprenticeship for five years with the Baltimore City Police Department and the FBI in obtaining this expertise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">My educational background, my personal educational background is I hold a degree in engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology and, also, engineering degree from the University of Maryland here in the State of Maryland. I am on the Board of Directors for the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners, which is the certifying society of firearm examiners here in the United States. I\u2019m also on the staff at several local colleges, did teaching in the area of forensic science and criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">Q: And how many firearms-related cases do you examine per year, on the average?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>A: On the average for a 20-year period, I would examine anywhere between 1,000 to [1,200] cases, of which I would testify in court between 100 to 125 times per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">Q: Have you had an occasion in the past to qualify as an expert in firearms identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">A: Yes, I have qualified in the [s]tate of Maryland, states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Federal courts here in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">After being accepted by the court as an expert, Kopera testified that the bullet fragment found in Kulbicki\u2019s truck had cannelures, or markings, consistent with \u201ca large caliber\u201d such as .38 or larger. Kopera also stated that damage to the rubber stripping inside Kulbicki\u2019s truck was caused by a bullet fragment. According to Kopera, the bullet only ripped the area, and did not create a hole, because it \u201cwas slowed down by hitting something else prior to hitting the rubber piece.\u201d On cross-examination, Kopera testified that Kulbicki\u2019s handgun \u201chad been examined and found to be in the cleaned condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The defense presented evidence that Kulbicki was running errands in his truck on the afternoon of January 9, 1993. Numerous \"witnesses testified to seeing Kulbicki at their respective businesses sometime between 3 and 4 p.m. that day. All of those witnesses knew, had previously worked with, or were familiar with Kulbicki. In addition, Kulbicki\u2019s wife testified that Kulbicki was with her from 4:30 p.m. until he left for work at about 10:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Kulbicki, who took the stand on his own behalf, denied killing Gina.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor went over all of the evidence, \u201cfilling] in the gaps\u201d of the case with \u201cforensic science.\u201d The State\u2019s argument, which spanned thirty-three pages of transcript, included the following two paragraphs regarding Peele\u2019s and Kopera\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">From that bullet fragment, you heard from ... Mr. Kopera, who examined it and who ... told you about the cannelures ... that he saw on the bullet fragment retrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>from Gina\u2019s head which told him both of these fragments came from a .38 caliber bullet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">And then from ... Mr. Peele, the FBI Agent, we learn that compositionally when it is broken down to parts per million into that minute detail those two bullet fragments, the one from Gina\u2019s head, the one in the Defendant\u2019s truck, are the same, are the same. You can\u2019t tell one from the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">After deliberating, the jury convicted Kulbicki of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In 2006, Kulbicki filed an amended petition for postconviction relief. The circuit court conducted a hearing on the petition from April 19 through 25, 2007. Kulbicki argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">He did not receive a fair trial because the State used inaccurate, misleading and unreliable scientific evidence. He did not receive a fair trial because the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of its Brady[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] obligations. He did not receive a fair trial because his defense attorneys failed to properly perform their duties as required by the Sixth Amendment[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] of the [Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">In particular, Kulbicki challenged \u201cfour pillars\u201d of the State\u2019s ease: (1) FBI Agent Peele\u2019s conclusions based on CBLA; (2) Kopera\u2019s testimony; (3) Clay\u2019s testimony; and (4) testimony regarding DNA and serology as to bone fragments and blood found in Kulbicki\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">First, Kulbicki stated that Peele \u201ctestified extensively\u201d about CBLA, which had since been \u201cexposed as nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>than a series of speculative and exaggerated claims.\u201d Relying on <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 372, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006), a case in which the Court of Appeals held that the conclusory aspects of CBLA are not admissible under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Kulbicki argued that \u201cthe introduction of improper ballistics and firearms evidence in this case is sufficient to warrant reversal of conviction.\u201d Second, Kulbicki averred that Kopera committed perjury at the trial \u201cwhen he testified that he had attended the University of Maryland and the Rochester Institute of Technology,\u201d and when he \u201cfalsified documents in order to conceal and protect his lies.\u201d Moreover, Kulbicki alleged that Kopera\u2019s testimony \u201cwas inconsistent with his own reports and bench notes.\u201d Third, Kulbicki argued that \u201cClay\u2019s identification should have been suppressed because it was unreliable and it was based on improperly suggestive procedures.\u201d Fourth, Kulbicki challenged the validity of the DNA and serology testing that was performed. In addition to those four main contentions, Kulbicki argued that trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve issues for appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">At the postconviction hearing, Kulbicki presented the testimony and affidavits of experts in the fields of metallurgy, chemistry, firearms and ballistics, visual science, and molecular biology. William Tobin, a former metallurgist for the FBI, testified that Peele had no scientific basis for his testimony linking bullet fragments to one another on the basis of their elemental composition. According to Tobin, Peele\u2019s testimony that the bullet fragments recovered from the autopsy and Kulbicki\u2019s truck were \u201canalytically indistinguishable\u201d was \u201cnot an accurate statement.\u201d Instead, Tobin opined that the bullet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>fragments\u2019 arsenic contents differed, and therefore should have been \u201cdeclared analytically distinguishable or dissimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Kulbicki next presented evidence, and the State stipulated, that Kopera had lied about his credentials at the trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence demonstrated that Kopera did not earn degrees in engineering, as he alleged, and had never been accepted to the University of Maryland or Rochester Institute of Technology. Rather, the University of Maryland transcript in Kopera\u2019s personnel file was a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">To further discredit Kopera\u2019s testimony, Kulbicki presented the testimony of John Nixon, who was accepted as an expert in firearms and ballistics. Nixon testified that, contrary to Kopera\u2019s opinion, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be able to say\u201d what caused the damage to the rubber stripping on Kulbicki\u2019s truck window. In addition, Nixon noted that Kulbicki\u2019s handgun had a right-hand twist while the bullet fragment recovered during the autopsy had a left-hand twist. Moreover, using Kopera\u2019s measurements of the markings on the bullet fragment and Kulbicki\u2019s weapon, Nixon concluded that Kulbicki\u2019s handgun \u201cdid not fire that bullet.\u201d Citing the FBI ballistics database, Nixon testified that the bullet fragment was most likely fired from a .32 caliber weapon. Nixon added that, using Kopera\u2019s measurements, the database did not contain a single match for a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">While Nixon was on the stand, Kulbicki introduced Kopera\u2019s bench notes into evidence. Contrary to Kopera\u2019s testimony that the bullet fragments from the autopsy and Kulbicki\u2019s truck came from a \u201clarge caliber\u201d gun, Kopera\u2019s bench notes stated that the caliber for the former was \u201cmedium\u201d and that the latter \u201ccouldn\u2019t be determined.\u201d In addition, while Kopera testified that his caliber determination was based on the cannelures, his laboratory report stated that the cannelure marks had \u201cno value for comparison purposes.\u201d Kopera\u2019s testimony that Kulbicki\u2019s handgun had been \u201cin the cleaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>condition\u201d was also contradicted by his notes, which stated that the gun was \u201cdirty\u201d with \u201cresidue\u201d in the barrel and cylinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Dr. Christopher Palenik, who was admitted as an expert in microscopy and chemistry, testified that Kopera improperly conducted the test that led to his conclusion that damage to Kulbicki\u2019s window was caused by a bullet fragment. Dr. Palenik explained that, by failing to apply hydrochloric acid, Kopera did not properly complete the test for the presence of lead. Kopera\u2019s claim that he did not use hydrochloric acid because the Maryland State Police protocols did not require its use in 1993 was contradicted by the text of the protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Dr. Elizabeth Johnson, who was admitted as an expert in molecular biology and forensic DNA profiling, testified that the methodology used by the State\u2019s laboratory made it impossible to conclude that the DNA samples that were tested had been retrieved from Gina\u2019s body or from the bone fragments in the truck. Dr. Johnson opined that the bone fragments were improperly stored and handled, and the State\u2019s technicians failed to properly clean them prior to testing. As a result, Dr. Johnson believed that the State should have deemed the results \u201cinconclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">During the postconviction hearing, Kulbicki called both of his trial counsel to testify, but neither could recall specific events from the trial or their preparation, and the case file no longer existed. Patricia Hall, the lead defense counsel in Kulbicki\u2019s 1995 trial, testified that she had originally sat in a second chair capacity as defense counsel in Kulbicki\u2019s 1993 trial. John Franke, a 1988 law school graduate, assisted Hall in the 1995 trial. Franke stated that he had previously handled other criminal jury trials, but none of them involved the charge of murder in the first degree. Franke testified that at the time of the trial, he was not \u201cfamiliar with the practice of expert witnesses [preparing] bench notes in addition to their official report produced at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The State presented testimony from one witness, Michael Thomas, a firearms identification examiner with the Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>County Police Department, who was accepted by the circuit court as an expert in firearms identification. Thomas \u201ccouldn\u2019t conclude an awful lot\u201d from the bullet fragment recovered from the autopsy because it was \u201cvery mutilated and deformed.\u201d He was, however, able to say that \u201cit didn\u2019t come from a small caliber firearm.\u201d In addition, Thomas could not rule out a .38 or .32 caliber weapon. With regard to the window stripping from Kulbicki\u2019s truck, Thomas testified that he tested the rubber-like strip using hydrochloric acid, and found that it tested positive for the presence of lead. On cross-examination, Thomas acknowledged that the FBI database did not list a .38 Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson revolver as being capable of firing the bullet recovered during the autopsy. Thomas based this conclusion on a comparison of his own measurements to the database. Thomas also testified that the bullet \u201cmight have a slight left twist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">By opinion and order dated January 2, 2008, the circuit court denied Kulbicki\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. With regard to the issues raised on appeal, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">The Uniform Post-[C]onviction Procedure Act applies only to limited categories of error. Not all discoveries or developments after conviction that shed new light on the trial provide a basis for relief. Most significantly, the question of guilt or innocence is beyond the purview of post-conviction relief, as the proceedings do not serve as a substitute for appeal or a motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Of equal importance, claims of newly discovered evidence also provide no basis for post-conviction relief....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Thus, in addressing the Petitioner\u2019s claims, this Court is limited to allegations of constitutional violations, ineffective assistance of counsel, and other matters clearly governed by the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief statute. Arguments of guilt or innocence, and concerns regarding newly discovered evidence and changes in science and technology within the intervening years are simply not a proper avenue for relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Plainly, Mr. Kopera committed perjury at trial. He testified to a degree and to credentials that were patently false....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">It is equally clear that this perjury was unknown to the prosecution at the time of trial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Under the current case law in Maryland, perjury that was not known to the prosecution at the time does not provide a basis for post-conviction relief. However, this Court believes that the Maryland appellate courts would likely follow the line of cases that find that knowledge of the falsity of a statement by a state law enforcement witness is, in effect, imputed to the State. Nevertheless, there must then be a showing [of] materiality of the falsity in order to warrant relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">In analyzing the question of materiality, the issue is the likelihood that the truth would have produced a different outcome, not that knowledge that the witness was committing perjury would have impacted the outcome. This distinction is critical. Mr. Kopera\u2019s academic credentials were essentially meaningless. He was not conducting testing that required an academic degree. His professional training and experience qualified him as an expert, regardless of his academic pedigree.... There simply is no likelihood that the jury\u2019s determination would have been influenced by the fact that Mr. Kopera did not have the academic credentials he claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">Petitioner\u2019s primary focus in this claim is the introduction of evidence of [CBLA] at trial. However the challenge to this evidence does not fit into any recognized category for post-conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">CBLA ... has actually not been adequately tested to demonstrate that conclusions drawn regarding the relatedness of batches of metal can support conclusions that specific fragments came from the same bullet or batches of bullets. The Court of Appeals reached essentially this conclusion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Clemons, supra. </em>However the studies that shed light on these conclusions were not available at the time this case was tried. At the time of both the original trial [and] the re-trial, it was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community that CBLA was valid and reliable science.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">There is nothing to suggest that the State presented expert testimony that it knew was not sound. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that defense counsel was ineffective at the time of trial by failing to anticipate this scientific development____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">There simply is no basis under the post-conviction laws that accords relief under these circumstances. Generally, such claims are handled ... through a Motion for a New Trial based upon newly discovered evidence ... Clearly the bullet analysis was central to the theory of the prosecution ... However this is not before the Court on a motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Petitioner\u2019s primary claim for ineffective assistance is based upon his argument that trial counsel essentially ceded the field of scientific evidence to the State....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[I]t is important to note that Ms. Hall was an experienced criminal defense attorney who served as second chair at the Petitioner\u2019s original trial, and then was lead counsel at the re-trial. Mr. Franke also was an experienced criminal defense attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">With CBLA, ineffective assistance is not a legitimate argument. The questions concerning the reliability of that science didn\u2019t even surface until long after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">In looking at the balance of the scientific evidence, counsel was faced with a difficult strategic decision concerning the blood and bone analysis. While evidence at this post-conviction hearing demonstrates that one could have conducted more extensive cross-examination, particularly in the DNA arena, there still is strong evidence that could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>linked to the victim ... Defense counsel was faced with a strategic decision whether to challenge multiple independent links to Ms. Neuslein, or to challenge agency. Clearly counsel opted for the latter strategy. The defense essentially acknowledged in opening that the shooting occurred in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck. The focus of their strategy was evidence of alibi, time of death, and that the truck and other items from the Kulbicki home were not in his exclusive control, suggesting others with access to those items had motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">These were strategic decisions. They were based upon the multiple areas of science that would likely establish a link between the truck and the death. These were reasoned decisions made by experienced counsel who had already seen this evidence play out once before at trial. While you might generate some question concerning a specific scientific link, the collective weight of all of those links would nevertheless be compelling. Counsel\u2019s approach was not ineffective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">(Footnotes and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Kulbicki\u2019s argument is threefold. First, he alleges that the use of unreliable evidence, such as CBLA, is a violation of due process cognizable under the Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act (\u201cUPPA\u201d). Second, Kulbicki avers that the State\u2019s use of \u201cperjured, false, and misleading expert ballistics testimony\u201d denied him his constitutional right to a fair trial. Third, Kulbicki argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In response, the State contends that Kulbicki\u2019s claim regarding the admission of CBLA evidence at his trial \u201c[is] not cognizable\u201d under UPPA and, \u201cin any event, [is] unfounded.\u201d Next, the State argues that Kulbicki\u2019s perjury claim does not afford him a ground for postconviction relief, particularly because the prosecutor was unaware of the perjury. Finally, the State argues that Kulbicki \u201cfailed to meet his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>establishing his claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">On appellate review of a decision by a postconviction court, we will not disturb the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Lopez v. State, </em>205 Md.App. 141, 154, 43 A.3d 1125, 1132 (2012) (citing <em>Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 551, 983 A.2d 1071 (2009)). Although we review the court\u2019s factual determinations under the clearly erroneous standard, \u201cwe make an independent determination of relevant law and its application to the facts.\u201d <em>Arrington, </em>411 Md. at 551, 983 A.2d 1071 (citation omitted). Based upon the relevant case law, we uphold the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">I. CBLA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act \u201capplies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is ... confined under sentence of ... imprisonment.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 7-101 of the Criminal Procedure Act (\u201cCP\u201d). A convicted person may begin a proceeding under this title if he or she claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(1) the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">(2) the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">(3) the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">(4) the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack on a ground of alleged error that would otherwise be available under a writ of habeas corpus, writ of coram nobis, or other common law or statutory remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">CP \u00a7 7-102(a). In addition, CP \u00a7 7-102(b) requires that \u201cthe alleged error has not been previously and finally litigated or waived in the proceeding resulting in the conviction or in any other proceeding that the person has taken to secure relief from the person\u2019s conviction.\u201d \u201cFor each trial or sentence, a person may file only one petition for relief\u2019 under UPPA, and in cases where a sentence of death has not been imposed, an UPPA petition \u201cmay not be filed more than 10 years after the sentence was imposed.\u201d CP \u00a7 7-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In this case, it is undisputed that Kulbicki\u2019s CBLA argument satisfied the requirements of CP \u00a7\u00a7 7-101, 7-102(b), and 7-103. He was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, was sentenced to life in prison, and has filed one postconviction petition within 10 years after the sentence was imposed. Although Kulbicki\u2019s challenge regarding Kopera\u2019s perjury was waived,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the remainder of the alleged errors raised by Kulbicki in his petition have not been previously litigated or waived in the proceeding resulting in his conviction or in any other proceeding. Therefore, the question presently before this Court is whether \u201cthe sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State,\u201d pursuant to CP \u00a7 7-102(a). Kulbicki argues that his conviction, which was based on inaccurate scientific evidence, namely CBLA, violated his due process rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"> The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV. \u201c[A] part of the due process guarantee is that an individual not suffer punitive action as a result of an inaccurate scientific procedure.\u201d <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 84, 673 A.2d 221 (1996) (citation omitted). Although scientific test results \u201cneed not be infallible\u201d to meet this standard, the evidence must not be \u201cso extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 352-53, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990)). \u201cThe Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>construed this test narrowly, as have the Maryland courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 673 A.2d 221 (citations omitted). According to the Court of Appeals, \u201cthe essence of the due process \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 inquiry is whether there was a balanced, fully explored presentation of the evidence,\u201d which is dependent on \u201cthe jury\u2019s ability to weigh the evidence, and the defendant\u2019s opportunity to challenge the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 673 A.2d 221 (citing <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 353, 110 S.Ct. 668). Stated differently, \u201c[t]he Constitution ... protects a defendant against a conviction based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unworthy of credit.\u201d <em>Perry v. New Hampshire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 716, 723, 181 L.Ed.2d 694 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In <em>Clemons, supra, </em>392 Md. at 371, 896 A.2d 1059, the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201ca genuine controversy exists within the relevant scientific community about the reliability and validity of CBLA.\u201d Therefore, it concluded that \u201cCBLA does not satisfy the requirement under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test for the admissibility of scientific expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 896 A.2d 1059. The <em>Clemons </em>Court, however, did not determine whether admission of CBLA evidence in cases prior to 2006 constituted a violation of <em>due process.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Clemons </em>addressed an <em>evidentiary </em>issue and, thus, applied only <em>prospectively </em>to cases to be heard at the trial level. By contrast, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>issue before us is whether we can <em>retroactively </em>rule that the use of CBLA evidence violated a defendant\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>right where the defendant was convicted on the basis of such \u201cunreliable\u201d scientific evidence. Because this issue has not been addressed by a court of this state, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance, and we adopt the holding of <em>United States v. Berry, </em>624 F.3d 1031, 1039-43 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Before turning to the holding in <em>Berry, </em>we must briefly explain the state of CBLA evidence. The FBI commissioned the National Research Council (\u201cNRC\u201d) to evaluate its use of CBLA and, following the Council\u2019s 2004 report,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> discontinued its use of CBLA at trials. <em>Id. </em>at 1037. The NRC report demonstrates that the problem with CBLA is not that the <em>method </em>used to <em>compare </em>the contents of two bullets is unreliable in some abstract sense,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but that it is unreliable to conclude that a CBLA \u201cmatch\u201d supports <em>further specific factual assertions put forth at trial. </em>Most often, these assertions are that matching bullets came from the same box, the same manufacturer, were related in time or geography, or generally linked the defendant to the crime in some unspecified manner. Crucially, these conclusions rested on assumptions unsupported by scientific and statistical testing of the general bullet <em>manufacturing </em>process. <em>See </em>Nat\u2019l Res. Council at 112-13. First, the NRC found that a CBLA match supports the inference that two bullets came from the same \u201csource\u201d when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>taken to mean a compositionally indistinguishable volume of lead (\u201cCIVL\u201d). But there was no generally reliable evidence that a CBLA match corresponded to a match among any other type of \u201csource,\u201d such as a specific manufacturer, box, time, location, etc. <em>See id. </em>at 106-07. Thus, it remained in many cases a distinct possibility that while bullets from the same \u201csource\u201d match each other, they also match bullets from any number of \u201csources.\u201d Second, there was no general knowledge of the probability that manufacturing variations would result in two different lead sources randomly producing matching bullets, producing what is known as a \u201cfalse positive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107 (\u201cAlthough it has been demonstrated that there are a large number of different [CIVL\u2019s], there is evidence that bullets from different CIVL[\u2019]s can sometimes coincidentally be analytically indistinguishable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In <em>Berry, </em>the defendant was accused of perpetrating a series of robberies and terroristic attacks that employed, among other weapons, pipe bombs filled with \u201cbuckshot,\u201d which are lead pellets traditionally used in shotgun shells. 624 F.3d at 1033-34. When Berry and his accomplices were apprehended, federal agents found in their vehicle a number of firearms, grenades, and ammunition, as well as incriminating letters. <em>Id. </em>at 1034-35. Agents later discovered more incriminating evidence at the suspects\u2019 residences, including fuses of the kind used in the attacks, propane canisters identical to one found in a failed incendiary device at one of the crime scenes, anti-government propaganda, and miscellaneous clothes and weapons matching eyewitness and video evidence of the attacks. <em>Id. </em>at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The suspects were indicted and tried together in 1997, and the government used CBLA tests to compare buckshot used in one of the pipe bombs with buckshot found in Berry\u2019s auto shop. <em>Id. </em>at 1035-36. The <em>Berry </em>Court described the CBLA evidence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">Kathleen Lundy, a forensic examiner formerly with the FBI, testified that the buckshot pellets found at the two locations were chemically \u201cindistinguishable,\u201d suggesting that both sets of buckshot came from the same source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Additional evidence greatly strengthened the connection between Berry\u2019s buckshot and the buckshot recovered from the pipe bomb. To begin with, the label on the bag of buckshot found in Berry\u2019s shop indicated that it came from Hornaday Manufacturing Company. In her research, Lundy learned that Hornaday purchases its lead from a single supplier. Until 1996, that supplier had been Asarco. In early 1996, however, Hornaday had started purchasing lead exclusively from Doe Run. Because the chemical composition of the buckshot used in the Planned Parenthood bomb did not match the composition of either Asarco or Doe Run lead, Lundy believed that the buckshot had been created in 1996, during a time when Hornaday was using lead from both suppliers in its products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Gregory Hanson, Director of Sales for Hornaday, confirmed much of Lundy\u2019s analysis. He testified that Hornaday had created a batch of 436 bags of buckshot from a mixture of Asarco and Doe Run lead in early 1996. In addition, Hanson testified that Hornaday was the only buckshot manufacturer who used bullets that were 3 percent antimony, a metal used to harden lead. Both the pipe-bomb buckshot and the buckshot in Berry\u2019s auto shop were 3 percent antimony, strongly suggesting that both came from the batch of buckshot that Hornaday manufactured in 1996. Of this batch, only thirty-two bags were shipped to the area of Spokane, Washington, and Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The end result of the CABL evidence was compelling. Between Lundy\u2019s and Hanson\u2019s testimony, the government narrowed the likely source of the buckshot in the Planned Parenthood pipe bomb to thirty-two bags, two of which were in Berry\u2019s possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1035-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">On appeal from postconviction proceedings,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Berry argued that the CBLA evidence used at his trial was so arbitrary as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to render his trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Id. </em>at 1040. The <em>Berry </em>Court explained that due process is violated only when the evidence is so arbitrary that the factfinder and the adversary system were not competent to uncover, recognize, and take due account of its shortcomings. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 899, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After reviewing the criticisms of CBLA explained above, the Ninth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">While the [CBLA] evidence introduced against Berry may have been flawed, we do not find it so arbitrary as to render Berry\u2019s trial \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d The criticisms of [CBLA] evidence that Berry relies on indicate that it is precisely the kind of evidence that the adversary system is designed to test. Vigorous cross-examination would have exposed its flaws to the jury[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArJ\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We see no reason to depart from the holding in <em>Berry, </em>and it applies squarely to the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The criticisms that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Kulbicki now levels against the CBLA evidence in his trial are the same as those in <em>Berry. </em>And as in <em>Berry, </em>discrediting the CBLA evidence in this case did not require <em>positive scientific proof </em>of assertions contrary to those presented at trial. The flawed assumptions in Kulbicki\u2019s case rested on <em>nothing; </em>Peele\u2019s testimony would have been fully discredited had those assumptions been recognized and their foundations tested. As in <em>Berry, </em>Kulbicki\u2019s criticisms of CBLA analysis \u201cconcern the proper weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. It can hardly be said, therefore, that the adversary system was not \u2018competent to uncover, recognize, and take due account of its shortcomings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1042 (quoting <em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 899, 103 S.Ct. 3383). Accordingly, we reject Kulbicki\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">II. Perjury and Alleged False Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Next, Kulbicki argues that the State\u2019s use of Kopera\u2019s perjured testimony as well as Kopera\u2019s and Peele\u2019s \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d expert ballistics testimonies violated his right to a fair trial. Relying on <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), Kulbicki contends that \u201cthe State is charged with the knowing use of perjured testimony when any state agent testifies falsely even if the falsity is unknown to the prosecutor at the time of the testimony in question.\u201d In addition, Kulbicki avers that Kopera\u2019s conclusions\u2014like Peele\u2019s\u2014were \u201cinaccurate, without scientific foundation, and inconsistent with his own reports and notes.\u201d Believing that both experts\u2019 testimonies were material to his conviction, Kulbicki urges us to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>In response, the State argues that in Maryland, \u201c[a]n \u2018allegation that perjured testimony was offered at trial, absent a showing that the State knowingly used perjured testimony, is not a ground for postconviction relief.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 385, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Alternatively, the State contends that, although Kopera committed perjury, Kulbicki was not denied a fair trial because Kopera\u2019s testimony was not material. Lastly, the State asserts that reversal is not warranted because at the time of Kulbicki\u2019s 1995 trial, \u201cthere was no indication that [Peele] questioned the validity of the matters he asserted or that his testimony was inaccurate or misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">At the outset, we note that Kulbicki waived any claims regarding Kopera\u2019s perjury. To the extent that comparing or examining Kopera\u2019s bench notes would have revealed variances with his trial testimony, and a background investigation would have revealed that Kopera lacked the claimed college degrees, Kulbicki could have raised his contentions on direct appeal. Thus, the postconviction court was not required to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Even if not waived, Kulbicki\u2019s argument still fails. Although we agree with Kulbicki that \u201cthe State is charged with the knowing use of perjured testimony when [a police officer] testifies falsely even if the falsity is unknown to the prosecutor at the time of the testimony,\u201d we decline to grant the relief he seeks. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">It is well-established that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment cannot tolerate a state criminal conviction obtained by the knowing use of false evidence.\u201d <em>Miller v. Pate, </em>386 U.S. 1, 7, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690 (1967) (citing <em>Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935)). Indeed, \u201ca conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by <em>representatives of the State, </em>must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Citing <em>Gray, supra, </em>388 Md. at 385, 879 A.2d 1064, the State would have us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>narrowly interpret the term \u201crepresentatives of the State,\u201d to include only prosecutors and not law enforcement officers or experts. However, a review of the long line of cases regarding this topic leads us to conclude otherwise but does not help Kulbicki as to the bottom line.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">When the <em>Napue </em>Court announced the rule at issue, it cited, among others, <em>Curran v. Delaware, </em>259 F.2d 707 (3rd Cir.1958), where the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the lower court\u2019s grant of habeas corpus relief. In <em>Curran, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe knowingly false testimony of [a detective assigned to the case] was sufficient to cause the defendants\u2019 trial to pass the line of tolerable imperfection and fall into the field of fundamental unfairness,\u201d despite the fact that \u201cthe prosecuting officer was in no way a party to or cognizant of the perjured testimony given by certain witnesses ... or of the fact that the law enforcement officers had taken steps to procure false testimony favorable to the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. As Kulbicki points out, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion in <em>Schneider v. Estelle, </em>552 F.2d 593, 595 (5th Cir.1977), where it made clear that, \u201c[i]f the state through its law enforcement agents suborns perjury for use at the trial, a constitutional due process claim would not be defeated merely because the prosecuting attorney was not personally aware of this prosecutorial activity.\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>See also In re Investigation of the W. Va. State Police Crime Lab., Serology Div., </em>190 W.Va. 321, 438 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1993) (\u201c[I]t matters not whether a prosecutor using [a State serologist] as his expert ever knew that [the expert] was falsifying the State\u2019s evidence. The State must bear the responsibility for the false evidence.\u201d). <em>Cf. Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (\u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The authority cited by the State does not support its claim that knowledge by the prosecutor, rather than other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>state actors, is a necessary requirement for a due process claim based on false testimony. In <em>Gray, </em>the Court of Appeals denied postconviction relief after finding \u201cno indication that ... the State knowingly used false testimony at trial.\u201d 388 Md. at 384-85, 879 A.2d 1064. In that case, however, it was a fact witness, Erika McCray, who recanted her testimony and not a state agent. <em>Id. </em>at 372-73, 879 A.2d 1064. More importantly, the <em>Gray </em>Court indicated that relief would have been warranted had \u201cthe <em>officer </em>who obtained McCray\u2019s testimony believed it to be false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 879 A.2d 1064 (emphasis added). <em>See also Height v. Dir., Patuxent Inst., </em>209 Md. 647, 650, 120 A.2d 911 (1956) (indicating that perjury by an \u201carresting officer,\u201d if supported by facts, \u201cwould amount to the denial of due process\u201d). Therefore, we expressly extend the federal courts\u2019 rulings in <em>Curran </em>and <em>Schneider </em>to cases in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that Kopera, an examiner with the Maryland State Police Firearms Unit, lied about his credentials at Kulbicki\u2019s trial. Because Kopera was a state official, Kulbicki has a valid constitutional claim recognizable under UPPA. Nonetheless, we agree with the postconviction court that Kulbicki\u2019s claim fails on the merits because \u201cthere must then be a showing [of] materiality of the falsity in order to warrant relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>299 Md. 297, 305, 473 A.2d 450 (1984), the Court of Appeals made clear that'\u201cthe proper rule, which is clearly supportable, requires that an initial inquiry be made to determine if the testimony is material to the outcome of the case; if it is not, the due process clause does not automatically require a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that case, Stevenson \u201cwas charged with the first degree murder of her husband and related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>offenses including setting fire while perpetrating a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 473 A.2d 450 (footnote omitted). Dennis Michael-son, one of the rebuttal witnesses called by the state to counter defense expert testimony as to the origin of the fire, \u201ctestified that he had graduated cum laude from the Illinois School of Technology, a fact which subsequently proved to be untrue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 473 A.2d 450. On appeal, the Court affirmed the denial of Stevenson\u2019s motion for a new trial, concluding that Michaelson\u2019s false testimony \u201cwas not material to the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 473 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Here, Kulbicki proved that Kopera presented false testimony as to his credentials. We agree with the postconviction court that \u201cthere simply is no likelihood that the jury\u2019s determination would have been influenced by the fact that Mr. Kopera did not have the academic credentials he claimed.\u201d As the State notes in its brief, the record reflected that \u201cballistics is a field for which no college degree is offered, and the expertise for the field is usually based on experience, which Kopera had in copious amounts.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In his reply brief, Kulbicki cites cases from other jurisdictions in which \u201ccourts found that an expert\u2019s perjury regarding his credentials constitutes sufficient grounds upon which to reverse a conviction.\u201d Those cases, however, are distinguishable. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>84 F.Supp.2d 124 (D.D.C. 1999) (expert\u2019s false qualifications, to which defense counsel stipulated in defendant\u2019s second trial, was deemed material where the first trial ended in a hung jury and the only difference in the second trial was the expert testimony); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>v. DeFronzo, </em>59 Ohio Misc. 113, 394 N.E.2d 1027 (Ohio Ct.Com.Pl.1978) (falsification of credentials was deemed material where expert had neither the academic background nor experience he claimed).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although Kulbicki correctly cites <em>Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, in stating that \u201c[t]he principle that the State may not knowingly use false evidence ... does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness,\u201d he fails to acknowledge that credibility is not based on credentials alone. <em>See </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions 3:14 (advising jurors that although the expert\u2019s \u201cexperience, training and skills, as well as the expert\u2019s knowledge of the subject matter\u201d should be considered, they are \u201cnot required to accept any expert\u2019s opinion\u201d and, rather, are free to \u201cgive expert testimony the weight and value [they] believe it should have\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Citing <em>Stevenson, </em>299 Md. at 308, 473 A.2d 450, Kulbicki urges us to consider the materiality of Kopera\u2019s entire testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The portion of the <em>Stevenson </em>Court\u2019s opinion on which Kulbicki relies, however, is dicta.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, we need not engage in a similar analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>As to Kulbicki\u2019s claims regarding the falsity of Peele\u2019s CBLA testimony, we agree with the State that \u201cthere was no indication that [Peele] questioned the validity of the matters he asserted or that his testimony was inaccurate or misleading.\u201d <em>See Brown v. State, 225 </em>Md. 610, 616, 171 A.2d 456 (1961) (describing perjury as \u201c \u2018swearing falsely and corruptly, <em>without probable cause of belief </em>\u201d) (quoting <em>Wharton, </em>Criminal Law, \u00a7 1511 (12th ed.1932), p. 1782) (emphasis added). Likewise, without the benefit of hearing testimony from Kopera himself during the postconviction proceeding, we cannot assume that his trial testimony regarding the gun\u2019s \u201ccleaned\u201d condition and the significance of \u201ccannelures\u201d did not reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>his beliefs at the time of trial. Any evidence presented by Kulbicki showing otherwise was merely circumstantial and speculative. Finally, as Peele was not a state official and Kulbicki provided no evidence to show that any prosecutors knew about the unreliable nature of CBLA at the time of trial, Kulbicki\u2019s contention \u201ccomes down to the claim that his conviction was the result of false testimony,\u201d which \u201cgoes to credibility and so to the sufficiency of the evidence, a matter not available for post conviction relief.\u201d <em>Husk v. Warden, Md. Penitentiary, </em>240 Md. 353, 356, 214 A.2d 139 (1965) (citing <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 637, 201 A.2d 672 (1964)). <em>See also Berry, </em>624 F.3d at 1043 (concluding that the NRC Report is no more than impeaching evidence of CBLA evidence introduced at trial, especially where the expert \u201cwas not accused of fabricating the results of any tests in this case, and there is no evidence that she committed perjury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Kulbicki\u2019s final claim is that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. According to Kulbicki, his attorneys should have consulted with scientific experts to investigate and challenge the State\u2019s ballistics and DNA evidence, and his attorneys should have objected to \u201cthe State\u2019s improper argument that Kulbicki\u2019s consultation with an attorney was evidence of guilt.\u201d In response, the State contends that Kulbicki failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance as to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 253, 262, 868 A.2d 898 (2005) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must satisfy the two-part test announced by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.... Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJWe\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">With respect to the first part of the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u201ca court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In that regard, all circumstances must be considered. <em>Id. \u201cA </em>fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Furthermore, \u2018Tj judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. \u201c[A] </em>court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d as \u201c[tjhere are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case\u201d and \u201c[ejven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Therefore, in order to prevail, a defendant \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201cMere errors in trial tactics are not sufficient to constitute incompetency of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Merchant, </em>10 Md.App. 545, 551, 271 A.2d 752 (1970) (citations omitted). \u201cTactical decisions, when made by an authorized competent attorney, as well as legitimate procedural requirements, will normally bind a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 150, 395 A.2d 464 (1978) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In this case, we cannot say that the postconviction court erred when it held that Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel acted reasonably. Both trial counsel were experienced criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>defense attorneys, and one of them had the highly relevant experience of serving as co-counsel at Kulbicki\u2019s <em>previous trial </em>on the same charges. As the trial court explained, Kulbicki\u2019s counsel faced a strategic choice: challenge multiple independent scientific links to the victim\u2014only some of which would be damaged by Kulbicki\u2019s present arguments\u2014or challenge agency. Kulbicki\u2019s present arguments give us no reason to reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that counsel reasonably chose to pursue the latter strategy, particularly where one of them had seen the evidence \u201cplay out once before at trial.\u201d None of the cases that appellant cites involved such a strategic choice or the knowledge gained from a previous trial. <em>See Gersten v. Senkowski, </em>426 F.3d 588, 609 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]t is clear that in this case such a failure was not justified as an objectively reasonable strategic choice. Here, no facts known to defense counsel at the time that he adopted a trial strategy that involved conceding the medical evidence could justify that concession.\u201d); <em>Sims v. Livesay, </em>970 F.2d 1575, 1580-81 (6th Cir.1992) (\u201cWe discern no strategy in [counselj\u2019s failure to investigate the role of the [evidence at issue], only negligence.\u201d); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 578 A.2d 734 (1990). And while we agree that the State\u2019s closing argument was improper,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we again cannot say that counsel\u2019s actions were anything other than a strategic decision not to call further attention to what it considered a damaging piece of evidence. In light of the particular facts of this case, we have no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling that Kulbicki\u2019s counsel acted reasonably. As Kulbicki failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we need not consider the second prong. 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cthere is no reason for a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>deciding an ineffective assistance claim to ... address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In his reply brief, Kulbicki makes clear that his challenge to the State\u2019s use of CBLA evidence is \u201cpremised on the assertion that the introduction and reliance on that evidence rendered his trial so fundamentally unfair that it violated his right to due process.\u2019\u2019 He rejects the State\u2019s contention that he seeks relief based upon newly discovered evidence. <em>See Douglas v.

It is worth noting that, because the Court's conclusion in <em>Clemons </em>was evidentiary and not constitutional, Kulbicki would not be entitled to a new trial for the retrospective application of the <em>Clemons </em>ruling, <em>see State v.

CBLA evidence is, \u201cin many cases, ... a reasonably accurate way of determining whether two bullets could have come from the same compositionally indistinguishable volume of lead.

In reaching its ruling, the <em>Stevenson </em>Court reviewed some of the Supreme Court cases upon which Kulbicki relies, including <em>Napue, supra; Miller v.

The Court also cited several cases from Federal Courts of Appeals, <em>id. </em>at 307, 473 A.2d 450 (\"new trials are required only when there is a knowing and intentional use of false evidence that is material\u201d) (citations omitted), as well as other due process cases with different factual contexts, <em>id. </em>at 308, 473 A.2d 450 (\"materiality must be shown before a new trial is warranted\u201d) (citations omitted), and reached the same conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. Because, ultimately, Kopera's testimony as to some of his credentials was not material, Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Kopera\u2019s credentials does not amount to ineffective assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. Kulbicki also cites <em>State v. Elder, </em>199 Kan. 607, 433 P.2d 462 (1967), but that opinion is inapposite. In <em>Elder, </em>the Supreme Court of Kansas did not employ the test we use in this case to determine whether an expert's perjured testimony was <em>material to the case before it. </em>Instead, the defendant, Lyle Elder, was on trial for <em>perjury </em>for having falsified his educational background while testifying as an expert in a <em>previous trial. Id. </em>at 463. The <em>Elder </em>Court therefore applied a much less stringent test for materiality than ours, to wit: \u201cThe false statements relied upon, however, need not bear directly on the ultimate issue to be determined; <em>it is sufficient that they relate to collateral matters upon which evidence would have been admissible.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">.

In particular, Kulbicki argues that Kopera was the only witness to testify that the damage in the truck was caused by a bullet fragment and that the revolver had been \"cleaned.\" Kulbicki also contends that Kopera \u201cwas one of only two witnesses who ... linked Kulbicki to the murder with bullets.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">. In its written opinion, the <em>Stevenson </em>Court held that the knowing and intentional use of <em>false testimony </em>violates due process when <em>such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>testimony </em>is material to the result of the case. <em>Stevenson, </em>299 Md. at 305, 473 A.2d 450. The Court went on to address Stevenson's reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Cornille, </em>95 Ill.2d 497, 69 Ill.Dec. 945, 448 N.E.2d 857 (1983), a case in which the State of Illinois had used testimony from the same expert as in <em>Stevenson, </em>and the Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the conviction when it came to light that the expert, \u201cMichaelson,\u201d had lied about his academic credentials. <em>Stevenson, </em>299 Md. at 308, 473 A.2d 450. In distinguishing <em>Cornille </em>from <em>Stevenson, </em>the Court addressed the <em>entirety </em>of the expert\u2019s testimony, rather than only the <em>false testimony </em>stated in the rule, above. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Cornille, </em>it appears that the testimony as to the cause of the fire was evenly balanced, justifying the court\u2019s conclusion that Michael-son\u2019s testimony, plus his impressive academic background, was likely to have persuaded the factfinder of the defendant\u2019s guilt. On the other hand, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge found evidence of appellant's guilt was overwhelming, even if Michaelson\u2019s testimony was not in the case, and he made this observation \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Our review of the record confirms this observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">However, there is nothing in this portion of <em>Stevenson </em>that expands the scope of the rule announced above, <em>id. </em>at 305, 473 A.2d 450, and it is entirely <em>consistent </em>with a rule limited to <em>false testimony. </em>(If the evidence in <em>Stevenson </em>was \"overwhelming\u201d without <em>any </em>of Michaelson's testimony, then it must be sufficient after subtracting only his <em>perjured </em>testimony.) We therefore would not presume that Kulbicki\u2019s proffered interpretation of <em>Stevenson </em>is anything more than dicta. Moreover, Kulbicki has not presented a case in which a defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed as a result of the admission of false testimony from Kopera, specifically, as Stevenson had done with regard to Michaelson. For these reasons, we need not, and shall not, apply Kulbicki\u2019s proposed interpretation of <em>Stevenson, </em>which would have us consider the sufficiency of the evidence <em>without any testimony </em>from Kopera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b474-5\">. The prosecution stated, in closing, that Kulbicki's decision to consult with an attorney and hire a private investigator \"is a sign of a guilty man.\u201d This appears contrary to Maryland law, <em>Hunter v.
