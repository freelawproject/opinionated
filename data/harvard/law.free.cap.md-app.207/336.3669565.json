The apartment was known as a \u201cstash house,\u201d where drug dealers stored their inventory. According to the State, appellant and Mr. Jones drove a van to the apartment. They entered the apartment and encountered three individuals. Appellant and Mr. Jones stole illegal drugs from the individuals in the apartment, but the target of the robbery, an individual known as \u201cG,\u201d was not present. Appellant and Mr. Jones then duct taped the three individuals and secured them in the rear of the van, before searching for \u201cG.\u201d After an unsuccessful search, they returned to the apartment. Mr. Jones reentered the apartment, bringing one of the other individuals with him, to resume the search for \u201cG.\u201d \u201cG\u201d later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>returned to the apartment with Andre Green. As they entered, Mr. Jones shot and killed \u201cG\u201d and wounded Mr. Green. Mr. Jones exited the apartment, whereupon he and appellant fled in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Prior to appellant\u2019s trial, but after Mr. Jones had pled guilty in his severed trial, the State filed a motion in limine, requesting that the circuit court bar the admission of Mr. Jones\u2019s signed statement to appellant\u2019s defense counsel. In the statement, which Mr. Jones gave a day after the alleged incident, he indicated that appellant was not present during the commission of the crimes and was not involved in the home invasion. Mr. Jones\u2019s statement also suggested that he may have shot the victims in self-defense. Counsel for Mr. Jones indicated that he anticipated that Mr. Jones would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked about the events on June 19, 2008 at appellant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its consideration of the motion in limine, the circuit court reviewed the statement and heard <em>in camera </em>testimony from Mr. Jones and a law clerk for appellant\u2019s defense counsel, concerning Mr. Jones\u2019s written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Mr. Jones\u2019s statement, which was handwritten on eight pages from a legal pad by appellant\u2019s defense counsel, signed by Mr. Jones, and later transcribed, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">This is a statement of Jamar Tonio Jones, dob 7/1/88, SSN ... of ... Martin Road in Brandywine, MD given on Friday, June 20, 2008 at 4:30 pm to Attorney Jon Norris and his law clerk Kathey Gravely, in Mr. Norris\u2019 office at 503 D Street, NW, Washington, DC. Mr. Norris and Ms. Gravely represent Mr. T.J. Sirroco [sic] Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">On Thursday, June 19, 2008 around noon I was present at the apartment in Walker Mill when 2 people were shot. I went to the apartment with my friend Darren Johnson. TJ Jackson was not at the apartment when the shooting oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>eurred. Darren and I went to the apartment because one of the guys in the apartment owed Darren some money for drugs. Darren said the guy owed him money for coke, cocaine. Darren asked me to go along with him so he could holler at the guy that owed him money. Darren and I were the only 2 who went to the apartment. The apartment, The apartment [sic] was in the 6600 block of Roland Road just off of Walker Mill Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">When Darren and I got there, there were three people in the apartment. All 3 were brown skinned, lighter than me. I did not know any of them. They opened the door and let us in. Darren went in the back with one of the guys. The guy that went with Darren was short and heavy set. When they were in the back I stayed in the front room with the other 2 guys. When Darren and the other guy came out I heard them arguing. I could tell it was about drugs and money. Darren stumbled, he may have been pushed, I grabbed him to get out of there. One guy was by the door, blocking it, the door. One guy was by the couch. The guy by the door was reaching for something. I thought he was going for a gun so I pulled out my gun, a Glock 9 mm, and I started shooting, we ran out. I don\u2019t know if I hit anyone. Darren and I run to the van on the way to the van there was an older lady and a man outside. Darren grabbed them and pushed them in the van. At no time when this happened was T.J. Jackson around. I get in the van and I drive. I tell Darren that they can\u2019t stay in the van. Somewhere I stop and push the people out of the van. I drive Darren to D.C. and drop him off. I drive back into Maryland and I go to a house to look for my friend T.J. Jackson. When I found TJ I told him what happened, I told TJ to get in the van with me, because I needed to talk with him. As we drove I told him a little bit. I told him that a situation went bad and I had to start shooting. I wanted to go tell my father but he wasn\u2019t there. The van was parked by my Dad\u2019s house on the grass on the side. The Martin Road House. The police came to my house[;] when I saw them I started running. TJ started running behind me. We ran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>for a while, when we saw some workers we got them to give us a ride. That was my idea. They gave us a ride to a friend\u2019s house on Frank Tippet Road. TJ Jackson was not involved in this shooting. He did not know that it was going to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">This 8 page statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I swear under penalty of perjury that it is true and accurate. I knew that I am making a statement against my penal interest which could be used against me. It is true and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">During his <em>in camera </em>testimony, Mr. Jones stated that he committed the crimes to which he had already pled guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He indicated that the day after the commission, he and appellant went to defense counsel\u2019s office, where Mr. Jones told defense counsel what occurred, including the shooting of \u201cG\u201d and Mr. Green. He recalled being in defense counsel\u2019s office, but did not recall defense counsel\u2019s law clerk also being present. Mr. Jones confirmed that he related the events to defense counsel, without appellant being present. He signed the statement, which defense counsel transcribed as Mr. Jones detailed the events, periodically confirming that the statement matched Mr. Jones\u2019s recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In response to questioning from the circuit court, Mr. Jones recognized that he gave a statement to defense counsel, but averred that the statement was \u201cnot true.\u201d In response to questioning from the State, Mr. Jones indicated that appellant suggested they go to defense counsel\u2019s office. A friend of appellant drove appellant and Mr. Jones to the office, because Mr. Jones knew that the police were looking for him and possibly his van. Appellant did not advise Mr. Jones that defense counsel represented appellant, but Mr. Jones knew that they were going to see defense counsel concerning the shooting. He and appellant went into the office, but Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Jones spoke with defense counsel outside of appellant\u2019s presence. He stated that defense counsel took notes while he detailed the events. Furthermore, he stated that he spoke with defense counsel in an effort to seek representation and that appellant agreed to pay for the representation because Mr. Jones did not have any money. He maintained that he did not meet with defense counsel to help appellant, but rather to help himself. He believed that providing the statement would not subject him to further risk of being criminally charged. He did not understand what giving \u201ca declaration against penal interests\u201d meant. He was a high school graduate, but did not write the statement himself nor did anyone ask him to. Instead, defense counsel wrote the statement as Mr. Jones described the events, without defense counsel explaining possible legal defenses or indicating that he represented appellant. Mr. Jones stated that defense counsel read the statement to him, and he signed at the bottom after skimming through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">When asked where he obtained the information provided to defense counsel, Mr. Jones responded that he \u201cmade it up.\u201d He refused to answer whether he gave the statement to keep appellant out of trouble, but indicated that at the time of the statement, he did not have a place to stay, other than with appellant. He maintained that he was not afraid of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On redirect by defense counsel, Mr. Jones acknowledged that almost three years had elapsed since he visited defense counsel\u2019s office. Still, even with the aid of his statement, he did not recall anyone other than defense counsel being present when he provided the statement. Mr. Jones recognized that defense counsel gave him the name and business card of another attorney, but indicated that this occurred after he gave the statement. Mr. Jones stated that defense counsel did not give him legal advice. Again, he concluded that appellant did not threaten him and that he was not afraid of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The circuit court then heard <em>in camera </em>testimony from defense counsel\u2019s former law clerk, who indicated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>worked for defense counsel on the occasion that appellant and Mr. Jones came to the office. It was her first time meeting Mr. Jones, but appellant indicated to her that Mr. Jones needed to speak to a lawyer. After appellant left the office, defense counsel and his law clerk conversed with Mr. Jones. The law clerk indicated that defense counsel stated that he represented appellant, and would not be able to give Mr. Jones any legal advice. Defense counsel also gave Mr. Jones the name and telephone number of another qualified criminal defense lawyer. In response to defense counsel\u2019s inquiry whether Mr. Jones wanted to speak to a lawyer, the law clerk averred that Mr. Jones was adamant that he wanted to talk to defense counsel and not a different lawyer. After Mr. Jones divulged the events of the previous day, defense counsel asked him to go through the story again and wrote down what Mr. Jones said. The law clerk indicated that Mr. Jones agreed that defense counsel\u2019s notes accurately reflected his story and that Mr. Jones did not appear to be threatened, coerced, or intimidated in anyway when giving the statement. Defense counsel explained a statement against penal interest to Mr. Jones, who appreciated the significance, did not have any objections to the statement, and signed it, swearing to its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">On cross-examination by the State, the law clerk elaborated that defense counsel\u2019s firm had an existing relationship with appellant and that defense counsel explained the theory of a declaration against penal interest to Mr. Jones in plain English, as opposed to legalese. She maintained that Mr. Jones understood that his statement could be used at trial. In fact, the law clerk explained that Mr. Jones\u2019s willingness to speak with appellant\u2019s attorney seemed \u201cvery odd\u201d in her opinion, but he was \u201cvery insistent and adamant about wanting to give a statement to [defense counsel].\u201d Additionally, she elaborated that Mr. Jones was not afforded the opportunity to write the statement himself because, in her training and experience and that of defense counsel, it is more efficient, easier for the declarant to modify, and has better \u201cfluidity\u201d and structure when the attorney writes the declarant\u2019s statement, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>gives the declarant an opportunity to review it with the attorney to make any deletions or corrections. Here, Mr. Jones reviewed the statement. He made no changes and signed it. The State pressed the law clerk on whether Mr. Jones actually described the events employing the vernacular used in the statement, and the law clerk conceded that Mr. Jones gave his statement in a \u201cgive and take\u201d with defense counsel, implying a back and forth conversation. She concluded that she and defense counsel explained that they represented appellant, and not Mr. Jones, but that Mr. Jones gave the statement, apparently in an effort to aid appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The circuit court considered argument on the application of Maryland Rule 5\u2014804(b)(3) and granted the State\u2019s motion in limine. The court discerned that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement was not truly inculpatory because Mr. Jones included references to acting in self-defense in response to another man in the apartment \u201creaching for something\u201d that Mr. Jones thought was a gun during an argument. The court also mentioned that the statements regarding appellant were collateral to the statement as a whole. Finally, the court determined that Mr. Jones\u2019s accounts of the shooting widely varied, between the statement in defense counsel\u2019s office, the statement of facts at Mr. Jones\u2019s plea hearing, and his statement to the circuit court that the statement he made in defense counsel\u2019s office was fabricated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the court did not question the veracity of the accounts from defense counsel and his law clerk of Mr. Jones\u2019s statement in defense counsel\u2019s office, it did not find Mr. Jones\u2019s statement to be trustworthy or adequately corroborated. The court questioned the accuracy of Mr. Jones\u2019s statement in light of the fact that appellant brought Mr. Jones to defense counsel\u2019s office, defense counsel\u2019s representation of appellant, and Mr. Jones\u2019s statement that appellant agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>pay for Mr. Jones\u2019s legal representation. Moreover, other evidence in the record indicated that appellant and Mr. Jones were working together the day of the incident, further calling into question the trustworthiness of Mr. Jones\u2019s statement to defense counsel that appellant was not present that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">MARYLAND RULE 5-804 AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Maryland Rule 5-804, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Rule 5-804.

Matusky, </em>343 Md. 467, 486, 682 A.2d 694 (1996)) (citing <em>Powell v. State, </em>324 Md. 441, 453, 597 A.2d 479 (1991); <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 557, 576-77, 776 A.2d 685 (2001)). Then, like other exceptions to the hearsay bar, \u201c \u2018admissibility is a question addressed exclusively to the discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkerson, </em>139 Md.App. at 577, 776 A.2d 685 (quoting <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 653, 415 A.2d 590 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">According to appellant, Mr. Jones\u2019s statement exculpated appellant and was admissible as a statement against penal interest pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(3), so the circuit court committed reversible error when it ruled that the statement was inadmissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the sake of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the statement\u2019s admissibility, Mr. Jones was \u201cunavailable\u201d under Rule 5-804(a)(2) in light of the anticipated assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege if asked about the events of June 19, 2008 at appellant\u2019s trial, despite the circuit court\u2019s admonishments. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>334 Md. 313, 333-34, 639 A.2d 125 (1994). However, Mr. Jones\u2019s statement suggested that he discharged a firearm in self-defense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>that he did not participate in or assist with \u201cDarren Johnson\u2019s\u201d criminal activity. Therefore, we point out, and the circuit court recognized, that there are issues regarding whether Mr. Jones\u2019s statement actually tended to subject him to criminal liability for the murder under Rule 5\u2014804(b)(8), and whether he actually appreciated the statement\u2019s impact on his liberty. <em>See </em>Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 802[E] (4th ed.2010) (\u201cThe trial judge must first be satisfied that the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s interest and that the declarant actually understood that his statement could indeed cause him [or her] a loss of property, money, or liberty.\u201d). Nevertheless, the crux of the circuit court\u2019s analysis, and thus appellant\u2019s appeal, was whether appellant presented corroborating circumstances that clearly indicated the trustworthiness and reliability of Mr. Jones\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801. Due to its inherent untrustworthiness, and the preference for in-court testimony that is subject to cross-examination, hearsay \u201cis not admissible\u201d unless \u201cotherwise provided by [the Maryland Rules] or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-802. Clearly, Mr. Jones\u2019s transcribed statement to defense counsel is hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">The correct procedural posture is, \u201cHearsay will be <em>excluded, </em>unless the <em>proponent </em>demonstrates its probable <em>trustworthiness.\u201d </em>Affirmative evidence of trustworthiness, moreover, contemplates something more than the absence of evidence of untrustworthiness. The likelihood of a motive to speak truthfully requires more than the unlikelihood of a motive to lie. Were it otherwise, the nothing-to-nothing ties on these issues would go to the exception rather than to the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\"><em>Cassidy v.

In that case, the defendant was charged with murdering his wife, who had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>shot and stabbed. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 796 A.2d 697. According to the defendant, his wife\u2019s lover, Brian Gatton, was the true perpetrator. The defendant posited that Mr. Gatton previously told another woman, Evelyn Johnson, that the defendant\u2019s wife was his girlfriend, and that after the murder, Mr. Gatton intimated to Ms. Johnson that he killed the defendant\u2019s wife. <em>Id. </em>at 533-34, 796 A.2d 697. The defendant subpoenaed Mr. Gatton to testify, but Mr. Gatton invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 796 A.2d 697. As such, the defendant sought to offer Mr. Gatton\u2019s statements that he killed the defendant\u2019s wife through Ms. Johnson as declarations against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>The State claimed that Ms. Johnson was not credible, and the trial court refused to admit Mr. Gatton\u2019s statements as declarations against penal interest, which this Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 796 A.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 796 A.2d 697. The court noted that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses <em>against </em>him [was] not implicated\u201d because the defendant was offering the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 796 A.2d 697. Yet, the Court concluded that the trial court invaded the province of the jury by determining Ms. Johnson\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 796 A.2d 697. The Court reiterated that to be admissible pursuant to Rule 5\u2014804(b)(3) \u201ca declarant\u2019s inculpatory statement that exculpates an accused need[s] corroboration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545 n. 11, 796 A.2d 697. The Court summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">[A] trial judge considering the admission of a hearsay statement offered as a declaration against penal interest must carefully consider the content of the statement in the light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and all relevant information concerning the declarant, and determine whether the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s penal interest and whether a reasonable person in the situation of the declarant would have perceived that it was against his penal interest at the time it was made. The trial judge should then consider whether there are present any other facts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>circumstances, including those indicating a motive to falsify on the part of the [out-of-court] declarant, that so cut against the presumption of the reliability normally attending a declaration against interest that the statements should not be admitted. A statement against interest that survives this analysis, and those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, are admissible as declarations against interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 544, 796 A.2d 697 (quoting <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d 955).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court discerned that the defendant had presented sufficient corroboration to allow the admission of Mr. Gatton\u2019s statement against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 545-47, 796 A.2d 697. Specifically, Mr. Gatton and the defendant\u2019s wife had been romantically involved, creating a \u201clove triangle\u201d between Mr. Gatton, the defendant, and his wife; Mr. Gatton possessed jewelry similar to that worn by the defendant\u2019s wife; Mr. Gatton used Ms. Johnson to pawn some of the jewelry; Mr. Gatton displayed a small handgun and a hunting knife when he made the statements to Ms. Johnson; and the victim was shot and stabbed. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 796 A.2d 697. As such, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Under the circumstances here present, [the defendant] was entitled to present his defense, <em>i.e., </em>that Gatton killed [the defendant\u2019s wife]. When Gatton, through the invocation of his right to remain silent became unavailable, [the defendant] was, under the facts of this case, entitled to present to the jury Gatton\u2019s declarations against penal interest through the person that allegedly heard the declarations, Evelyn Johnson. Under the circumstances here present, it was error to deny their admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 547, 796 A.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">After <em>Gray, </em>this Court decided <em>Roebuck, supra, </em>148 Md. App. at 569, 813 A.2d 342, in which the defendant and his cousin were both charged with murdering a young victim with a knife and gun. In a custodial interrogation, the defendant indicated that he gave a gun to his cousin, but that the cousin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>killed the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 813 A.2d 342. The cousin, also in a custodial interrogation, confessed to the crime, but claimed that the defendant \u201cphysically\u201d tried to \u201cstop\u201d him during the attack. <em>Id. </em>In the cousin\u2019s trial, the State used the cousin\u2019s statement against him, and he was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 575, 813 A.2d 342. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the cousin refused to testify because his appeal was pending, so the defendant sought to introduce the cousin\u2019s custodial statement as a declaration against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 813 A.2d 342. The trial court ruled that the statement was not sufficiently corroborated to render it trustworthy and barred its admission as a declaration against interest. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 813 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We relied on <em>Gray </em>and determined that the trial court erred. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 813 A.2d 342. At trial, the State theorized that the defendant aided and abetted the murder by giving the gun to his cousin, who, in turn, killed the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 813 A.2d 342. The State\u2019s theory and the trial court\u2019s ruling on admissibility, however, ignored evidence that corroborated the cousin\u2019s statement. <em>Id. </em>at 592-93, 813 A.2d 342. The cousin\u2019s statement was made during a custodial interrogation, after police had advised the cousin of his constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 813 A.2d 342. A key State witness indicated that he drove the defendant, the cousin, and the victim to the area where the murder occurred, and drove the defendant and the cousin away from the area. <em>Id. </em>We also discerned significance from the fact that the cousin\u2019s statement was the subject of a motion to suppress in his case, which the lower court denied. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the State regarded the cousin\u2019s statement as being reliable, introducing it into evidence at the cousin\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 813 A.2d 342. \u201cPut another way, because the State touted [the cousin\u2019s] statement as trustworthy in its case against [the cousin], the court should have considered the State\u2019s reliance on [the cousin\u2019s] statement as a factor with respect to the trustworthiness of [his] statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 813 A.2d 342. Nevertheless, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">In reaching our conclusion, we are mindful that \u201cthe exclusion of a statement exculpating an accused could result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>in an erroneous conviction.\u201d <em>[State v.] Anderson </em>[141 Wis.2d 653], 416 N.W.2d [276,] at 280 [ (1987) ]. Moreover, given a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense, <em>id., </em>416 N.W.2d at 279, a defendant should not be subjected \u201cto an insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\u201d to obtain admissibility of a hearsay statement that is central to the defense and has been sufficiently corroborated. <em>Id., </em>416 N.W.2d at 280. Ultimately, it is for the fact finder to assess the veracity of the declaration. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Roebuck, </em>148 Md.App. at 594, 813 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The next year, in <em>Stewart, supra, </em>151 Md.App. at 427, 827 A.2d 850, we reviewed the existing case law surrounding Rule 5\u2014804(b)(3) in the context of a father\u2019s statement allegedly exculpating his son, when both the father and the son were charged, but tried separately, with murder and assault. The trial court ruled that the father\u2019s statement was not a declaration against penal interest, and thus inadmissible under Rule 5-804(b)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 446, 827 A.2d 850. We noted that the case was \u201cakin\u201d to <em>Gray </em>and <em>Roebuck, </em>but that the errors that led to reversals in those cases were not present because the court did not \u201cusurp[ ] the jury\u2019s function in assessing credibility of the \u2018relator\u2019 of the declaration against penal interest ]\u201d or \u201cerroneously overlook[ ] the corroboration of [Roebuck\u2019s cousin\u2019s] declaration, including the State\u2019s own use of [Roebuck\u2019s cousin\u2019s] declaration at [his] murder trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 827 A.2d 850. We recognized that there was \u201ca \u2018specific concern\u2019 that \u2018the accused or the declarant, or both, may have a motive to fabricate the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 827 A.2d 850 (citation omitted). Relying on <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d 287 (S.D.N.Y.2001), and other illustrative federal cases that focused on the relationship between the declarant and the accused in the context of trustworthiness, we believed that \u201cin a murder case in which a father and son are both implicated, the close familial bond of father and son raises the specter that [the father] had a motive to fabricate to protect his son.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454-55, 827 A.2d 850 (citing <em>United States v. Desena, </em>260 F.3d 150, 158-59 (2d. Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Duke, </em>255 F.3d 656, 658-59 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v.

In <em>Stewart, </em>151 Md.App. at 455, 827 A.2d 850, the father \u201csought to exculpate both himself <em>and </em>his son; he stated that he ... committed the crimes, but claimed, in effect, that he acted in self-defense.\u201d We also noted that \u201cthe consistency of a declarant\u2019s statement is an important factor to consider,\u201d and there were several inconsistencies in the father\u2019s various accounts, causing the trial court to be skeptical of the trustworthiness of the declarations. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We held that the trial court properly considered the circumstances surrounding the trustworthiness of the father\u2019s statement, recognizing that the statements were made when he knew his son was sought by police or had been arrested. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found the father\u2019s account, in which he assumed full responsibility for, and acted alone in, three altercations, as \u201centirely implausible,\u201d in light of the father either seriously wounding or killing three people almost half his age. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 827 A.2d 850. The trial court did not credit the father\u2019s assertion that he did not know the three victims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The father also suggested that he acted in self-defense, which we deemed to render his statements as \u201cself-exculpating,\u201d not self-incriminating. <em>Id. </em>As such, the statements were \u201cless trustworthy within the meaning of the hearsay exception in [Rule 5-804(b)(3) ].\u201d Additionally, the court had already heard a majority of the evidence, which \u201csimply did not corroborate [the father\u2019s] assertions that he acted alone.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, even if the evidence was unclear as to whether the father or the son shot the gun, the father\u2019s statements were not exculpatory as to the son based on principles of accomplice liability, which the State advanced and supported with evidence. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we declined to second guess the trial court\u2019s determination that the father\u2019s declarations attempting to exculpate his son were untrustworthy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We note that in <em>Colkley v.

Giles, </em>239 Md. 458, 469, 212 A.2d 101 (1965)). In <em>Giles, </em>the Court of Appeals cited an Oklahoma case for a definition of \u201cexculpatory,\u201d which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\"><em>\u201cExculpatory\u201d is </em>defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary as <em>\u201cclearing or tending to clear from alleged faith or guilt.\u201d </em>The various jurisdictions have adhered basically to this definition. The State of Texas in the case of <em>Moore v. State, </em>124 Tex.Cr.M. 97, [100,] 60 S.W.2d 453[, 455 (1933) ], said that \u201cExculpatory\u201d means \u201cclearing, or tending to clear, from alleged fault or guilt; excusing.\u201d In the case of <em>State v. Langdon, </em>46 N.M. 277, [279,] 127 P.2d 875[, 876 (1942) ], [the Supreme Court of New Mexico] used the following language: \u201cThe word \u2018exculpate\u2019 is employed in the sense of excuse or justification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Colkley, </em>204 Md.App. at 607-08, 42 A.3d 646 (quoting <em>Dean v.

The absence of a quality is not the same thing as the opposite of that quality. There is a wide \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d of neutral connotation between the opposing verbal trench lines. The world is not necessarily black or white. In any event, this is nothing more than a passing observation on the uses and abuses of the language and an affirmation that things are sometimes gray.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\"><em>Colkley, </em>204 Md.App. at 608, 42 A.3d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Here, even though he suggested that he acted in self-defense in response to a man in the apartment \u201creaching for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>something\u201d and that \u201cDarren Johnson\u201d caused the initial altercation and later kidnapping, Mr. Jones\u2019s statement was arguably inculpatory, and thus against his penal interest. He placed himself at the scene of a home invasion, which involved being in proximity to illegal drugs and collecting a debt owed to \u201cDarren Johnson\u201d for a drug deal. He also admitted carrying and discharging a handgun in a residence. It is unclear whether a reasonable person in Mr. Jones\u2019s position would have perceived his statement to have \u201cso tended to subject [him or her] to civil or criminal liability\u201d under Rule 5-804(b)(3). Nevertheless, Mr. Jones indicated that appellant was absent and did not participate in the ordeal. Therefore, for the sake of argument, and as it does not affect our holding, we accept appellant\u2019s contention that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement inculpated himself and \u201cDarren Johnson,\u201d and exculpated appellant for the charged crimes. Still, we heed Judge Moylan\u2019s warning and point out that just because a statement is inculpatory of one person, or several people, does not mean the statement is exculpatory of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We discern that the circuit court properly granted the State\u2019s motion in limine, excluding Mr. Jones\u2019s statement at defense counsel\u2019s office, as the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and its ultimate decision to exclude the statement based on insufficient indicia of reliability was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart, </em>151 Md.App. at 447, 827 A.2d 850 (citations omitted). The parties do not dispute that Mr. Jones was unavailable, given his counsel\u2019s indication that he would refuse to testify at appellant\u2019s trial and invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Additionally, we note that there are no Confrontation Clause issues because appellant, himself, sought admission of the out-of-court statement. <em>Gray, </em>368 Md. at 538, 796 A.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The circuit court concluded that the statement did not so tend to subject Mr. Jones to criminal or civil liability. Despite the conclusion in Mr. Jones\u2019s statement that he \u201cknew\u201d that he was \u201cmaking a statement against [his] penal interest which could be used against [him],\u201d we cannot hold that the court was clearly erroneous. As mentioned, the court emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the unreliability, untrustworthiness, and sheer lack of corroboration surrounding Mr. Jones\u2019s statement. In that regard, Mr. Jones\u2019s self-defense claim weighs against his statement being trustworthy and exhibiting necessary corroboration. <em>Stewart, </em>151 Md.App. at 455, 827 A.2d 850(citing <em>Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d at 305(a declarant who does not fully inculpate himself or herself, but rather exculpates both himself or herself <em>and </em>the defendant, weighs against reliability)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Mr. Jones\u2019s statement also suggested that another person, \u201cDarren Johnson,\u201d was criminally liable. This Court has held that \u201cwhen \u2018a statement directly inculpates the declarant, <em>and no one else,\u2019 </em>that circumstance is a factor \u2018in favor of its reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d at 305) (emphasis in <em>Stewart). </em>Mr. Jones\u2019s suggestion that a third person was criminally culpable does not weigh as heavily in favor of reliability and trustworthiness, but rather the deflection of culpability weighs against reliability and trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Appellant posits that the circuit court failed to consider the content of the statement. In <em>Roebuck, supra, </em>148 Md.App. at 581, 813 A.2d 342, we stated that a court evaluating a declaration against penal interest must \u201ccarefully consider the content of the statement in light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and all relevant information concerning the declarant[.]\u201d We believe the circuit court did just that. According to appellant, the court concluded that the statement concerned \u201cDarren Johnson\u2019s\u201d presence in the apartment and his decision to force two individuals into the van, with appellant\u2019s absence being collateral. Appellant points out that he sought admission of the entire statement, and asserts that the circuit court only looked at the segments of the statement that mentioned appellant, finding those portions to be collateral to the general focus of the statement. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument because it is apparent that the circuit court properly found the entire statement to be unreliable, untrustworthy, lacking corroboration, and, thus, inadmissible. Moreover, it is apparent that the thrust of Mr. Jones\u2019s statement concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>him and \u201cDarren Johnson,\u201d with appellant\u2019s absence merely mentioned, almost in an <em>ad hoc </em>fashion. While not dispositive either way, this is certainly a consideration. <em>See Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 15-16, 526 A.2d 955 (discussing collateral and noncollateral statements and inculpatory and exculpatory versions of both).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">At bottom, the circuit court determined that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement to defense counsel lacked the required sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d and \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d for the statement to be admissible pursuant to Rule 5-804(b)(3). <em>Stewart, </em>151 Md.App. at 447, 827 A.2d 850 (citations omitted); <em>accord United States v. Thomas, </em>919 F.2d 495, 498 (8th Cir.1990) (deceased co-defendant\u2019s telephone call to his counsel allegedly exculpating defendant not admissible statement against penal interest because, in addition to not tending to subject him to criminal liability, there were no \u201ccorroborating circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the statement\u201d); <em>United States v. Zirpolo, </em>704 F.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir.1983) (exculpatory affidavit signed by former co-defendant who had pled guilty, but invoked Fifth Amendment privilege making him unavailable, not admissible as statement against penal interest because circumstances did not corroborate affidavit\u2019s trustworthiness). In addition to the statement including suggestions that Mr. Jones acted in self-defense, the court found a plethora of circumstances indicating that the statement was untrustworthy. Appellant brought Mr. Jones to defense counsel\u2019s office one day after the incident in the apartment, before either of the men had been arrested for the charged crimes. Appellant suggested that Mr. Jones wanted to make the statement, and appellant offered to pay for Mr. Jones\u2019s representation, albeit presumably by a different attorney. Mr. Jones stated that, at the time of the statement, he did not have anywhere to live other than with appellant. Furthermore, at the hearing on the State\u2019s motion in limine prior to appellant\u2019s trial, Mr. Jones refused to answer whether he gave the statement to protect appellant. Instead, Mr. Jones stated that he \u201cain\u2019t saying nothing.\u201d Still, Mr. Jones testified that the statement he made to defense counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cnot true\u201d and that he \u201cmade up\u201d the statement. Finally, though otherwise unsubstantiated, Mr. Jones\u2019s counsel advised the circuit court that Mr. Jones would not testify against appellant, despite the court\u2019s admonishments, because Mr. Jones \u201cwas terrified\u201d of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The statement is also clearly inconsistent with the statement of facts on which Mr. Jones pled guilty, where he inculpated appellant. On appeal, appellant posits that Mr. Jones\u2019s plea was an <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). An <em>Alford </em>plea is \u201ca guilty plea containing a protestation of innocence,\u201d which \u201clies somewhere between a plea of guilty and a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>[,]\u201d where a \u201cdefendant does not contest or admit guilt.\u201d <em>Bishop v. State, </em>417 Md. 1, 18-19, 7 A.3d 1074 (2010) (citations omitted). In its decision in <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, the Supreme Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apn\">[WJhile most pleas of guilty consist of both a waiver of trial and an express admission of guilt, the latter element is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of criminal penalty. An individual accused of [a] crime may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he [or she] is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Appellant directs our attention to an excerpt from Mr. Jones\u2019s plea hearing. The excerpted colloquy occurred after the court asked Mr. Jones the appropriate litany of questions and the State presented the factual predicate for the plea, evidence that would have been produced at trial, including appellant\u2019s presence during the commission of the crimes. Mr. Jones\u2019s defense counsel also already indicated on behalf of his client that Mr. Jones had no additions or corrections to the factual predicate. Then, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">THE COURT: Okay.

I just want to make it clear when you asked him, are you pleading guilty, because you are guilty, and no other reason, I just want to make sure the only reason he said basically is because the plea agreement, but aside from the plea agreement, the reason why you\u2019re pleading guilty is you are guilty, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">[MR. JONES]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">As a result of the plea, the State recommended, and the Court imposed, a life sentence, with all but twenty-five years suspended. The State allowed Mr. Jones to file a motion for reconsideration to be held in abeyance and addressed at a later date. Based on the above, appellant posits that Mr. Jones\u2019s plea was an <em>Alford </em>plea, rather than a guilty plea, or at least some sort of \u201chybrid\u201d of the two. We concur with appellant that Mr. Jones received a favorable plea bargain. However, a favorable plea bargain does not convert a guilty plea into an <em>Alford </em>plea, and we discern no error in the circuit court citing Mr. Jones\u2019s prior guilty plea as a factor in its consideration of the State\u2019s motion in limine in appellant\u2019s case. Moreover, the fact that Mr. Jones pled guilty based on a factual predicate that, in regard to appellant\u2019s presence and participation, was directly contrary to his statement to appellant\u2019s defense counsel was a logical and proper consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in the circuit court\u2019s determination as to indicia of reliability and trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We hold that the circuit complied with Rule 5-804(b)(3) and the applicable case law when it excluded Mr. Jones\u2019s statement to defense counsel, rightfully wary that certain \u201cstatements are suspect because of a long-standing concern ... that a criminal defendant might get a pal to confess to the crime the defendant was accused of....\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>151 Md.App. at 454-55, 827 A.2d 850 (citing <em>Silverstein, </em>732 F.2d at 1346). It is evident that the court\u2019s decision relied on the complete dearth of indicia of reliability or corroborating evidence. Rather, there was a plethora of evidence that indicated that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement to appellant\u2019s defense counsel was unreliable, untrustworthy, uncorroborated, and, therefore, inadmissible as a statement against penal interest. The court did not clearly err in its factual determinations, and its ultimate decision that the statement was inadmissible was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Appellant refers us to the transcript of Mr. Jones's plea hearing, in which the statement of facts underlying the plea indicated that he and appellant committed the charged crimes together. The circuit court also presided over Mr. Jones\u2019s plea hearing and, therefore, was aware of the factual predicate underlying the plea during the proceedings in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">. A 2010 amendment of Rule 5-804, which is derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 804, substituted \u201coffered in a criminal case\u201d for \u201cto exculpate the accused\u201d in the second sentence of Rule 5-804(b)(3). The change paralleled a 2010 amendment to Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), providing that the corroborating circumstances requirement applies to all declarations against penal interest offered in criminal cases, regardless of the proponent. The Advisory Committee noted, \"A unitary approach to declarations against penal interest assures both the prosecution and the accused that the Rule will not be abused and that only reliable hearsay statements will be admitted under the exception.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) advisory committee note. As such, the portion of Rule 5-804(b)(3) that requires \"corroborating circumstances clearly indicating] the trustworthiness of the statement\u201d for the statement to be admissible is particularly relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">. Even though it would not have been binding on the circuit court, appellant contends that the State agreed with appellant that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement was a statement against interest on two occasions in the record. However, a review of the record clarifies that, in both instances cited by appellant, the State \"concedefd]\u201d and \u201cagreefd]\u201d that the <em>issue </em>at hand was whether Mr. Jones's statement was admissible as a statement against interest. As such, the State did not \u201cconcede\u201d or \"agree\" that Mr. Jones\u2019s statement was admissible as a statement against interest, but rather elucidated the question presented to the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
