The attorney is Frederick R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Franke, Jr. Franke was retained by Raymon K. Nelson, M.D. (\u201cRaymon\u201d), to represent Raymon in his capacity as the trustee of the Trust of his late brother, Ralph L. Nelson, M.D. (\u201cRalph, Sr.\u201d). The beneficiaries of the Trust are Ralph, Sr.\u2019s wife, Myra Nelson (\u201cMyra\u201d), and his son, Ralph L. Nelson, Jr. (\u201cRalph, Jr.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">When Myra filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking, among other things, the appointment of a co-trustee, because Raymon had purportedly mismanaged the Trust, Raymon hired Franke to represent him in this matter. After paying Franke a retainer and, later, as the case progressed, additional legal fees, Raymon reimbursed himself, with funds from the Trust, relying on provisions of the Trust Agreement that purportedly permitted him to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">After discovery had advanced, Myra, together with Ralph, Jr., who had been added as a party, amended what had become their joint petition to demand that Raymon be removed as trustee, that a trustee be appointed in Raymon\u2019s place, and that he be required to pay damages for misappropriation of Trust funds. Granting that request in part, the circuit court removed Raymon as trustee, replacing him with an interim trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">By that time, Raymon owed Franke more than $120,000 in legal fees. Unable to draw funds from the Trust, as a result of his removal as trustee, Raymon made no further payments to Franke though Franke continued to represent him in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>About two months before trial, Franke notified Raymon that, largely because of Raymoris failure to pay any pending or projected legal fees and costs, he intended to file a motion to withdraw as Raymoris counsel. The motion was first granted by one judge and then denied by another. From the ultimate denial of that motion, Franke noted this appeal, claiming that, in refusing to grant his motion to withdraw, the court had abused its discretion and that, under the collateral order doctrine, that ruling was an appealable order. Then, pending the resolution of this appeal, at the request of Franke and with no opposition from Myra and Ralph, Jr., the circuit court stayed these proceedings indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Because we hold that the circuit court\u2019s order rejecting Franke\u2019s request to withdraw is appealable under the collateral order doctrine and that the circuit court abused its discretion in so ruling, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and direct that court to grant Franke\u2019s request to withdraw as counsel for Raymon,</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">When, in 2004, Ralph, Sr., discovered that he was suffering from a rare and lethal form of cancer, he established, with the assistance of counsel, a trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) to receive the assets of his estate for the benefit of his wife, Myra, and his son, Ralph, Jr. He named as co-trustees his brother, Raymon, and himself. But, following the death of Ralph, Sr., later that year, Raymon became the sole trustee of the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Between 2005 and the spring of 2008, relations between the decedent\u2019s wife and brother deteriorated, because of, among other things, Raymoris substantial delays in, or perhaps avoidance of, communicating essential information regarding the financial condition of the Trust, to her. It was not until January 2008, Myra claims, that Raymon provided her with an accounting of the Trust for 2005. That accounting stated that the Trust had a balance of $2,556,702.09, as of the beginning of that year. Four months later, pressed by Myra to proride further information, Raymon supplied her with an accounting of the Trust\u2019s assets for 2006, but not for 2007. Then, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>result of an additional document provided by Raymon, Myra learned that the Trust\u2019s assets had declined in value from $2,556,702.09 to approximately $1,610,000 as of June 2008, a loss of $946,702.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Suspecting that Raymon was misappropriating Trust funds, Myra filed a petition in the Anne Arundel County circuit court, requesting that the circuit court assume jurisdiction over the Trust; order an accounting of the Trust\u2019s assets; prohibit Raymon \u201cfrom spending any Trust funds for any purpose\u201d other than to provide a monthly allowance to Myra; require Raymon to show cause why he should not be removed as trustee; and appoint a co-trustee. Several weeks later, Raymon hired Franke to represent him, paying him a $10,000 retainer, and later, as the case progressed, at least $24,437.39 in additional legal fees. Raymon then reimbursed himself, for the fees he had paid Franke, with funds from the Trust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">A second amended petition, filed by Myra and Ralph, Jr., requested that the court immediately remove Raymon as trustee and appoint, in his place, Myra\u2019s cousin \u201cor some other suitable individual\u201d as trustee, as well as a demand for damages of $1,500,000 for fraudulent misappropriation and intentional dissipation of Trust funds. Four months later, Myra and Ralph, Jr., filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that Raymon be enjoined from reimbursing himself with monies from the Trust. Judge Pamela L. North, who had been specially assigned to the case, removed Raymon as trustee and appointed, in his stead, Myra\u2019s cousin as interim trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Trial on the remaining claims, relating to Raymon\u2019s purported misappropriation of Trust assets, was scheduled for February 2, 2010. Two months before that date, Franke sent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>letter to Raymon, notifying him of Franke\u2019s intent to file a motion to withdraw as his counsel. Almost two weeks after that, Franke filed a motion to withdraw his appearance, hand-delivering a courtesy copy to Judge North.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In that motion, Franke stated that he was owed more than $120,000 in legal fees; that he had, nonetheless, continued representing Raymon \u201cbecause of the potential prejudice\u201d that might have occurred \u201cwith discovery still outstanding and with a hearing set for a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\u201d; that \u201csince the ruling on th\u00e9 Preliminary Injunction,\u201d he had \u201coverseen the turnover of trustee responsibilities\u201d to the interim trustee and had \u201cundertaken efforts to settle the matter\u201d to no avail; that he had served Raymon with notice, as required by the Maryland rules; and that trial was scheduled \u201ctwo months from the notice of intention to withdraw.\u201d There were, he suggested, \u201cother reasons for the withdrawal\u201d and that those reasons had \u201ccreated a conflict making continued representation problematic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Raymon opposed the motion, contending that \u201cat this late stage in the matter, having completed discovery and other trial preparation work,\u201d and with trial to begin in five weeks, he \u201cwould likely sustain irreparable harm and an unfair trial if Counsel were to withdraw.\u201d Any conflicts between himself and Franke were, he claimed, \u201cfinancially based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Although the instant case had been specially assigned to Judge North, Franke\u2019s motion was, for some unknown reason, presented to a different circuit court judge: Judge Paul A. Hackner. After Judge Hackner granted the motion, the Clerk of the Circuit Court sent notice to Raymon, advising him that his \u201cfailure to have new counsel enter his appearance\u201d within fifteen days after service of the notice \u201cshall not be grounds for postponing any further proceedings, concerning the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">But, seven days later, Judge Hackner \u201cwithdrew\u201d his order, stating that, because the case had been specially assigned to Judge North, it was she, not he, who should have been given the withdrawal motion to decide. The effect of this ruling was to re-instate Franke\u2019s representation of Raymon, leaving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>motion to withdraw still pending. Then, Judge North denied the motion, without elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">After noting an appeal from that ruling, Franke filed a motion in the circuit court to stay proceedings pending that appeal. In their response to that motion, Myra and Ralph, Jr., stated that they were \u201cnot opposed\u201d to a stay, and Judge North thereafter granted that motion, staying all proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We begin by addressing an issue of first impression in Maryland, that is, whether we may consider, under the collateral order doctrine, an interlocutory appeal from the denial of an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, as counsel, in a civil case. Although the \u201cexercise of appellate jurisdiction in Maryland is normally dependent upon a final judgment rendered by the trial court,\u201d <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Bowen, </em>410 Md. 287, 294, 978 A.2d 678 (2009), there are \u201cthree exceptions\u201d to that rule: \u201cappeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602;[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660 (2005). Because, as Franke concedes, this appeal is neither allowed by statute nor permitted by Rule 2-602, we look, as he does, to the collateral order doctrine, in determining the appealability of the lower court\u2019s ruling. For an order to fall within that exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">(2) it must resolve an important issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">(3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">(4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-14\"><em>Addison v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 138, 154, 917 A.2d 1200 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">Because there are no Maryland appellate decisions that specifically consider the appealability of a trial court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>denying an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw in a civil case, we turn, for assistance, to the decisions of those federal and state courts that have. When we do, we find that nearly all of the courts which have decided this issue, federal and state, have held that orders denying an attorney\u2019s request to withdraw fall within the collateral order doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Brandon v. Blech, </em>560 F.3d 536, 537 (6th Cir.2009) (concluding that, because an \u201corder compelling an attorney to continue work without compensation\u201d \u201cconclusively\u201d determines the disputed question, \u201cis unrelated to the merits, cannot be rectified after a final judgment, and may impose significant hardship,\u201d it \u201cis just the sort of order the [collateral order] doctrine contemplates\u201d); <em>Rivera-Domenech v. Calvesbert Law Offices PSC, </em>402 F.3d 246, 249 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam) (observing that \u201c[a]t the time of the entry of the denial of the motion to withdraw, there was interlocutory jurisdiction to take an appeal to this court\u201d); <em>Fid. Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co. of New York v. Intercounty Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>310 F.3d 537 (7th Cir.2002) (holding that an order denying an attorney\u2019s request to withdraw satisfies the collateral order doctrine); <em>Whiting v. Lacara, </em>187 F.3d 317 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam) (holding that an order denying an attorney\u2019s request to withdraw satisfies the collateral order doctrine); <em>Galloway v. Clay, </em>861 A.2d 30 (D.C.2004) (holding that an order denying an attorney\u2019s request to withdraw satisfies the collateral order doctrine); <em>Silva v. Perkins Mach. Co., </em>622 A.2d 443, 444 (R.I.1993) (per curiam) (holding \u201cthat the order denying [attorney\u2019s] motion to withdraw possesses the requisite degree of finality\u201d and that it should be reviewed \u201cimmediately to avoid imminent hardship to the attorney\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Two of those <em>cases\u2014Whiting v. Lacara, </em>187 F.3d 317, and <em>Fidelity National Title Insurance Company of New York v. Intercounty National Title Insurance Company, </em>310 F.3d 537\u2014provide a particularly helpful and comprehensive analysis of this issue and therefore merit elaboration. In <em>Whiting v. Lacara, </em>the first of the two cases, a former police officer, Whiting, brought a civil rights action, in federal district court, against his former employer, the Old Brookville Police Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ment, and other local entities and individuals, after his employment with that department was, in his view, wrongfully terminated <em>Id. </em>at 318. After retaining, then discharging his first counsel, Whiting\u2019s second counsel withdrew from the case, with Whiting\u2019s consent, after a jury had been selected, and that resulted in the discharge of the jury. Whiting eventually hired Garrett R. Lacara to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">But, less than two weeks before trial, Lacara filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Attached to his motion was an affidavit in which Lacara averred, as grounds for his motion, that Whiting had \u201cfailed to follow legal advice,\u201d had not kept adequate contact with his office, had demanded that Lacara re-litigate issues that had already been decided, and had \u201cdemanded publicity against legal advice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, relations between attorney and client had become so strained that, according to Lacara, Whiting had entered his office on one occasion and, without permission, had begun \u201crifflfing]\u201d through Lacara\u2019s in-box. <em>Id. </em>When asked to leave, Whiting refused until Lacara called \u201c911.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">After denying these allegations, Whiting stated that he would agree to an order permitting Lacara to withdraw, provided that all of the fees that he had paid Lacara were refunded. That was not necessary because the district court denied Lacara\u2019s motion outright. Challenging that ruling, Lacara filed an appeal, as well as a motion requesting an \u201cemergency stay\u201d of the district court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit granted the stay but denied Lacara\u2019s \u201crequest for relief on the merits at that time,\u201d whereupon Lacara renewed his motion to withdraw in the district court. <em>Id. </em>When that court rejected, once more, his request to withdraw, Lacara noted his second appeal. That appeal was then consolidated, for review, with his previous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Second Circuit found that the order denying \u201cLacara\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel satisfie[d] each of the ... requirements\u201d of the collateral order exception, pointing out that it \u201c \u2018conclusively determine^] the disputed question,\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>that is, whether counsel will \u201c \u2018continue his representation,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 320 (quoting <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 375-76, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981)); that it presented \u201can issue completely separate from the merits of the underlying action,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and that, once a final judgment had been entered, the harm to Lacara \u201cw[ould] be complete, and no relief c[ould] be obtained on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It hardly needs to be said that the order before us possesses the same features as the order which the Second Circuit found to be an appealable collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We now turn to the second of the two cases: <em>Fidelity National Title Insurance Company of New York v. Intercounty National Title Insurance Company, supra, </em>310 F.3d 537. But, before we begin our review of that case, we note that there is one other reason why it is particularly deserving of our attention and that is because of its thoughtful and swift disposal of any inclination to equate an order denying withdrawal to a nonappealable order disqualifying counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Fidelity National Title filed suit, in federal district court, alleging that the named corporate and individual defendants had wrongfully diverted $20 million from real estate escrow accounts under their control. Five of those defendants\u2014three corporations and the two individuals, who controlled those corporate entities\u2014retained the law firm of Myron M. Cherry &amp; Associates, LLC, to represent them. As the case progressed, they repeatedly failed to pay their legal bills, eventually owing the Cherry law firm approximately $470,000 in legal fees and expenses. That led the Cherry law firm to move, on two separate occasions, to -withdraw its representation. But, each time, its motion was denied. When the last of the two motions was denied, the law firm appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In considering whether it had jurisdiction over that appeal, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that the Supreme Court had held that neither an order disqualifying a lawyer, <em>Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, </em>472 U.S. 424, 105 S.Ct. 2757, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>L.Ed.2d 340 (1985), nor an order declining to do so, <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981), was appealable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While conceding a \u201csuperficial\u201d similarity between orders denying motions to disqualify and motions to withdraw, it avowed a \u201cvital difference\u201d: \u201c[IJncorrect decisions about disqualification may justify reversal at the end of the case, while an incorrect decision forcing an unpaid lawyer to continue providing services never would supply a reason to reverse the final judgment.\u201d 310 F.3d at 539. Then, observing that, \u201c[bjecause an order compelling a lawyer to work without prospect of compensation is unrelated to the merits of the dispute, cannot be rectified at the end of the case, and has a potential to cause significant hardship,\u201d the Seventh Circuit, relying upon the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Whiting, supra, </em>stated that it was joining that circuit in holding that an order denying a motion to withdraw \u201cis immediately appealable as a collateral order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Because we find persuasive the reasoning of <em>Whiting </em>and Fidelity\u2014showing that an order denying an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw satisfies all of the criteria of the collateral order doctrine and therefore should be treated as an appealable collateral order\u2014we hold that Franke\u2019s interlocutory appeal falls within that exception to the rule of finality and shall be considered by this Court on interlocutory appeal. Indeed, were we to rule otherwise, we would effectively deny the bar any means for seeking the reversal of what may prove to be an erroneous and extremely burdensome ruling, because to defer an appellate challenge to such a ruling until final judgment essentially renders it moot on arrival. <em>Rivera-Domenech, supra, </em>402 F.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Having decided that this matter is properly before us, we now consider the propriety of the decision below. In so doing, we employ an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Serio v. Baystate Props., LLC, </em>203 Md.App. 581, 590, 39 A.3d 131 (2012); <em>Das v. Das, </em>133 Md.App. 1, 31, 754 A.2d 441 (2000). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the court\u2019 or if the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Serio, </em>203 Md.App. at 590, 39 A.3d 131 (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994) (in banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">There are two Maryland rules governing when an attorney may withdraw from a case. They are Rule 1.16 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 2-132 of the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure, in particular, paragraphs (b)(5), (b)(6) and (c) of the former and paragraph (b) of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Paragraphs (b)(5), (b)(6), and (c) of Rule 1.16 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u2756 sis *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">(5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer\u2019s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">(6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">There is no dispute that Raymon, Franke\u2019s client, has, in the words of paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 1.16, \u201cfail[ed] substantially to fulfill an obligation\u201d owed to Franke, \u201cregarding ... the services\u201d provided by Franke as his lawyer. In fact, Raymon has never disputed the amount of legal fees that he owes Franke. It exceeds $120,000. Nor has he, as far as the record discloses, made any attempt to either pay any portion, no matter how small, of the fee arrearage or to obtain new counsel since his removal as trustee. That may be because he does not have the funds or because he adamantly insists that he is entitled to have Franke\u2019s continued representation, regardless of whether he pays the outstanding legal bills or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Moreover, there is no disagreement that Franke gave Raymon \u201creasonable warning,\u201d as required by the same paragraph of Rule 1.16, that he would withdraw unless Raymon fulfilled his obligation to cure the fee arrearage. Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(b)(5). Two months before the scheduled trial, Franke advised Raymon of his intention to withdraw, as Raymon\u2019s counsel, for non-payment of fees and suggested that Raymon should either obtain new counsel or notify the court that he wished to proceed pro se. Thirteen days later, eight days more than the five days mandated by the Maryland Rules of Procedure, Franke filed his motion to withdraw, as well as a certificate that he had so informed Raymon by letter of his intention to withdraw his representation. In response, Raymon filed an opposition to Franke\u2019s withdrawal motion, acknowledging that he had received Franke\u2019s letter. Thus, Franke fully complied with paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 1.16, having established that Raymon had \u201csubstantially\u201d failed \u201cto fulfill an obligation\u201d to him and that he had given Raymon \u201creasonable warning\u201d of his decision to withdraw as Raymon\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>As for paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 1.16, which permits a lawyer to \u201cwithdraw from representing a client if ... the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer,\u201d Raymon does not claim that there is any chance that Franke will be paid for his legal services except out of the assets of the Trust, a highly unlikely outcome. Indeed, given the circuit court\u2019s finding that, in his capacity as trustee, Raymon \u201cwas either dangerously cavalier in his treatment of the insurance benefits or he was willfully stealing from Ralph\u2019s estate and, therefore, from the Trust\u201d; and the thirty-seven percent reduction in the value of the assets of the Trust under Raymon\u2019s trusteeship, there appears to be little likelihood either that the interim trustee will pay any portion of Raymon\u2019s legal fees, from the assets of the Trust, or that Raymon will be restored as trustee of the Trust, so that he can gain access to those funds himself. In any event, Franke should not have to wait to see if the latter event occurs. He was not retained on a contingent fee basis or on the assumption that he would be paid from the Trust\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Having no reasonable prospect of receiving any of the more than $120,000 owed him, Franke faces, unless given the opportunity to withdraw, further expenditures of time and resources on Raymon\u2019s behalf, as significant proceedings lie ahead, notably, Raymon\u2019s trial. Thus, Franke, who is a solo practitioner, finds himself confronted with an \u201cunreasonable financial burden,\u201d not unlike the four-lawyer firm in <em>Fidelity, </em>which was owed $470,000 by its client (which, when divided by four, the number of lawyers in the withdrawing firm, is approximately what Raymon owes Franke). As a consequence, the denial of the firm\u2019s motion to withdraw, shortly before trial, by the federal district court, was reversed by the Seventh Circuit. 310 F.3d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We now turn to Rule 2-132 of the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs striking of an attorney\u2019s appearance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section (b) of that rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>When the client has no other attorney of record, an attorney wishing to withdraw an appearance shall file a motion to withdraw. Except when the motion is made in open court, the motion shall be accompanied by the client\u2019s written consent to the withdrawal or the moving attorney\u2019s certificate that notice has been mailed to the client at least five days prior to the filing of the motion, informing the client of the attorney\u2019s intention to move for withdrawal and advising the client to have another attorney enter an appearance or to notify the clerk in writing of the client\u2019s intention to proceed in proper person. Unless the motion is granted in open court, the court may not order the appearance stricken before the expiration of the time prescribed by Rule 2-311 for responding. The court may deny the motion if withdrawal of the appearance would cause undue delay, prejudice, or injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">As directed by Rule 2\u2014132(b), Franke\u2019s motion to withdraw was \u201caccompanied by\u201d a \u201ccertificate that notice ha[d] been mailed to\u201d Raymon \u201cat least five days prior to the filing of the motion.\u201d In fact, Franke waited thirteen days, after mailing a notice certificate to Raymon, before filing his motion to withdraw. The notice mailed to Raymon informed him of Franke\u2019s \u201cintention to move for withdrawal\u201d and advised Raymon \u201cto have another attorney enter an appearance or to notify the clerk in writing of fhis] intention to proceed in proper person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, Franke fulfilled the requirements of Rule 2\u2014132(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">But that does not end our analysis. In fact, it only opens the door to a much more complex task and that is consideration of the last sentence of Rule 2-132(b). That sentence enumerates the three grounds upon which a court may deny a motion to withdraw, even after the moving attorney has complied with the notice requirements of Rule 2\u2014132(b). It states that a court \u201cmay deny\u201d such a motion \u201cif withdrawal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the appearance would cause undue delay, prejudice, or injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Reviewing those terms in the sequence in which they are presented by paragraph (b), we first address \u201cundue delay.\u201d No one suggested below or has argued on appeal that undue delay would have followed if Franke\u2019s motion to withdraw had been granted. Nor could this have been a pressing concern of the court, since it could have quite reasonably denied any ensuing motion to postpone, given that Raymon had ample time to secure other counsel or prepare for self-representation, a not unfeasible alternative, as Raymon, a medical doctor, is, by any standard, highly educated. As we observed in <em>Serio, supra, </em>203 Md.App. at 592, 39 A.3d 131, \u201ca client who did not act to secure substitute counsel following notification of an attorney\u2019s intent to withdraw is not entitled to a continuance.\u201d <em>Accord Das, supra, </em>133 Md.App. at 25-26, 31, 754 A.2d 441. Thus, undue delay would not necessarily have been a result of granting Franke\u2019s withdrawal request.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Turning now to \u201cprejudice,\u201d the second ground upon which a withdrawal can be denied, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, Raymon would not have suffered unfair prejudice if Franke\u2019s motion to withdraw had been granted. It is undisputed that Raymon has not paid Franke since April 15, 2009. It is inconceivable that Raymon, who, as we noted, is a medical doctor, did not understand that a likely consequence of his failure to pay any legal fees incurred, after his removal as trustee, would ultimately be an attempt by his counsel to withdraw from the case. And, when Franke finally did notify Raymon of his intention to withdraw, Raymon had two months in which to obtain new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">And, if new counsel was not a feasible option, Franke placed Raymon in as good a position to represent himself as he could, having, as Franke explained in his motion to withdraw, \u201ccarried\u201d and continued to represent Raymon, despite the legal fees that were owed, \u201cbecause\u201d he feared \u201cthe potential prejudice that m[ight] have occurred with discovery still outstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ing and with a hearing set for a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Then, when the motion for a preliminary injunction was granted and Raymon was removed as trustee, Franke, disregarding once again the fees that Raymon owed him, oversaw \u201cthe turnover of trustee responsibilities\u201d to the interim trustee and undertook \u201cefforts to settle the matter.\u201d It was only after fulfilling those responsibilities that Franke finally informed Raymon of his intent to withdraw, timing his motion to withdraw to coincide with a lull in the case. Raymon was given two months\u2019 notice of Franke\u2019s intent to withdraw, and there was no element of surprise. In short, Franke has gone to some lengths to avoid compromising Raymon\u2019s interests. Indeed, any prejudice which Raymon might suffer as a consequence of granting the motion to withdraw is plainly self-inflicted. <em>Serio, </em>203 Md.App. at 594, 39 A.3d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Before leaving the question of prejudice, we observe that a circuit court faced with an attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw should also consider whether third parties would suffer unfair prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Brandon, supra, </em>560 F.3d at 538 (observing that \u201ca district court may forbid withdrawal if it would work severe prejudice on ... third parties\u201d); <em>Fidelity, </em>310 F.3d at 541 (analyzing prejudice in terms of \u201c[sjevere prejudice to third parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In declining to oppose Franke\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings, Myra and Ralph, Jr., thereby confirmed, we note, that they did not expect to suffer any prejudice because of the delay. And, indeed, we can think of none, as, having removed Raymon as trustee and installed Myra\u2019s cousin as interim trustee, the court had already granted, at least on a temporary basis, much of the relief they had requested. Thus, time\u2014 whether spent productively or futilely\u2014was on their side.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">We now turn to the third factor enumerated in Maryland Rule 2-132, \u201cinjustice,\u201d that is, the nature and extent to which parties to the litigation, any third parties, or the attorney seeking to withdraw would suffer injustice as a result, if the court granted or denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>As to the injustice an attorney would suffer upon the denial of his or her motion to withdraw, the Seventh Circuit observed, \u201can order compelling a lawyer to work without prospect of compensation ... has a potential to cause significant hardship\u201d to the attorney. <em>Fidelity, </em>310 F.3d at 539. <em>See also Brandon, </em>560 F.3d at 538 (observing that to \u201ccompel[ ] attorneys to continue representing clients who refuse to pay imposes a severe burden\u201d); <em>Rivera-Domenech, supra, </em>402 F.3d at 249 (observing that it \u201csimply expects too much of counsel to expend the additional energy necessary to go to trial,\u201d and to advance the necessary expenses, \u201cwithout any real assurance that he will be paid for any of it, especially where he already is owed a substantial sum and the client has violated the written fee agreement\u201d) (citation and quotation omitted); <em>Silva, supra, </em>622 A.2d at 444 (observing that to \u201crequire [the attorney] to finance the costs of [the client\u2019s] litigation would impose an unfair financial burden on the attorney\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Raymon asserted in his opposition to the motion to withdraw: \u201c[A]t this late stage in the matter, having completed discovery and other trial preparation work and [with] trial looming in [five] weeks, [he] would likely sustain irreparable harm and an unfair trial if Counsel were to withdraw [at] this stage.\u201d We reject this claim of injustice. Raymon must bear the consequences of his failure to pay existing attorney fees and his acknowledged inability to pay those likely to be incurred by the trial of this case. <em>Serio, </em>203 Md.App. at 594, 39 A.3d 131 (defendant in civil case required to proceed to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>without counsel). On the other hand, the circuit court\u2019s order, effectively compelling Franke to continue representing Raymon, without reasonable likelihood of compensation, imposed an unreasonable financial burden on him. <em>Brandon, </em>560 F.3d at 538; <em>Fidelity, </em>310 F.3d at 539. Thus, there would be no injustice to Raymon if the motion to withdraw were granted, but there would be to Franke if that motion were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Franke\u2019s motion to withdraw. The effect of that denial was to compel Franke to provide free legal services to Raymon. Consequently, we shall vacate the trial court\u2019s order denying Franke\u2019s motion to withdraw and direct that it be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY DENYING MOTION TO WITHDRAW VACATED.
