DAVIS (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">A jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted Robert Edward Quansah, appellant, of second-degree assault and violating a peace order, and acquitted him of first-degree assault, arson, threat of arson and two other arson-related offenses. The court imposed consecutive sentences of ten years for the assault and ninety days for the peace order violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Challenging those convictions and sentences, appellant raises three questions for our review, which we revise as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>1. Did the trial court err in imposing separate and consecutive sentences for second-degree assault and violating a peace order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting an extrajudicial statement of the assault victim, Martha Kembumbala, from her application for a peace order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">3. Did the trial court err in excluding evidence that Kembumbala threatened to harm appellant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">We conclude that, under the Rule of Lenity, appellant\u2019s sentence for violating a peace order must be merged into his sentence for second degree assault because both convictions may have been based on a single act. Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting Kembumbala\u2019s statement and did not exclude evidence of a threat by Kembumbala, we shall affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">At a three-day trial, the State presented evidence that, on the same day that appellant was served with a peace order requiring him to stay away from the residence where he was renting a room from Martha Kembumbala, appellant returned to the premises and beat her with a tire iron. Two of Kembumbala\u2019s other tenants confirmed her account of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Appellant\u2019s defense, as articulated in defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, was that Kembumbala obtained the peace order in order to \u201cget even\u201d with him after he ended their romantic relationship and that she then sent Timothy Allen, one of her tenants, to assault appellant when he parked across the street in the taxicab that he drove as a part-time job. According to appellant, Kembumbala fled when she saw him chasing after Allen with a tire iron, falling twice and sustaining the injuries that she later claimed were inflicted by appellant. Admitting that he made physical contact with Kembumbala, appellant maintained that he did so only after he heard gunshots, when he ran to Kembumbala in order to protect her. Shortly after the altercation, appellant drove to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the police station to report the assault by Allen but, instead, was arrested and charged with assault based on Kembumbala\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Martha Kembumbala testified that, in the spring of 2009, she owned and resided at a six-bedroom house located at 3613 Washington Avenue in the Gwynn Oak area of Baltimore County. In May 2009, she was renting rooms to several individuals, including appellant, Timothy Allen, and Allen\u2019s girlfriend, Pauline Francois. About three weeks after appellant moved into her residence in March of 2009, Kembumbala and appellant \u201cwent out a couple of times\u201d but it \u201cwasn\u2019t really a serious relationship.\u201d Because appellant soon became verbally and emotionally abusive, calling her derogatory names and demanding sexual relations, Kembumbala ended the romantic relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">According to Kembumbala, appellant thereafter threatened \u201cmore than five times\u201d that, if she attempted to evict him, he would burn the house down. Despite these warnings and appellant\u2019s attempts to continue the relationship, Kembumbala instructed appellant to move out during the first week of May, but he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On Sunday, May 24, 2009, Kembumbala contacted appellant\u2019s pastor and twice called 911 for police assistance due to appellant\u2019s continued presence and threats.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When an officer told her that he could not help unless she obtained a peace order, Kembumbala went to district court and obtained an interim peace order at 1:23 a.m. on Monday, May 25, 2009. The peace order, which was admitted into evidence, prohibited appellant from contacting Kembumbala, attempting to contact her or entering her property. A Baltimore County police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>officer served appellant with the order and escorted him from Kembumbala\u2019s property at 5:00 a.m. that same morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Later that day, as she was leaving her shift as a private duty nursing aide at 11:00 p.m., Kembumbala saw appellant drive his taxicab past the premises where she was employed. When she arrived home, Kembumbala smelled a strong odor of gasoline. Accompanied by Allen and Francois, Kembumbala went outside and discovered that the exterior wall and two windows outside her bedroom had been blackened by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Kembumbala testified that, while she, Allen, and Francois were still outside, she called 911 on her cell phone and simultaneously continued to look around the premises. She heard Francois call out and, when she went to the front of the house, she saw appellant parked across the street in his taxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">When appellant saw Kembumbala, he got out of his vehicle, \u201cgrabbed [her] from the back\u201d as she attempted to get inside her house, and struck her repeatedly with a black steel object, landing blows on her head, knee, and toe, and causing her to fall on the grass. As he hit her, appellant repeatedly stated, \u201cI told you I was going to kill you.\u201d Before briefly losing consciousness, Kembumbala heard a \u201cgunshot, pop-pop like two or three times\u201d and then saw appellant enter his taxi. When police and paramedics arrived, she declined to go to the hospital, but later went because her pain worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Baltimore County Police Officer Zachary Small testified that, when he responded to a 911 call from Kembumbala\u2019s residence, she \u201chad several injuries. Her clothing was disheveled. She was visibly shaking, crying.\u201d On the grass beside her driveway, the officer discovered \u201ca tire iron that was laying near\u201d Kembumbala\u2019s shoes, bracelet, car keys and Bluetooth earpiece.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">A fire inspector testified that gasoline had been poured along two window frames and fires intentionally ignited in both locations, but the fires had burned out. A container of gasoline, which Kembumbala explained was used to fuel a lawnmower, was found \u201cbetween half and full\u201d in the garage on the property. Photos depicting Kembumbala\u2019s injuries, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>tire iron and the burned areas of the house were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">After Officer Small returned to the police station, appellant came in \u201cto report that he had been assaulted.\u201d Appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and elected to provide his account of the altercation. Appellant told the officer that he was across the street from Kembumbala\u2019s residence when Allen assaulted him and \u201cfired several shots from an unknown handgun.\u201d Appellant claimed that he then grabbed his tire iron and chased Allen across the street, but that he dropped it and that he did not assault Kembumbala. According to the officer, appellant did not complain of any injuries and none were visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Timothy Allen and Pauline Francois confirmed Kembumbala\u2019s account of the arson and the assault. Both testified that, on the evening of the incident, Kembumbala came to their room while they were watching a movie to enlist their assistance in investigating a strong odor of gasoline. The trio went outside, where they discovered that a wall of the house had been burned. When Kembumbala got to the front of the house, she spotted appellant across the street; Allen and Francois also saw him \u201csitting in a taxi watching the house.\u201d Both witnesses recounted that, \u201c[a]s soon as he spotted\u201d them, appellant \u201cjumped out\u201d of his vehicle \u201ccharging towards\u201d them, carrying a long, shiny, black, pipe-like object. Allen and Francois ran and then heard \u201cpow-pow-pow,\u201d which they perceived to be gunshots.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They looked back at the house and saw appellant \u201crepeatedly beat\u201d Kembumbala \u201cmore than five times\u201d with the weapon, then \u201cran back to the cab and pull[ ] off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He claimed that he began a romantic and sexual relationship with Kembumbala within three or four weeks after he moved into her house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>According to appellant, because Kembumbala was seeing other men and taking financial advantage of him, he ended the relationship. On the Sunday before Kembumbala obtained the peace order, appellant told her that he was planning to move out of her house that Tuesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Appellant maintained that Kembumbala\u2019s allegations in support of the peace order were false, denying that he hurt her in any way and that he threatened to burn her house and choke her. After appellant left Kembumbala\u2019s house as a result of the peace order, he decided to stay in his car, as he waited for the hearing that was scheduled three days later and to get his money back from Kembumbala.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Later that night, appellant drove his cab to the apartment complex across the street from Kembumbala\u2019s house, planning to call his brother to pick him up there, because the cab company tracked the vehicle by \u201cGPS\u201d and required him to park it at his address-of-record when not on duty. While appellant was sitting in the cab, Timothy Allen approached. When appellant rolled down his window, Allen immediately punched him in the face, then ran. Appellant saw that Allen had a handgun. Appellant believed that Kembumbala sent Allen to attack him.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">After Allen punched him, appellant grabbed a tire iron that he had recently used to fix a flat tire, got out of the cab and began to chase Allen, who succeeded in eluding him. When Kembumbala saw appellant chasing Allen, she ran, falling on the gravel driveway twice. Appellant then heard shots fired and ran to Kembumbala. He \u201cembracefd] her and ... shook her,\u201d asking \u201cwhy are you doing this ... why do you hire somebody to kill me[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">According to appellant, Kembumbala\u2019s falls accounted for her injuries, which were inconsistent with the tire iron beating described by Kembumbala, Allen and Francois. When he went to the police station to report the assault by Allen and show his swollen face, he was arrested based on Kembumbala\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brother, James Quansah, testified that appellant is \u201ca quiet, gentle man\u201d who \u201cworked as an aide for the adult and disabled\u201d and also ministered to others as a pastor. According to James, his brother\u2019s face was bruised and swollen when he visited him in jail about a week after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Sentencing Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in imposing separate sentences for assault and violation of a peace order\u201d even though both convictions arose from the same conduct. \u201cUnder the Double Jeopardy Clause, a defendant is protected against multiple punishment for the same conduct, unless the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 141, 156, 742 A.2d 493 (1999). As this Court has explained, when two statutory crimes arise out of the same act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">[i]t is purely a question of reading legislative intent. If the Legislature intended two crimes arising out of a single act to be punished separately, we defer to that legislated choice. If the Legislature intended but a single punishment, we defer to that legislated choice. If we are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the so-called \u201cRule of Lenity,\u201d by which we give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-10\"><em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 201, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982) (citations omitted); <em>see Pair v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 617, 638, 33 A.3d 1024 (2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 Md. 397, 41 A.3d 571 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Appellant argues that \u201cit is entirely possible that the jury predicated both convictions upon the same conduct\u201d because the trial court instructed the jury that the State had the burden to prove that appellant \u201cfailed to comply with any term of the peace order,\u201d and \u201cthe assault was the most prominent alleged violation\u201d of the peace order. Invoking the Rule of Lenity, appellant contends that there is \u201cno indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>legislature in [this] context intended multiple punishment\u201d to be imposed for convictions arising from a single act, so that his ninety-day sentence for violating the peace order must be merged into his ten-year sentence for assault. Alternatively, appellant maintains that \u201cmerger is required as a matter of fundamental fairness\u201d because \u201cthe assault and violation of the peace order were effectively a single event,\u201d \u201c[t]he peace order was in effect for an extremely brief period\u201d and \u201cthe evident purpose\u201d of criminalizing both offenses is to protect persons like Ms. Kembumbala.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The State disputes that both convictions arose from a single act, arguing that the jury \u201clikely\u201d convicted appellant of second-degree assault and violating the peace order based on separate criminal acts, so that the trial court did not err in imposing separate punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">If, as the State maintains, there were separate factual bases for the two convictions, then the trial court clearly had authority to impose separate consecutive sentences for each conviction. <em>See, e.g., Kelly v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 403, 442, 6 A.3d 396 (2010) (\u201cPrinciples of fairness do not prevent separate sentences for [the] separate offenses\u201d of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 Md. 502, 10 A.3d 1181 <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2119, 179 L.Ed.2d 912 (2011); <em>Wooten-Bey v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 603, 629, 547 A.2d 1086 (1988) (Rule of Lenity does not require merger of sentences for \u201ctwo separate criminal acts for which the Legislature has provided distinct punishments,\u201d such as planning a robbery and committing a robbery), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>318 Md. 301, 568 A.2d 16 (1990). Thus, we must first address, as a threshold question, whether appellant\u2019s two convictions arose from a single act.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">A. Single Act Basis for Appellant\u2019s Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Second-degree assault is a statutory crime that encompasses the common law crimes of assault, battery, and assault and battery. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-203(a) of the Criminal Law Article (Crim.) (\u201cA person may not commit an assault.\u201d); Crim. \u00a7 3-201(b) (defining \u201cassault\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>mean \u201cthe crimes of assault, battery, and assault and battery, which retain their judicially determined meanings\u201d); <em>Nicolas v. State, </em>426 Md. 385, 402-03, 44 A.3d 396 (2012). A battery is a touching that is either harmful, unlawful or offensive. <em>Marlin v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 134, 166, 993 A.2d 1141, <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 339, 1 A.3d 468 (2010). <em>See also Nicolas, </em>426 Md. at 403, 44 A.3d 396 (\u201can assault of the battery variety is committed by causing offensive physical contact with another person.\u201d). Second-degree assault is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years. Crim. \u00a7 3-203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Under Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-1508 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">(a) Fines or imprisonment.\u2014An individual who fails to comply with the relief granted in an interim peace order under \u00a7 3-1503.1 of this subtitle [governing peace orders] ... is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to: (1) For a first offense, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days or both....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">(b) Arrest.\u2014A law enforcement officer shall arrest with or without a warrant and take into custody an individual who the officer has probable cause to believe is in violation of an interim peace order ... in effect at the time of the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In the State\u2019s view, appellant\u2019s admission that, \u201cwhen he was running toward Kembumbala, he knew that he was not supposed to have any contact with her or be on her property,\u201d supported a conviction for \u201cviolating the peace order by going onto her property and making contact with her,\u201d whereas the evidence that appellant subsequently beat her with the tire iron separately supported the assault conviction. For the reasons explained below, we disagree with the State\u2019s interpretation of the verdicts and, instead, conclude that the likely factual basis for both verdicts was that appellant grabbed Kembumbala.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">1. Standards Governing Review of Jury Verdicts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">The Court of Appeals has held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the appropriate standard to apply when addressing a question of factual ambiguity in the context of merging convictions is to resolve the ambiguity in the defendant\u2019s favor in a situation where it is impossible to know for certain the rationale of the trier of fact for finding the convictions entered against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Nicolas, </em>426 Md. at 408 n. 6, 44 A.3d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In <em>Nicolas, </em>the Court considered ambiguities in convictions for resisting arrest and assault, stemming from an altercation involving multiple police officers. <em>See id. </em>at 410-12, 44 A.3d 396. After reviewing the trial transcript, the jury instructions and the verdict sheet, the Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the record is ambiguous as to the factual bases for which the jury found Petitioner guilty of second degree assault of\u2019 two different officers who arrested him, because \u201ca reasonable jury could have found that the assaults were based on acts that preceded the officers\u2019 attempt to arrest Petitioner, or that the assaults were an integral part of the resisting arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 44 A.3d 396. Given that ambiguity, \u201cthe trial judge should have merged the assault convictions into the conviction for resisting arrest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Our task, therefore, is to review the record to determine whether, as appellant claims, there is a comparable ambiguity about whether the jury convicted him of violating the peace order and second degree assault based on a single criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">2. The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Before closing arguments began, the trial court instructed the jury that second-degree assault \u201cis causing offensive physical contact to another person\u201d and that, \u201c[t]o convict the Defendant of violation of a peace order, the State must prove ... that the Defendant failed to comply with any term of that peace order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed the evidence supporting each of the charges against appellant. After presenting the State\u2019s theory that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>used gasoline from the container in Kembumbala\u2019s garage to willfully \u201cset fire to or burn[ ] at least part\u201d of Kembumbala\u2019s house, the prosecutor addressed the charges of assault and violating the peace order, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[Appellant] is also charged with second degree assault. Now, a second degree assault under the law can be something as mild as a push or a slap, and <em>any kind of contact that a person finds offensive and does not consent to, that\u2019s a second degree assault.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Certainly, after what you have heard you can all agree that at a minimum the Defendant committed a second degree assault against Ms. Kembumbala that night. I mean, when you heard him testify, <em>he actually admitted to committing a second degree assault because ... he grabbed her, he shook her, </em>and then he acted as a human shield trying to protect her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">I ask that you not believe the last part but <em>I will say that the grabbing and the shaking at a minimum is a second degree assault. </em>So that has already been proved by the Defendant\u2019s own admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">However, he went further, and he is charged as a consequence with first degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">A first degree assault is an assault where the Defendant intended to cause serious physical injury. So <em>it is more than a grabbing and a shaking. </em>It is more than a slap or a hit to the face. <em>It is, for example, taking a, tire iron made of metal and cracking someone over the head with it, </em>as the Defendant did in this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">The Defendant is also charged with the violation of a peace order. And we know now after hearing all the evidence, and you will see the evidence, that the peace order was in place, that it did exist and the Defendant knew about it. <em>He went there in violation of the order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">Now, he says he went there because he wanted to park his car closer to the house. Well, maybe he got a cab so he had a reason to return to the property. In any event, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there, cab or no cab. <em>He certainly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the yard wh[ere] he has already admitted he\u2019s gone, and he wasn\u2019t supposed to have any contact with Ms. Kembumbala.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\n<em>So, even if his story is true about what he testified to today, there would have been no reason for him to run up into the yard and grab her that way because he had been court ordered not to have any contact with her.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\"><em>So he is guilty of violating that peace order. </em>He failed to comply with the major conditions of that order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In appellant\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel portrayed Ms. Kembumbala as a vengeful, scorned ex-lover who \u201cfabricated\u201d both the fire and her claim that appellant beat her with the tire iron that he admitted leaving on her property. In support, counsel pointed out that Allen and Francois did not smell any gasoline until after Kembumbala arrived home; that the gasoline container was still half-full; that Kembumbala\u2019s injuries were consistent with appellant\u2019s description of her falls and inconsistent with the prosecution witnesses\u2019 accounts of a repeated beating with a tire iron; that there was no evidence of Kembumbala\u2019s blood or DNA on the tire iron; that in the 911 recording of Kembumbala\u2019s call, instead of expressing fear and reporting appellant\u2019s presence at the moment she saw him parked across the street, Kembumbala yelled \u201cget him\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and hung up; and that appellant voluntarily went to police and \u201ctold the same story from day one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">At the end of his argument, defense counsel summarized the defense theory of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">He didn\u2019t attempt to violate a peace order, he didn\u2019t burn anybody\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t assault Ms. Kembumbala. He didn\u2019t knock her down. <em>He embraced her, is his testimony, and said, why are you doing this to me, </em>why are people shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>I don\u2019t think she probably even knew what the shooting was about, that Tim Allen had ... gone to that level. But the whole thing exploded. And I submit to you that this was Ms. Kembumbala setting this man up and then going through with the set up. And it is not preposterous, it is not crazy, and it is not beyond what people do. And if there weren\u2019t facts to support that, I wouldn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. But you have major facts to support\u2014you have this whole gas thing. That\u2019s major number one. You have \u201cget him\u201d on the tape and terminating a 911 call, but, above all, there is no evidence in this case of a tire iron beating, period. Does not exist. If it doesn\u2019t exist, they\u2019re lying, and you should find the man not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">3. Factual Basis for the Verdicts</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The State contends that the \u201cconviction for violating the peace order likely was based upon [appellant\u2019s] actions in entering Kembumbala\u2019s property and making contact with her, whereas his assault conviction was based upon the beating.\u201d We disagree. Based on the trial court\u2019s instructions, closing arguments and the evidence discussed therein, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that appellant committed a second-degree assault when he grabbed Kembumbala and that the same act also constituted a violation of the peace order. Indeed, the prosecutor expressly invited the jury to make such a finding. Thus, it is just as plausible, if not more so, that the jury found that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed either arson or first degree assault <em>(i e., </em>the tire iron beating), but convicted appellant of the two lesser crimes in the indictment, based on the prosecution theory that appellant violated the peace order and committed second-degree assault by grabbing Kembumbala.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s suggestion that the verdicts were based on different acts because appellant violated the peace order by returning to Kembumbala\u2019s residence and thereafter committed a second-degree assault by grabbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Kembumbala. In <em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. <em>171, </em>452 A.2d 1234 (1982), we rejected an analogous argument that the jury convicted the accused of a single count of assault and another count of attempted rape based on separate acts that occurred during a single criminal episode. Judge Moylan\u2019s explanation for why the law and the charging document did not support such an interpretation of the verdicts is instructive in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">In an effort to forestall [sentencing merger], the State strains to have us treat the common law assault as an attack separate and distinct from the attack that was initiated and continued for purposes of accomplishing the rape. It maintains that the initial threat at knifepoint was all that was necessary to constitute either (1) the overt act of the attempted rape or (2) the assault with intent to rape; and that the subsequent beating (producing the broken nose and the broken jaw) was gratuitously extra and thereby constituted a separate and additional assault. The argument collapses of its own weight. Because an assault turns out to be more vicious and more protracted than would be minimally necessary to constitute the crime does not operate to subdivide it thereby into two (or even three or four) separate assaults. Assault may range along its spectrum from the least significant to the most aggravated of attacks.... Though ranging from one end of the spectrum to the other, there is still the single crime of assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">If, as the State maintains, the sentence was for a \u201csecond assault,\u201d we are constrained to ask whatever happened to the \u201cfirst assault?\u201d If the verbal order to disrobe at knifepoint was the first assault, and the breaking of the jaw a second and distinct assault, why were not two assault counts placed in this indictment? Does the State maintain that the appellant could have been sentenced separately and consecutively for two separate assault convictions under a single count? The answer ... is obviously, \u201cNo,\u201d and is, therefore, dispositive of the State\u2019s attempt to find two separate assaults within the confines of the charges in this case. There was a single, albeit lengthy and vicious, attack. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The common law assault was part of the attempted rape and should have been merged into it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 201-02, 452 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Applying this reasoning to the record before us, we conclude that the State may not avoid sentencing merger on the theory that the jury convicted appellant of violating the peace order based on appellant\u2019s mere presence on Kembumbala\u2019s property, whereas it convicted appellant of assault based on his admission that he subsequently grabbed Ms. Kembumbala. The fact that appellant\u2019s violation of the peace order turned out to be more protracted than would be minimally necessary to constitute that crime does not permit us to parse it into multiple violations. <em>See id. </em>If appellant\u2019s presence on Kembumbala\u2019s property constituted one violation of the peace order and his physical contact with her constituted a second and distinct violation, the indictment should have had two counts charging violation of the peace order. <em>See id. </em>Instead, there was a single violation of the peace order charged and argued to the jury, based on the undisputed evidence that appellant made physical contact with Ms. Kembumbala while on her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Thus, we conclude that, at the very least, there is ambiguity about whether the conviction for violating the peace order stemmed from the same physical contact upon which the guilty verdict on the second-degree assault charge is likely premised. This ambiguity must be resolved in favor of appellant. <em>See Nicolas, </em>426 Md. at 412, 44 A.3d 396; <em>Walker, </em>53 Md.App. at 201-02, 452 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">We therefore proceed with our sentencing merger analysis on the premise that the two verdicts arose from a single criminal act. Although appellant\u2019s sentences do not merge under the required evidence test because each offense requires proof of distinct elements, nevertheless merger may be necessary if the Legislature did not intend to authorize multiple punishments based on a single act of assault or there is uncertainty as to whether the Legislature intended to do so. <em>See generally Moore v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 655, 682-94, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>A.3d 981 (2011) (thoroughly reviewing sentencing merger principles and recognizing that merger may be required under either the required evidence test, the Rule of Lenity or principles of fundamental fairness); <em>Pair, </em>202 Md.App. at 637, 33 A.3d 1024 (\u201cEven when the merger of sentences is not compelled by the \u2018required evidence\u2019 test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), it may nonetheless be compelled by the rule of lenity.\u201d). We address that question next.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">B. Legislative Intent to Authorize Multiple Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Appellant argues that there is \u201cno indication that the legislature in the instant context intended multiple punishments.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cit is significant that [CJP] \u00a7 3-1508 ... mandates a fine and incarceration\u201d for violating a peace order, \u201cbut does not contain an anti-merger provision permitting sentencing for related offenses despite the fact that a violation of a peace order will frequently take the form of a separate offense.\u201d <em>Cf. Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 652-53, 943 A.2d 1260 (2008) (recognizing that the Legislature enacted an express anti-merger provision in order to authorize separate and consecutive sentences for a single act that constitutes both child abuse and a crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The State counters that, even if appellant\u2019s sentences for assault and violating a peace order are based on a single act, they \u201cdo not merge under the Rule of Lenity because the crimes and penalties for assault and violating a peace order address different criminal behavior.\u201d In support, the State argues that, \u201c[w]hereas assault is a crime against a person, violating a peace order punishes the violation of a court order.\u201d In addition, the State invokes CJP \u00a7 3-1502(a), which provides that, \u201c[b]y proceeding under this subtitle [governing peace orders], a petitioner is not limited to or precluded from pursuing any other legal remedy[,]\u201d asserting that this provision \u201cfurther indicates that the Legislature intended that the violation of a peace order should operate independently of any other crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>We are not persuaded that CJP \u00a7 3-1502(a) effectively operates as an \u201canti-merger\u201d provision. This subsection permits \u201ca petitioner\u201d to pursue legal remedies other than a peace order and \u201cpetitioner\u201d is statutorily defined to mean \u201can individual who files a petition under \u00a7 3-1503 of this subtitle.\u201d Thus, the plain language of the statute permits an individual who obtains a peace order to seek additional relief, such as other civil remedies. There is no language indicating that the Legislature intended this provision to apply to the State, much less that it was intended to permit the State to impose multiple criminal punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Nevertheless, we cannot agree with appellant that the absence of anti-merger language in the peace order subtitle indicates that the Legislature intended that sentences for violating a peace order and second-degree assault should be merged. Such silence means nothing more than that the Legislature did not explicitly address the topic of merger in the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As alternative support for its anti-merger interpretation of the peace order subtitle, the State relies on the principle that, \u201cwhen two separate criminal statutes create separate offenses based on different behavior with different criminal consequences, and there is no relevant legislative history suggesting that the Legislature intended to prohibit the imposition of separate sentences for the two separate crimes, the rule of lenity does not apply.\u201d <em>Fenwick v. State, </em>135 Md.App. 167, 174-75, 761 A.2d 1021 (2000). To be sure, under this analytical framework, we have held that separate sentences for conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery \u201cmake sense\u201d because \u201cthe two crimes and penalties address different criminal behavior,\u201d <em>ie., </em>planning a robbery and thereafter committing one. <em>Wooten-Bey, </em>76 Md.App. at 627-30, 547 A.2d 1086. <em>Cf. Fenwick, </em>135 Md.App. at 175, 761 A.2d 1021 (declining to merge sentences for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and distribution of cocaine). Conversely, we also have held that separate sentences for uttering and attempted theft must be merged under the Rule of Lenity when they are based on the same criminal act. <em>See Moore, </em>198 Md.App. at 703-04, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>A.3d 981 (Because \u201c[a]ppellant\u2019s convictions for uttering and attempted theft all arose out of the same transaction, namely, appellant\u2019s attempt to cash two forged checks at the M &amp; T Bank on September 6, 2006\u201d and \u201cthere is no indication in the language of the statutes governing theft and uttering that the legislature intended separate punishments for these offenses arising out of the same transaction, the rule of lenity requires a merger[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The State posits that the sentences imposed for the separate offenses of second-degree assault and violation of the protective order are \u201cbased on different behavior\u201d because the peace order statute \u201cpunishes the violation of a court order,\u201d whereas \u201cassault is a crime against the person.\u201d This argument ignores that the peace order statute, like second-degree assault, punishes unlawful contact with a person and that appellant\u2019s two sentences punish him for the same \u201ccriminal behavior\u201d\u2014the unlawful contact that occurred when he grabbed Kembumbala.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We find nothing to indicate whether the Legislature intended to authorize multiple punishments for a second-degree assault and a violation of a protective order based on the same assaultive behavior. When \u201cwe are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the ... \u2018Rule of Lenity\u2019 by which we give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>53 Md.App. at 201, 452 A.2d 1234. Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s ninety-day sentence for violating the peace order must be merged into his ten-year sentence for second-degree assault. <em>See generally Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 356, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006) (\u201cthe offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty ordinarily merges into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Admission of Extrajudicial Statement From Ms. Kembumbala\u2019s Peace Order Application</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting a portion of the written statement made by Martha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Kembumbala in support of her application for the peace order. In appellant\u2019s view, Kembumbala\u2019s extrajudicial statement was not admissible as a prior consistent statement and, in any event, \u201cthe prejudicial effect of this evidence greatly outweighed any conceivable probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The State responds that the trial court correctly ruled that the defense opened the door, during its cross-examination of Kembumbala, for this statement from her peace order application to be admitted for rehabilitative purposes. Moreover, the admission of this statement was not unduly prejudicial in light of other evidence elicited by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">After reviewing the pertinent legal principles, we conclude that, for the reasons set forth below, the trial court did not err in admitting the challenged statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">A. Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). Unless expressly permitted, \u201chearsay is not admissible.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Although a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion, a decision to admit or exclude hearsay is an issue of law that we review <em>de novo. Bernadyn v. State, </em>890 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Among the established exceptions to the rule against hearsay is one for a prior consistent statement made by a witness. Maryland Rule 5-802.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">(b) A statement that is consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of fabrication, or improper influence or motive!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>This hearsay exception does not apply to statements made by the declarant after his or her alleged motive to fabricate existed, because only \u201c \u2018[a] consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a consequence of that motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmes v. State, </em>350 Md. 412, 419, 712 A.2d 554 (1998) (quoting <em>Tome v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 158, 115 S.Ct. 696, 701, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">When a prior consistent statement is inadmissible under Rule 5-802.1(b), it may nevertheless be admissible as nonhearsay to bolster credibility under Rule 5-616(c)(2), which provides that \u201c[a] witness whose credibility has been attacked may be rehabilitated by ... evidence of the witness\u2019s prior statements that are consistent with the witness\u2019s present testimony, when their having been made detracts from the impeachment.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 426-27, 712 A.2d 554. Although it is appropriate for the trial court to give a limiting instruction that the jury may not consider such rehabilitative statements as substantive evidence, the trial court need not do so in the absence of such a request. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">B. Admission of Statement from Kembumbala\u2019s Peace Order Application</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Before trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to admit portions of Kembumbala\u2019s written application for the peace order, including a statement that appellant \u201chas sexually assaulted me without my consent. He has threat [sic] to choke me to death. He has threatened to burn down my house.\u201d The State argued that these statements were \u201cnot hearsay\u201d because they were offered \u201cfor their effect on the hearer. It shows why she obtained the peace order.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, explaining that, because Kembumbala wrote the statements, they were not admissible to show either the effect they had on her or appellant\u2019s motive and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">At trial, Kembumbala testified on direct examination that, two weeks into her relationship with appellant, he became verbally abusive and made \u201ca lot of threats, especially try<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ing\u2014telling me that he was going to burn my home if I ever try to kick him out of the house[.]\u201d Kembumbala claimed that, when she ended the relationship \u201caround the first week of ... May\u201d and asked appellant to move out of her house, \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t like it at all.\u201d Kembumbala twice called 911 on May 24, but the police officer who responded told her that he could not do anything unless she got a peace order. Immediately thereafter, at about 1:00 a.m. on May 25, 2009, Kembumbala applied for and obtained a peace order.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Although Kembumbala did not testify on direct examination about the sexual nature of her relationship with appellant and she did not describe any physical or sexual abuse, defense counsel pursued those topics on cross-examination. Counsel asked whether she had been \u201cintimate\u201d with appellant and whether she \u201cha[d] sex with him[.]\u201d When counsel inquired about the manner in which appellant abused Kembumbala, she replied that he had called her \u201cdumb, fool and stupid,\u201d threatened to choke her and threatened to burn down her house. Defense counsel then challenged Kembumbala\u2019s claims, resulting in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you are going together like a week or ten days and all of a sudden he\u2019s threatening you and telling you he\u2019s going to choke and burn down your house out of the blue almost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: Because when I come\u2014I work all week, sir. When I come on the weekends, I\u2019m so tired, and <em>he wanted more sexually </em>and I couldn\u2019t concern, <em>and that is when the abuse and all the curses and everything would be happening, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>So you are saying that sex was kind of the thing that caused the </em>problems\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">[DEFENSE <em>COUNSEL]:\u2014because he wanted more frequency than you wanted because you were tired?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\n<em>Is that a fair statement?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Is that why you asked him to leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: <em>I asked him to leave because if somebody threaten to choke me and kill you and bum your house, too, I don\u2019t think you will want to live with them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Thereafter, defense counsel attempted to impeach Ms. Kembumbala by eliciting her admission that, before the charged assault, she had never claimed that appellant physically assaulted her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But <em>I\u2019ve never heard you say that he hit you or touched you in any way ? </em>You haven\u2019t said that until the 25th [sic] of May? You said he called you names and he made these threats, but <em>he never touched you, is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: He, he almost touched me but he did not. <em>He tried to choke me. </em>When he came to choke me, he did not, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you are saying he threatened you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014but and <em>until May 25th he never touched you? </em>Not touched you in a wrong way when I say that. He didn\u2019t hurt you? <em>He didn\u2019t hurt you physically?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-12\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: He pushed me, sir. <em>He pushed me. He held me on the floor, on the bed, sir, so </em>that\u2019s\u2014 <em>when he pushed me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>And when did that happen?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-14\">[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: It happened that Friday\u2014that ... <em>Saturday before the Sunday, Sunday that I got the peace order, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>But you never told anybody that even before today, did you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>[MS. KEMBUMBALA]: <em>I put it in my statement when I went to get the peace order, </em>sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In a bench conference during the State\u2019s re-direct examination of appellant, after the prosecutor asked the trial court to reconsider its decision to exclude the statement from Kembumbala\u2019s peace order application, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgQ\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, with regard to my motion <em>in limine </em>[before] trial, I know that you have ruled that the portion of the petition for peace order, that is the application, would not be admissible. I believe what you said was at that time\u2014I\u2019m going to renew my request that a portion of it be admissible because I feel at this point it is a prior consistent statement and [defense counsel] has questioned Ms. Kembumbala. Specifically, he said that she never told anybody about the injuries prior to today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">I feel that is\u2014or about his threats and physical contact prior to today. Her answer was that she did mention it in her application for the peace order....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Well, it\u2019s just the same thing that she\u2019s been saying on the stand. It\u2019s that he threatened her, to burn down her house and to choke her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">THE COURT: It was a prior consistent statement and you have attacked her credibility in not reporting it previously. So I will permit it, but just the parts that has [to] do with that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you, Your Honor.

Appellant\u2019s Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting Kembumbala\u2019s written statement from her peace order application, because it was an extrajudicial statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted and, therefore, constituted inadmissible hearsay. In appellant\u2019s view, the statement did not qualify for admission as a prior consistent statement because \u201cthe objected-to portion of the request for the peace order was simply not inconsistent with the witness\u2019s direct examination\u201d given that Kembumbala \u201chad not testified to the most prejudicial allegation: \u2018Mr. Robert sexually assaulted me without my consent.\u2019 \u201d Appellant contends that, if defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination opened a door, it was only \u201cto a prior report of pushing and holding down,\u201d not to \u201cdifferent and more serious accusations, such as sexual assault.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">\u201cUnder Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2), a prior consistent statement is admissible to rehabilitate a witness as long as the fact that the witness has made a consistent statement detracts from the impeachment.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 427, 712 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>554. This rule applies when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s opening statement and/or cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness has \u2018opened the door\u2019 to evidence that is relevant (and <em>now </em>admissible) for the purpose of ... rehabilitation/]\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>408 Md. 204, 226, 969 A.2d 262 (2009). <em>See Anderson v. State, </em>420 Md. 554, 567, 24 A.3d 692 (2011). These requirements were met in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We agree with the trial court that, during cross-examination, defense counsel opened the door to the admission of this excerpt from Kembumbala\u2019s peace order application. Counsel elicited Kembumbala\u2019s testimony about her contentious sexual relationship with appellant, then asserted that she \u201cnever\u201d said that appellant \u201chit [her] or touched [her] in any way\u201d until \u201cthe 25th of May/]\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the date of the altercation for which appellant was on trial. When Ms. Kembumbala responded that appellant \u201cpushed me\u201d and \u201cheld me on the floor, on the bed\u201d on \u201cSaturday before the Sunday ... that I got the peace order,\u201d defense counsel countered, \u201cBut you never told anybody that even before today, did you?\u201d Ms. Kembumbala then replied that she \u201cput it in my statement when I went to get the peace order/]\u201d Thus, Kembumbala\u2019s \u201ccredibility ha[d] been attacked\u201d on the ground that she had never reported that appellant physically assaulted her, whether sexually or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The transcript does not indicate that defense counsel challenged the portion of Kembumbala\u2019s statement that appellant \u201csexually assaulted me without my consent\u201d as impermissible other crimes evidence or argued that it was not consistent with Kembumbala\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if counsel did so, it was not error to admit this portion of the statement in light of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination challenging Kembumbala to recount whether and when she complained about any type of physical abuse. The challenged excerpt from her peace order application was consistent with Kembumbala\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>that, before \u201ctoday\u201d at trial, and indeed, before appellant assaulted her with the tire iron, she reported physical abuse by appellant in her peace order application. Clearly, the fact that Kembumbala alleged such abuse, and that she did so before the altercation on May 25, \u201cdetract[ed] from the impeachment.\u201d Md. Rule 5\u2014616(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Thus, the statement was admissible under Rule 5-616(c)(2), not for its truth, but to rehabilitate Kembumbala\u2019s credibility on the critical issue of whether, as appellant claimed, she fabricated her allegations in order to exact revenge on him for ending their romantic and residential relationship. <em>See Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 429-30, 712 A.2d 554. Although a limiting instruction would have been appropriate to advise the jury not to consider the statement for the truth of the matters asserted therein, defense counsel did not request one and the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to give one, <em>sua sponte. See id. </em>at 429, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Nor did the court abuse its discretion in failing to exclude the challenged statement under Md. Rule 5-403, permitting exclusion of relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice[.]\u201d As defense counsel acknowledged during the bench conference, the choking and burning threats described in Kembumbala\u2019s peace order application were \u201cjust the same thing that\u201d Kembumbala had \u201cbeen saying on the stand.\u201d Thus, even if the jury considered those allegations for the truth of those matters, such evidence was merely cumulative and, therefore, not unduly prejudicial. Moreover, for the reasons we have discussed, the extensive cross-examination regarding whether Kembumbala reported any type of physical abuse fairly opened the door for admission of Kembumbala\u2019s prior consistent statement alleging physical and sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Exclusion of Appellant\u2019s Testimony Regarding Kembumbala\u2019s Threat</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">In his final assignment of error, appellant complains that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that Kembumbala <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>threatened to harm him. On direct examination, appellant testified that, on Sunday, May 25, before Kembumbala obtained the peace order, he told her that he planned to move out. Defense counsel then inquired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What happened as a result of your telling Ms. Kembumbala you wanted to leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFl\">[APPELLANT]: I moved back to my rented place and still had that for the few days I\u2019ll be there, I wanted to stay as landlord\u2014landlady and tenant, and <em>it was like if she is going to lose me, nobody is going to get me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV1\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">THE COURT: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously sustained the prosecutor\u2019s general objection \u201con apparent hearsay grounds,\u201d because Kembumbala\u2019s extrajudicial statement \u201cwas offered for the nonhearsay purpose of corroborating [a]ppellant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d According to appellant, Kembumbala\u2019s threat that \u201cnobody is going to get\u201d appellant \u201cif she is going to lose\u201d him, was offered, not for its truth, but rather as corroboration of appellant\u2019s theory that \u201cAllen had attacked him (presumably at her urging),\u201d to counter the State\u2019s claim that appellant was the initial aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">We agree with the State that appellant has mischaracterized the challenged testimony as an extrajudicial statement and mischaracterized the trial court\u2019s ruling as a decision to exclude the testimony on hearsay grounds. Appellant did not testify that Kembumbala made such a statement. Nor did defense counsel proffer that Kembumbala verbally threatened appellant or argue that appellant\u2019s testimony should be admitted as nonhearsay. In the absence of any mention of hearsay, the trial court did not err in construing appellant\u2019s testimony as merely an expression of his own speculative belief that Kembumbala\u2019s motive in obtaining the peace order was to seek revenge for appellant\u2019s decision to end their relationship and his tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION FOR VIOLATING A PEACE ORDER AND SECOND-DEGREE ASSAULT AFFIRMED; SENTENCE FOR VIOLATING A PEACE ORDER VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY ONE-THIRD [1/3] BY BALTIMORE COUNTY, TWO-THIRDS [2/3] BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. Kembumbala testified that the Sunday and Monday time period during which she called police, sought the peace order, and appellant beat her were May 25 and 26, 2009. The calendar and court documents, however, establish that the relevant Sunday was May 24, 2009, and that the Monday on which the altercation between Kembumbala and appellant occurred was May 25, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. Allen, who was incarcerated at the time of trial awaiting sentencing on a charge of violating probation and had an unrelated assault conviction, denied that he fired a gun.

Although the transcript does not indicate that defense counsel lodged any objection to this portion of Kembumbala\u2019s statement, some portion of defense counsel\u2019s argument during the bench conference was inaudible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
