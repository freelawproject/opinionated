As a result of the consolidation of the two facilities, a number of Spring Grove staff members were laid off,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including the 17 appellants in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some of the laid-off workers were then rehired. Asserting that they should have been included among the rehired staffers, appellants filed a grievance, which was denied by an administrative law judge. They then filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Appellants present one issue which we have reworded and divided into two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">I. After a layoff, do laid-off State employees have a statutory right to reinstatement by seniority if the unit seeks to fill vacancies in the same class?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">II. Did Spring Grove Hospital fill the job vacancies in question by reinstating laid-off employees or by recruiting candidates and appointing the most qualified?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">We conclude that Title 7 and 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d) (1994, 2009 RepLVol.) gave Spring Grove two means of filling the vacancies in question: recruit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ment and reinstatement. Because there is no statutory preference for either method, we answer appellants\u2019 first question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">As to the second issue, if the agency decides to fill the vacancies through recruitment, it must follow the procedures mandated by the General Assembly in Title 7. These requirements are manifold but the most important in our view pertain to public notice, thus assuring that all interested individuals have an opportunity to apply, and transparency, so that applicants and would-be applicants will know what criteria will be used in making hiring decisions. The degree to which Spring Grove complied with these statutory mandates is problematic. The administrative law judge made findings of fact regarding some but not all of these compliance issues. We will remand this case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">For its part, DHMH advances an additional question, which we have also rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Did the ALJ err by permitting 17 additional grievants to join the original grievance petition, even though those grievants were no longer employed by DHMH?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">This issue is not preserved for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">We summarize some of the uncontested factual findings made by the ALJ as part of her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\n<em>The Closure of Rosewood and Layoffs at Spring Grove</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Direct Care Assistants (\u201cDCAs\u201d) are responsible for assisting patients with their daily activities, escorting patients to and from appointments and performing similar direct services related to patient care. Prior to 2009, appellants were employed as DCAs at Spring Grove Hospital. In 2008, the State began to consolidate DHMH\u2019s long-term care facilities. The Rosewood Center was scheduled for permanent closure. As the Rosewood Center was in the process of shutting down, DHMH transferred employees from that facility to Spring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Grove Hospital. The first group of displaced Rosewood employees arrived at Spring Grove Hospital in January 2009. Successive groups of Rosewood employees followed in February, May, June, and July 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In August 2009, DHMH employed approximately 176 DCAs at Spring Grove Hospital, all of whom occupied positions subject to the State Personnel Management System (\u201cSPMS\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In June and July 2009, after Rosewood closed, Spring Grove began to determine how many Rosewood employees arrived and how many employees would be laid off as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">For purposes of a layoff, an employer must compute the number of \u201cseniority points\u201d that each employee has accumulated while working for the State. SPP \u00a7 ll-205(a). DCAs accumulate seniority points on account of their service record: one point for each month of State employment, one point for each month of employment in DHMH, and one point for each month of employment in the job series<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which the layoff will occur. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">DHMH calculated the seniority points of employees at Spring Grove Hospital. A list of the seniority points computations prepared by DHMH was forwarded to Dr. David Helsel, Spring Grove\u2019s Superintendent, who in turn shared it with Judy Tullius, Spring Grove\u2019s Personnel Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Spring Grove determined that approximately 50 Spring Grove DCAs needed to be laid off. Spring Grove identified the DCAs with the lowest seniority (fewest seniority points) based on the list of seniority points furnished by DHMH. Tullius prepared a form letter to send to each Spring Grove DCA scheduled to lose his or her job. All the identified DCAs were given the same letter and it was dated August 12, 2009. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">It is with regret that I must inform you that you will be laid off effective Monday, October 12, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">As you may be aware, you will receive the benefit of the application of COMAR 17.04.04.01, <em>which provides for lay off/displacement procedures based on seniority, and reinstatement procedures. </em>Please be advised that the Department has limited displacement to Baltimore County. Unfortunately, there are no employees in your classification who are less senior in Baltimore County displacement area. Therefore, you will be laid off. Your last day of employment will be Monday, October 12, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>Rehiring Some of the Laidr-Off DCAs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Enclosed with the August 12 layoff letter was an employment application. Tullius orally explained to affected DCAs that they needed \u201cto fill out the application, get it back to [her] as quickly as possible, [and] that [Spring Grove was] working on trying to identify positions to go ahead and recruit.\u201d Most of the laid-off DCAs, including all of the appellants, filed an employment application for their previous positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">At the direction of Tullius, Angela Hayes, Spring Grove\u2019s Nurse Recruiter, organized a committee to interview DCAs who applied for the open positions. The interview panel was assigned to determine who among the applicants would be best qualified to fill the vacancies. The interview panel conducted interviews on August 26, 27, and 28, 2009. Spring Grove also reviewed the personnel file of all employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>applied. It noted the amount of sick leave each DCA used and the number of disciplinary actions received by each DCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The interview panel presented each DCA with a list of ten questions. Each of the four panelists graded the response given to each of the ten questions based on a four level score: \u201cBest-Better-Good-Fair.\u201d The scripted questions included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">1. \u201cHow can [Spring Grove] be assured that you will come to work?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">2. \u201cGive some examples of how the hospital can depend on you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">3. \u201cConsidering that you are laid-off, give examples as to why you would like to remain employed here at [Spring Grove]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">4. \u201cHow can you help to decrease patient-to-patient or patient-to-staff assault?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The scored result of each interview, along with the result of the personnel file review, were summarized on a document prepared by Hayes entitled the \u201cInterview Process\u201d table. Based on this information, the director of nursing at Spring Grove determined which employees would be offered DCA positions. Tullius extended offers of employment to approximately 22 DCAs. The offers of employment and rejection letters were issued by letter dated September 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Laid-off DCAs who were junior in seniority points to appellants were offered employment as DCAs, and subsequently employed by Spring Grove on October 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\n<em>The Grievance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">The September 16th letters did not mention seniority points and appellants soon realized that seniority had not been honored. On October 2, 2009, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 982 (\u201cAFSCME\u201d), the bargaining representative for DCAs and other employees of DHMH, filed a grievance with DHMH, signed by Ms. Sturdivant and Mr. Opoku. The grievance identified the employees as \u201cPeter Opoku; Adeline Sturdivant, et al.\u201d and asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>DHMH and its Spring Grove Hospital took action and initiated the process to lay off employees and to conduct \u201crehiring interviews\u201d with certain employees in disregard of employees\u2019 seniority rights as mandated by applicable statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">Management initiated the lay off process in spite of the fact that approximately 30[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] vacancies in the same classification from which employees are being laid off existed at the time. Further, Management is also failing to follow procedures stated in statutes and regulations for the reinstatement of separated employees due to abolition of positions mandated by the State Governor and the Board of Public Works.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Shortly after the grievance was filed, AFSCME\u2019s representatives met with officials of DHMH and the Department of Budget and Management (\u201cDBM\u201d) to identify which laid-off DCAs would be eligible to join in the grievance and to discuss the layoff and rehiring process. One result of the discussions was an agreement between the Director of DBM\u2019s Employee Relations Division and an AFSCME representative that AFSCME would have until April 15, 2010 to identify laid-off DCAs who wished to participate in the grievance proceedings. AFSCME identified seventeen additional grievants who were consolidated with the original October 2, 2009 grievance. Pursuant to SPP \u00a7\u00a7 12-201-12-205, the grievants and DHMH attempted to resolve their dispute first within that department and then by an appeal to the Secretary of the DBM. Those efforts failing, the Secretary referred the grievance to the Office of Administrative Hearings for an adjudicatory hearing before an administrative law judge. The ALJ\u2019s decision is DBM\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>SPP \u00a7 12-205(c)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, the ALJ issued a 32 page decision denying the grievance. Appellants filed a petition for judicial review. On April 18, 2011, the circuit court issued an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision. Appellants filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">This case involves a judicial review of a decision issued by a State administrative agency. In such a case, \u201cwe review directly the action of the agency, rather than the decision of the intervening reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Md. Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Cent. Acceptance Corp., </em>424 Md. 1, 14, 33 A.3d 949 (2011). Our \u201creview of the administrative agency\u2019s factual findings is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Kim v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>423 Md. 523, 536, 32 A.3d 30 (2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWe uphold the agency\u2019s factual conclusion if a reasoning mind could have reached that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In contrast, we review an administrative agency\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. Schwartz v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, and to remedy them if wrong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u201cWhen considering a question of statutory interpretation by an agency, we review the agency\u2019s interpretation according to a non-deferential standard of review.\u201d <em>Acceptance Corp., </em>424 Md. at 16, 33 A.3d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">There are three issues before us in this appeal. First, we must determine whether the ALJ erred when she concluded that SPP \u00a7 11-208 does not establish a right of reinstatement for laid-off State employees. Second, we must address whether DHMH complied with Title 7 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article when it conducted its hiring process. Finally, we will discuss DHMH\u2019s contention that the ALJ erred in permitting 17 former employees to participate in the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>I. A Right to Reinstatement?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">At the heart of the parties\u2019 dispute is SPP \u00a7 11-208, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u00a7 11-208. Order of reinstatements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">(a) <em>Within same </em>class.\u2014The employee with the most seniority points shall be the first employee to be reinstated in the class from which the employee was laid off or from which the employee was separated under \u00a7 11-302[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of this title or to any lower class in the same job series within the principal department or other independent unit in which the layoff or separation under \u00a7 11-302 of this title occurred, (b) <em>Within comparable </em>class.\u2014Reinstatement to a comparable class to which the Secretary has certified employees who were laid-off or who were separated under \u00a7 11-302 of this title shall be made from among the five laid-off or separated employees with the most seniority points who are certified to the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In her analysis, the ALJ concluded that SPP \u00a7 11-208 does not give laid-off workers a statutory right of reinstatement. She reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">If the Legislature intended to require the appointing authority to give laid off employees priority over others for vacant State positions, it would have enacted language ... imposing such a requirement on appointing authorities. It did not do so, however, so I cannot impose that obligation on Spring Grove.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Appellants contend that, although Spring Grove was not required to fill its vacant DCA positions, when the hospital decided to do so, it was required by SPP \u00a7 ll-208(a) and COMAR 17.04.04.05(C) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to reinstate the laid-off DCAs by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>seniority. In their view, the ALJ erred as a matter of law when she concluded otherwise. DHMH\u2019s position is that the ALJ\u2019s legal analysis was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Whether SPP \u00a7 ll-208(a) establishes a right of reinstatement is a matter of statutory construction. This Court recently summarized the appropriate judicial approach to these questions in <em>Powell v. Breslin, </em>195 Md.App. 340, 351-53, 6 A.3d 360 (2010), <em>affirmed, </em>421 Md. 266, 299, 26 A.3d 878 (2011):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">[T]o determine [the legislative] purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.... If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, [w]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. If there is no ambiguity in th[e] language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears. As this Court has stated, [bjecause it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We turn to the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Title 7 sets out the procedures for \u201cfilling] vacant skilled service and professional service positions\u201d in the SPMS. SPP \u00a7 7-201(b). An appointing authority<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may fill job vacancies in one of three ways. As outlined in SPP \u00a7 7-203:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">An appointing authority may select candidates for a position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">(1) from an existing list of eligible candidates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">(2) if the appointing authority decides to recruit for the position, by recruitment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">(3) from a special list of eligible candidates whom the Division of Rehabilitation Services of the Department of Education certifies as being physically capable and adequately trained to qualify for the position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">In this case, neither party contends that subsection (3) applies to the facts before us. The only relevant options under Title 7 are SPP \u00a7 7-203(1) and (2), which allow an appointing authority to select candidates for a position either from an existing list of eligible candidates or by recruitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Title 11 addresses, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c(1) the <em>layoff </em>of employees in the skilled service or the professional service; and (2) the <em>reinstatement </em>of laid-off and separated skilled service or professional service employees to comparable positions in State employment.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11-202 (emphasis added). When an agency seeks to fill vacant job positions by reinstatement, Title 11 provides that positions are filled according to seniority, where \u201c[t]he employee with the most seniority points [is] the first employee to be reinstated....\u201d SPP \u00a7 ll-208(a). Title 11 operates in concert with Title 7. Laid-off employees eligible for reinstatement form \u201can existing list of eligible candidates\u201d within the purview of SPP \u00a7 7-203(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Appellants assert that, under \u00a7 ll-208(a), if there is a list of eligible candidates and that list includes, or consists entirely of, laid-off employees, the appointing authority must rehire the laid-off employees by seniority before considering any other candidate. We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 contention. Before addressing this matter, we will provide a more detailed explanation of the two hiring schemes relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Title 7, Subtitle 2: Appointments</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Title 7 sets out a detailed scheme that an appointing authority must follow when it chooses to fill a vacant position. The process begins, conceptually, with a description of the position to be filled. Under SPP \u00a7 7-102(a)(l), \u201c[e]ach employee ... shall be provided with a written position description which describes the essential duties and responsibilities the employee is expected to perform and the standards for satisfactory performance on a form approved by the Secretary [of DBM].\u201d The position description must be approved by the appointing authority. SPP \u00a7 7-102(b). Supervisors are obligated to \u201cgive each supervised employee a copy of the position description for the employee\u2019s position.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7\u2014102(c)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>Position Selection Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">While the written position description can serve other pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>poses,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it has a role in the recruitment process authorized by Subtitle 7. Under SPP \u00a7 7\u2014201(b), \u201c[e]ach unit shall fill vacant skilled service and professional service positions in accordance with a position selection plan.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The position selection plan must contain \u201cthe information about the position that the Secretary [of DBM] requires,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">(1) a position description described in \u00a7 7-102 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(2) the minimum qualifications for the class of the position and any selective qualifications required for appointment to the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">(3) any limitations on selection for the position ... [e.g.] ... candidates indicating a willingness to work in a location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">SPP \u00a7 7-202(b). Moreover, \u201cif applicants for the position are to be recruited,\u201d the position selection plan must also contain the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">(i) location for submitting applications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">(ii) manner for posting the position announcement in the unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">(iii) method and length of time for advertising the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">(iv) closing date to receive applications for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">(v) plan of development of any selection test to be administered to qualified applicants; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">(vi) duration of the list of eligibles that results from the recruitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>SPP \u00a7 7-202(b)(4). When a draft of a position selection plan is completed, \u201c[t]he appointing authority shall: (1) approve or disapprove each position selection plan; (2) authorize funding for approved plans; and (3) send a copy of an approved selection plan to the equal employment opportunity officer of the unit [in this case, Spring Grove Hospital].\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-202(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Selection of Candidates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">From here, an appointing authority may select candidates for a position pursuant to SPP \u00a7 7-203, which we discussed earlier. Again, under this section, there are two primary ways to fill vacant positions: (1) by selecting \u201cfrom an existing list of eligible candidates\u201d; or (2) \u201cif no existing list of eligible candidates exists or if the appointing authority decides to recruit for the position, by recruitment....\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Reading \u00a7 7-203 and \u00a7 11-208 in conjunction, we conclude that \u00a7 7-203(l)\u2019s \u201cexisting list of eligible candidates\u201d encompasses, among others, laid-off employees eligible for reinstatement under \u00a7 11\u2014 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>Job Announcements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">If an appointing authority decides to pursue option number two and recruit candidates, then the \u201cappointing authority shall prepare a job announcement for the position and conduct recruitment in accordance with the position selection plan.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-204(a).

Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the appointing authority to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">advertise the position vacancy at least 2 weeks before the deadline for submitting applications by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">(i) making available a job announcement to all appropriate State agencies, based on selection limitations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">(ii) using any other method that is reasonably calculated to ensure a sufficient pool of applicants, including printed advertisements in newspapers and journals, paper and electronic bulletin board postings, and special notices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">SPP 7-204(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\n<em>Rating Qualified Applicants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">After the close of a position announcement, the appointing authority must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">(1) review the applications received to determine the applicants who meet the minimum qualifications for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">(2) prepare a register of qualified applicants in random order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">(3) send to unqualified applicants a notice that they have failed to meet the minimum qualifications for the position; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">(4) as provided in subsection (b) of this section/[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] if a competitive examination that requires attendance at a test site is required for the position, send a notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>examination to qualified applicants on the register at least 10 days before the test administration date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">SPP \u00a7 7-205. In rating qualified applicants, an appointing authority \u201cmay use any appropriate selection process,\u201d but the \u201cunit must be able to establish the job relatedness, reliability, and validity of the selection tests that it uses.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-206(a). If an appointing authority uses a selection test, the test must be free of charge and open to all qualified applicants. SPP \u00a7 7-206(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Once the appointing authority has rated the qualified applicants, it must, \u201cbased on appropriate standards, place the candidates within the following categories\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">(i) best qualified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">(ii) better qualified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">(iii) qualified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">(iv) unsatisfactory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">(v) certified by the Division of Rehabilitation Services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">(vi) eligible for reinstatement after layoff or after a separation under \u00a7 11-302 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-14\">(vii) eligible for reinstatement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-15\">(viii) eligible for transfer</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">SPP \u00a7 7-208(a)(l). In addition, the appointing authority must \u201cplace the candidates on a list of eligible candidates by category in random order within the category <em>except </em>for candidates eligible for reinstatement after layoff or separation under \u00a7 11-302 of this article who shall be placed in that category <em>in seniority point order.\u201d </em>SPP \u00a7 7-208(a)(2) (Emphasis added). Subsequently, the appointing authority must file this list of eligible candidates with DBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">\n<em>Appointments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">Finally, Title 7 provides the framework that an appointing authority must follow in selecting its new employees. Under SPP \u00a7 7-209(a), \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, an appointing authority shall make an appointment from among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the candidates in a rating category on a list of eligible candidates as follows\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">(1) if there are at least five candidates rated best qualified, from that rating category;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">(2) if there are fewer than five candidates rated best qualified, from the candidates in the best qualified and better qualified categories; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">(3) if there are fewer than five candidates rated best qualified and better qualified, from candidates in best qualified, better qualified, and qualified categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">To help decide between candidates within a rating category, SPP \u00a7 7-209(c) allows appointing authorities to conduct interviews, as long as it interviews at least three candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">After completing these requirements, \u201c[t]he appointing authority must certify to the Secretary [of DBM] that the hiring process was conducted in accordance with the selection plan and this subtitle.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-209(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Title 11, Subtitle 2: Layoffs</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The Title 11 scheme governing layoffs and reinstatements is more straightforward. Under SPP \u00a7 11-203, a layoff is required when a position is abolished or vacated due to a lack of work. Notice of a layoff must be given \u201cto each employee to be affected\u201d at least 60 days before the layoff \u201cis effective.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11-204. For purposes of a layoff, SPP \u00a7 ll-205(a) provides that the appointing authority \u201cshall compute the total number of seniority points for each employee subject to the layoff.\u201d The order of the layoff according to SPP \u00a7 11\u2014 206(a)(1) is by seniority points. The employee in the classification with less seniority points \u201cshall be laid off before others in the class with higher seniority points.\u201d SPP \u00a7 ll-206(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Under SPP \u00a7 2-601(a), when subjected to layoff, each former employee retains reinstatement rights under the SPMS \u201cwithin 3 years from separation.\u201d If reinstated, the employee will be given credit for past State service for seniority, leave accrual and other benefits. PPS \u00a7 2-601(b) and (c). If a position is vacant within the same class of jobs and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>appointing authority decides to reinstate, the order of reinstatement is governed by \u201cseniority points.\u201d SPP \u00a7 ll-208(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">The employee with the most seniority points shall be the first employee to be reinstated in the class from which the employee was laid off ... or to any lower class in the same job series within the principal department or other independent unit in which the layoff ... occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Under SPP \u00a7 7-208(a), the appointing authority must maintain a list of laid-off employees and produce such a list for each vacancy that occurs. The list of laid-off employees eligible for reinstatement must be \u201cin seniority point order.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-208(a)(2). Eligible candidates have the right to know \u201ctheir relative standing on the list of eligible candidates.\u201d SPP \u00a7 7-208(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">From these statutes, DHMH argues that \u201cthe ALJ correctly concluded that applicable statutes authorized Spring Grove, in its discretion, to recruit applicants and fill vacancies by selecting from among the best qualified eligible candidates [pursuant to Title 7], without any obligation to select from lists of laid off employees [pursuant to Title 11], such as the grievants.\u201d We agree with the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">While the statutory scheme is complicated, it is not ambiguous. Read together, Titles 7 and 11 provide two paths by which a State agency can fill vacant positions: recruitment through Title 7 or reinstatement pursuant to Title 11. There is nothing in either Title 7 or Title 11 that suggests that, if an agency decides to recruit, it cannot recruit among laid-off employees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is nothing in either title that states that the two methods are mutually exclusive and, indeed, \u00a7 7-208 makes it clear that they are not, because it requires an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to categorize candidates within eight categories, including those \u201celigible for reinstatement.\u201d Section 7-208(a)(l)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In contending that \u00a7 11-208 gives laid-off employees an absolute right of reinstatement if the agency subsequently fills vacancies in the same position, appellants rely on SPP \u00a7 7-209. The statute provides in relevant part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfF\">\u00a7 7-209. Appointments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">(a) In <em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided by law, </em>an appointing authority shall make an appointment from among the candidates in a rating category on a list of eligible candidates as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">(1) if there are at least five candidates rated best qualified, from that rating category;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">(2) if there are fewer than five candidates rated best qualified, from the candidates in the best qualified and better qualified categories; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">(8) if there are fewer than five candidates rated best qualified and better qualified, from candidates in best qualified, better qualified, and qualified categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Appellants assert that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">SPP \u00a7 7-209 requires that the appointing authority choose from among the best qualified, better qualified, and qualified categories, <em>but only </em>if no other statute controls. The limiting language that is the preface to SPP \u00a7 7-209 makes that clear. The section begins with the qualification, \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11-208 is just such a set of conditions that is \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">Where, as here (under SPP \u00a7 11-208), there is an express statutory obligation to reinstate, the appointing authority has no cause to choose from the best, better, and qualified categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">We do not read the qualifying preface in SPP \u00a7 7-209(a), <em>viz., </em>\u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law,\u201d as broadly as do appellants. Section 7-209(a) requires an agency to hire from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>among the most qualified eligible candidates. An individual\u2019s qualifications are irrelevant if a laid-off employee is reinstated because, by statute, reinstatements are on the basis of seniority. The qualifying language in \u00a7 7-209 simply reflects that, under some circumstances, an appointing authority is barred from considering qualifications. We could only reach the result suggested by appellants by reading into Subtitle 7 a prohibition against filling a vacant position by recruitment when laid-off employees are also eligible for reinstatement. This we cannot do. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645 (2001); <em>Powell v. Breslin, </em>195 Md.App. at 351, 6 A.3d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In conclusion, SPP \u00a7 7-203 clearly states that an agency can fill vacancies by recruitment or selection from an existing list of eligible candidates. If the list of eligible candidates includes laid-off employees, the laid-off employees must be rehired on the basis of seniority as mandated by Title ll\u2019s reinstatement procedure. If the agency makes the effort to recruit in accordance with Title 7, it can hire the candidates it deems to be the best suited for the position. There is no statutory preference for either method\u2014an agency may fill a vacancy through a Title 7 recruitment or a Title 11 reinstatement, or, conceivably, a combination of both. As we previously discussed, there is nothing in the State Personnel and Pensions Article that prevents an agency from directing its recruiting efforts at previously laid-off employees, as occurred in this case. If this is done, the list of applicants that qualify for future employment may include candidates who are eligible for reinstatement pursuant to Title 11 <em>as well as </em>candidates who are eligible for appointment after participating in a Title 7 recruitment process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, as we explore further in part II, if an agency chooses to recruit, it must comply with the statutory requirements set out in Title 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>II. What Actually Occurred in <em>this </em>Case: Did Spring Grove Recruit or Appoint from an Existing List of Eligible Candidates?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Appellants contend that Spring Grove did not comply with most of the requirements of SPP \u00a7\u00a7 7-202-7-204 in its efforts to recruit among the laid-off DCA\u2019s and that, regardless of its protestations to the contrary, Spring Grove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">actually chose \u201cto hire from the class of laid-off employees.\u201d Spring Grove laid off approximately 50 DCAs. According to the Interview Process table, 47 DCAs were laid off, 45 were interviewed, and 2 did not apply. Between nineteen and twenty-two laid-off DCAs were ultimately selected for reinstatement. No other individuals were considered for the vacant DCA positions. No other individuals were offered any of the vacant DCA positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Appellants argue that this characterization of the recruitment process is supported by several first-level findings of fact made by the ALJ. In effect, they argue that the findings by the ALJ point ineluctably to the conclusion that Spring Grove\u2019s recruitment process was nothing more than a pretext to disguise the fact that Spring Grove was reinstating laid-off DCAs but not on the basis of seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">As we will explain, we agree that several findings of fact by the ALJ support appellants\u2019 theory. However, for reasons that are not clear from the decision, the ALJ did not make findings of fact as to other relevant issues regarding Spring Grove\u2019s compliance with Title 7\u2019s requirements for recruiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The ALJ concluded that Spring Grove\u2019s hiring process was valid because it involved a recruitment, pursuant to Title 7, and not a reinstatement, pursuant to Title 11. It is true that the hiring process resembled a recruitment: as expressed in DHMH\u2019s brief, \u201cthe Hospital developed a position selection plan ..., conducted a competitive recruitment to fill the DCA positions, and made offers of employment to those eligible candidates who were determined to be in the \u2018best qualified\u2019 category of candidates for those positions.\u201d This notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>standing, some of the ALJ\u2019s findings are not consistent with her ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">First, SPP \u00a7 7-204(a) states that the appointing authority must \u201cconduct [the] recruitment in accordance with the position selection plan.\u201d Thus, the position selection plan must be completed before recruitment commences. On this point, the ALJ found that: (1) \u201cSpring Grove made each offer of employment to fill a vacant DCA position on or after September 16, 2009\u201d; and (2) \u201cAll corresponding [position selection plans] were prepared on or about October 6, 2009.\u201d Based on these findings, it appears that the position selection plans were drafted weeks <em>after </em>the offers were extended for the DCA positions. This does not comply with the statute\u2019s requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Second, pursuant to SPP \u00a7 7-202(b), a position selection plan must list \u201cthe minimum qualifications for the class of the position and any selective qualifications required for appointment to the position\u201d and \u201cany limitations on selection for the position.\u201d On this point, the ALJ found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">Spring Grove used \u201cSelective Qualifications\u201d in \u201cdetermining which employees to keep.\u201d The Selective Qualifications applied were: the number of [sick days used] by the employee over the prior 12 months, the number of disciplinary actions received by the employee, an interview, and \u201cwhether the R.N. supervisor had given any reference letters for those individuals.\u201d [(Quoting the testimony of Judy Tullius)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Spring Grove also considered the number of times \u201cthe applicant had been late.\u201d The ALJ noted that these \u201c \u2018Selective Qualifications\u2019 were used to limit which employees would be selected for rehire\u201d and that these \u201cSelective Qualifications were <em>not </em>noted by Ms. Tullius on the Position Selection Plans----\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Our own independent review of the position selection plans confirms that nothing was listed on the forms under \u201cMinimum Qualifications,\u201d \u201cSelective Qualifications\u201d or \u201cLimitations On Selection.\u201d Because the position selection plans did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>list the minimum qualifications or selection qualifications required for the position, Spring Grove did not comply with the recruitment requirements set out in SPP \u00a7 7\u2014202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Third, under SPP \u00a7 7-202(b)(4), if an appointing authority chooses to recruit, the position selection plan must contain the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">(i) location for submitting applications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">(ii) manner for posting the position announcement in the unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">(iii) method and length of time for advertising the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">(iv) closing date to receive applications for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">(v) plan of development of any selection test to be administered to qualified applicants; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">(vi) duration of the list of eligibles that results from the recruitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">None of the position selection plans listed this information. In fact, the preprinted versions of the position selection plan signed by Tullius contained spaces for \u201cWhere Job Announcement Will Be Posted\u201d and \u201cWhere Candidates Will Apply,\u201d (information required under SPP \u00a7 7-202(b)(4)), but these spaces were left blank on all of the forms. From this one can infer that no notice of the job openings was posted but, because there might be other explanations for the failure to complete the forms, the matter should be addressed by an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">Fourth, SPP \u00a7 7-204 requires an appointing authority to \u201cprepare a job announcement for the position.\u201d This job announcement, together with a copy of the position selection plan, must be sent \u201cto the Secretary [of DBM] at least 1 week before posting the job announcement to assure public access.\u201d SPP 7-204(c)(l). Moreover, the appointing authority must \u201cadvertise the position vacancy at least 2 weeks before the deadline for submitting the applications.... \u201d While there is nothing in the record that indicates that Spring Grove complied with this requirement, the ALJ made no finding on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Fifth, SPP \u00a7 7-209(d) states that \u201c[t]he appointing authority must certify to the Secretary that the hiring process was conducted in accordance with the selection plan and this subtitle.\u201d Again, there is nothing in the record that indicates that Spring Grove complied with this requirement but the AL J made no finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Of all of these requirements, we view SPP \u00a7 7-204\u2019s provisions relating to public notice and advertising as the most critical. The statute states that \u201c[t]o recruit candidates ..., an appointing authority <em>shall </em>prepare a job announcement for the position <em>and conduct recruitment in accordance with the position recruitment plan.\u201d </em>SPP \u00a7 7-204(a) (emphasis added). The job announcement <em>shall </em>contain, among other information, \u201ca summary of the position description [and] the minimum qualifications for the class <em>and any selective qualifications necessary for consideration.\u201d </em>SPP \u00a7 7-204(b) (emphasis added). The statute further requires an appointing authority to forward copies of the position selection plan and the job announcement to the Secretary of DBM \u201cat least one week prior to posting <em>to assure public access.\u201d </em>SPP \u00a7 7-204(c)(l). Finally the statute requires an appointing authority to \u201cadvertise the vacancy at least 2 weeks before the deadline for submitting applications\u201d by, among other things, \u201cmaking available a job announcement to all appropriate State agencies based on selection limitations.... \u201d SPP \u00a7 7-204(c)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Applicants for a State job have a right to know the actual\u2014not merely the purported\u2014criteria by which a position is filled. Equally as important, when a State agency recruits, <em>all </em>persons\u2014not only those contacted by the agency\u2014have a right to apply. While some of Title 7\u2019s requirements may be technical and primarily designed to facilitate efficient government operations, \u00a7 7-204\u2019s requirements serve a larger purpose because they assure an open, transparent and fair recruiting process. While appointing authorities are appropriately vested with broad discretion in deciding how to recruit for vacant positions, nothing in Title 7 gives an agency the right to disregard \u00a7 7-204\u2019s statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>It follows that, if Spring Grove failed to comply with \u00a7 7-204, its efforts to fill the vacant DCA positions cannot be deemed a recruitment. If Spring Grove did not recruit but instead merely appointed candidates from among those recently laid off, it filled the positions through reinstatement. The ALJ found that \u201c[s]eniority points were not considered as a qualification in the hiring decision.\u201d If Spring Grove filled the positions through reinstatement, it did so in violation of SPP \u00a7 ll-208(a)\u2019s mandate that laid-off employees be reinstated solely on the basis of seniority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We will remand this case to the Office of Administrative Hearings so that an ALJ can complete the fact-finding process as to Spring Grove\u2019s compliance with SPP \u00a7 7-204 and make conclusions of law based upon those findings and this opinion. If the ALJ concludes that Spring Grove failed to comply with the statute, it should grant appellants\u2019 grievance and proceed to determine an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">III. The Addition of 17 Grievants to the Grievance Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">As a final matter, DHMH asks us to consider its contention that 17 of the grievants are not eligible to participate in this proceeding because they were not employees at the time the grievance was filed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">This argument is not preserved. In the proceedings before the ALJ, DHMH moved to dismiss the grievance as to all grievants on the basis that it was not timely filed. DHMH asserted that SPP \u00a7 12-203 provides that an employee must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>file a grievance within 20 days of either the date of \u201cthe occurrence of the alleged fact that is the basis for the grievance\u201d or the day that the employee became aware of the act. DHMH took the position that the 20 day deadline was triggered by the layoff notices, which were dated August 12, 2009. Thus, the Agency reasoned that the grievance was not timely because it was not filed until October 2. The ALJ denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">According to the Agency, the Grievance was late because it was not filed within twenty days of August 12, 2009 [the date DCAs received their layoff notices]. If the Grievants were still contesting Spring Grove\u2019s decision to lay them off, I would agree with the Agency; however, I reject the Agency\u2019s argument because the Grievants are not contesting the layoff notices [but rather Spring Grove\u2019s refusal to reinstate by seniority].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Before this Court, DHMH takes a different tack. It asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">By permitting the belated addition of 17 former employees to the grievance, some seven months after the former employees were laid off by the Hospital, the ALJ \u201cexceeded] the statutory authority,\u201d <em>id., </em>because the grievance procedure established in Title 12 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article provides an administrative remedy only for certain \u201cemployees\u201d within the State Personnel Management System, and not for <em>former </em>employees. <em>See Perry v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>201 Md.App. 633, 639 [30 A.3d 262] (2011).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">DHMH\u2019s new theory is that the 17 former employees should be excluded because they were no longer employees of the State when they were joined to the grievance. As appellants observe in their reply brief, this argument was not raised at the administrative hearing, thus it cannot be asserted for the first time upon judicial review. <em>Parham v. DLLR, </em>189 Md. App. 604, 615-16, 985 A.2d 147 (2009) (citing <em>Department of Employment v.

We reiterate: if an agency conducts a recruitment process in compliance with Title 7, and in so doing receives applications from laid-off employees eligible for reinstatement, it may rehire some of those employees based upon their qualifications. If an agency wishes to forgo the recruitment process, it can reinstate from laid-off employees based on seniority.
