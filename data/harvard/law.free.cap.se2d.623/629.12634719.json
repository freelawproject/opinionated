We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Karen Moriarty Penry founded Carillon Assisted Living, LLC in 1996. Petitioner established an office in Raleigh to develop assisted living facilities in North Carolina. As of 29 January 2004, petitioner operated six licensed assisted living facilities in six different North Carolina counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 1997, petitioner filed plans with DHHS for development of twenty-one assisted living facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 28 August 1997, the North Carolina General Assembly imposed a moratorium on the development of additional assisted living facilities. The moratorium was retroactive to 1 July 1997 and expired on 30 June 1998. The law provided:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From the effective date of this Act until 12 months after the effective date of this Act, the Department of Health and Human Services shall not approve the addition of any adult care home beds for any type home or facility in the State, except as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) Plans submitted for approval prior to May 18, 1997;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) Plans submitted for approval prior to May 18, 1997, may be processed for approval if the individual or organization submitting the plan demonstrates to the Department that on or before August 25, 1997, the individual or organization purchased real property, entered into a contract to purchase or obtain an option to purchase real property entered into a binding real property lease arrangement, or has otherwise made a binding financial commitment for the purpose of establishing or expanding an adult care home facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%20443\">\n    1997 N.C. Sess. Laws 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 30 October 1998, the legislature reinstated the moratorium retroactive to 1 July 1998 through 26 August 1999. The legislature again extended the moratorium in 1999 and 2000. It remained in force through 31 December 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 1999, DHHS declined to issue a declaratory ruling that eight of petitioner's new projects and six of its expansion projects were to be exempt from the moratorium. Petitioner petitioned for review in Wake County Superior Court alleging: (1) its proposed projects were exempt from the moratorium; (2) the moratorium was unconstitutional; and (3) application of the moratorium to petitioner's projects was unconstitutional. The court ruled in petitioner's favor on 15 October 1999 and held that the projects were exempt from the moratorium and petitioner\n   was entitled to develop all twenty-seven projects. DHHS appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 20 June 2000, petitioner, DHHS, and the State of North Carolina through its Attorney General, entered into a settlement agreement that resolved and settled the litigation. In the agreement, petitioner agreed to forego its constitutional challenges to the moratorium in exchange for the unconditional right to develop nineteen projects (\"settlement projects\") instead of the twenty-seven petitioner applied for. In accordance with the agreement, the trial court's order was vacated and the pending appeals were withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The General Assembly enacted the 2001 Session Law, which provided the moratorium would expire on 31 December 2001. After 31 December 2001, all assisted living facilities were to be subject to a Certificate of Need (\"CON\") law. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 131E-175 (2003). The 2001 Session Law provides, \"any person who obtained an exemption\" under the moratorium must meet financing and construction deadlines on its exempt projects to save the exemption.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%20234\">\n    2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The exemption holder must provide DHHS with evidence of: (a) the funding to cover the project's capital costs by 1 June 2004; (b) the completion of building foundation and footings by 1 December 2004; and (c) the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by 1 December 2005.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%20234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the holder of the exemption fails to meet these deadlines, the exemption is terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%20234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioner maintained the deadlines did not apply to its development plans and did not comply with the statutory deadlines for many of its projects. DHHS advised petitioner that it could not develop forty-three projects (\"gap projects\") for which petitioner filed plans during the four-month period between the date the moratorium expired, 30 June 1998, and the date it was reinstated, 30 October 1998. DHHS asserted that if the moratorium precluded petitioner from developing the gap projects until 31 December 2001, the moratorium's expiration date precluded petitioner from developing the gap projects absent a CON.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 24 July 2003, petitioner filed a contested case in the Office of Administrative Hearings. Petitioner asserted: (1) the 2001 Session Law is inapplicable to the settlement projects; (2) DHHS breached the settlement agreement; and (3) the application of the 2001 Session Law and moratorium to the settlement projects and the gap projects violated petitioner's rights under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Administrative Law Judge Beecher R. Gray (\"ALJ\") ruled in petitioner's favor on 13 May 2004. The ALJ found the parties had agreed and settled for petitioner to possess an unconditional right to develop the settlement projects, had not agreed solely to an exemption from the moratorium, and the deadlines contained in the 2001 Session Law did not apply to the settlement projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On further review, DHHS reversed the ALJ. DHHS dismissed petitioner's constitutional, breach of contract, and damages claims, and its claims against the State for lack of jurisdiction. DHHS granted summary judgment for itself and the State and rejected petitioner's claim that the 2001 Session Law is inapplicable to the settlement projects and on its claim relating to the gap projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 11 August 2004, petitioner filed a petition for judicial review in Wake County Superior Court. The trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss petitioner's constitutional, breach of contract, and damages claims, and its claims against the State for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents on all remaining claims. Petitioner appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioner argues the trial court erred by: (1) failing to uphold the decision of the ALJ granting summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that the 2001 Session Law did not apply to the Settlement Projects; (2) dismissing petitioner's constitutional, breach of contract, and damages claims, and its claims against the State for lack of jurisdiction; and (3) failing to grant summary judgment for petitioner on its constitutional claims. Petitioner argues it is entitled to develop the gap projects for which plans were filed with DHHS when there was no\n   moratorium or other development conditions were in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review on Administrative Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The appropriate standard of review in this case depends upon the issue being reviewed. This Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The proper standard of review by the trial court depends upon the particular issues presented by the appeal.\n   <em>\n    ACT-UP Triangle v.

The parties hereby agree that the moratorium is not applicable to development of the facilities described in Exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The language of the settlement agreement is unambiguous. In exchange for the right to develop the settlement projects without obtaining an exemption, petitioner forfeited its right to litigate its remaining claims and constitutional challenges. DHHS previously had been granted full legislative authority to approve projects prior to the moratorium, which set limitations on that authority. To resolve a constitutional challenge to the moratorium, the parties agreed the moratorium did not operate to limit DHHS and the State's authority with regards to certain of the projects at issue, thereby settling a question which otherwise would have to have been resolved by the courts. This settlement authority is precisely the legislative purpose of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-22. Respondents properly exercised their statutory authorities to settle the case. N.C. Gen.Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00a7 150B-22 (2003) (\"It is the policy of this State that any dispute between an agency and another person that involves the person's rights, duties, or privileges, including licensing or the levy of a monetary penalty, should be settled through informal procedures.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The dissenting opinion argues that while respondents had authority to enter into settlement agreements pursuant to this statute, that authority is not without constitutional limitation.

I am unable to find any provision within these sections which authorizes respondent to exempt any person, organization, or project from the application of any duly enacted legislation to which such legislation otherwise would apply. Respondent's authority regarding the application of the moratorium, consequently, was limited to the authority delegated in the legislation itself. The authority granted to respondent in the legislation was limited to the determination of presence or absence of facts which would allow development of new beds pursuant to the enumerated exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Interpreted as urged by respondent, the settlement agreement would fall within the constraints placed upon the General Assembly's delegation of authority. Respondent entered into the settlement agreement pursuant to the State's policy to settle disputes through informal procedures based upon the decision of the superior court that petitioner's projects, including the settlement projects, fell within one of the enumerated exceptions to the moratorium. Consequently, the agreement would be enforceable as its terms were within respondent's authority. Under this interpretation, the settlement projects could be developed lawfully pursuant to the settlement agreement, subject to the constraints imposed by the subsequent legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is a well accepted canon of contract interpretation that where the words of a contract can be interpreted two different ways, one making the contract lawful and the other making it unlawful, the lawful interpretation is preferred.

Interpreting the settlement agreement as suggested by petitioner, presents a situation in which the executive branch of our government has invaded the exclusive province of the legislative branch. In the instant case, the General Assembly enacted legislation, the validity of which is not at issue before this Court, and an agency of the executive branch purportedly disregarded its mandate to faithfully execute that legislation. The settlement agreement, therefore, would be unlawful. Interpreting the settlement agreement as urged by respondent, however, the actions of respondent do not violate the separation of powers doctrine. According to respondent's interpretation, the settlement agreement was entered into pursuant to a legislative delegation of authority to determine the existence of facts to which the enacted legislation will apply. Respondent's interpretation results in the settlement agreement being lawful and, therefore, is the preferred interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, I would hold that the development of the beds in question is subject to the subsequent legislation and affirm the trial court's summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Petitioner also assigns error to the trial court's grant of respondent's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") lacked jurisdiction over petitioner's claims. In its petition for contested case hearing, petitioner raised constitutional, breach of contract and damages claims against respondent and the State of North Carolina as well as several of the claims set forth in North Carolina General Statutes, section 150B-51(b), including that \"the Department ha[d] exceeded its authority and jurisdiction, acted erroneously, [and] failed to act as required by law and rule.\" See N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51(b)(2)-(3), (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioner's argue that North Carolina General Statutes, section 150B-51(b)(1) grants the trial court the jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of a statute if raised before OAH and appealed in a petition for judicial review. This is incorrect. The purpose of the statute is to allow the trial court to determine whether the agency \"acted in violation of constitutional provisions\" in reaching its decision - not whether an organic law of the General Assembly is unconstitutional as such determinations may not be made by administrative agencies, such as OAH. Our Supreme Court has made clear that administrative agencies do not have subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional issues. \"[C]onstitutional claims will not be acted upon by administrative tribunals, . . .\"\n   <em>\n    Johnston v.
