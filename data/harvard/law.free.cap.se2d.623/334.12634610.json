(ACM), appeals the trial court's dismissal of several of its claims against defendant Gregory Poole Equipment Company (Poole) and dismissing all of its claims against defendant Caterpillar, Inc. (Caterpillar). ACM also appeals the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Poole on its remaining claim for breach of contract. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ACM was the general contractor responsible for the additions and renovations to the South Cary Wastewater Treatment Plant. ACM hired Via Electric Company (Via) to serve as the electrical subcontractor for the project. The project required that two generator sets be installed to provide emergency power in the event of a power outage. In July 1997, Via purchased two Caterpillar generators from Poole, a distributor for Caterpillar. The generators were installed in May 1998. On 16 September 1999, one of the generators malfunctioned, causing the generator to send excessive voltage through the system, and damaging electronic equipment at the plant. As a result of the damage to the plant's equipment, the Town of Cary back-charged ACM $68,537.97 for the damages, who in turn back-charged that amount to Via. In a separate suit, the Town of Cary, ACM, and Via settled their various claims regarding the project, including the damages to the electronic equipment. The Town of Cary is not a party to this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 6 February 2001, Via filed this action against ACM and other defendants. ACM filed an answer, counterclaim, and third party\n   complaint against Acardis, Geraghty &amp; Miller of North Carolina (Arcadis). ACM settled its claims against Arcadis. Poole and Caterpillar were not originally parties to this suit, but were defendants in a prior suit filed by Via arising out of the same series of events. As part of a settlement agreement between Via and ACM, Via assigned its claims against Caterpillar and Poole to ACM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ACM subsequently amended its third party complaint to become the plaintiff in this action and added Caterpillar and Poole as defendants based upon Via's assignment of claims. ACM's complaint stated claims against Caterpillar for breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and negligence. The complaint also stated claims against Poole for breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and negligence On 11 October 2002, Caterpillar filed a motion to dismiss ACM's claims. Poole filed a similar motion on 14 October 2002. Judge Manning heard the motions and dismissed all of ACM's claims against Caterpillar and dismissed all but ACM's breach of contract claim against Poole. ACM filed a notice of appeal from the dismissal order as to defendant Caterpillar on 2 June 2003, but later withdrew that appeal. A year later, Judge Manning entered an order of final judgment, concluding that his earlier order dismissing the case as to Caterpillar became a final judgment and the law of the case as a result of ACM's appeal of the earlier order and subsequent withdrawal of that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 26 March 2004, Poole moved for summary judgment on the remaining breach of contract claim. Judge Hobgood granted Poole's motion for summary judgment, dismissing ACM's claim for breach of contract. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Law of the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in holding the withdrawal of its appeal from the order dismissing its claims against Carterpillar became a final judgment and the law of the case. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The order of dismissal in this case did not adjudicate all the claims, as one claim was left to be litigated against defendant Poole. Therefore, it was interlocutory and generally not appealable.\n   <em>\n    Sharpe v.

As a result, the trial court erred in holding the dismissal order became the law of the case. The dismissal order is subject to review by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Assignability of Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In plaintiff's first argument, it contends the trial court erred in dismissing its claims against Poole and Caterpillar under the doctrine of champerty. We agree in part and disagree in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint asserted the following claims against Poole and Caterpillar: (1) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; (2) breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose; and (3) negligence. Plaintiff also asserted claims against Poole for breach of express warranty and breach of contract. The 2 May 2003 order dismissed plaintiff's claims against Poole and Caterpillar for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and\n   negligence, as all being personal tort claims. The order further dismissed plaintiff's breach of contract claim against Poole to the extent it sounded in tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is well-established in this state that personal tort claims are not assignable because such assignments would be void against public policy because they promote champerty.\n   <em>\n    Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp.

Plaintiff's claim for breach of express warranty, as assigned by Via, stems directly from Via's contractual agreement with Poole.

Neither party contests they entered into a valid contract for the purchase of the generators. The only dispute is whether Poole provided generators that met the terms of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Specifically, ACM contends Poole breached the contract in that it failed to: (1) provide generators with an adequate automatic transfer switch having adequate overvoltage protection; (2) provide a generator set that performed according to the project specifications; (3) properly inspect the generator set to determine any deficiencies; and (4) perform the work in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The evidence taken in the light most favorable to ACM establishes that Poole was not the manufacturer of the generators, only the distributor. Poole delivered the two generators, which met the requirements Via specified. Poole inspected the generators after they were delivered to the work site and ran start-up tests on them to insure they were working properly before they became operational. The generators ran consistently for four hours with only minimal problems, which Poole repaired. In the deposition of Milton Via, Jr., Via's project manager, he testified the generators performed satisfactorily for the seventeen or eighteen months preceding the 16 September 1999 incident. Despite the generator's malfunction, there was no evidence presented showing that Poole could have detected a defect in the parts described above. All the evidence presented demonstrates Poole complied with the terms of the contract. Thus, plaintiff is unable to establish an essential element of its claim, that is, that Poole breached the contract. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting Poole's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse Judge Manning's order dismissing ACM's claims against Poole for breach of express warranty and for breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We affirm Judge Manning's order dismissing the claims against Caterpillar for breach of the implied warranties, and also affirm Judge Hobgood's order of summary judgment on the claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   REVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judges HUDSON and JACKSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
