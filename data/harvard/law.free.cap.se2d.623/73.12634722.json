In this case, Defendant contends that the State failed to prove the element of malice to support a conviction of second-degree murder. Because the evidence showed that Defendant drove with an alcohol concentration of 0.156; sped seventy-five to eighty miles per hour in a forty-five miles per hour zone; traveled in the opposite direction lane; ran a red light without attempting to brake or stop; and had notice as to the serious consequences of driving while impaired as a result of his nine-year-old driving while impaired conviction; we uphold his conviction for second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter arose out of a five-car collision resulting in the death of Bernadette Whitsett and serious injuries to several other individuals. The accident occurred at the intersection of Country Club Road and Western Boulevard in Jacksonville, North Carolina. In the first vehicle at the intersection, Mrs. Whitsett and her husband, Kenneth, stopped at a red light in the left turn lane. In the second vehicle, Daniel Lewis stopped at the red light in the right lane. In the third vehicle, Samuel Cheatham stopped at the red light in the center lane. In the fourth vehicle, taxicab driver, Nathan Scott with a front-seat passenger traveled on Western Boulevard, and made a right turn on a green light to Country Club Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The fifth vehicle was described by Crystal Williams as she drove South on Country Club Road toward Western Boulevard. She testified that, a red pickup \"came out of nowhere, and [] got pretty close to the back of the car, so it kind of startled me, and then he shot over into - there's really not a middle lane, but I guess you would say he made one and he went flying down Country Club.\" She testified that the red pickup was going seventy-five to eighty miles per hour in a forty-five miles per hour zone. Thereafter, she heard a collision but did not observe it, came to the intersection of Country Club Road and Western Boulevard, observed the accident and called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Andrea Richmond also observed the fifth vehicle as she stopped for gas and drove onto Western Boulevard toward Country Club Road. At the intersection of Western Boulevard and Country Club Road, Ms. Richmond was in the left lane, next to the center turn lane, and had a green light. Approximately twenty to thirty-five feet from the intersection, she saw a red truck directly in front of her in the intersection. She testified that the red truck made no effort to stop at the red light, was going at least sixty miles per hour, went over a raise in the intersection, lost control, and \"slammed into\" the Whitsett vehicle which was \"pushed several feet, yards, backwards and also spun backwards.\" The Whitsett vehicle then collided with the vehicles driven by Cheatham and Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Lewis also saw the red truck approach the intersection, very fast, and then \"felt a jolt\" as something hit his vehicle. Mr. Scott saw the red truck, in his rearview mirror, go \"airborne\" and hit his taxicab in the rear. The impact broke the driver's seat, and Mr. Scott lost control of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paramedics William Pollock and John Smith arrived on the scene at 11:29 p.m., assessed the scene, and called for two additional paramedic trucks, two helicopters, and fire department vehicles with extrication equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mrs. Whitsett was dead upon the paramedics' arrival. Mr. Whitsett sustained a corneal abrasion to his left eye and abrasions on his face. Mr. Cheatham sustained a hole through the side of his face from under his right eye to the corner of his mouth, on the left side, collapsed lungs, and a dislocated left shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The paramedics found Defendant William Donovan Westbrook in the driver's seat of the red pickup with his legs trapped due to the extensive damage to the front of the truck. Paramedic Smith described Defendant as \"somewhat combative, not completely belligerent ... he sort of fought us[.]\" Defendant was removed from the vehicle, and Smith asked him if he had been drinking. Defendant responded in the affirmative and said he had \"a lot\" to drink.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon arrival at Onslow Memorial Hospital, emergency room nurse Linda Royston testified that Defendant was combative, uncooperative, and complained that \"his family jewels were hurting.\" She asked him if he had been drinking and he stated he \"had a lot to drink.\" She took a blood sample from Defendant, and then he was transferred via helicopter to Pitt Memorial Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Earl Burkhart, an accident reconstructionist with the Jacksonville Police Department, testified that he observed no braking or skid marks for any of the vehicles. The State also introduced a 1995 conviction of Defendant for driving while impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A jury found Defendant guilty of second-degree murder, driving while impaired, failing to stop for red light, reckless driving to endanger, driving left of center, and exceeding the posted speed. The trial court sentenced Defendant to imprisonment terms of 189 to 236 months imprisonment for the second-degree murder charge, twenty-four months for the driving while impaired charge, and thirty days for the remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting evidence of his prior conviction; (2) admitting his medical records; and (3) denying his motion to dismiss the second-degree murder charge. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior conviction for driving while impaired because it is not probative evidence of malice. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 8C-1, Rule 404(b) of the North Carolina General Statutes provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   N.C.

The trial court also admitted testimony of the Onslow County Deputy Clerk of Superior Court establishing Defendant's convictions on file. The State argued that the evidence of Defendant's driving while impaired conviction was relevant to show intent, i.e. malice, to support the second-degree murder charge. Defendant contends that the convictions alone, without evidence of the facts and circumstances supporting them, are not relevant to malice under Rule 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under our caselaw, \"prior driving convictions of a defendant are admissible to show malice, and the showing of malice in a second-degree murder case is a proper purpose within the meaning of Rule 404(b).\"\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Goodman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125227\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/57/#p72\">\n    149 N.C.App. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20S.E.2d%20196\">\n    560 S.E.2d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 (2002) (Greene, J., dissenting),\n   <em>\n    rev'd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"491495\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/357/43/\">\n    357 N.C. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20619\">\n    577 S.E.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (per curium as stated in dissenting opinion);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., State v.
