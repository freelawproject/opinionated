On 19 September 2003, a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder based on malice, premeditation, and deliberation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and subsequently on 26 September 2003, the jury recommended a sentence of death. We find no error in defendant's conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As seemed to be his custom, defendant began consuming alcoholic beverages on 19 March 1999. After drinking Jim Beam bourbon whiskey and Long Island Iced Tea, defendant argued with Michelle Lancaster, a female with whom he was living. He slapped Michelle on the head, knocking her to the ground, took her money and a bottle of prescription medication, and left the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   He eventually ended up at the apartment of Ralph Arthurs. Ralph Arthurs, Harold Grant, and defendant sat in Arthurs's apartment while defendant and Arthurs drank alcohol. Soon, Arthurs and Grant began discussing defendant's earlier beating of Robin Williams, defendant's former girlfriend. Arthurs demanded defendant leave the apartment, and defendant asked if he could finish his beer first. Grant got up and started walking towards the sink. When Grant got close to a knife block located on the counter beside the sink, defendant claims he thought Grant was going to attack him with a knife, although defendant admits Grant could have just been getting water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant stood up, grabbed a fire extinguisher, and started beating both Grant and Arthurs. At one time Grant got up from the floor and attempted to leave the apartment. Defendant dragged him back in and continued beating him. Defendant then stabbed Arthurs in the upper abdomen, and stabbed Grant in the face, chest, and neck. Defendant left the knives in Arthurs's upper abdomen, Grant's chest, and on both sides of Grant's neck. Grant's autopsy reflected the stab wounds were likely inflicted after Grant was rendered unconscious or had died. One knife recovered from Grant's neck was bent at a ninety-degree angle, indicating the force with which defendant plunged the knife into Grant's lifeless body. The cause of death for both murders was blunt force trauma to the head. Arthurs's pants were around his knees, and Grant's pants pockets were pulled out. The autopsy reports indicate Arthurs's blood alcohol content was .04, while Grant's did not register any alcohol present in his blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A blood spatter and stain expert testified for the State during trial and shed further light on the brutality of the killings. A blood stain which started at the front door and extended back to the body of Grant was consistent with defendant's dragging of Grant's body back into the apartment. In addition, a blood spatter on the front porch indicated Grant's head came into contact with the porch at some point. A blood spatter near Grant's head was consistent with his body being dragged back into the apartment, dropped face down onto the floor, and then later turned on his back. The blood spatter on the wall was consistent with the swinging of a fire extinguisher which hit Grant's head. In addition, the authorities found Arthurs's body with a significant amount of blood pooled to the left side of his head and a lack of blood on the front of his clothing. In the expert's opinion, Arthurs was also at one time lying face down and then subsequently rolled over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These killings occurred the morning of 20 March 1999 around 4:00 a.m. The noise from the struggle awoke a neighbor, Macie Randall, along with her granddaughter Angel. Later that morning, Tommy Feemster, the superintendent of the apartment building where the murders took place, went to the apartment complex to repair a leaky toilet in Arthurs's apartment. Feemster's coworker motioned for him to come to the door of Arthurs's apartment. When Feemster arrived at the door, they noticed what appeared to be blood on the area outside the door. Feemster immediately went to Macie Randall's apartment, and she informed him of the struggle she heard earlier that morning. Feemster then returned to Arthurs's apartment and pushed open the door, stepped inside, and discovered a body with a knife sticking in it. Based upon what he observed, he immediately closed the door and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The evidence reflected that after leaving the crime scene, defendant smoked some crack cocaine, and later that morning started seeking help from friends and family members. He telephoned Michelle Lancaster who told him he needed to retrieve his belongings and move out of her residence because of their recent altercation. She also told defendant she would not help him. Defendant then went to an automobile dealership where his sister Charlene McKinney worked. From there, he telephoned his half-sister Lisa Sneed and told her he needed her to pick him up at a nearby restaurant. Sneed picked him up, later that day took him to Lancaster's residence to pick up his belongings, and then they returned to Sneed's residence. After arriving at Sneed's residence, defendant put a pair of jeans and a\n   pair of shoes in the washing machine. Later, Sneed received a telephone call from a detective investigating the homicides who was seeking to interview defendant and Sneed. When Sneed inquired of defendant concerning this request, he informed her the detective wanted to question him about a murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant asked Sneed to lie to the detectives and tell them defendant and Sneed were together during the time of the murders. He told her he was with some guys smoking crack, and they would not cover for him. Based upon the detective's telephone call, defendant and Sneed went to the police station along with Robin Williams. Sneed told police the lie defendant posited, and Sneed and defendant quickly departed when detectives requested consent to search her residence. Upon returning to Sneed's residence, defendant grabbed his clothes and shoes from the washing machine, and Sneed gathered some drug paraphernalia she did not want the police to find. Defendant and Sneed then drove to Clover, South Carolina and threw the clothing items and drug paraphernalia out the window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The next day defendant and Sneed went to a grocery store where defendant asked Sneed to purchase a newspaper. After reading about the murders in the newspaper, defendant revealed to Sneed he in fact killed the two men. He claimed one of the men pulled a gun on him, and then defendant told Sneed to \"[t]ake it to your [expletive deleted] grave.\" The very next day Sneed went to the police station, told the detectives what defendant said, and told the detectives she had lied in their prior interview. Defendant was soon arrested, and shortly thereafter invoked his right to counsel. Later defendant voluntarily requested the detectives question him - at which time he admitted killing the victims. Defendant presented no evidence in the guilt-innocence proceeding. Upon deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the penalty proceeding, the State presented testimony from family members of Grant and Arthurs detailing the effects of the victims' murders on their lives. The State elicited testimony from Phyllis Williams, the mother of Robin Williams, concerning an incident in which defendant beat Robin. In addition, two law enforcement officers testified regarding this event, and the State submitted into evidence a judgment reflecting a conviction against defendant arising from his assault of Williams. Defendant served time in prison and also received probation as punishment for this beating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant submitted evidence of a difficult home life, including his father shooting his maternal grandfather shortly after his birth. He also submitted evidence he dropped out of high school, was successful in a group home, was a good father, and came from a family that consumed copious amounts of alcohol. A vocational rehabilitation counselor testified defendant had been employed as a drywall installer. However, on cross-examination the prosecution elicited testimony defendant violated his probation while being aided by the vocational rehabilitation counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant's forensic psychologist James H. Hilkey, Ph.D. also testified as an expert in the penalty proceeding. In his opinion, defendant suffers from longstanding depression, bipolar disorder, poly-substance abuse problems, and exhibits some characteristics of borderline personality disorder with antisocial and paranoid features. Dr. Hilkey testified defendant had been admitted numerous times to Dorothea Dix Hospital for various mental health problems, including attempted suicide, impulse control disorder, poly-substance abuse, and paranoid personality disorder. Dr. Hilkey also opined defendant suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Dr. Hilkey believed defendant would adjust well to prison life so long as he was compliant with his medication regimen. In addition, Dr. Hilkey testified on cross-examination his fee would be $15,000 in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the trial court's instruction on the submitted mitigating and aggravating circumstances and our statutory requirements for imposition of capital punishment, the jury commenced deliberations. The jurors found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt the following aggravating circumstances as to both murders: (1) defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use\n   of violence to the person; (2) the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; and (3) the murders were part of a course of conduct in which defendant engaged and which included the commission by defendant of other crimes of violence against other persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   No juror found any statutory mitigating circumstance, but at least one juror found eleven nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. After finding the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and the aggravating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty when considered with the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury returned a binding recommendation of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GUILT-INNOCENCE ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant claims the trial court committed reversible error when it overruled his objection to the admission of specific acts of bad conduct during redirect examination of Lisa Sneed. On cross-examination, defendant elicited testimony from Sneed that defendant could get violent after using drugs and alcohol, but when he is not consuming alcohol or drugs he has a heart of gold and is a good person. On redirect examination, the prosecution's questioning elicited more information on defendant's violent character, namely his violence against two other people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule 404 of our Rules of Evidence provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Character evidence generally.\n   </em>\n   - Evidence of a person's character or a trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Character of accused.\n   </em>\n   - Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same; . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404 (2003). Additionally, subsection (b) of Rule 404 provides: \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\" Defendant asserts the admission on redirect examination of the prior bad acts violated Rule 404(b) and thus constitutes reversible error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Whenever a defendant \"opens the door\" to character evidence by introducing evidence of his own pertinent character trait - in this case his peacefulness - the prosecution may rebut that evidence with contrary character evidence.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Rule 404(a)(1). Defendant cannot complain when the whole story is revealed, part of which he elicited through his own questioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1443(c) (2003) (\"A defendant is not prejudiced by the granting of relief which he has sought or by error resulting from his own conduct.\"). In\n   <em>\n    State v. Syriani,\n   </em>\n   we found no error in the admission of other specific acts of conduct after the defendant himself first elicited specific acts of conduct during his questioning.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549203\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/333/350/#p378\">\n    333 N.C. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378-80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=428%20S.E.2d%20118\">\n    428 S.E.2d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132-34,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"231682,233093,235270,233531,235692,232590,231374,230994,230899,232630,234584,234875,235740,233052\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/948/\">\n    510 U.S. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20S.%20Ct.%20392\">\n    114 S.Ct. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20341\">\n    126 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]he law wisely permits evidence not otherwise admissible to be offered to explain or rebut evidence elicited by the defendant himself.

While the bad acts elicited by the prosecution on redirect of Lisa Sneed may have been inadmissible on direct examination before defendant \"opened the door\" during cross-examination, the prosecution's rebuttal of defendant's evidence of good character through the use of specific instances of conduct is proper.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Garner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2508466\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/330/273/#p289\">\n    330 N.C. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20S.E.2d%20861\">\n    410 S.E.2d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (1991). Therefore, we overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant also assigns as error the failure of the trial court to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   in the prosecution's closing argument. Defendant takes exception to the following statement by the prosecutor: \"The judge may tell you that the defendant acted with deliberation. Excuse me, with pre - the defendant\n   acted with premeditation, that is, he formed the intent to kill the victim over some period of time.\" Defendant did not object, so we review this statement to see whether it was so grossly improper the trial court abused its discretion in failing to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.

We hold this statement was not so grossly improper as to require intervention by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant's argument rests heavily on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, we held there was an improper argument during closing statements when the prosecutor told the jury the trial judge found a statement reliable and trustworthy, and if the trial judge had found anything wrong with the testimony he would not have let the jury hear it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20S.E.2d%20372\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20S.E.2d%20372\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20S.E.2d%20372\">\n    546 S.E.2d at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Also, because there was no objection, and therefore no overruling by the trial court of defendant's objection, this idea was not solidified in the jurors' minds. Additionally, the prosecution's argument did not travel outside the record as prohibited by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1230(a) (2003). Finally, the trial court instructed the jury the court was impartial and the jury would be mistaken to believe otherwise. The trial court instructed the jury it \"may\" find premeditation and deliberation, and instructed on what basis the jury could make such a finding. Therefore, this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant further contends the trial court's instruction to the jury regarding confession constitutes reversible error. Although defendant did not object to the giving of this instruction, any error is still preserved for appeal. Whenever a defendant alleges a trial court made an improper statement by expressing an opinion on the evidence in violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 15A-1222 and 15A-1232, the error is preserved for review without objection due to the mandatory nature of these statutory prohibitions.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

We heard from Dr. Hilkey there, the $15,000 man. Qualified medical or psychological experts can review the same material, yet come to different opinions. We know this, because Dr. Holly Rogers we heard about - we didn't hear from her, but in 1999 or 2000 or around about that time diagnosed the defendant as having intermittent explosive disorder or rage disorder. Dr. Hilkey: No, he didn't have that, according to Dr. Hilkey. Dr. Hilkey tells us that-well, let me back up a minute. In fact, there were different diagnoses given by qualified people over the course of these years. One of them diagnosed him with schizophrenia. Dr. Hilkey says no, he's not schizophrenic. Dr. Hilkey says, well, Dr. Rogers-let me back up a minute, now-if you recall diagnosed him as having antisocial, or being-having antisocial personality, which is-which Dr. Hilkey confirms that he's got. Yes, in fact, he does have traits similar to antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Hilkey didn't specifically diagnose him with that but indicated that he has antisocial features. Well, you folks may recall that antisocial personality disorder is what used to be called psychopathic, sociopathic. It's now called antisocial. A rose, folks, by any other name is still a rose. What you and I call mean, nasty, evil, vicious, Dr. Hilkey calls antisocial. We have now sanitized all these behaviors and called them-wrapped them up in nice, neat little packages and given them psychological names. There is a psychological diagnosis for someone who drinks too much coffee: Caffeine-induced disorder. That's what we learned from the $15,000 man.

The prosecution's statement emphasized Dr. Hilkey's fee in the case was $15,000 and the jury should take that fact into account when determining the credibility of Dr. Hilkey and the weight it should place on his testimony. Considering the statements made by prosecutors in our prior cases that have found no gross impropriety requiring\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   intervention by the trial court, we find the prosecution's closing argument in this case tame by those standards. Accordingly, we overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition, defendant claims the trial court should have intervened\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   when the prosecution used the word \"crap\" during penalty proceeding closing arguments. The prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We all have issues in our family, every one of us. Every one of us. Mr. Duke\n   was given every opportunity, every chance to be part of a loving, warm environment, and chose not to. He chose not to be part of that. You know, I was waiting to hear from his family members, based on what we saw, that the defendant was tortured, locked in a closet, beaten severely by his mother or Mr. Fincher. Where was that? Where was any of that? On the contrary, what you heard was they did everything they could to provide for him, but he didn't care. Warm, loving home? Who needs that when there's crap?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We note first of all the word \"crap\" makes absolutely no sense in this context. We do not find it proper to hypothesize, however we cannot help but wonder if a transcription error in fact occurred. Regardless of any possible transcription error, we analyze this statement as if the word \"crap\" was actually used by the prosecutor during the argument.

In the case at bar, the prosecution did not engage in any name-calling nor did the prosecutor improperly disparage defendant's argument. Instead, the prosecutor took defendant's evidence as it was, and, albeit in less than professional terms, discussed the choice defendant made to turn his back on his family and pursue instead a life of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and violence, which culminated in a senseless and brutal double murder. We cannot say this argument was so grossly improper as to require the trial court to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu,\n   </em>\n   and we therefore overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant's request to give the jury peremptory instructions on the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(2) and (f)(6) mitigating circumstances. We disagree. It is well established a defendant is entitled to peremptory instructions on a mitigating circumstance whenever the evidence supporting the mitigating circumstance is uncontroverted.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Holden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2519398\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/338/394/#p402\">\n    338 N.C. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402-03,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=450%20S.E.2d%20878\">\n    450 S.E.2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (1994). \"[W]e have held that it is not error for a trial court in a capital case to refuse to give requested instructions where counsel failed to submit the instructions to the trial court in writing.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There is nothing in the record or the transcript to indicate such a request was made in writing by defendant. That said, even if the requested instructions had been submitted in writing the evidence supporting the (f)(2) and (f)(6) mitigating circumstances was simply not uncontroverted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(2) provides a statutory mitigating circumstance of: \"The capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance.\" Here, defendant presented evidence he suffered from mental or emotional disturbance through his expert witness Dr. Hilkey. Dr. Hilkey, while giving his opinion defendant committed these murders under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance, also admitted on cross-examination two clinicians could come to different conclusions. Additionally, Dr. Hilkey testified as to inconsistent diagnoses of defendant's condition determined by other mental health professionals in the past. Clearly, the evidence of defendant's mental or emotional disturbance was not uncontroverted, as established by the cross-examination made by the prosecution. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to a peremptory instruction on the (f)(2) mitigating circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Additionally, defendant was not entitled to a peremptory instruction on the (f)(6) mitigating circumstance which provides: \"The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was\n   impaired.\" While defendant submitted evidence that tended to show this mitigating circumstance existed, that evidence was not uncontroverted. In fact, during the guilt-innocence proceeding of the trial, the prosecution introduced evidence tending to show defendant knew what he did was wrong such as turning out Grant's pants pockets, pulling Arthurs's pants down to his knees, and ransacking the apartment - all to make it appear a robbery occurred. In addition, defendant fled the scene of the crime, destroyed potential evidence, attempted to destroy other evidence by discarding it across the state line, and encouraged his sister to lie in order to provide him an alibi. Surely the jury could have reasonably found from this evidence defendant knew and appreciated the criminality of his actions. Because defendant's evidence on this matter was not uncontroverted, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant assigns as error the denial of his request to submit to the jury a non-statutory mitigating circumstance of: \"Jeff's actions towards these victims were influenced to some degree by their behavior towards him and he reacted to what he thought was provocation on the part of the victims.\" As a general rule, a defendant is allowed to submit to the jury any mitigating circumstance that a jury could reasonably find to have mitigating value and has sufficient evidence to support it.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

However, this does not mean defendant is entitled to place the question of his guilt of first-degree murder back onto the table for the jury to decide. The jury decided during the guilt-innocence proceeding defendant was guilty of first-degree murder, rejecting his contention he acted under perceived provocation. We therefore overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant contends reversible error occurred when the trial court reinstructed the jury on mitigating circumstances after the jury submitted a question to the court seeking clarification.

The trial court advised the jury to decide the listed mitigating circumstances as it previously instructed, and \"any others which you deem to have mitigating value.\" The trial court did not instruct the jurors the statutory mitigators were not to be found unless the jury concluded they had mitigating value. If any error occurred in the re-instruction, this error was to defendant's benefit because it implied all the listed circumstances had some mitigating value, rather than instructing the jury it should not find a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance unless it deemed that circumstance to exist and have mitigating value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   This case is clearly distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    State v. Syriani,\n   </em>\n   this Court stated: \"Because these jury instructions incorporate narrowing definitions adopted by this Court and expressly approved by the United States Supreme Court, or are of the tenor of the definitions approved, we reaffirm that these instructions provide constitutionally sufficient guidance to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 391-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=428%20S.E.2d%20118\">\n    428 S.E.2d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Syriani,\n   </em>\n   the pattern jury instruction given in the instant case was\n   a sufficient limiting instruction which cures any vagueness or overbreadth of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance. This Court's appellate narrowing of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance has been incorporated into the pattern jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, we fail to see how conducting appellate review of a question submitted to the jury somehow makes this Court a co-finder of fact with the jury in violation of\n   <em>\n    Ring.\n   </em>\n   Defendant asserts in his brief that appellate narrowing, as allowed by\n   <em>\n    Walton,\n   </em>\n   \"no longer passes constitutional muster.\" In support of this argument, defendant cites only a footnote from a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States,\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Cone,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927194\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/447/\">\n    543 U.S. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ___ n. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927194\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/447/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852 n. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927194\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/447/\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 891 n. 6 (2005) (per curiam). This footnote merely summarizes the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   and states the inapplicability of\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Cone,\n   </em>\n   as the\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   case was tried before\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   was announced and the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   is not retroactive. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   Court did not have before it the issue of whether appellate narrowing of vague aggravating circumstances post-\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   is constitutional. We decline to make the logical jump defendant makes that a mere statement indicating an issue is not before the Court means an overruling of prior precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Further, we note this argument by defendant is speculative in nature. Defendant did not assert in his brief or at oral argument that the murders committed by him were not especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel or for some reason require appellate narrowing. Therefore, we will only determine, during proportionality review, the sufficiency of the evidence in the record to determine if it supports the finding of the aggravating circumstance by the jury. In this determination, the Court merely acts as all appellate courts do and determines if the sufficiency of the evidence submitted supported the finding of the jury. Defendant's argument that such review by an appellate court somehow makes that court a co-finder of fact with the jury in violation of\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   is without merit. In fact, if\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   imposes such a prohibition upon appellate courts, then, in any sentencing determination, defendants will no longer be allowed to request that a trial court or an appellate court determine whether a circumstance was supported by the evidence after that circumstance is found by the jury. This argument lacks merit, and therefore we overrule defendant's assignment of error on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Constitutionality of \"Issue Three\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant claims part of the applicable jury instructions and the Issues and Recommendation as to Punishment Form, both derived from N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(b) and (c), violate his constitutional rights because if the jury determines the mitigating circumstances are equal in weight to the aggravating circumstances, the jury must continue its analysis instead of recommending life without parole. \"Issue Number Three,\" as it is called by many attorneys, is derived from N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(c), which provides in part: \"When the jury recommends a sentence of death, the foreman of the jury shall sign a writing on behalf of the jury which writing shall show . . . the mitigating circumstance or circumstances are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance or circumstances found.\" The jury recommendation form in this case reads: \"Do you unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstance or circumstances found is, or are, insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance or circumstances found by you?\" This instruction and the statute on which it is based do not violate defendant's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   We note at the outset defendant did not object to the instruction given, nor was there any indication of equipoise in the record.

A reversal for plain error is only appropriate in the most exceptional cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The plain error rule applies only in truly exceptional cases. Before deciding that an error by the trial court amounts to \"plain error,\" the appellate court must be convinced that absent the error the jury probably\n   would have reached a different verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v. Odom,\n   </em>\n   307 N.C. at 661, 300 S.E.2d at 378-79.

Therefore, the test for \"plain error\" places a much heavier burden upon the defendant than that imposed by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1443 upon defendants who have preserved their rights by timely objection.

The murders in this case were especially brutal. The evidence showed defendant brutally beat the victims with a blunt object - a fire extinguisher. Both victims were found with their brains \"smashed.\" The multiple blows from the fire extinguisher fractured both victims' skulls and caused immediate internal bleeding of the victims' brains. In addition, the violent blows from defendant's swings of the fire extinguisher forced Arthurs's brain into his spinal column. When Grant tried to leave the apartment, defendant grabbed him and pulled him back into the apartment so he could continue his savage beating. The autopsy showed multiple stab wounds to Grant's face and neck. The evidence showed not only did defendant stab his victims, but he moved the blades around inside their bodies, causing even more damage. To finish this brutality, defendant plunged knives into both sides of Grant's neck, into Grant's chest,\n   and into Arthurs's upper abdomen, leaving a total of four knives in his victims' bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Although we `compare this case with the cases in which we have found the death penalty to be proportionate . . . . we will not undertake to discuss or cite all of those cases each time we carry out that duty.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
