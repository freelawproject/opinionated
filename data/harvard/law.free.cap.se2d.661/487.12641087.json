They filed identical motions for judgment against Dillard's and two of its employees, claiming damages for malicious prosecution. The plaintiffs' pleadings alleged that the defendants had falsely and maliciously charged them with embezzlement and procured their prosecution on that charge, but at the conclusion of the Commonwealth's evidence in the General District Court, their motions to strike the Commonwealth's evidence had been granted and the charges dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendants responded with motions to compel arbitration, showing that the plaintiffs,\n   while employed by Dillard's, had been parties to an arbitration agreement requiring them to submit to binding arbitration certain controversies that might arise between the parties. The circuit court heard argument on the motions in both cases, reviewed the briefs and pleadings, and ruled from the bench that the arbitration agreement, by its terms, did not cover the dispute between the parties and that the cases could proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The circuit court delivered its oral ruling on March 20, 2007. Identical orders were entered in the two cases, overruling the motions to compel arbitration, on April 10, 2007. On April 4, 2007, after the court's oral ruling but before the entry of its written orders, the defendants filed with the clerk of the circuit court a notice of an interlocutory appeal to this Court in each case, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   No other notices of appeal were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rule 5:9(a) provides: \"No appeal shall be allowed unless, within 30 days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel for the appellant files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel.\" (Emphasis added.)
