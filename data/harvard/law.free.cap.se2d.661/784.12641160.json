We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 5 March 2007, BB &amp; T filed a complaint and alleged that defendants and four other individuals had \"failed and refused to pay their indebtedness due under . . . [g]uaranty [a]greements.\" BB &amp; T requested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia:\n   </em>\n   (1) \"[t]hat it have and recover of the [d]efendants, jointly and severally, the sum of $530,407.98 in principal, plus $40,123.43 in interest, plus $7,373.32 in late fees, plus interest from June 23, 2006 until paid in full[ ]\" and (2) \"[t]hat it have and recover of the [d]efendants its attorneys' fees as provided for in the Guaranty Agreements and Section 6-21.2 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BB &amp; T's complaint asserted: (1) Six Star Economic Development Group, LLC (\"Six Star\") executed a promissory note in favor of BB &amp; T in an amount of $1,700,000.00 on or about 6 December 2002; (2) Six Star later defaulted under the terms of the promissory note; and (3) defendants and four other individuals had guaranteed the payment of the promissory note pursuant to guaranty agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 15 May 2007, defendants filed their \"answer/motion to dismiss/cross-claim.\" Defendants' motion to dismiss alleged BB &amp; T had failed to include the Small Business Administration, a co-signor/guarantor of the promissory note and a necessary and proper party to the action. Defendants' cross-claim alleged a claim for contribution/indemnification against Mary Morrison (\"Morrison\") and Harry Southerland (\"Southerland\"). Defendants' cross-claim asserted Morrison and Southerland, along with other members of Six Star, had agreed to \"indemnify and hold harmless defendants from . . . any and all loss, damage, claim and/or liability . . . arising from any claim . . . made against any of the defendants by virtue of their involvement . . . with Six Star. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 21 May 2007, BB &amp; T moved for summary judgment. On 27 September 2007, defendants filed a \"motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)/affirmative defense[.]\" Defendants alleged the guaranty agreements were void due to lack of consideration and \"assert[ed] an [a]ffirmative [d]efense that the [g]uaranty [a]greements . . . lack[ed] consideration.\" On 1 October 2007, the trial court ruled \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [BB &amp; T] is entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\" Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred when it granted BB &amp; T's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. On appeal of a trial\n   court's allowance of a motion for summary judgment, we consider whether, on the basis of materials supplied to the trial court, there was a genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Evidence presented by the parties is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Summey v.
