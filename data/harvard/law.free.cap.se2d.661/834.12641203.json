KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This dispute arose out of a mortgage loan entered into by Harald Schmidt. The issues on appeal are whether the circuit court erred by sustaining both a demurrer to a claim for rescission of the mortgage loan and a plea in bar of the applicable statutes of limitation as to claims for actual fraud and constructive fraud, along with violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), Code \u00a7 59.1-196\n   <em>\n    et seq.;\n   </em>\n   the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C \u00a7 1601\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2000 &amp; Supp. V 2005); and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2000 &amp; Supp. V 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We will affirm the circuit court's judgment sustaining the demurrer because Schmidt did not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for rescission of a contract.

MATERIAL FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an amended complaint, Schmidt recounted the events surrounding a mortgage loan that he entered into on February 28, 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Schmidt, he submitted a mortgage loan application to Household Finance Corporation II, d/b/a Household Finance Corp. of Virginia (Household Finance), in response to a telephone solicitation from a Household Finance employee. Household Finance then offered Schmidt a mortgage loan with a lower interest rate and shorter term than his existing mortgage loan. The loan, however, would have prepaid finance charges of $17,467.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Schmidt met with two Household Finance employees at its office in the City of Fairfax. The employees allegedly told Schmidt that they could not execute the loan documents at the Household Finance office but, instead, needed to go to a nearby restaurant to do so. When the notary public who was scheduled to meet with Schmidt and the Household Finance employees in order to notarize the loan documents failed to arrive at the restaurant, Schmidt explained that he needed to return to work. The Household Finance employees, however, informed Schmidt that he had to sign the loan documents that day in order to receive the loan and that, if he would execute the documents, the notary public could sign them later. Schmidt then executed the loan documents but never received\n   copies of them, despite the employees' promise to send the documents to Schmidt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2004, Schmidt initiated steps to refinance the mortgage loan that he believed he had obtained from Household Finance. The next month, while working with another lender, Schmidt learned for the first time that his mortgage loan was actually from a lending institution known as \"MBNA,\" not from Household Finance, and that the interest rate was several points higher than he had understood. Schmidt also learned that the $17,467 he had paid to Household Finance did not represent prepaid finance charges but was for closing costs and fees. According to Schmidt, he also discovered that Household Finance, by its agents, had forged Schmidt's signature on loan documents and provided MBNA with false information regarding Schmidt's income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon learning all this information, Schmidt refused to make further loan payments on the grounds that he had not agreed to the loan terms. In November 2005, foreclosure proceedings were commenced against Schmidt's residence. Schmidt then sold his residence, and he alleges that he received at least $100,000 less than he would have received if he had not sold the property to avoid the foreclosure proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Schmidt's amended complaint naming only Household Finance as a defendant, he sought rescission of the written contract (Count I). He alleged that the mortgage loan was unlawful because Household Finance was not licensed as a mortgage lender. He further claimed that, \"[b]ecause the loan ... was illegal, [Household Finance] has no right to retain the money that it received from [Schmidt] in excess of the amount it lent to [Schmidt] and is obligated by natural justice and equity to refund the money to [Schmidt].\" Schmidt also alleged actual fraud (Count II) and constructive fraud (Count III), as well as violations of the VCPA (Count IV), the TILA (Count V), and the RESPA (Count VI). In response, Household Finance filed, among other things, a demurrer to Counts I through IV of Schmidt's amended complaint and a plea in bar of the applicable statutes of limitation to all the counts asserted in the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' memoranda and oral argument with regard to the demurrer and plea in bar, the circuit court made the following determination, as stated in the final order: \"Count I - Demurrer sustained, Plea in Bar Denied. Count II-VI - Demurrer is Denied, Plea in Bar is sustained. The First Amended Complaint is Dismissed with Prejudice.\" We awarded Schmidt this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Schmidt assigns error to the circuit court's judgment sustaining both Household Finance's demurrer to his claim for rescission and the plea in bar with regard to the other claims. We will first address the demurrer and then the plea in bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Demurrer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When reviewing a trial court's judgment sustaining a demurrer, we determine only \"whether a plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Almy v.

Here, we must determine whether Schmidt's factual allegations stated a cause of action for rescission against Household Finance. We have previously explained that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [o]ne of the first principles with respect to the rescission of a contract is that, in seeking a remedy which calls for the highest and most drastic exercise of the power of a court of chancery - to annul and set at naught the solemn contracts of parties - there must be first a sufficient averment of facts showing the plaintiff entitled in equity to the relief which he seeks, and satisfactory proof of these facts, to justify the interposition of the court; and in addition to all this the court must be able substantially to restore the parties to the position which they occupied before they entered into the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Bonsal v.

This is so, according to Schmidt, because Household Finance is not licensed as a mortgage lender in accordance with Code \u00a7 6.1-410. Schmidt contends that illegality is one of the grounds for rescission and that he can, therefore, rescind the transaction and recover the money he paid to Household Finance. Schmidt acknowledges that Household Finance was not a party to the mortgage loan. He, nevertheless, argues that since Household Finance employees failed to disclose that the lender was MBNA, Household Finance is liable on the contract (and for rescinding it) on the theory that an agent for an undisclosed principal is liable, along with the principal, on the contract. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his amended complaint, Schmidt captioned Count I as \"RESCISSION OF WRITTEN CONTRACT,\" but the only written contract alleged was the mortgage loan with MBNA. Schmidt did not assert any contract to which he and Household Finance were parties. Thus, Schmidt alleged no factual basis for a cause of action against Household Finance for rescission of a contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Schmidt alleged that he had sold his residence and repaid the amount of the loan that he received. These allegations show that the circuit court could not restore the parties to the respective positions they occupied before entering into the contract.\n   <em>\n    Bonsal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"465791\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/111/595/#p599\">\n    111 Va. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20S.E.%20978\">\n    69 S.E. at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see McLeskey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2111014\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/242/51/#p54\">\n    242 Va. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20S.E.2d%20846\">\n    405 S.E.2d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Schmidt also argues that he asserted a cause of action for unjust enrichment in Count I and that the circuit court erred in sustaining Household Finance's demurrer in regard to that theory of recovery. In support of this argument, Schmidt points to his allegation asserting that, because the loan from Household Finance to Schmidt was illegal, Household Finance \"has no right to retain the money that it received from [Schmidt] in excess of the amount it lent to [Schmidt] and is obligated by natural justice and equity to refund the money to [Schmidt].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, Schmidt had to allege that: (1) he conferred a benefit on Household Finance; (2) Household Finance knew of the benefit and should reasonably have expected to repay Schmidt; and (3) Household Finance accepted or retained the benefit without paying for its value.\n   <em>\n    See Nedrich v.

Contrary to Schmidt's argument, he did not plead sufficient factual allegations in his amended complaint to state a cause of action for unjust enrichment.

The statute of limitations for actual fraud and constructive fraud, as well as a VCPA violation, is two years. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-243(A) and 59.1-204.1(A), respectively. However, \"[i]n actions for fraud or mistake, [or] in actions for violations of the Consumer Protection Act [the cause of action accrues] when such fraud, mistake, misrepresentation, deception, or undue influence is discovered or\n   by the exercise of due diligence reasonably should have been discovered.\" Code \u00a7 8.01-249(1),\n   <em>\n    see also STB Marketing Corp. v.

However, Schmidt stated no facts demonstrating that, despite the exercise of due diligence, he could not have discovered the alleged fraud any sooner. Yet, Schmidt alleged that he executed the loan documents\n   in a restaurant and was advised that the notary public, who failed to appear, would execute the documents later. Schmidt further alleged that he never received a copy of the loan documents although the Household Finance employees told him that copies would be sent to him. Based on these facts, a reasonable and prudent person would suspect that something was amiss with regard to the mortgage loan. But, Schmidt apparently made no follow-up inquiries about the mortgage loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    STB Marketing,\n   </em>\n   this Court held that a thorough examination of land records and foreclosure sale documents would not have apprised the plaintiff of the fraudulent acts at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2108661\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/240/140/#p144\">\n    240 Va. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20S.E.2d%20394\">\n    393 S.E.2d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the present case, by contrast, the alleged events surrounding the execution of the mortgage loan documents were sufficient in and of themselves to put Schmidt on notice that, at a minimum, he needed to make further inquiry. Thus, based on the facts alleged in Schmidt's amended complaint, we conclude that Schmidt did not carry his burden to prove that he filed this action within two years of the time when, \"by the exercise of due diligence[, the alleged fraud] reasonably should have been discovered.\" Code \u00a7 8.01-249(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, we address the plea in bar of the statutes of limitation applicable to Schmidt's causes of action alleging violations of TILA and RESPA.
