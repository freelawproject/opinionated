(\"Dr.Lung\") regarding the standard of care applicable to Arcadis FPS, Inc. (\"Arcadis\") and the City of Burlington, North Carolina (\"City of Burlington\"); (2) granting partial summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington on plaintiffs' Chapter 143 and negligent misrepresentation claims; (3) granting summary judgment in favor of Arcadis on all of plaintiffs' claims; and (4) subsequently granting summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington on all of plaintiffs' remaining claims. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 10 July 2002, the City of Burlington purchased an easement from Huffman Oil Company, Inc. (\"Huffman\") to construct and maintain a waterline under and across Huffman's property near the corner of U.S. Highway 70 and N.C. Highway 100 in Guilford County. In 2003, the City of Burlington began construction of approximately 12,300 linear feet of 24-inch potable waterline to connect the City of Burlington's water system to the City of Greensboro's water system (\"the water main project\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arcadis was retained to provide engineering and surveying services for the project. Paul Howard Construction Company, Inc. (\"Howard\") was hired to perform the required construction work. Howard entered into a sub-contract with PDM Investments, Inc. (\"PDM\") to install a series of underground vaults to house and provide access to valves at specified locations along the waterline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   David and Christopher Michael (\"the Michaels\") of Michael's Backhoe &amp; Landscaping, Inc. were sub-contracted to construct part of the waterline on behalf of PDM. The Michaels were contractually responsible for all excavation, pipe installation, fittings and valve installation, compacting, erosion control measures, and testing from Station 0 + 00 to Station 48 + 00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 3 July 2003, after completing the majority of the required work, the Michaels performed a pressure test on a portion of the waterline recently installed. This test required access through the underground vault installed by PDM and Howard, near the intersection of Highways 70 and 100. The waterline failed to maintain sufficient pressure for the required period of time. The Michaels dismissed the remainder of their crew and proceeded to search for the leak. The next morning, the Michaels were found dead at the bottom of the vault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The cause of death was determined to be \"asphyxia and environmental hypoxia\" due to a hazardous and toxic environment and petroleum discharge. The medical examiner found that the cause of death was \"consistent with the extremely low oxygen levels in the vault measured shortly after the bodies of [the Micheals] were removed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 6 June 2005, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging fourteen separate wrongful death claims against Huffman, the City of Burlington, Arcadis, and Howard. Plaintiffs contended that the deaths were caused by hazardous environmental conditions existing near the corner of Highways 100 and 70. Plaintiffs alleged the hazardous environmental condition resulted from toxic vapors leaking into the soil from two underground storage tanks used in connection with a gasoline service station that formerly operated on Huffman's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged the following claims for relief against the City of Burlington: (1) strict liability under a violation of Chapter 143; (2) third-party beneficiary; (3) failure to investigate; (4) failure to warn; (5) negligent misrepresentation; (6) inherently dangerous work; and (7) premises liability. Plaintiffs alleged negligence and negligent misrepresentation against Arcadis. Subsequently, both the City of Burlington and Arcadis filed answers, which denied plaintiffs' material allegations and asserted the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. On 13 December 2006, Arcadis filed a motion to exclude plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Lung, and moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 21 December 2006, the City of Burlington moved for partial summary judgment regarding the following claims: (1) third-party beneficiary; (2) failure to investigate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) failure to warn; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) inherently dangerous work; and (6) premises liability. On 20 February 2007, the City of Burlington filed: (1) a second motion for partial summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claim for strict liability under Chapter 143 and (2) a motion to exclude Dr. Lung's expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By separate orders dated 18 January and 4 April 2007, the trial court ruled that Dr. Lung would not be permitted to testify at trial as to the appropriate standard of care or the breach of such standard regarding defendants, Arcadis and the City of Burlington. On 4 April 2007, the trial court also granted partial summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington regarding plaintiffs' claims of: (1) strict liability under violation of Chapter 143 and (2) negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 2 May 2007, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Arcadis on all of plaintiffs' claims. The trial court also granted summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington on all of plaintiffs' remaining claims. On 29 May and 15 June 2007, the trial court issued orders staying the remaining proceedings pending resolution of this appeal. Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by: (1) granting Arcadis's and the City of Burlington's motions to exclude Dr. Lung's expert testimony; (2) granting partial summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington regarding plaintiffs' Chapter 143 and negligent misrepresentation claims; (3) granting summary judgment in favor of Arcadis regarding all of plaintiffs' claims; and (4) subsequently granting summary judgment in favor of the City of Burlington regarding all of plaintiffs' remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    III. Interlocutory Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a preliminary matter, this appeal is interlocutory. \"Generally, a party cannot immediately appeal from an interlocutory order unless failure to grant immediate review would affect[ ] a substantial right pursuant to N.C.G.S. sections 1-277 and 727(d).\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Exclusion of Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs argue Dr. Lung should be allowed to testify as an expert witness in this case and opine the standard of care to be employed by professional engineers in the design and administration of underground utility construction projects.

Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is well-established that trial courts must decide preliminary questions concerning the qualifications of experts to testify or the admissibility of expert testimony. When making such determinations, trial courts are not bound by the rules of evidence. In this capacity, trial courts are afforded wide latitude of discretion when making a determination about the admissibility of expert testimony. Given such latitude, it follows that\n   <em>\n    a trial court's ruling on the qualifications of an expert or the admissibility of an expert's opinion will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Howerton v.

Although North Carolina does not exclusively adhere to the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   general acceptance test, when specific precedent justifies recognition of an established scientific theory or technique advanced by an expert, the trial court should favor its admissibility, provided the other requirements of admissibility are likewise satisfied....

Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The party moving for summary judgment ultimately has the burden of establishing the lack of any triable issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   A defendant may show entitlement to summary judgment by (1) proving that an essential element of the plaintiff's case is non-existent, or (2) showing through discovery that the plaintiff cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim, or (3) showing that the plaintiff cannot surmount an affirmative defense. Summary judgment is not appropriate where matters of credibility and determining the weight of the evidence exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We review an order allowing summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   If the granting of summary judgment can be sustained on any grounds, it should be affirmed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v.
