A trial before the court and jury resulted in a verdict of not guilty, on which judgment was rendered, from which this appeal is taken.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265\">The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff in substance tends to show that plaintiff was stooping over near the corner of Desplaines and Twelfth streets, drinking water which ran from a sprinkling wagon of the city standing near the corner of said streets, and that the boy was in plain view of any one approaching the corner of the streets, coming from the north on Desplaines street; that the servant of defendant in error came from the north on Desplaines street, driving the horses and wagon south on that street at a trot, and in passing around the corner where the boy stood drinking from the sprinkler, and as the driver turned west on Twelfth street, the front wheel of his wagon struck the boy, knocked him down, and he was run over by the hind wheel of the wagon. Several witnesses testified that they were in a position to see the occurrence, and state that had the driver looked he could have seen the boy at least 150 feet away; that there was nothing to obstruct his view, and that there were no other boys at the place where plaintiff was standing.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265(11) 266(160)\">The evidence on behalf of defendant in error was to the effect that the horses and wagon were driven very slowly south on Desplaines street; that the driver did not see the boy at the sprinkler, and did not know that the wagon struck him until after be had been run over; also, that there were several other boys at the sprinkler with the plaintiff, who were scrambling and pushing in all directions, and that one of the boys either pushed the plaintiff down or he slipped and fell against the wagon and was run over. The evidence is conflicting, and while we are not prepared to hold that a verdict either way would not have been justified by the evidence, we are inclined to the view that the' evidence, when considered as a whole, fairly preponderates in favor of the plaintiff, that the driver was negligent, and that the boy was in the exercise of such care, considering his age and intelligence, as would not have precluded a recovery.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266\">The trial court, after examining the plaintiff, ruled that he was not competent to testify. Plaintiff stated on this examination that he was a Jewish boy, did not go to school, never went to church or Sunday school; that he did not know what it was to tell a lie, and did not know what would happen to him if he told a lie.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\" pgmap=\"266\">\u00d1o instructions were asked on behalf of plaintiff and the court instructed the jury for defendant, that if they believed from the evidence that the\" plaintiff was guilty of negligence which directly contributed to the injury, then he could not recover, and also gave the two following instructions:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\" pgmap=\"266\">\u201c The court instructs yon that if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff might, in the exercise of ordinary care and caution, have seen the danger and avoided it, and that the omission to do so directly contributed to the injury, .then he was guilty of such negligence as will prevent the recovery in this suit, unless you further find from the evidence that the injury was caused by the willful, intentional or wantonly reckless acts of the defendant or their servants.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\" pgmap=\"266(40) 267(56)\">\u201c The court instructs the jury that to entitle the plaintiff to recover, the jury must believe from the evidence that the injury complained of was occasioned by the carelessness or negligence of the defendants, or their servants, in the manner charged in the declaration. And if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, then the plaintiff can not recover, unless you further find from the evidence that the injury was caused by the willful, intentional or wantonly reckless acts of the defendants or their servants.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\" pgmap=\"267\">2sTo instruction was given defining negligence, nor which told the jury that there should be any distinction between the negligence of an adult and that of a child of tender years.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">King &amp; Gross, attorneys for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267\">Richard H. Mather, attorney for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b267-7\" pgmap=\"267\">Mr. Justice Windes</author> <p id=\"A-o\" pgmap=\"267\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b267-8\" pgmap=\"267\">When the evidence is conflicting and the case is close as to the right of recovery, it has been, repeatedly decided that the instructions to the jury should be accurate. Canevin v. R. R. Co., 72 Ill. App. 81, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b267-9\" pgmap=\"267\">Whether or not the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence was a question of fact for the jury, and it was important that the jury in the determination of that fact should have been properly and accurately instructed. What would have been negligence on the part of an adult which would have precluded his recovery, does not necessarily constitute negligence on the part of a child of tender years, such as the plaintiff is shown to be, which would prevent a recovery. The negligence of a child is to be measured by his age, capacity and intelligence under the circumstances of the particular situation under consideration.</p> <p id=\"b267-10\" pgmap=\"267(94) 268(26)\">In Kerr v. Forgue, 54 Ill. 482, the court was asked to instruct the jury in the case of an injury to a boy twelve years old, that \u201c if the jury believe from the evidence that had the boy used ordinary care the injury complained of would not have happened, then, in that case, the law is for defendant,\u201d but the court modified the instruction by inserting after the word \u201c care \u201d the following: \u201c that is, such care as a boy of his age and discretion would naturally use.\u201d The Supreme Court held that the instruction as asked was not proper, and that the giving of it as modified was not error. The court say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b268-4\" pgmap=\"268\">\u201cA child can only exercise care and prudence equal to his capacity. Ordinary neglect as to a person of full age and capacity might be gross neglect as to a child. Hence the age and discretion of the child were the proper subjects of inquiry by the jury. The child is reckless and thoughtless; the man prudent and watchful.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">In C. &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Becker, 84 Ill. 483, which was an action to recover for injuries to a boy which resulted in his death, the court say :</p> <blockquote id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">\u201c While the deceased was possessed of ordinary intelligence and was capable of using as much caution for his safety as other boys of his age, yet it is not to be expected of a boy between six and seven years of age that the same caution and care will be used for personal safety as will be exercised by persons of mature age.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268\">To the same effect in principle are the cases of Ry. Co. v. Eininger, 114 Ill. 83, and City of Pekin v. McMahon, 154 Ill. 141-54, and Ry. Co. v. Ohlsson, 70 Ill. App. 487. The McMahon case reaffirms the Kerr case, supra, and the court say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268\">\u201c But where a child has passed the age of seven years, as was the case with appellee\u2019s deceased intestate, we are of the opinion that he is bound to use such care as children of liis age, capacity and intelligence are capable of exercising, and that the question whether he has done so or no.t should be submitted to the jury.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b268-9\" pgmap=\"268\">In view of the principle announced in the foregoing decisions, we are of opinion that the jury was not accurately instructed, under the evidence in the case, and that it should be submitted to another jury under instructions stating the law as above indicated.</p> <p id=\"b268-10\" pgmap=\"268\">Counsel for plaintiff in error in their briefs fail to cite any adjudication by the Supreme Court of Illinois on the question of the degree of care required of a child, and have thus imposed upon this court the labor which it has a right to expect should be performed by counsel.</p> <p id=\"b268-11\" pgmap=\"268(9) 269(34)\">Other contentions are made, which we deem it unnecessary to consider, among which is that it was error to use the word \u201c particulars \u201d in the second instruction, when the word \u201c opportunities \u201d was no doubt intended to be used.</p> <p id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">This may be avoided on another trial.</p> <p id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
