S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l) and (2), and numerous other charges. He was sentenced to a total of 49 years and assessed a Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty of $550. No period of parole ineligibility was imposed. The facts giving rise to the charges and convictions need not be recounted in detail, although some of the events must be discussed later in this opinion. Defendant\u2019s actions towards the victims can accurately be characterized as brutal physical torture, constituting both aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault and other crimes warranting the 22 convictions here under review. The repeated rape of the adult victim with various implements, the senseless beatings and torture with heated nails, and other gruesome acts place defendant beyond the pale of a decent society. These events, which took place over a three-week period while he held the victim in her apartment by threats to harm their infant daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ter, are described in detail in her testimony. By the verdict the jury obviously accepted that testimony. Defendant has raised two points on the appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Legal Issue #1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">As a matter of law, the appellant could not be found guilty of either first degree sexual assault or aggravated assault because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt with corroborating expert medical testimony the element of the offenses that the victim sustained \u2018severe personal injury\u2019 or \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14\u20141(f) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>Legal Issue #2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">The consecutive sentence imposed on the appellant was excessive and an abuse of discretion under the totality of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Defendant first claims that he should not have been convicted of first degree sexual assault or aggravated assault, since there was insufficient proof to show the victim sustained \u201csevere personal injury,\u201d or \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. 2C</em>:14-1f and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1) respectively. \u201cSevere personal injury\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1f includes the term \u201csevere bodily injury, disfigurement, disease, incapacitating mental anguish or chronic pain.\u201d \u201cSevere\u201d bodily injury is not further defined, although \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1b as \u201cbodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d It is this latter definition which is incorporated by reference in the aggravated assault section, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b, which defines the conduct constituting aggravated assault as such where an actor \u201cattempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury----\u201d Whether each actual injury is permanent is irrelevant, since attempts to cause such injury suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">In this case defendant\u2019s treatment of the victim over the three-week period can only be described as depraved. The fortunate fact that she recovered from her wounds in no way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>mitigates defendant\u2019s actions as to the sexual offenses where he clearly used \u201cphysical force or coercion and severe personal injury [was] sustained by the victim.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(6). The evidence sustained at least an inference of mental anguish, and there is no requirement of permanent bodily injury under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1f<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. After substantial testimony, verified by medical examinations, of defendant\u2019s raping the victim with a coat hanger on several occasions and a club on another and dropping heated nails on her body, including an attempt to burn her clitoris, the aggravated sexual assaults were clearly established. As to the aggravated assaults, the testimony and physical evidence of his beating the victim so fiercely about the head and face that her tongue was nearly torn from her mouth, shows either an actual \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d or at least an attempt to cause the same. Although there was no permanent loss of either of victim\u2019s sexual function or the use of her tongue or other organs, the beatings and use of heated nails among other tortures satisfied the statutory test required under both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(6) and 2C:12-1b(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Defendant also alleges that the consecutive sentences imposed were excessive under the standard of <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 644 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Yarbough v. New Jersey, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986). <em>Yarbough </em>states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">... there should be an overall outer limit on the cumulation of successive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest terms (including an extended term, if eligible) that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses. <em>[Ibid, </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">The judge here carefully analyzed the evidence of the weeks of torture and imposed consecutive sentences based upon those groupings of events which were sufficiently separate to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>consecutive sentences even under the <em>Yarbough </em>standards. Moreover, the <em>Yarbough </em>standards are not absolute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">Those separate, consecutive punishments ... would <em>typically </em>not exceed in aggregate duration, except for an habitual offender, the longest term for the two most serious offenses. [Emphasis added, 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 646].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The court specifically recognized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">... that even within the general parameters we have announced there are cases so extreme and so extraordinary that deviation from the guidelines may be called for____ We repose the paramount responsibility for fair and certain sentencing justice in our trial courts. <em>[Id. </em>at 647],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Applying these extended standards we have no difficulty sustaining the sentence, even if it slightly exceeds the maximum for the two greatest offenses. This is particularly true in the absence of a parole ineligibility term. A sentencing judge must consider the parole consequences of his sentence. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 93-94 (App.Div.1987). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-2e; 2C:44-1c(2). Here the 49-year sentence will result in less \u201creal time,\u201d if defendant earns all applicable credits, than a 40-year sentence with any parole disqualifier under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51a and b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Had there been merely the three separate incidents which are the subject of the three consecutive sentences, defendant\u2019s argument might have some merit. But considering the myriad of additional convictions with which the sentences were made concurrent and the weeks of suffering endured by the victim, the greater punishment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-11\">There is also no question that the prosecution could have been justified on a different theory, <em>i.e., </em>that defendant employed a weapon, which would have satisfied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-13\">While the issue of an ineligibility term is not before us, we believe that one would have been justified in this case. Reference to the subject is, therefore, relevant to review of a claim of excessiveness under <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>especially as to a sentence imposed before the opinion was published.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
