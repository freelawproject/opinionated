The defendant shall have exclusive possession of the marital home. The said marital home shall be sold upon the occurrence of one of the following events, whichever event shall first occur:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">a. The minor child, Stephen B. Pugh, graduates high school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-16\">b. The defendant remarries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-17\">c. The defendant lives with a non-related adult male.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Seventeen months after the divorce, plaintiff moved to sell the marital home on the ground that defendant was then living with \u201ca non-related adult male.\u201d Following a plenary hearing, the motion judge found \u201cthat there is a living together within the meaning of the property settlement agreement\u201d and that plaintiff \u201cis entitled to insist upon the sale of the former marital home.\u201d Defendant appeals from the order thereupon entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We have no difficulty in accepting the motion judge\u2019s findings of operative fact. He found that plaintiff had observed one or both of Gerald Parker\u2019s two vehicles at the marital home \u201cwhenever he has gone past the house or when he has picked up the children for visitation, be it late at night or early in the morning.\u201d Parker was also observed performing chores around the house, such as cutting the grass, and was seen late at night unloading band equipment from defendant\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Defendant acknowledged that Parker spends three out of four weekends of the month with her, usually bringing his daughter with him; she also said that on occasion Parker brings a change of clothing. The motion judge further found that Parker has his meals with defendant and her family when he is at the house and that he \u201cshowers at the home and also shaves at the home during the weekends that he is there.\u201d The proofs showed that \u201cdespite the fact that [Parker] eats his meals there and has the use of the facilities at least three nights\u2014two or three nights a week, that other than having purchased the riding mower, he makes no other contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The judge also reported his interview of the parties\u2019 son Stephen, then 14 years old. Stephen told the judge that \u201cthere was some clothes there, not much,\u201d that Parker \u201cstays there nearly each weekend\u201d and that he also \u201cstays there on other occasions, as much as one night a week.\u201d While Parker would occasionally \u201cmiss that one night a week,\u201d there were other weeks \u201cwhen he would be there for a longer period than one night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Based upon those proofs, the judge concluded that Parker \u201cis there more than three weekends a month,\u201d that \u201cthere are occasions during the week when he is there as well and that \u201cthere is more than a casual relationship here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">While those factual findings are amply supported by the record, we are satisfied that they do not warrant the conclusion that defendant \u201clives with a non-related adult male\u201d within the meaning of the property settlement agreement. To be sure, defendant and Parker spend substantial time together at the former marital home and it can be assumed that they enjoy a sexual relationship. But they are not continuously together, nor do they hold themselves out or conduct themselves as husband and wife. They have not established a single economic or domestic unit. Parker maintains a separate residence where he spends significant time and where he maintains custody of his own minor child. He keeps most of his clothing at his own residence. There is no suggestion that either defendant or Parker has assumed a parental role or responsibility with respect to the other\u2019s children. Excepting for the fact that Parker does some household chores and eats meals with defendant when he stays with her, there is no evidence that either he or defendant is financially contributing to or benefitting from the other. All of those facts point strongly toward a conclusion that defendant is not \u201cliving with\u201d Parker. <em>See, e.g., Beck v. Beck, </em>286 <em>Ala. </em>692, 246 So.2d 420, 428 (1971); <em>Littlefield v. Littlefield, </em>292 A.2d 204, 211 n. 3 (Me.1972); <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>122 Misc.2d 849, 472 N.Y.S.2d 550 (1984); <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>11 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>279, 465 <em>N.E.2d </em>476, 477-478 (1983); <em>Fuller v. Fuller, </em>10 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>253, 461 <em>N.E.2d </em>1348 (1983); <em>In re Marriage of Vasconcellos, </em>58 <em>Or.App. </em>390, 648 P.2d 1358 (1982); <em>In re Marriage of Desler, </em>56 <em>Or.App. </em>812, 643 P.2d 655 (1982); <em>Weseman v. Weseman, </em>51 <em>Or.App. </em>675, 626 P.2d 942, 944 rev. den. 291 <em>Or. </em>118, 631 P.2d 341 (1981). <em>Cf. Kaplan v. Kaplan, </em>186 <em>Conn. </em>387, 441 A.2d 629 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Whether this mix of facts should require the sale of the former marital home is a question of contract interpretation: namely, what did the parties intend to accomplish by including paragraph 19c in their agreement? Plaintiff testified that he \u201chad strong religious objections to my wife residing with a nonrelated adult male,\u201d that he regarded it as \u201cvery possible\u201d that his wife would do so \u201cand that was the reason we included it in the divorce settlement.\u201d Defendant gave a quite different explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">My understanding at the time of the divorce and the only reason that I agreed to that section in the divorce hearing was the fact that I thought it meant that I would move a nonrelated male\u2014that I would not marry him, move him into my home, live with him, be supported by him, and have him be a major factor in my children\u2019s lives which Gerald is not. And excuse me, that he would reside there night and day, 24 hours a day, get up and go to work from there, come home from work, and live in a situation as if we were man and wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The judge did not resolve this conflict in the testimony nor did he state any conclusions as to the meaning or intent of the contract language.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">We are disinclined to apply the contract language in a way which conflicts with our stated public policy to guarantee individual privacy, autonomy, and the right to develop personal relationships. <em>See Gayet v. Gayet, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>149, 151 (1983). The contract is ambiguous; it need not, and should not, be read to require the sale of the former marital residence simply because defendant has adopted a particular lifestyle. Read reasonably in light of our public policy, the agreement should be regarded as having principally an economic purpose, that is, to assure that plaintiff\u2019s interest in the former marital home is not used to subsidize defendant\u2019s relationship with a male cohabitant. As <em>Gayet </em>put it in a cognate setting, the test is whether \u201cone cohabitant supports or subsidizes the other under circumstance es sufficient to entitle the supporting spouse to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">So tested, the facts found by the motion judge do not warrant the conclusion that defendant \u201clives with\u201d Parker. There is no showing of support or subsidization or of any change in defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ant\u2019s economic needs or resources resulting from her relationship with Parker. Nor is there any showing that the relationship with Parker has in any other way materially affected defendant\u2019s use of or her need for the former marital home. Given those circumstances, we conclude that the property settlement agreement does not require the sale of the house at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The February 13, 1986 order is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
