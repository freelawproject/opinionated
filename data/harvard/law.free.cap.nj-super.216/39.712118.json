A jury returned guilty verdicts on counts two and three and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the lesser included offense of simple assault on count one. Defendant appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">POINT I The trial court erred in denying the Defendant\u2019s motion to acquit him of the charges of aggravated assault and aggravated sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">POINT II The trial court committed plain error when it did not sua sponte [sic] strike part of the Prosecutor\u2019s inflammatory summary [sic] argument which referred to the Defendant as a professional rapist. (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">POINT III The trial court erred in not granting a mistrial or temporarily halting the proceedings for a private psychiatric examination of the Defendant when the Defendant experienced a mental breakdown during his counsel\u2019s summation. (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The only issue requiring discussion is defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to acquit addressed to the charge of aggravated sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The State introduced evidence to establish that defendant entered an office building in Bloomfield, New Jersey during regular business hours. The victim was an employee of a firm occupying the building. As the victim emerged from a women\u2019s restroom into the public hallway, she was confronted by defendant. He pushed her into the restroom, punched and threatened her and committed an act of sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Defendant conceded having had sexual contact with the victim but testified that she approached him, a stranger, in the hallway and invited him into the restroom for a consensual sexual adventure. The jury resolved the credibility issue in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Sexual penetration constitutes aggravated sexual assault if the actor uses physical force or coercion \u201cand severe personal injury is sustained by the victim.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2 a.(6). Severe personal injury is defined as \u201csevere bodily injury, disfigurement, disease, incapacitating mental anguish or chronic pain.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1 f. The theory of the State\u2019s case is that the victim sustained incapacitating mental anguish (sometimes hereinafter referred to as IMA) as a result of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Defendant contends that the evidence was inadequate to establish that the victim sustained IMA. Specifically, it is contended that the testimony of an expert, presumably a psychiatrist or a psychologist, is necessary to prove that the victim sustained IMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Chapter 14 of the N.J.Code of Criminal Justice does not define incapacitating mental anguish. In the absence of statutory definition, words are to be given their ordinary and well understood meaning. <em>In re Barnert Memorial Hospital Rates, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>31 (1983). A dictionary defines \u201canguish\u201d as \u201cextreme pain either of body or mind\u201d and \u201cexcruciating distress.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1971). In a personal injury context mental anguish was defined as \u201cthe mental suffering resulting from emotions such as grief and despair.\u201d <em>Martin v. U.S., </em>448 <em>F.Supp. 855, </em>876 (E.D.Ark.1977), modified on other grounds, 586 <em>F.2d </em>1206 (8th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Other jurisdictions have construed similar terms in the context of sexual offense statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Michigan, the element of mental anguish elevates a sexual assault to a first degree crime. <em>M.S.A. </em>\u00a7 28.788(2)(1)(f) [M.C.L.A. \u00a7 750.520b(1)(f) ] and <em>M.S.A. </em>\u00a7 28.788(1)(j) [M.C.L.A. \u00a7 750.520a(j) ]. The Michigan Supreme Court in <em>People v. Petrella, </em>424 <em>Mich. </em>221, 380 <em>N.W.</em>2d 11 (1985), resolved a conflict within the Michigan Court of Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it defined mental anguish as \u201cextreme or excru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>dating pain, distress, or suffering of the mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424 <em>Mich. </em>257, 380 <em>N.W.2d </em>27. The Michigan statute does not require mental anguish to be incapacitating.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Under New Mexico statutes, criminal sexual penetration is elevated from third degree to second degree if the use of force or coercion results in mental anguish. N.M.S.A.-1953 \u00a7 40A-9-21 B.(2) and <em>N.M.S.A. </em>1953 \u00a7 40A-9-20 C. <em>State v. Jiminez, </em>89 <em>N.M. </em>652, 556 P.2d 60 (Ct. of Appeals, 1976) held that mental anguish means distress of the mind.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We recognize that mental anguish is a boundary between a crime which carries a ten year maximum sentence and a crime which doubles that exposure. We are satisfied that, in the context of the New Jersey statutory scheme, mental anguish means <em>severe </em>emotional distress or suffering. This definition is consistent with the ordinary and common understanding of the words used and is consistent with the operative adjective in the statutory element of severe personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Incapacitating mental anguish is one component of the statutory definition of \u201csevere personal injury\u201d. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1 f. That definition also includes \u201csevere bodily injury, disfigurement, disease ... or chronic pain.\u201d Of these components, only mental anguish must be incapacitating. \u201cIncapable\u201d is defined as \u201cnot able or fit for the doing or performance <em>...\u201d </em>and \u201cincapacity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe state of being incapable\u201d as well as a \u201clack of physical or intellectual power____\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1971). In the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation \u201cincapacity\u201d means \u201cinability to perform labor.\u201d <em>Yeomans v. Jersey City, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>496, 508 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is probable that most rapes cause the victim to suffer emotional distress. The requirement that mental anguish be incapacitating accomplishes two goals. It provides corroboration that the victim\u2019s distress is severe, and it justifies greater punishment. With these legislative purposes in mind, and consistent with the ordinary and common understanding of the words used, we define incapacitating mental anguish as severe emotional distress or suffering which results in a temporary or permanent inability of the victim to function in some significant aspect of her life, such as in her employment, her ability to care for herself or in her capacity as spouse, homemaker or mother. In this context, temporary incapacity means more than a mere fleeting, short-lived or brief incapacity. Were it otherwise almost every sexual assault in which the actor uses physical force or coercion to commit an act of penetration would be a first degree crime. Such is not the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2 c(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The victim\u2019s testimony would support a finding that immediately after the attack she was unable \u201cto sleep for about four days, day or night\u201d, that she was \u201cvery angry ... very hostile\u201d toward her husband, that she could not concentrate on her work, that she could not stop crying and that she was unable to return to work until July 19, 1983 when she returned to work on a part-time basis. The offense occurred on April 27, 1983. She also testified that until the middle of July she was afraid to leave her home and did not do so except to attend counselling sessions and to visit her brother. The victim did not return to full time employment until early September.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Her counselor, Beverly Lanty, a registered nurse and social worker with substantial credentials and experience in the fields of nursing, social work and marital and family therapy, met with the victim on May 5, 1983, eight days after the assault. Ms. Lanty testified that the victim was shaking, crying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>manifesting difficulty in speaking. She described the victim as looking very tired, depressed, and in a state of shock.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Defendant contends that Ms. Lanty was testifying beyond her expertise. We disagree. Her testimony related to the jury her observations of the victim and the victim\u2019s demeanor. A witness need not be an expert to make and describe these observations. Moreover, Ms. Lanty\u2019s observations were within the ambit of her education, training and work experience. Therefore, she had the necessary expertise, if any was required, to make those observations. Furthermore, Ms. Lanty did not render an opinion as to whether the victim sustained incapacitating mental anguish nor was such an opinion from an expert necessary to support this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Expert testimony is required if the issue to be decided \u201cis so esoteric that jurors of common judgment and experience cannot form a valid judgment ...\u201d <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 283 (1982). Expert testimony is justified when the average juror \u201cis relatively helpless in dealing with a subject that is not a matter of common knowledge.\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 209 (1984). In <em>Kelly, </em>the court held that an understanding of the battered woman\u2019s syndrome is beyond the ken of the average juror. But, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">No expert is needed, however, ... to tell the jury the logical conclusion ... that a person who has in fact been severely and continuously beaten might very well reasonably fear that the imminent beating she was about to suffer could be either life threatening or pose a risk of serious injury. <em>[Id. </em>at 207]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In the ease at bar, the victim described the impact of the rape upon her. It was for the jury to decide whether the description was credible. If the jury accepted the victim\u2019s version of the incident and the physical and emotional abuse she sustained during the incident, that version would support a finding of a nexus between the rape and the victim\u2019s post-rape emotional state as described by her and as corroborated by Ms. Lanty. Those findings are within the common experience and knowledge of the average juror as is the ultimate conclusion that the victim suffered mental anguish (severe emotional distress) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>which resulted in a temporary inability of the victim to function as an employee, as a spouse and in other significant aspects of her life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The remaining issues raised by the defendant are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Six other states have statutes which consider the impact of a sex crime on the victim\u2019s mental or emotional health in determining the severity of the offense. 11 <em>Del.Code Ann., </em>\u00a7 764; <em>Mich.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 28.788(1)(j) [M.C.L.A. \u00a7 750.520a(j) ]; <em>Minn.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 609.341(8); <em>Neb.Rev.Stat., </em>\u00a7 28.318(3); <em>N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 632-A 1 (III); <em>N.M.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 30-9-10(B)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\"><em>People v.
