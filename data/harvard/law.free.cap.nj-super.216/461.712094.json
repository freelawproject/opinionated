Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Memorandum 85-259, issued by Police Director Knox on December 10, 1985, reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">1. Narcotic enforcement is the most sensitive and health threatening assignment in policing today. It exposes the Police Officer to certain health hazards that are not necessarily encountered in normal patrol work. The advent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, commonly referred to as AIDS, is a prime example of a real health threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">2. Secondly, Narcotic enforcement is, by its very nature, a sensitive assignment, requiring the highest degree in confidence. Confidence is the key to narcotic investigations; it is not only the trust between the investigator and an informant, it is also faith in performance, ability and the manner in which laws are enforced. Police Officers should bear in mind that they symbolize the dignity and authority of the Law. It is a harsh reality that we, as Police Officers, must maintain standards of conduct that are above that which is expected of the average citizen in order that we maintain the confidence and trust of the public that we serve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">3. These dual concerns, the health of the employee and the trust of the public is of paramount concern to this Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">4. Effective 0001 hours, December 12th, 1985, all members of the Narcotic Bureau shall be required to take a urinalysis and blood test. Furthermore, any transfer into the Unit shall be predicated upon a successful urinalysis and blood test. Any request of transfer to the Narcotic Bureau shall be forwarded with the understanding that a urinalysis exam and blood test is required as part of the assignment, both upon transfer and at least twice a year afterwards. These exams are to be administered to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">a. Health deficiencies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">b. Substance abuse</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">5. Furthermore, all such testing shall be conducted under the supervision of the Police Surgeon or his representative and the Internal Affairs Bureau. All results are to be confidential and forwarded to the Police Director for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">The Memorandum was delivered to plaintiff Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) on December 12, 1985. Narcotic Bureau officers reporting for duty that afternoon were ordered to provide urine specimens. This action was filed on December 13, 1985. The City was immediately enjoined from any further implementation of the Memorandum; the injunction remained effective throughout the trial proceedings and has been continued pending disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The genesis and intended operation of the Memorandum were described by Director Knox in an affidavit. Director Knox was \u201cconcerned ... with drug abuse among members of the Police Department\u201d and also \u201cwith the public perception with respect to the drug abuse among members of the Police Department.\u201d His concern resulted from his \u201cawareness of the extent and seriousness of the problem of drug abuse in society in general, and in Newark in particular, as well as the results of recent urine testing of Police Department recruits[.]\u201d He asserted that the testing of two recent classes of recruits \u201cyielded 5 positive tests for such substances as cocaine, heroin, morphine and barbituates.\u201d Director Knox continued that \u201c[p]ublic confidence ... is crucial to effective law enforcement\u201d; such confidence \u201cdepends on credibility and the urine testing contemplated by Memorandum 85-259 will go a long way toward reinforcing credibility.\u201d In addition, the tests were intended \u201cto serve the interests of public safety and effective law enforcement by deterring drug use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In a deposition, Director Knox also said that he had received \u201c[s]pecific information from citizens in the community and also from street people\u201d about police officers using controlled dangerous substances, including allegations against two Narcotic Bureau officers. He said he had received information from two commanding officers about the same Narcotic Bureau officers. However, Director Knox said the information received from the commanding officers did not play any role in his issuance of the directive: \u201cI intended to test members of this police department anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As to the intended operation of the tests, Director Knox set forth in his affidavit that the procedures to be used \u201care the same as those already utilized in testing recruits.\u201d Samples would be field-tested first \u201cusing the EMIT urine screening program.\u201d Those samples which test positive would be forwarded for laboratory testing. All test results would be \u201cconfidential,\u201d but police officers for whom positive samples are found \u201cwill be charged as set forth in the rules and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>tions.\u201d However, test results \u201cwill not be made known to the prosecutor and no criminal charges will be brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The issues were presented to the trial judge on the pleadings, affidavits and deposition testimony. In an unreported opinion, the judge concluded that mandatory urine monitoring constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the New Jersey and United States Constitutions but that \u201cthere are no constitutional inhibitions against the Director\u2019s basic power to issue Memorandum 85-259.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge ordered a hearing, however, \u201con whether the means of enforcing the Director\u2019s order are calculated to show accurately the presence of controlled dangerous substances in the urine, and also whether the tests will be conducted with a minimum possible invasion of the police officer\u2019s personalty and privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On June 16, 1986, the trial judge entered final judgment ordering, among other things, that \u201cthe acquisition of urine and the testing of urine, if conducted, shall be conducted in accordance with the Methods and Procedures for Urine/Drug Screening\u201d incorporated in the judgment. Those methods and procedures are set forth in Appendix A attached to this opinion. Plaintiffs appeal from that judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention here, as in the trial court, is that drug/urine testing as authorized by Memorandum 85-259 would constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of Article 1,117 of the New Jersey Constitution and also of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, both of which direct that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The City does not dispute plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a govern-mentally compelled taking of urine is both a \u201csearch\u201d and a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the constitutional provisions. That proposition is uniformly recognized in the reported cases. <em>See e.g. McDonell v. Hunter, </em>809 F.2d 1302 (8th Cir.1987); <em>Shoemaker v. Handel, </em>795 <em>F.2d </em>1136 (3d Cir.1986), <em>cert. den. </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>577, 93 L.Ed.2d 580 (1986); <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employers Union v. Von Raab, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>380, 387 (E.D.La.1986); <em>Capua v. City of Plainfield, </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>1507, 1513 (D.N.J.1986); <em>Allen v. City of Marietta, </em>601 <em>F.Supp. </em>482, 488-489 (N.D.Ga.1985); <em>Storms v. Coughlin, </em>600 <em>F.Supp. </em>1214, 1218 (S.D.N.Y.1984); <em>City of Palm Bay v. Bauman, </em>475 So.2d 1322, 1324 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985); <em>Caruso v. Ward, </em>133 Misc.2d 544, 506 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>789, 792 (Sup.Ct.1986). The parties thus properly frame the issue as being whether the search and seizure authorized by the Memorandum would be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">We start with the principles that a search or seizure based upon a warrant supported by probable cause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is \u201cpresumed to be valid\u201d <em>(State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133 (1983)), and that a warrantless search is <em>\u201cprima facie </em>invalid unless it comes within one of the specific exceptions to the warrant requirement\u201d of the constitutional provisions. <em>State v. Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>132, 141 (1981). <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>347, 357, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>88 <em>S.Ct. </em>507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). We conclude that the searches and seizures contemplated by the Memorandum do not come within any \u201cspecific exception\u201d to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Many of the exceptions to the warrant requirement nevertheless require a showing of probable cause. See, <em>e.g., Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 136 (warrantless search permissible upon showing of exigent circumstances and probable cause); <em>State v. Martin, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 567 (warrantless search of automobile permissible if based on probable cause); <em>Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 142, n. 4 (an arrest made upon probable cause allows a warrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person and immediate vicinity). Other warrantless searches or seizures are lawful on a showing of some individualized suspicion less than probable cause. See, <em>e.g., New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>325, 342, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 744, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (warrantless school search will ordinarily pass constitutional muster \u201cwhen there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school\u201d); <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>648, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1391, 59 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 660 (1979) (discretionary automobile stops require \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d); <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>873, 881, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2574, 2580, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (roving-patrol automobile stops in border areas are permissible \u201cwhen an officer\u2019s observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country____\u201d); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (warrantless \u201cstop and frisk\u201d sustainable upon a showing that \u201ca reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger\u201d); <em>United States v. Bunkers, </em>521 <em>F.</em>2d 1217 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 423 <em>U.S. </em>989, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 46 L.Ed.2d 307 (1975) (warrantless search by postal inspector of employee\u2019s locker was justified by showing of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity); <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 504 (1986) (investigatory stop by police only valid if officer has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>particularized suspicion); <em>State v. Adams, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>587, 598-600 (App.Div.1973) (warrantless search at airport upheld where traveler fit skyjacker profile, set off magnometer and pat-down search uncovered suspicious bulge). None of those \u201cspecific exceptions\u201d to the warrant requirement serves to validate the Memorandum, which concededly does not condition urine testing on either probable cause or any individualized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The City seeks to bring the proposed testing within the \u201cpervasively regulated industry\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, which permits certain warrantless searches and seizures without either probable cause or individualized suspicion. Administrative searches, <em>i.e., </em>those conducted to enforce a regulatory scheme, are subject to the Fourth Amendment and commonly require the issuance of a warrant. <em>See Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>307, 323-324, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1816, 1825-26, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>305 (1978); <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>541, 545-546, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1737, 1740, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967); <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>523, 534-535, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1727, 1733-34, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). However, private commercial property utilized in a pervasively regulated industry may be inspected without a warrant and without individualized suspicion. <em>See Donovan v. Dewey, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>594, 599-602, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2534, 2538-39, 69 L.Ed.2d 262 (1981); <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>311, 315-317, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1593, 1596-97, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972); <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>72, 76-77, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>774, 776-77, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970). Persons associated with such an industry may also be subjected to a warrantless search, at least while on the commercial premises. <em>In re Martin, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>295, 313-314 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The City principally relies on <em>Shoemaker, </em>which upheld regulations of the New Jersey Racing Commission permitting alcohol and drug testing of jockeys and other licensed persons without probable cause or reasonable individualized suspicion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>795 <em>F.</em>2d at 1142. Noting that the licensees had always been aware that they were subject to \u201cintense state regulation,\u201d the court found that the regulatory interest in protecting both the wagering public and the public justified the testing requirements. The court took pains to point out, however, that its holding applies only to testing of \u201cvoluntary participants in a highly-regulated industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1142 n. 5. See <em>Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power District, </em>653 <em>F.Supp. </em>1510 (D.Neb.1987) (random drug screening of public utility employees upheld under the rationale of <em>Shoemaker).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Police officers are not members of a \u201chighly-regulated industry.\u201d Like many other groups of public employees, police officers are subject to a variety of statutory and administrative controls.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But government\u2019s supervision of its employees cannot be equated with the regulation of sensitive industries requiring \u201cclose supervision and inspection,'\u2019 <em>See, e.g., In re Martin, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 312-313. Police are not engaged in a \u201ccommercial enterprise\u201d <em>(cf. Donovan, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>at 599, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2538); they are not subject to a \u201ccomprehensive and defined\u201d regulatory scheme in which drug testing is a \u201cnecessary component\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 600, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2538); there has been no legislative determination \u201cthat warrantless searches are necessary to further a regulatory scheme[.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>To treat the police as a \u201cpervasively regulated industry\u201d would dangerously extend and distort that exception to the warrant requirement beyond its intended scope. We thus find ourselves in agreement with the many courts which have found <em>Shoemaker </em>inapplicable to or distinguishable from cases involving public employees. See, <em>e.g., American Fed. of Gov\u2019t. Employees, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>AFL-CIO v. Weinberger, </em>651 <em>F.Supp. </em>726, 734-35 (S.D.Ga.1986); <em>Caruso, </em>506 N.Y.S.2d at 798.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Since the contemplated warrantless drug testing does not fit within any \u201cspecial exception\u201d to the warrant requirement, we must regard the Memorandum as <em>\u201cprima facie </em>invalid.\u201d <em>Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 141. Defendants accordingly \u201cmust prove the overall reasonableness and validity of the search\u201d and seizures they propose. <em>Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Reasonableness is not easy to assess or describe. As Justice (now Chief Justice) Rehnquist said in <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>520, 559, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1861, 1884, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>447 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlV\">Specific applications of those general principles can be found in the decided cases. As to the \u201cneed for the particular search,\u201d the \u201csubstantiality of the public interest\u201d in the challenged practice must be assessed. <em>See Donovan, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>at 602, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2539; <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>543, 556, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3074, 3082, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976). A closely allied inquiry is whether the particular law enforcement technique at issue is needed. <em>See Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 562, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3085; <em>State v. Kirk, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 55 (App.Div.1985). The availability and practicality of alternative means of investigating the asserted evil is also of significance. <em>See, e.g., Bell, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>at 559, n. 40, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1885, n. 40; <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 556 n. 12, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3082 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Such public interest considerations must be weighed against a variety of private interests of the persons subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the warrantless search or seizure. Of primary concern, of course, is the degree of personal intrusion which the investigatory procedure involves. <em>See, e.g., Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 557-558, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3082-83. Implicated in that inquiry are such questions as whether the intrusion is for regulatory or other civil purposes, or to discover contraband or evidence of crime <em>(see, e.g., Donovan, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>at 598-599, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537-38; <em>Kirk, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 55); whether the intrusion involves a search or only an inquiry <em>(see, e.g., Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 565, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3086), and whether the intrusion is of the person <em>(see, e.g., Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490) or a residence <em>(see, e.g., Camara, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>at 530-531, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1731-32) or an automobile <em>(see, e.g., Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 545-546, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3077), or commercial premises <em>(see, e.g., See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>at 543-544, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1739). In evaluating the personal intrusion, the fact that it occurs without any individualized suspicion weighs heavily against a finding of reasonableness. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 560, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3084, \u201csome quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure.\u201d <em>See also T.L.O., </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>at 342 n. 8, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 744 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In a welter of recent cases, courts throughout the country have been called upon to weigh the competing public and private interests in drug/urine testing of public employees. Virtually all of the reported cases have concluded that such testing is unconstitutional in the absence of some reasonable individualized suspicion. <em>See American Fed. of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, </em>651 <em>F.Supp. </em>726 (Department of Defense civilian police officers); <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 387 (customs service workers); <em>Penny v.

Other cases have upheld urine testing where the employer had reasonable individualized suspicion of drug use. <em>Everett v. Napper, </em>632 <em>F.Supp. </em>1481 (N.D.Ga.1986) (fire fighter); <em>Allen, </em>601 <em>F.Supp. </em>482 (municipal utility employees); <em>Div. 241 Amalgamated Transit Union v. Suscy, </em>538 F.2d 1264 (7th Cir.1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 429 <em>U.S. </em>1029, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>653, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976) (municipal bus drivers); <em>Turner v.

All recognize that a public employer has an important and legitimate interest in assuring that its employees abstain from drug use because drug use can impair job performance and put the public at risk. <em>McDonell, </em>809 F.2d at 1308; <em>Div. 241 Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>538 F.2d at 1267; <em>Penny, </em>648 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 817; <em>Lovvorn, </em>647 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 879; <em>Capua, </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1516-1517; <em>Everett, </em>632 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1485-1486; <em>Turner, </em>500 A.2d at 1008; <em>City of Palm Bay, </em>475 So.2d at 1326; <em>Caruso, </em>506 N.Y.S.2d at 793; <em>Patchogue-Medford Congress, </em>505 N.Y.S.2d at 891. <em>See Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 387; <em>Jones, </em>628 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1508. Moreover, a public employee must be regarded as having a diminished expectation of privacy in his or her role as an employee. <em>Lovvorn, </em>647 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 880; <em>Turner, </em>500 A.2d at 1008; <em>City of Palm Bay, </em>475 So.2d at 1324; <em>Caruso, </em>506 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d at 793. On the other hand, mandatory urine testing involves a highly intrusive procedure which carries a variety of consequences and risks for the persons tested. <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 387; <em>Lovvorn, </em>647 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 880; <em>Capua, </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1514; <em>Caruso, </em>506 N.Y.S.2d at 792. In weighing the public need against the private intrusion, the courts are persuaded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>absence of a factual showing that drug use is widespread among the affected employees or that it presents an identifiable risk to the public. See <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>649 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 390; <em>Lovvorn, </em>647 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 882; <em>Penny, </em>648 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 816-817; <em>Capua, </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1516; <em>City of Palm Bay, </em>475 So.2d at 1325; <em>Caruso, </em>506 N.Y.S.2d at 795, 799; <em>Patchogue-Medford Congress, </em>505 N.Y.S.2d at 891. The reasonable individualized suspicion test fairly accommodates the legitimate interest of employee privacy without unduly restricting the public employer\u2019s opportunity to monitor and control the use of drugs by its employees. <em>See Penny, </em>648 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 817; <em>Lovvorn, </em>647 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 883; <em>Capua, </em>643 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1518; <em>Caruso, </em>506 N.Y.S.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Our research has disclosed only three cases which uphold drug/urine tests of public employees without any showing of reasonable individualized suspicion. In <em>McDonell v. Hunter, </em>the court held that corrections officers may be subjected to urinalysis \u201cperformed uniformly or by systematic random selection of those employees who have regular contact with the prisoners on a day-to-day basis in medium or maximum security prisons.\u201d (809 F.2d at 1308). In <em>Mack v. United States, </em>653 <em>F.Supp. </em>70 (S.D.N.Y.1986), the court held that the FBI could lawfully require plaintiff, an FBI agent, to submit to urinalysis; although the FBI apparently had some individualized suspicion of plaintiff, Judge Leval did not determine or rest his decision on the reasonableness of that suspicion. And in <em>Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power District, </em>653 <em>F.Supp. </em>1510, the court held that annual and random drug screening of public utility employees who had access to \u201cvital areas\u201d of a nuclear power plant was reasonable. Both <em>McDonell </em>and <em>Mack </em>were based in part on findings that the testing was a modest invasion of privacy. In <em>Rushton </em>the court emphasized the diminished expectation of the employees who were already subject to random pat-downs, electronic searches for explosives or metal objects and constant surveillance. However, in all three cases the courts found that the public need for such testing, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>not specifically proved, was sufficiently compelling to justify the intrusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Based upon the present record and in light of the authorities discussed, we conclude that the drug/urine testing authorized by Memorandum 85-259 without probable cause or reasonable individualized suspicion is unreasonable and thus constitutionally invalid. Without repeating all that other courts have said about the nature of urine testing, we find that such testing constitutes a significant interference with personal privacy and autonomy. Government monitoring of urine involves an intrusion upon a most private kind of conduct. Both in concept and in practice, that intrusion is profoundly demeaning. Drug testing here also has serious pragmatic implications, including loss of employment and possible criminal prosecution. The protectible privacy interests of plaintiffs are thus very substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The City surely has an important and legitimate interest in assuring that its Narcotic Bureau personnel are drug free. The record, however, does not indicate that drug use within the Narcotic Bureau, or indeed among police officers generally, is extensive or that the public is presently endangered by drug use among police officers. In promulgating the Memorandum, Director Knox pointed only to five positive tests among two recent classes of recruits. He offered no specific evidence of drug use among regular police officers; his laconic references to information received about two Narcotic Bureau officers suggests that possible drug use can effectively be explored by reliance on reasonable individualized suspicion. His principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>justifications for his directive were simply that testing would enhance \u201c[pjublic confidence,\u201d \u201cgo a long way toward reinforcing credibility\u201d of the police department and \u201cserve the interests of public safety and effective law enforcement by deterring drug use.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">While those are proper goals, urine testing without reasonable individualized suspicion is not a proper means to attain them. The abstract interest in enhancing \u201cpublic confidence\u201d is not of sufficient weight to justify sacrificing the palpable privacy interests of police officers. And surely the general public interest in enforcing drug laws cannot be permitted to set at naught the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Our weighing of the public and private interests is supported by the Law Enforcement Drug Screening Guidelines promulgated by Attorney General W. Cary Edwards on October 22, 1986, just after this matter was argued before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Attorney General Edwards there set forth drug testing guidelines which he urged be adopted by all law enforcement agencies in New Jersey. Under those guidelines, police trainees \u201cshould be subjected to unannounced drug testing by urinalysis during mandatory basic training\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Permanently appointed law enforcement officers should be required to undergo further mandatory drug screening whenever there is individualized reasonable suspicion to believe that the officer is unlawfully using drugs. Officers should be tested under these circumstances only with the approval of the county prosecutor or chief executive officer of the department or his designee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s guidelines are based upon recommendations of the New Jersey Criminal Justice Advisory Council, which the Attorney General had commissioned to \u201cthoroughly research current drug screening programs, existing drug testing technology, and the financial and operational impact of drug testing upon the law enforcement community.\u201d The Council urged that \u201ca veteran officer should be tested when there is individualized reasonable suspicion to suspect that he is using illegal drugs.\u201d That recommendation was based upon the Council\u2019s finding that \u201creliable data with respect to the percentage of law enforcement officers who use drugs is non-existent\u201d and thus random drug testing of law enforcement officers \u201ccannot be justified by conclusive evidence of their widespread illicit drug use.\u201d Random drug testing, the Council concluded, \u201csignificantly diminishes morale and ultimately invades the privacy of the overwhelming number of officers who do not use drugs in order to identify those few who do.\u201d Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">[t]he Council believes that objective indications of drug use will adequately identify those law enforcement officers who use illegal drugs. Specific objective factors such as absenteeism, deterioration of work habits, chronic lateness, and confidential information as to illegal drug use constitute reasonable objective bases or reasonable suspicion to suspect that urinalysis will produce evidence of illegal drug use. (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">While the recommendations of the Council and the Attorney General do not address the constitutional question and in any event are not binding on us, they do reinforce our own conclusion from this record that the public interest does not require police officers to be subjected to the drug testing envisioned by Memorandum 85-259. That testing, we hold, is an unreasonable search and seizure and thus unconstitutional.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Our holding is based exclusively on Article I, U 7 of the New Jersey Constitution. While we like to believe that the United States Supreme Court would reach the same result as a matter of federal constitutional law, we offer no such prediction. <em>See State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 284-285 (1986). Our state constitution protects fundamental rights independently of the United States Constitution and has often been construed, particularly in recent years, as providing greater protection to our citizens\u2019 individual rights than accorded them under the federal constitution. <em>See State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 522-524 (1986). In particular, our state constitution has been found to afford greater protection against unreasonable searches and seizures than may be required by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95 (1987); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>338 (1982); <em>State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211 (1981); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">To be sure, \u201cthe discovery of unique individual rights in a state constitution does not spring from pure intuition but, rather, from a process that is reasonable and reasoned.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 367 (Handler, J., concurring). We find ample grounds here to resort to the state constitution. The case implicates important personal rights of public employers and employees of this State. <em>Cf. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 146; <em>Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 285; <em>Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 366 (Handler J., concurring). State law, tradition and policy have long given privacy invasions a degree of protection beyond that afforded by the federal constitution. <em>Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 146; <em>Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 370-372 (Handler, J., concurring). There is clearly a necessity for our giving firm guidance to our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>public employers and employees and to limit the prospect of disarray in decisional treatment of the question. <em>Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 285-286. Finally, failure to rest our decision on state law might lead to needless <em>review </em>in the United States Supreme Court, and could in fact require, in some cases, subsequent redundant proceedings in our own courts. <em>Id. </em>at 286. Those considerations, we find justify characterizing the drug/urine testing authorized by Memorandum 85-259 as an unreasonable search and seizure within the meaning of Article I, If 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The final judgment is accordingly reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for the entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion. The Law Division shall also address the Second Count of the complaint insofar as it asserts a claim for damages under 42 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 arising from the urine tests taken prior to the entry of the restraints. The trial judge found it unnecessary to address that claim in light of his finding that Memorandum 85-259 was facially constitutional. There is no merit to defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs had abandoned the claim: the final judgment unequivocally states that plaintiffs had withdrawn only claims relating \u201cto the acquisition and testing of blood samples pursuant to Memorandum 85-259.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">METHODS AND PROCEDURES FOR URINE/DRUG SCREENING</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">I.

These drugs shall not be considered inclusive or exclusive. Certain drug \u201cfads\u201d or custom-made drugs may cause an adjustment in the menu of the drug screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">B. Monitoring Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The Internal Affairs Bureau is the sole unit which may conduct urine acquisition. The Internal Affairs Bureau shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">1. Designate a superior officer from the Internal Affairs Bureau to supervise all urine acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">2. Ensure that one member of the Internal Affairs Bureau together with the Police Surgeon or one other medical person shall witness all voids. The Internal Affairs Bureau representative is considered the official monitor. The presence of the Police Surgeon or one other medical person is mandatory throughout all steps of the urine collection process. No voiding shall occur in the absence of the Police Surgeon or other medical person unless the employee specifically requests in writing that the Police Surgeon or other medical person not witness the void.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">3. Ensure that the Monitor is of the same sex as the employee voiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">4. Inspect for accuracy, prior to the time of voiding, all written submissions, such as identification numbers, la-belling requirements, lab analysis request forms, etc. as set forth in Section D below.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">5. Inspect specimen bottles prior to the time of voiding for signs of apparent pre-voiding tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">6. Prepare and retain a log identifying by name and rank of all members of the Internal Affairs Bureau who are present during the urine acquisition process, the name, address and phone number of all medical persons present during the urine acquisition process and the identification number of all police officers employee tested. The Internal Affairs Bureau shall provide the president of the F.O.P. Lodge No. 12 with a copy of this log within twenty-four (24) hours of urine acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">C. Time and Place of Sampling</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">1. The Internal Affairs Bureau is responsible for scheduling urine acquisition with the approval of the Police Director or the Chief of Police, during a scheduled tour of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">2. Screening shall be conducted as a group, either by squad, organized unit, shift, etc. except in situations in which there are staggered work schedules or an individual is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>not present when his group is tested which in that event the individual(s) will be tested in a subsequent group screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">3. The location for the actual voiding must be in a recognized restroom. For screening of members of the Narcotic Bureau, the restroom in the Captain\u2019s office shall be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">4. Only the Internal Affairs Bureau representative, the Police Surgeon or one other medical person, and the person voiding shall be present in the restroom and the Internal Affairs Bureau shall take all precautions or actions necessary to ensure that the act of voiding shall not be within the view of any person(s) other than the monitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">D. Sampling Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">1. The employees submitting the urine sample shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">a. Print his/her employee serial number from his/her identification card in the area designated for \u201cpatient\u2019s name\u201d and the date on the pre-attached label of the specimen bottle prior to voiding. No employee names are to be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-12\">b. Print his/her employee serial number from his/her identification card in the area designated for \u201cpatient\u2019s name\u201d and the date on the lab request form (Chain of Custody Request Form) prior to voiding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">c. Void fifty (50) mL of urine in the specimen bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">d. Secure the cap of the specimen bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">e. Wrap evidence tape around the specimen bottle, starting at the top of the bottle and continuing down one side and up the opposite side so the evidence tape overlaps the top or starting point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">f. Place the lab request form (Chain of Custody Request Form) in a plastic bag along with the specimen bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">g.

Ensure all samples are intact prior to relinguishing control to courier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">h. Maintain all results of urinalysis as confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">IV. DRUG SCREEN RESULTS</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">A. Confidentiality</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">1. The contracted lab shall communicate all lab analysis results to the City of Newark Police Director either verbally or by mailing the same to the Police Director marked \u201cConfidential\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">B. Negative Results</p>\n<p id=\"b514-18\">1. The Police Director shall require a representative of the Internal Affairs Bureau to make available the lab analysis results confirming that the urine has been tested \u201cNegative\u201d for drugs, to an employee within seven (7) working days of the employee\u2019s request to view the results of analysis or to receive a copy of lab analysis results.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">2. An employee may request to view the lab results or receive a copy of the lab analysis results by verbally making such request to the Internal Affairs Bureau and by making an appointment with same, or by submitting a formal request to his commanding officer who shall then immediately forward such request to the Internal Affairs Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-20\">C. Positive Results</p>\n<p id=\"b514-21\">In instances where there are positive results of screened drugs in the employee\u2019s sample:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>1. The employee is to be confidentially informed of the results immediately in writing simultaneously mailed by certified mail and by first-class mail marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d and addressed to the individual at his home address, which writing shall state: \u201cThere is a positive urinalysis for (insert). Your options are annexed hereto. You are entitled to consult a representative of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 12 or your labor union and anyone else you wish to assist you. Attached to said writing shall be an exact listing entitled \u201cOPTIONS\u201d of procedures identified herein as Secs. IV C.2, C.3, Sec. V A, A.l, B and C and Sec. VI A, B and C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">2.

The employee must accompany or provide an agent to accompany a member of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the original urine sample from the City contracted lab to the lab of his/her choosing. Transportation expenses shall be borne by the employee concerned.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The blood test requirement was withdrawn by consent during the pendency of the trial court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">The trial judge also rejected plaintiffs' contention that Director Knox exceeded his statutory authority in promulgating the Memorandum; plaintiffs do not challenge that ruling on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Shortly after the trial judge issued his opinion, Director Knox promulgated a directive requiring drug/urine testing of all police department personnel. We understand an action has been filed to invalidate that directive, that implementation of the directive was temporarily enjoined and that the litigation has been stayed pending final disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The City does not argue that an officer's acceptance of assignment to the Narcotic Bureau can be regarded as a valid consent to an otherwise unreasonable search. <em>See, generally, McDonell, </em>809 <em>F.2d </em>at 1310 ; <em>Caruso, </em>506 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d at 793-794.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Probable cause is defined as \"a \u2018well grounded suspicion\u2019 that a crime has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>State v.

Burnett, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>377, 387 (1964)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Drug testing that is conducted as part of a bona fide health checkup is not constitutionally objectionable. <em>See Caruso, </em>506 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 798. At oral argument plaintiffs conceded that they would have no objection to such testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The court in <em>Caruso </em>noted that <em>Shoemaker </em>may be \"simply out of step with the rest of the authorities.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">GovernmentaIly authorized drug testing of persons other than public employees has been upheld in some cases. <em>See, e.g., Shoemaker, </em>795 F.2d 1136 (jockeys); <em>Storms, </em>600 <em>F.Supp. </em>1214 (prison inmates). As our earlier discussion of <em>Shoemaker </em>suggests, such cases involve a different mix of public and private interests and are not of significant guidance here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In a post-judgment affidavit submitted in opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for stay pending appeal, the Director also said that two Newark officers had recently been arrested for possession and distribution of narcotics. The record is silent as to any connection between the investigations preceding those arrests and Memorandum 85-259.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Immediately after the guidelines were promulgated, we inquired whether the City intended to adopt them and withdraw Memorandum 85-259. The City responded that it would comply with legislation implementing the guidelines, which the Attorney General had announced he would seek. The City accordingly moved for a stay of the appeal pending action by the Legislature. We denied that motion. The Legislature has not yet acted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\">In this matter we need not, and do not, pass upon the propriety of random drug testing of police trainees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We need not determine here whether public employees engaged in extra-hazardous activities may fairly be subjected to drug tests without reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>individualized suspicion. <em>Cf.
