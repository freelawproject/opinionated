Count five was severed for the purposes of trial. The State\u2019s motion for an extended term as a persistent offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 was granted. On count one defendant was sentenced to a term of 15 years with seven and one-half years parole ineligibility. Counts two and four were merged with count one for sentencing and on count three he was sentenced to a consecutive term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of four years. Both sentences were imposed consecutive to any sentence imposed for parole violation. A $125 Violent Crimes Compensation Board Penalty was also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The following facts developed during trial. On the evening of June 9, 1983, Aoran Green, a security worker for the Newark Housing Authority, went to meet a friend at 212 Prince Street in Newark. His friend was not there, and at approximately 10:30 p.m., he started to leave the apartment building when he encountered four men on the stairway. One of the men was defendant Leander Johnson and another, whom Green recognized as a former school mate, was Michael Jackson. Although he did not know the defendant\u2019s name, Green recognized him because he had gone to grammar school with defendant and had seen him around the projects. Green did not recognize the other two men. When Jackson greeted Green and called him by name, a person other than the defendant, started arguing with Green about having rent detectives to his girl friend\u2019s house. The argument ended when one of the men suggested that they all forget about it. Green then left the building alone and proceeded to his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As Green approached his car he began talking to an acquaintance, Marshal Boulers, and, while conversing with Boulers, he put some articles in the trunk of his car. When Green turned around defendant was standing in front of him. As the man who had argued with Green about his girl friend approached, defendant stepped back and fired a shot at Green\u2019s kneecap. The second man then said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him\u201d and also fired a shot. After being shot Green apparently fell to his knees and \u201cstarted crawling into the car.\u201d The other men fled, because, according to Green, \u201cthey thought I was going under the seat to get a gun.\u201d Green got into his car and drove to police headquarters where he gave the police a description of his assailants. Green was then taken to a hospital where he remained for 10-12 days. On June 12, two days after the shooting and while still in the hospital, Green reviewed several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>books of photographs brought to him by the police and selected defendant\u2019s photo as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On June 25, Green was in Bamberger\u2019s in Newark talking with two detectives from the Newark Police Department who worked there as part-time security officers. Defendant by happenstance walked into the store; Green immediately identified him and the officers arrested the defendant. Defendant told the detectives that he did not know Green and when asked his name gave the officers a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">At trial defendant testified that he spent the entire evening of June 9, 1983 with his girl friend, Carolyn Freeman. Both Ms. Freeman and her mother confirmed that defendant was at their home on the evening of the shooting. Defendant testified that he had known Green all of his life because they had gone to grammar school together. He also testified that Green and another man had recently accosted him, searched him, handcuffed him, drove him around the block and then let him go. Defendant stated that on that occasion harsh words were exchanged. He indicated that this episode occurred in June, but did not give the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Other facts developed at trial will be discussed under the appropriate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">On appeal defendant contends: (1) that hearsay statements from the argument and descriptions of the attackers given by the victim should not have been admitted; (2) that the State improperly bolstered the credibility of the victim and attacked the credibility of the other eyewitness and defendant; (3) that comments of the prosecutor during summation were improper, and (4) that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contentions and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred when it admitted prejudicial hearsay, which was not objected to, on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>separate instances. The first alleged hearsay involved statements by a third party that led to the argument in the stairway just prior to the assault and the second instance of hearsay involved identification statements by Green to the investigating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Since no objection to either out-of-court statement was raised at trial, any error will not be grounds for reversal unless it is clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333 (1971). The possibility of an unjust result must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>Macon </em>at 336; <em>State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18-19 (1974). We find that there was no plain error, nor do we find any merit to either of defendant\u2019s contentions concerning these two hearsay issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">First, defendant complains about the following testimony by Green prior to the assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">Q. Now what took place on the staircase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab5\">A. Well, the guy, Michael Jackson, he said, \u201cHow you doing, Aoran?\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">Q. Michael was one of these four people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayy\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">Q. Then the other guy said, he said, \u201cIs that Aoran Green?\u201d, so he said, \u201cYes.\u201d. So he said, \u201cWhy did you bring detectives to my girl friend\u2019s house?\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">Q. Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">A. The other defendant that\u2019s not in court yet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Defendant argues that the statements made by a third person violated the hearsay rule and defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. Defendant asserts that the evidence was harmful because it suggested a motive for the shooting. The State responds that: (1) no objection was made at trial; (2) the statement was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the assertion; (3) the statement did not inculpate defendant; (4) the Confrontation Clause does not exclude all hearsay, and (5) if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>was hearsay, it was admissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(9) as a statement by a coconspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">An out-of-court statement is inadmissible as hearsay if it is \u201coffered to prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>63. Here, the statement was not \u201coffered to prove the truth of the matter stated\u201d and therefore was not hearsay. It was offered to establish the fact that an argument had occurred in the stairway prior to the shooting. There was no violation of the hearsay rule because the truthfulness of the statement was not at issue. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>16, 28-29 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U.S. </em>1054, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>805, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>852; <em>State v. Smith, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>120, 138 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 59 <em>N.J. </em>293 (1971). The statement was non-accusatory and did not implicate defendant in the argument or the subsequent crime. <em>See State v. McKiver, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 548 (App.Div.1985). Moreover, if Green had merely testified that there was an argument on the stairway without a recital of the context of the conversation, his statement would have been admissible. The statements were made merely to establish that there was a discussion between Green and another person concerning another incident. We find no error in the admission of the statements by a third party that led to an argument in the hallway just prior to the assault. In view of our determination it is unnecessary to pass upon the remaining responses by the State to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Defendant also raises as an issue the admission of testimony by Detective Pallaro that Green gave police a detailed description of the two individuals who shot him and that he knew one of the individuals. Defendant points out that similar statements were also made by Detective Lytwym. He asserts that the testimony by these two officers violates the hearsay rule stated in <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263 (1973). The State answers that Pallaro\u2019s testimony \u201cwas the result of [his] nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>mal business activity\u201d and was inherently trustworthy. The State also incorrectly asserts that the statement is not hearsay because Green testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Detective Pallaro, who questioned Green at the police station as he waited for an ambulance, testified that Green gave him descriptions of the two men and told him that he knew one of them. At trial Pallaro recounted the descriptions that Green had given to him. Lytwym, who was with Green in Bamberger\u2019s when the defendant was arrested, testified that Green pointed to defendant and said, \u201cThere\u2019s the man who shot me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Initially, <em>Bankston </em>is not applicable under the circumstances of this case. <em>Bankston </em>and its progeny involved situations where police are required to explain why they approached a suspect. 63 <em>N.J. </em>at 268. The cases all involved tips by anonymous informers. <em>See State v. Douglas, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 273 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 102 <em>N.J. </em>378 (1985); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 15 (App.Div.1979); <em>State v. Long, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 133 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 70 <em>N.J. </em>143 (1976). Here, we are dealing with an out-of-court description by the victim, Green who identified defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(c), where identification is at issue, a statement is admissible if previously made by a person who is a witness at the trial if it is a prior identification of a party and \u201cmade under circumstances precluding unfairness or unreliability.\u201d <em>See State v. Williams, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>472, 480 (1979). Lytwym\u2019s testimony clearly qualifies as a prior identification. <em>Cf. State v. Sinclair, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>525, 546-547 (1967) (statements which bear on issues other than identification should not be admitted). Pallaro\u2019s testimony regarding the description may be considered a prior identification as well. <em>Cf. State v. Ginardi, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435 (App.Div.1970), aff\u2019d 57 <em>N.J. </em>438 (1970) (composite sketch admissible as prior identification); <em>Evid.R. </em>20, comment 4 at 198 (Anno.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Furthermore, on cross-examination defense counsel questioned Green concerning the description he gave the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>before the detective testified. Green repeated the description on redirect examination. Since any errors were \u201cinduced, encouraged or acquiesced in or consented to by defense counsel\u201d they may not be the basis for reversal. <em>State v. Harper, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 277 (App.Div.1974), certif. den. 65 <em>N.J. </em>574 (1974). Defense counsel opened the door to this line of questioning and did not object at trial, thus preventing any curative instructions by the court. <em>See State v. Douglas, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273-274.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The statement by Green to the investigating officers was admissible as prior identifications under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(e), and in our view the identifications were \u201cmade under circumstances precluding unfairness or unreliability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Defendant contends that the court improperly admitted testimony of Green\u2019s good habits and character, and his prior assistance to the police in narcotics investigations. He asserts that Evid.R. 47 (Character Trait as Proof of Conduct), was violated because the jury was asked to infer that Green acted a certain way due to evidence of his prior good conduct. The State counters that defense counsel created an inference as to Green\u2019s \u201cbad character\u201d by certain allegedly improper questions and that the prosecutor merely rebutted this inference. The State does not respond to the contention concerning Green\u2019s prior relationship with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">On cross-examination defendant asked Green whether he had been drinking that day, whether he was under the influence of narcotics that night and whether the paper bag he placed in the trunk contained any contraband. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the State then elicited from Detectives Pallaro and Lytwym that Green did not smoke, drink, deal or use drugs on the issue of Green\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Contrary to the State\u2019s contention, evidence of a witness\u2019 sensory or mental defects has unquestionable relevance in attacking a witness\u2019 credibility. <em>N.J. Rules of Evidence </em>(Anno. 1986) comment 10 at 210. \u201cMental abnormality\u201d at the time of observing the facts is provable on cross-examination or by extrinsic evidence bearing on credibility, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>(3 ed. 1984), \u00a7 45 at 104. It is a standard ground for impeachment. <em>Id. </em>at 105. A form of abnormality exists when the witness is under the influence of drugs or drink and may be used to impeach the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Ibid. See State v. Franklin, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>386 (1968) (reversible error to restrict defendant\u2019s examination concerning witness\u2019 alcoholism and state of intoxication at the time of the offense; evidence relevant on credibility). <em>See also State v. Crudup, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215 (App.Div.1980) (cross-examination of witness on any factors affecting visual perception at the time of the event proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\"> The testimony of Pallaro and Lytwym corroborated Green\u2019s testimony that he did not drink or use narcotics. For the purpose of supporting the credibility of a witness, the party calling the witness may examine him and introduce extrinsic evidence relevant upon the issue of credibility, <em>Evid.R. </em>20, and <em>see </em>comment 4 at 198 (Anno.1986). A party may introduce extrinsic evidence relevant to credibility, whether or not that extrinsic evidence bears upon the subject matter of the action. <em>Id., </em>Comment 1 at 190. Impeachment is an attack upon credibility, <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 49 at 115, and any deficiency of the senses which would lessen the ability to perceive facts testified to by the witness is an attack on the credibility of the witness. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 45 at 104. The testimony of Pallaro and Lytwym was proper to impeach any inference attacking Green\u2019s credibility created on cross-examination by attempting to establish a deficiency in his sensory perceptions caused by drug and alcohol use at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\"><em>Evid.R. </em>47 permits proof of a character trait for the purpose of drawing inferences as to the conduct of a person on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>specific occasion but only by opinion testimony, reputation evidence or evidence of a conviction, Here the State was attempting to establish that Green did not drink or use drugs in order to show that he did not indulge on the date of the assault. The testimony of Pallaro and Lytwym expressed their opinion or knowledge of Green\u2019s reputation and was admissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>47 to counteract the insinuation of alcohol or drug use by Green even though he directly denied such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Defendant further contends that admission of testimony regarding Green\u2019s past work with the police is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">As noted earlier, on cross-examination defendant was asked whether he had been drinking that night, whether he was under the influence of narcotics that night and whether he had any contraband in the bag which he had been carrying. We held above that the questions regarding his use of alcohol or narcotics on the date in question were clearly proper and relevant to the issue of Green\u2019s ability to perceive. Furthermore, we determined that the State was permitted to rebut this inference, not only by testimony from the victim, but also through corroboration by other witnesses. It was in rebuttal of ttm inference that defendant\u2019s perception was impaired that the testimony contended to be improper was elicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The State sought to corroborate Green\u2019s testimony that he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident. It could establish this fact in one of two ways: (1) testimony by a witness who was with Green on the date in question who would have observed that Green had used no drugs or alcohol at that time, or (2) through evidence of Green\u2019s reputation as a teetotaler, non-smoker or non-drug user to show that he did not indulge on the day of the attack. The State chose the latter method. The second method had the added benefit to the State of demonstrating that the victim was not a regular drug or alcohol user. Contrary to the State and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>trial court\u2019s contentions, the prosecutor's questions regarding Green\u2019s use of drugs or alcohol on the <em>date in question </em>attacked only Green\u2019s sensory abilities. They did not necessarily infer that Green was a drunk, junkie or drug dealer, or that he was somehow not a law-abiding citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Nonetheless, in order to permit Pallaro to testify to Green\u2019s reputation regarding drugs and alcohol, the State had to lay a foundation to show that Pallaro knew Green well enough to testify as to his reputation in the community. In pursuit of this objective, the State asked Pallaro whether he knew Aaron Green prior to the date in question and the nature of the relationship. At this point defense counsel objected. The judge permitted the question as relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility. Pallaro then testified that Green was a police informant with whom he had worked in the past. Pallaro then gratuitously volunteered that \u201cthe information [given by Green] was always good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Defendant now contends that this testimony was improper because it asked the jury to infer that Green\u2019s testimony in this case was \u201cgood\u201d or truthful because he was known to have been truthful in the past. However, an impeached witness may be sustained by testimony in the form of opinion or evidence of reputation. <em>Evid.R. </em>46; 47(a), (b). Where a trait of a person\u2019s character is relevant, evidence of reputation with reference thereto at a relevant time in a group with which the person then habitually associated is admissible to prove the truth of the matter reputed. <em>Evid.R. </em>63(28).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Before testimony sustaining the character or reputation of a witness may be admitted, such character or reputation must be attacked or impeached. It is not necessary that the impeachment be successful; an attempt is sufficient. 98 <em>C.J.S., Witnesses, </em>\u00a7 532a(l); 4 <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 1104(a) (Chadburn rev. 1972). A direct impeachment of moral character by testimony, reputation or personal opinion, to a general trait of character plainly satisfies the rule and opens the way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>rehabilitate a witness by testimony of good character. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1105(A). \u201cWhere, without actually introducing testimony, the opponent <em>effectively insinuated the witness\u2019 impeachment, </em>his good character is then proper in rebuttal.\u201d <em>Wigmore, </em>\u00a7 1104(A) at 235. (Emphasis in original). Though the witness may deny the things insinuated, a jury may often believe that, though denied, there is some foundation for the insinuation if witnesses are not called to convince them to the contrary. <em>Wigmore, </em>\u00a7 1106(A). at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We emphasize that the testimony objected to was volunteered during the course of proper questioning by the State. Although the questions regarding Green\u2019s drug and alcohol use on the date in question did not impugn Green\u2019s character for honesty, truthfulness and veracity, or his reputation as a law-abiding citizen, further questions by defense counsel did attack Green\u2019s character. It will be recalled that defense counsel also asked Green whether he had any contraband in the bag he was carrying. This question had nothing to do with the witness\u2019 ability to perceive. It did, however, infer that the witness was not a law-abiding citizen. Consequently, there was an attack on Green\u2019s credibility as a truthful, honest, law-abiding person. Although the rebuttal to this attack came about inadvertently, the State could have properly rebutted this inference directly by evidence of Green\u2019s reputation in the community as a truthful, honest, law-abiding citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In order to support Green\u2019s credibility it was proper for the State to introduce extrinsic evidence in relation to the issue of credibility provided that there was no violation of <em>Evid.R. </em>22 and 47. Under <em>Evid.R. </em>22(c), (d), evidence of traits of character, other than honesty or veracity, and evidence of specific instances of conduct are inadmissible. The statements by the police officers were directed to the reputation of Green for honesty, truthfulness, veracity and also his reputation for \u201cbeing a law abiding citizen\u201d, and were admissible. <em>State v. Micci, </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 463 (App.Div.1957). The police officers\u2019 testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>expressed their opinions of Green and his reputation within the police community for these traits of character. The testimony was not only of honesty and veracity but also of his \u201cbeing a law-abiding citizen\u201d. The testimony was general without referring to specific instances of conduct. <em>Evid.R. </em>22(c), (d). If the testimony had referred to a specific case or instance, then the rule would have been violated. <em>Cf. State v. Mondrosch, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.1969), certif. den. 55 <em>N.J. </em>600 (1970) (evidence of witness\u2019 past actions to effect credibility violated <em>Evid.R. </em>22(d)). The testimony that Green was an informant and that the \u201cinformation was always good\u201d bolstered Green\u2019s reputation for veracity in providing accurate and reliable information in the past. <em>Cf. State v. Stefanelli, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 457 (App.Div.1977), rev\u2019d on oth. grds. 78 <em>N.J. </em>418 (1979) (testimony of law enforcement officials as to cooperation by an accomplice witness not supportive of credibility but the relationship of witness with prosecutor\u2019s office)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">With respect to the rehabilitative testimony of Green\u2019s character and reputation a limiting instruction, pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>6, restricting the testimony as to only the credibility of Green should have been given. However, the failure of defendant to request such instruction does not constitute plain error. <em>State v. Lair, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>388 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Moreover, the admission of the testimony concerning the prior activities of Green is harmless error and not of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336 (1971). Not any possibility of an unjust result will cause reversal of a conviction. The possibility of an unjust result must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18-19 (1974); <em>Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">If it is sufficiently clear that another trial conducted without committing a particular error would lead to the same result, using judicial resources to conduct the retrial is obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ly inefficient. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 182 at 533, citing note 64, <em>Cornell L.Rev., </em>538, 538 (1979). Even if the error is of constitutional dimension, it will be held harmless if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error. <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>499, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); <em>Chapman v.

Wainwright, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>371, 377, 92 <em>S.Ct </em>2174, 2178, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); accord <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 <em>U.S. </em>85, 86, 84 <em>S.Ct </em>229, 230, 11 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>171 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Defendant argues that the State\u2019s attack on the credibility of Marshall Boulers, one of its own witnesses, was improper. The State claims that it was surprised by Boulers testimony and merely sought to neutralize it. Boulers, who witnessed the shooting, was called by the State and testified that he saw the gunman, could identify him, but that defendant was not their man. He then admitted that he had previously told an investigator for the prosecutor that he saw the shooting but did not see who shot Green. He stated that he had lied to the investigator because he was scared, although he did not explain why he was afraid. Defense counsel did not object to this testimony. As previously noted, under <em>Evid.R. </em>20, with certain exceptions not applicable here, for the purpose of impairing or supporting the credibility of the witness, any party including the party calling the witness may examine him and introduce extrinsic evidence relevant to the issue of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Since the prior statement was not written, recorded or given under oath, neutralization is improper unless there has been surprise. <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a). The State must also show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the testimony was adverse or contrary to its case. <em>See State v. Gallicchio, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>540, 546 (1965). If the State had no prior indication that the witness would contradict the prior statements, a preliminary hearings should have been held after the testimony sought to be neutralized was given. <em>Id. </em>at 547-548. See <em>Evid.R. </em>8(1). The jury should then be instructed that the prior statement is not admitted to prove the truth of the matter therein asserted. <em>Gallicchio, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 548; <em>Evid.R. </em>20, comment 3 at 194 (Anno.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In the present case it is obvious that the State was surprised based on Boulers\u2019 own admission that he had previously lied to an investigator from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The testimony was clearly adverse as he stated that defendant was not the guilty party. <em>See Gallicchio </em>at 545. However, the court did not follow the proper procedure before allowing the prosecutor to impair Boulers credibility. Further, no limiting instruction was given at the time the testimony was offered or during the court\u2019s charge to the jury. <em>See Gallicchio </em>at 548. Considering defendant\u2019s failure to object, the fact that neutralization was accomplished without extrinsic evidence and in view of the fact that neither of Boulers\u2019 statements inculpated the defendant, the error in failing to follow the proper procedure and failing to give limiting instructions pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>6 was harmless. See <em>State v. Stefanelli, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Defendant objects to five instances of allegedly improper comments by the prosecutor during his summation. Defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in each instance were beyond the scope of the testimony adduced at trial. The State answers that there was no plain error because all of the comments were based upon evidence in the records. \u201cOrdinarily a defendant will not be heard to claim prejudice if defense counsel does not make a timely objection to improper remarks.\u201d <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 106 (1972). A timely objection is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>necessary to provide the court and the prosecutor with an opportunity to cure any error caused by an improper remark <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 511 (1960), and signifies that defense counsel did not believe that the comments were prejudicial in the atmosphere of the trial. <em>State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 533-534 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 102 <em>N.J. </em>393 (1986). Defendant\u2019s failure to object to the comments at trial means that the errors \u201cneed not be dealt with in the same way as those raised by a timely challenge.\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 218 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The prosecutor is not simply another attorney who represents the State; he has an obligation to play fair and insure that justice shall be done. <em>Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534-535; <em>see Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 510-511. While he is allowed a wide latitude during summation, <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 218; <em>State v. Perry, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>45, 47 (1974), the prosecutor\u2019s comments must be confined to the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. <em>Id. </em>at 47. Particular remarks during summation must be evaluated in the setting of the entire trial. <em>Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s argument on summation that Green was not a drug dealer, drunk or dope user, but was trying to clean up the neighborhood. There was testimony that Green was an informer who had previously given the police reliable information. There was also testimony that the argument on the stairway resulted from Green\u2019s work with police regarding a stolen coat. We have already determined the testimony that Green was an informer and the statements in the stairway on the evening of the crime were admissible. Therefore, the remarks of the prosecutor during summation on these subjects were a reasonable inference from the facts and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that Boulers lied at trial because he was afraid of the defendant. Boulers admitted that he had given a prior contradictory statement. There was testimony that Boulers was on the same floor as defendant in the county jail and had contact with him every day. There was also testimony from Boulers that he was scared when he gave the original statement. The prosecutor also argued that Boulers would rather perjure himself than face defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Testimony of threats made by a defendant against a witness with the intent to induce him not to testify against the accused is admissible. <em>State v. Hill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>490, 500 (1966). This type of evidence illuminates \u201cdefendant\u2019s consciousness of his own guilt\u201d and is not subject to the restriction of <em>Evid.R. </em>55. <em>See State v. Lassiter, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>2, 8 (App.Div.1984). Further, testimony that the witness was afraid may be offered notwithstanding the fact that the attempts to influence the witness\u2019 testimony were not committed with the authorization or knowledge of defendant. <em>State v. Gray, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 417-418 (App.Div.1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N.J. </em>596 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">There was no error by the prosecutor in attempting to establish that Boulers was intimidated by the defendant while both were incarcerated in the county jail. Again, the prosecutor\u2019s argument during summation was a reasonable inference from facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s interruption of his summation in order to tell the jury that Boulers was not found until shortly before trial because his name was spelled differently when he was incarcerated. Initially, defense counsel opened the door to any error, <em>see State v. Harper, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 277, when he stated in his closing argument that the police report, which had not been entered into evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>provided the prosecutor with Boulers name in June 1983. The prosecutor then interrupted and explained that the delay in locating Boulers was due to the fact that the police report referred to Marshall \u201cBouls.\u201d It is evident that both parties improperly commented upon facts not in evidence but defense counsel precipitated the counter-action by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The situation is comparable to the admission of inadmissible evidence which the adversary is then permitted to answer. Professor McCormick characterizes this as \u201cfighting fire with fire.\u201d <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 57 at 146. The statement of defense counsel on summation that the police report provided the prosecutor with Boulers name in 1983 was improper and inadmissible even though relevant to the issues. It was probably damaging to the prosecutor\u2019s case or at least prejudicial. Since the prosecutor seasonably objected to the statement by defense counsel he then is entitled to give an answering statement as a matter of right to refute the damaging statement. <em>Id. </em>at 147-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s inference that defendant was guilty because he failed to report to police headquarters after learning he was a suspect, citing <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 112-113 (1976) and <em>State v. Ripa, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>199, 203-205 (1965). Both cases dealt with the improper use of defendant\u2019s silence while in custody. The court in <em>Deatore, </em>however, specifically distinguished situations where defendant\u2019s conduct after a crime is inconsistent with his innocence. 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 108. In <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>423 F.2d 127 (5 Cir.1970), the court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">[i]t is today universally conceded that the fact of an accused\u2019s flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself, [at 133; quoting <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 276 (3d Ed.1940)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\"><em>Cf. State v. Lassiter, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 8 (evidence of threats against witness by defendant admissible on issue of conscious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ness of guilt); <em>Stale v. Cantalupo, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 123 (App.Div.1982), certif. den. 93 <em>N.J. </em>274 (1983) (evidence of flight admissible on issue of consciousness of guilt). See <em>State v. Plowden, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228 (App.Div.1974), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>504 (1974) (comments upon the failure of alibi witness to report to police on behalf of defendant held proper since such failure is a factor in weighing credibility). Defendant\u2019s failure to turn himself in for two weeks when he knew that the police were looking for him is fair comment on the issue of consciousness of guilt. There is no contention that the argument was a departure from the facts and reasonable inferences adduced at trial. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was not clear and unmistakable nor did it substantially prejudice the defendant\u2019s fundamental rights to have the jury fairly to evaluate the merits of his defense. <em>State v. Bucanis, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>45 (1958), <em>cert. </em>den. 357 <em>U.S. </em>910, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>1157, 2 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1160 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Finally, defendant objects to the prosecutor \u201ctestifying to the effect that the police officers begged Green to let the jury know that he was working with the police.\u201d The following excerpt contains the relevant comments by the prosecutor on summation regarding this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">What did Aoran Green say? No sir, I had papers in the bag. Oh, you always keep papers in the bag? I keep papers in the bag. I wasn\u2019t drunk because I don\u2019t drink and I wasn\u2019t high because I don\u2019t do drugs. Then as Aoran told you, He and I sat down in my office after the first days of testimony, I said Aoran they\u2019re out trying to make you someone that you\u2019re not. We can\u2019t let them get away with it because if they do, he\u2019s going to get away with shooting you. What we\u2019re going to do, Aoran, if it\u2019s okay with you, and I\u2019m asking you, because it could put your life on the line, let\u2019s tell them and prove to them that you don\u2019t do drugs and let\u2019s prove it to them by telling them that you supply police with information, that you\u2019re an informant and not a street informant, he\u2019s not the junkie in the jail which you have something there, instead of sending them to prison, they\u2019ll give you something else. That\u2019s not the type of person Aoran Green is. Aoran, let's tell them you work with Pallaro, let\u2019s tell them you work with Lytwym, let\u2019s tell them you don\u2019t do drugs, that you are instrumental in people being arrested and prosecuted. Then the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">THE COURT: Mr. Haggerty, please confine you remarks to what the witness said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>MR. HAGGERTY: And I believe this is what he testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">MR. BLASI: I make no objection to this, judge. He may go on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">It is obvious from the comments that the prosecutor said nothing about the <em>police </em>begging Green to reveal his relationship with the police. It is also clear that the conversation between Green and the prosecutor was not part of the evidence. The prosecutor was, in effect, testifying during his summation. Although the trial judge interrupted the prosecutor, defense counsel did not find the comments objectionable. \u201c[N]ot every departure from the facts and reasonable inferences necessarily calls for a reversal.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 511. <em>Cf. Perry, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 54; <em>Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Since Judge Villaneuva intervened promptly and decisively, <em>State v. Stewart, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96 (App.Div.1978), any impropriety of the comment was timely eradicated. <em>See State v. Ruiz, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350 (App.Div.1974), (timely curative instructions by the court), mod. o.g. 68 <em>N.J. </em>54 (1975). See also <em>State v. Winter, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>640 (1984). Further, the judge gave the jury the standard instruction that the attorneys\u2019 comments on the evidence should be disregarded if they are not in accordance with its recollections of the facts. Such an instruction may cure errors made by the prosecutor, <em>State v. Serret, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 28 (App.Div.1984); <em>contra Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 107. At any rate, the prosecutor\u2019s comment on this issue is clearly not capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Defendant argues that his trial attorney was incompetent in failing to request appropriate hearings, failing to object to allegedly hearsay statements, failing to attempt to rehabilitate defendant\u2019s character and failing to request a charge for a lesser included offense. The State answers that the alleged errors, which constituted trial strategy, did not result in the admission of probative evidence and did not prejudice defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number> An accused\u2019s right to be represented by counsel, a fundamental part of our criminal justice system, <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 653, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 2043, (1984), 80 L.Ed.2d 657, 664 (1984) means the right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id.; McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>759, 771 n. 14, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1441, 1449 n. 14, 25 L.Ed.2d 763; <em>State v. Sugar, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>1, 17 (1980). It is presumed \u201cthe lawyer is competent to provide the guiding hand that the defendant needs\u201d; the burden rests on the accused to demonstrate a constitutional violation. <em>Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 658, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2046, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674 (1984), decided the same day as <em>Cronic, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor established a two-part test which defendant must meet in order to prove counsel\u2019s performance was so inadequate as to require reversal of his conviction. First, \u201cdefendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 688, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 693. Second, \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, <em>104 S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 698. Accord <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, \u2014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2464, 2473, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>144, 159 (1986). A reasonable probability is defined as probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Ibid. </em>This test replaces the New Jersey standard which had required reversal only if counsel\u2019s errors reduced the trial to a \u201cfarce or mockery of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Edge, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>580, 593 (1971); <em>State v. Pace, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 251 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\"> Moreover, in reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, every effort must be made (1) to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, (2) to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct and (3) to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. <em>Strickland, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 689, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. Failure to make the required showing of either deficient performance or sufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2071, 80 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 702. <em>Accord Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2474, 91 L.Ed.2d at 160. In evaluating a claim the reviewing court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 689, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Defendant identifies five specific errors by trial counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">(1) Failure to request a Sands<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing. At trial defendant testified and defense counsel specifically rejected a <em>Sands </em>hearing, however, no prejudice has been demonstrated. The key to exclusion of convictions of crimes under <em>Sands </em>is remoteness, which cannot be determined by the passage of time alone. <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 144 (1978). Defendant\u2019s prior convictions for robbery and weapons offenses were from four to six years old. They were serious crimes, <em>ibid., </em>and more than likely would have been admitted by the court if a hearing had been held. <em>Cf. State v. Hughes, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 369 (App.Div.1974), (counsel is not obligated to make a frivolous motion), certif. den. 66 <em>N.J. </em>307 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">(2) Failure to request a <em>Miranda </em>hearing. The problem with determining this issue is that facts were not developed at trial to indicate whether there was a violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Both Green and Lytwym testified that defendant denied knowing Green when detained but later at trial defendant testified that he had known Green all his life. Lytwym did not indicate whether he gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings nor did he testify to any incriminating statements made by defendant. Since defendant testified, most assuredly if there had been any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>violations it would developed through defendant\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">(3) Failure to object to statements made during argument. Since we have concluded that there was no error on any of these issues, they may not be the basis for an assertion of ineffective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">(4) Failure to ask Boulers about the cause of his fear. As previously noted Boulers testified that he was scared but he did not indicate the source of his fear. Defendant argues that if Boulers had been asked, \u201che would have testified that he was afraid of an unknown individual who was the actual shooter.\u201d This is pure speculation; moreover, Boulers might have stated that he was scared of defendant. We previously pointed out in <em>State v. Gray, supra, </em>the reason or source for Boulers alleged fear when he gave the previous inconsistent statement is irrelevant; the fact of the inconsistency was the only relevant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">(5) Failure to request that fourth degree assault be charged as a lesser included offense. Defense counsel did not request such an instruction after the issue was raised by the trial judge. This failure to request an instruction generally precludes defendant from raising the issue on appeal. <em>State v. Saulnier, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>199, 205-206 (1973). Nevertheless, there was no \u201crational basis\u201d to have charged defendant for simple assault. <em>Id. </em>at 206-207. Simple assault is merely a disorderly persons offense and is inapplicable (1) because the attack resulted in serious bodily injury; (2) there was no evidence of negligence, and (3) as the victim was not merely placed in fear of injury. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-la(l), (2), (3). <em>See Hughes, supra. </em>Shooting a victim in the knee with a pistol could never under any circumstances constitute merely disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Defendant has failed to overcome the presumption of effective counsel. We are satisfied that the errors complained of, even if valid, did not effect the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"><em>State v. </em>Sands,76 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
