The opinion below was reported as <em>Andre v. Union Tank Car Co., Inc., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51 (Law Div.1985), where the facts and applicable law have been set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">We agree with Judge Sachar that the failure-to-warn issue, which survived plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of their negligence and design defect claims, has been preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Act, 45 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 421, <em>et seq. </em>and regulations enacted thereunder, and we affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the cogent analysis of that issue contained in his opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l); <em>Andre, </em>213 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>per. </em>at 59-66. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the question of duty-to-warn under New Jersey products liability law and we expressly refrain from approving or disapproving so much of the opinion below as treats with that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Inasmuch as plaintiffs\u2019 case was properly dismissed under <em>R. </em>4:40-1 prior to reaching the jury, their argument on appeal that mention of the negligence of Jose\u2019s employer, Essex Chemical Company, constituted reversible error is also moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
