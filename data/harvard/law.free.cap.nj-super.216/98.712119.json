He was sentenced on the murder conviction to a 25 year custodial term with 12V2 years of parole ineligibility and on the weapon possession conviction to a consecutive 10 year term with 5 years of parole ineligibility; the armed robbery conviction was merged into the murder conviction.

Our consideration of the remaining issues requires a full exposition of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The convictions arise out of a January 7, 1981 incident in which two or more persons forcibly entered the Newark apartment of Thomas Pinkney, killed Pinkney and robbed Alfred Boatwright and Andre Loney.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Both Boatwright and Loney testified at trial. Boatwright said that he, Loney and Pinkney were in the apartment when a knock came at the door. Loney opened the door and two men came in with a .22 calibre rifle, saying \u201cback up or freeze or something.\u201d Pinkney, who was sitting in a chair, \u201cjumped up and came toward them\u201d when \u201cthe shot went off.\u201d The intruders then told Boatwright and Loney to \u201cget on the floor and empty out our pockets.\u201d After taking money from Boatwright, the men left. Boatwright testified that one of the men was masked and that the other, who shot Pinkney, was \u201c[ljight skinned and he had either green or brown eyes.\u201d Boatwright initially said that because he was \u201chigh\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was unable to identify the masked man. On cross-examination, however, Boatwright acknowledged that he believed that person to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Reginald James, a friend with whom he had spent time earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Loney gave a somewhat different description of the occurrence. Loney, who also acknowledged being \u201chigh\u201d although not \u201cspaced out,\u201d said that he had opened the door to let Boatwright in the room. As he started to close the door, two men burst through, both wearing ski masks, one carrying a sawed-off shotgun and one with a .22 calibre rifle. Loney started \u201cscuffling\u201d with the two men. Suddenly \u201canother third party kicked the door,\u201d the door \u201cflew open\u201d and Loney \u201cgot another rifle aimed at me.\u201d The third person, who was not masked, fired his rifle at Loney, but the \u201cbullet and the shell just rejected out from the side____\u201d At that point Pinkney got up, \u201ccomes around ... [a]nd, boom, he got shot in the stomach.\u201d Although Loney had apparently made no pretrial identification of defendant, at trial he said he was \u201cpositive\u201d that defendant was \u201cthe guy that didn\u2019t have the mask on that shot my buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The State also called Clifford Plant, who had earlier pleaded guilty to complicity in the murder of Pinkney. At a hearing outside the presence of the jury, he was confronted with his plea agreement that, in return for a recommendation that he would not serve more than 20 years in prison, he would testify truthfully and in accordance with his January 21, 1981 statement at any trial of the other participants. Plant said that \u201cthere is something wrong\u201d with that recitation of the plea agreement because he \u201cwas only supposed to have been testifying against one person, that was another co-defendant of mine, not against Anthony Gross.\u201d Asked about his January 21 statement, Plant acknowledged that he had gone to the police station with his father, had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and had signed and sworn to the truth of the statement. However, he testified that he had not implicated defendant in the murder or robbery and that defendant \u201cwasn\u2019t even involved.\u201d Plant further testified that he had not told the police that Charlie Williams \u201chad a shotgun and went in the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>with a shotgun\u201d although he later so testified in the trial of Williams. Pressed as to what he had testified in the Williams trial, Plant said \u201cI refuse to answer. I plead the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Without any ruling by the trial judge or objection from defense counsel, the jury was returned to the courtroom and Plant was resworn in its presence. He again acknowledged having pleaded guilty to complicity in the murder and to having signed and sworn to the January 21 statement. However, he denied knowing defendant and said that the first time he saw defendant was \u201c[w]hen I got locked up\u201d after the killing. The prosecutor then sought to elicit the contradictory January 21 statement. Defense counsel objected at sidebar \u201cto the foundation which has been laid____ The proper foundation would be</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">to ask him what happened on that day and then if there is an inconsistency\u2014.\u201d The prosecutor agreed to \u201cask the question.\u201d He asked Plant a series of questions concerning defendant\u2019s involvement in the incident. After Plant testified that defendant was neither present nor otherwise involved<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and without further objection from defense counsel, the prosecutor elicited the prior contradictory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The substance of the prior statement was that Plant, Williams, defendant and one Eddie Maxwell went to the building where Pinkney lived. Plant knocked on Pinkney\u2019s door. When the door opened, defendant and Williams \u201cpulled the rifle and shotgun out,\u201d went inside and closed the door. Plant and Maxwell remained in the hallway. Plant heard a shot, immediately after which defendant and Williams came out of the apartment. All four went to 84 Boyd Street in Newark, where defendant left the rifle and shotgun in apartment 1C. Plant then went to his apartment, 2E, in the same building. Plant acknowledged that Williams and Maxwell were with him at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Pinkney\u2019s, but insisted that defendant was not; he said that the police had inserted the references to defendant and he had signed the statement \u201cbecause that\u2019s all he told me to do was sign it.\u201d On cross-examination, Plant said he had signed the statement because he wanted to minimize the time he would have to spend in prison and because he had been pressured, handcuffed to a chair for four hours and a plastic bag had been put over his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">After Plant testified, the prosecutor called Police Sergeant Williams, who had taken the January 21 statement. He testified Plant had come to police headquarters with his father, that the father had provided food to his son and had been present during part of the interrogation, that all of the answers contained in the statement were Plant\u2019s, that Plant had read the statement after it was typed, that he was asked to make any corrections that he wished to make, that he had made corrections on the first page and \u201con the last question\u201d and that he had placed his initials at each correction. Williams said that no plastic bag was put over Plant\u2019s head and that Plant had not been handcuffed or otherwise threatened. Williams also said that the first time he had ever heard defendant\u2019s name was when Plant mentioned the name in the course of the interview and the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The prosecutor then asked Williams \u201c[w]hat specifically did Mr. Plant tell you about Mr. Gross\u2019 participation in this crime?\u201d Defense counsel objected that \u201c[i]t\u2019s hearsay.\u201d The trial judge overruled the objection and the prosecutor thereupon elicited the essence of the January 21 statement. Williams further testified that a search warrant had been obtained based upon the information provided by Plant and a sawed-off shotgun had been recovered at 84 Boyd Street.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the conclusion of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>testimony, the written statement itself was admitted in evidence without objection from defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Defendant did not testify or present any witnesses in his behalf. In charging the jury, the trial judge instructed that the jury was \u201cto determine whether or not [the January 21] statement was actually made by [Plant], and if made, whether that statement or any portion thereof is credible\u201d; that \u201cthe circumstances and the facts surrounding the giving of the statement as well as other evidence\u201d should be considered in determining its credibility; that if the jury should find that the statement \u201cwas not actually made or that [it was] not credible, then it had the right to disregard that statement completely\u201d; that if the jury found the statement was given and that \u201cpart or all of it is credible,\u201d then the jury could give \u201csuch weight to that statement or any portion of it that [it finds] to be truthful and credible as [it] deems it should be accorded,\u201d and that in weighing Plant\u2019s testimony the jury may consider \u201cwhether he might have a special interest in the outcome of this case and whether his testimony might have been influenced by any feelings which he may have had.\u201d Defense counsel took no exception to that portion of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The contentions made in Points I, II, IV and V of defendant\u2019s briefs all challenge the admission of Plant\u2019s out-of-court statement which contradicted his trial testimony. The admissibility of that statement as substantive evidence on the State\u2019s offer is governed by <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a)(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">A statement is admissible if previously made by a person who is a witness at a hearing, provided it would have been admissible if made by him while testifying and the statement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(a) Is inconsistent with his testimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with the requirements of Rule 22(a) and (b); however, when the statement is offered by the party calling the witness it shall be admissible only if, in addition to the foregoing requirements, it (i) is contained in a sound recording or in a writing made or signed by the witness in circumstances establishing its reliability or (ii) was given under oath subject to the penalty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>perjury at a trial or other judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative, administrative or grand jury proceeding, or in a deposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Plant was a witness at trial and his prior statement was in a writing signed by him. The focus of inquiry is whether he signed the statement \u201cin circumstances establishing its reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The \u201ccircumstances establishing reliability\u201d requirement was introduced into <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) in 1980; it has not yet been the subject of any reported decisions. Prior to July 1, 1980, the Rule allowed the proponent of a witness to introduce a prior contradictory statement \u201conly as permitted by Rule 20,\u201d which in turn permitted the prior statement to be used solely \u201cto neutralize the witness\u2019 testimony, provided that the judge found the proponent had been surprised\u201d by the trial testimony. <em>See State v. Ross, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>239, 248 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That reflected the orthodox rule, long under attack by academic and other commentators and now rejected in a growing number of jurisdictions. See generally <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 251 at 601-604 (2d Ed.1972); 3A <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1970), \u00a7 1018 at 995-1007; Graham, \u201cEmploying inconsistent statements for impeachment and as substantive evidence,\u201d 75 <em>Mich. L.Rev. </em>1565 (1977); Annotation, \u201cUse or admissibility of prior inconsistent statements of witness as substantive evidence of facts to which they relate in criminal case,\u201d 30 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 414 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Effective July 1, 1980, both <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) and <em>Evid.R. </em>20 were amended to allow prior inconsistent statements to be admitted substantively on application of any party if the prior statement was \u201ceither in writing signed by the witness under circumstances establishing its reliability\u201d or \u201cgiven under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, judicial hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>proceeding before an agency empowered to issue subpoenas, or in a deposition.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) Comment (1985). <em>See State v. Hacker, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 537 n. 2 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>364 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As of July 1, 1982, <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) was further amended to its present form. As summarized by the State Rules of Court Review Commission in its Comment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">The most important change in this amendment was to delete the requirement that the \u201cspecial reliability\u201d provisions of the 1980 amendment must be met even where the party offering the prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence is not the proponent of the witness. Thus the rule reverted to the original rule of broad admissibility for inconsistent statements offered by an adverse party, even if the statement was not in writing or made under oath. It was decided that only where the proponent of the witness offered the prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence was compliance with those reliability requirements necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\"><em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) Comment (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The successive formulations of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) thus represent various compromises between the \u201corthodox\u201d rule against giving substantive evidential status to prior inconsistent statements (see <em>State v. Reddick, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>115, 121 (App.Div.1979)) and the \u201cacademic\u201d view that the hearsay dangers evaporate when the declarant is in court, under oath and subject to cross-examination before the factfinder concerning both the in-court and out-of-court statements. See, <em>e.g., State v. Whelan, </em>200 <em>Conn. </em>743, 513 A.2d 86 (1986), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>597, 93 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986); <em>Commonwealth v. Brady, </em>510 <em>Pa. </em>123, 507 A.2d 66 (1986). <em>Cf. State v. Stefanelli, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>418, 432 (1979). As the Supreme Court Special Committee on Evidence Rules described the accommodation, the present Rule is designed \u201cto limit substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent statements [of the proponent\u2019s witness] to those statements given in a form and under circumstances importing special reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Under the 1982 amendments, statements contained in sound recordings and in writings of, but not signed by, the witness were made admissible upon a proper showing of reliability. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>explaining that expansion of the Rule, the Committee emphasized \u201cthat it is not the making of the statement in circumstances establishing reliability to which this change in the rule is intended to refer but rather only the mechanics by which the statement is made.\u201d While this comment is cryptic, we are satisfied that the Committee did not intend that the \u201cspecial reliability\u201d requirement relate solely to mechanical authenticity of the statement; it simply pointed out that the 1982 amendments brought within the ambit of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) statements which had previously been excluded because of the mechanics by which they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Rule calls for all the relevant \u201ccircumstances\u201d surrounding the prior inconsistent statement to be evaluated in determining whether its \u201creliability\u201d has been sufficiently established.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To be reliable, a prior statement offered under the Rule need not have circumstantial probabilities of trustworthiness equivalent to those reflected in the various exceptions to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 65-66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 2538, 2539, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>597 (1980); <em>State v. D.R., </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 296 (App.Div.1986). The hearsay exceptions are designed generally to admit certain out-of-court statements where the declarant is not a witness at the hearing. Where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>hearsay statement has \u201csome degree of trustworthiness more than the ordinary,\u201d it is admitted \"as not merely the best that can be got from that witness, but better than could ordinarily be expected without the test of cross-examination.\u201d 5 <em>Wig-more, Evidence, </em>(Chadbourn Rev.1974) \u00a7 1420 at 251-252. <em>Cf. Ohio v. Roberts, supra, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2539. But <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) requires the declarant to be a witness at the hearing. The out-of-court statement is thus subject to the scrutiny of cross-examination, which is recognized as the most effective means to test the truth of an out-of-court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>See Lee v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2061, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 525-526 (1986); <em>California v. Green, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>149, 158, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970); <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>415, 418-420, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 1076, 1077, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>934 (1965); <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 404-405, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1068, 1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Since the Rule thus contemplates cross-examination of the declarant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the circumstantial showing of reliability need not be such' as would permit the statement to be admitted in the absence of the declarant. <em>Compare State v. D.R., supra, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 295-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We cannot catalog all of the \u201ccircumstances\u201d which may bear upon the reliability of a statement offered under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a). Certainly they include such considerations as (1) the declarant\u2019s connection to and interest in the matter reported in the out-of-court statement, (2) the person or persons to whom the statement was given, (3) the place and occasion for giving the statement, (4) whether the declarant was then in custody or otherwise the target of investigation, (5) the physical and mental condition of the declarant at the time, (6) the presence or absence of other persons, (7) whether the declarant incriminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ed himself or sought to exculpate himself by his statement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (8) the extent to which the writing is in the declarant\u2019s hand, (9) the presence or absence, and the nature of, any interrogation, (10) whether the offered sound recording or writing contains the entirety, or only a portion or a summary, of the communication, (11) the presence or absence of any motive to fabricate, (12) the presence or absence of any express or implicit pressures, inducements or coercion for the making of the statement, (13) whether the anticipated use of the statement was apparent or made known to the declarant, (14) the inherent believability or lack of believability of the statement and (15) the presence or absence of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">All of the relevant circumstances should be explored at a hearing conducted pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>8 out of the presence of the jury. The role of the trial judge at that, preliminary inquiry is not to determine the credibility of the out-of-court statement. Rather it is for the judge to determine from the proofs whether the prior statement was made or signed under circumstances establishing sufficient reliability that the factfinder may fairly consider it as substantive evidence. <em>Cf. State v. Farrow, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>434, 451 (1972), <em>cert. </em>den. 410 <em>U.S. </em>937, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1396, 35 L.Ed.2d 602 (1973), <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 271-272 (1972). See <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 543 (1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">No <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing was held at trial to determine the admissibility of Plant\u2019s statement under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a). The substance of the statement was presented to the jury by direct examination of Plant without objection by defense counsel; it was only when the State later proffered the statement through Sergeant Williams that defense counsel objected that \u201c[i]t\u2019s hearsay.\u201d Defendant\u2019s present challenge to the admission of Plant\u2019s statement is thus presented as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">There can be no doubt that, if the statement was improperly admitted, the error was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. <em>See State v. LaPorte, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>312, 318-319 (1973). Plant\u2019s inculpation of defendant was the most powerful evidence presented by the State. Defendant was not identified by any other witness except Loney, who had made no pretrial identification and who gave the police a description of the gun-wielder which could be found not to fit defendant. Moreover, there was no physical evidence to place defendant at the scene. There is accordingly a fair degree of possibility that the admission of Plant\u2019s out-of-court statement, if error, led to an unjust verdict. <em>See State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 355 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The present record, however, does not permit us to make a fair judgment as to whether the statement was sufficiently reliable to be admitted in evidence. Because no <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing was held, neither the State nor defendant was called upon to present proofs as to the circumstances or the reliability of the statement and the trial judge was not asked to make findings or conclusions concerning those matters. It would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>most inappropriate for us to attempt any assessment of the statement\u2019s admissibility in that setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We therefore must remand the matter to the Law Division to conduct an appropriate <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing to determine the admissibility of Plant\u2019s statement under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a)(i). At the conclusion of that hearing the trial judge shall set forth in full his findings and conclusions. If he determines that the statement was properly admitted at trial, then defendant\u2019s conviction shall stand.

My single and narrow point of disagreement is engendered by my conviction that a statement given during police interrogation by a suspect in custody which inculpates another is the product of circumstances which are presumptively unreliable. Moreover, rather than submitting the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 issue to a preponderance test, I would impose upon the State the burden of overcoming that presumption of unreliability by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">As cogently explained by the majority opinion, the compromise between the so-called academic and orthodox views which is effected by the present version of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(l)(a) was forged after intensive debate and several false starts and constitutes a unique attempt fairly to resolve the recanting witness problem. It is not my purpose therefore to readdress the relative merits of the orthodox view, represented by <em>Fed.Evid.R. </em>801(d)(1)(A), which limits the substantive admissibility of a prior inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>statement made by a witness-declarant who is subject to cross-examination to statements given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury \u201cat a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition,\u201d and the academic view, as represented by <em>Evid.R. </em>63(1) of 1953 Uniform Rules of Evidence, which would make any prior inconsistent statement of a declarant substantively admissible provided the declarant is present at trial and available for cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">I believe, however, that the widespread rejection of the academic view, and particularly its rejection in the formulation of the federal rule, is instructive in applying the New Jersey compromise rule. <em>See generally </em>21 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5006-5007, 92-113 (1977); Graham, <em>Employing Inconsistent Statements for Impeachment and as Substantive Evidence, </em>75 <em>Mich.L.Rev. </em>1565, 1573-1582 (1977); 28 <em>U.S.C.A., </em>Federal Rules of Evidence, Historical Note to <em>Fed.Evid.R. </em>801 at 133-139. <em>See also Goings v. United States, </em>377 F.2d 753 (8th Cir.1967); <em>State v. Saporen, </em>205 <em>Minn. </em>358, 362, 285 <em>N.W. </em>898, 901 (1939). In short, adherence to the orthodox rule is predicated on the general perception that the unrestricted evidential use of prior statements made even by testifying witnesses would increase the temptation and the opportunity for the distortion of evidence if not its actual fabrication. The New Jersey rule seeks to avoid these obvious dangers by requiring a threshhold judicial determination, by way of an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing, that the prior statement was \u201ccontained in a sound recording or in a writing made or signed by the witness in circumstances establishing its reliability____\u201d I have no doubt that there must be a congeries of circumstantial patterns which could produce a contextually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>reliable statement. I can, however, think of no circumstance more inherently unlikely to produce a reliable statement inculpating another than the custodial interrogation of a person suspected of committing a crime, whether or not the same crime as that of which he inculpates the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The unreliability of such statements is a phenomenon long since recognized by the United States Supreme Court and the New Jersey courts as well. See the cases collected in note 8 of the majority opinion. Thus, as Justice Brennan has recently observed in <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2062, <em>90 L.Ed.2d </em>514, 526 (1986), \u201c[o]ver the years since <em>Douglas [Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>415, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>934 (1965)], the Court has spoken with one voice in declaring presumptively unreliable accomplices\u2019 confessions that incriminate defendants.\u201d And in his concurring opinion in <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>74, 98, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>210, 224, 27 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>213 (1970), Justice Harlan expressed the view that \u201cas a matter of due process * * * a confession of an accomplice resulting from formal police interrogation cannot be introduced as evidence of the guilt of an accused, absent some circumstance indicating authorization or adoption.\u201d And while I appreciate the majority\u2019s point that this condemnation of the custodial statement as \u201cpresumptively suspect\u201d and as raising a \u201cspecial suspicion\u201d has generally been made in the context of the confrontation clause, nevertheless, I do not regard the force or substance of the condemnation, which is based solely on the circumstances in which the statement is made, as in any way diluted by variations in the subsequent trial circumstances in which it is offered as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In short, while I agree that all of the factors enumerated by the majority are relevant to the judicial determination of circumstantial reliability, it is my view that the single factor of the formal custodial interrogation of a declarant himself suspected of crime militates so strongly against a reliability conclusion as to preclude the technique of simply considering that factor along with all the others. I would consequently accord that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>factor presumptive effect in establishing non-reliability and would require that presumption to be overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The 1953 Uniform Rules were subsequently replaced by the 1974 Uniform Rules. <em>Evid.R. </em>801(d)(1)(A) of the 1974 Uniform Rules is identical to the federal counterpart. <em>See generally, </em>13 <em>U.L.A. </em>at 197-200, respecting the historical and analytical relationships among the Federal Rules of Evidence, the 1953 Uniform Rules and the 1974 Uniform Rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
