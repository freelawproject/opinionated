We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Plaintiff Robert Tonsberg (plaintiff) sustained personal injuries while a passenger in a bus owned by defendant VIP Coach Lines, Inc. (VIP) and operated by defendant Brian Smith (Smith). When the bus swerved to avoid another vehicle driven by an unidentified motorist, plaintiff was thrown forward in the bus, thereby sustaining back injuries. Plaintiff Ellen Tonsberg sued <em>per quod.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">It was stipulated that VIP and Smith were liable to the extent of 80% and the phantom driver 20%. Defendant Kemper Insurance Company paid $15,000 to plaintiff on behalf of the phantom driver under an uninsured motorist provision. A trial as to damages only against defendants VIP and Smith resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>jury verdict in favor of plaintiff of $10,205.99 and zero for Mrs. Tonsberg on her <em>per quod </em>claim <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">On this appeal, plaintiffs make the following legal arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">I. THE COURT IMPROPERLY EXCLUDED TESTIMONY REGARDING A THERMOGRAM PERFORMED ON PLAINTIFF BY DR. GETSON AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE OTHER TREATING PHYSICIANS TO COMMENT ON ITS RELIABILITY WHICH EXCLUSION SUBSTANTIALLY PREJUDICED PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">II. A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL IS APPROPRIATE AFTER A JURY VERDICT WHERE THE VERDICT WAS CLEARLY AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">III. THE USE OF DR. WELLS\u2019 CONVICTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTACKING PLAINTIFF\u2019S CREDIBILITY WENT BEYOND THAT PERMITTED BY RULE 20 AND RULE 55 OF EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">IV. THE COMMENTS OF COUNSEL WERE SO CLEARLY IMPROPER AND PREJUDICIAL THAT A NEW TRIAL IS REQUIRED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">V. THE EXCLUSION OF PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS BY DEFENDANT\u2019S EXPERT, DR. THEODORE KUSHNER WAS NOT PROPER PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE RULE 22. PLAINTIFF\u2019S ATTORNEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO SHOW THAT THE DOCTOR MADE INCONSISTENT FINDINGS OF PERMANENCY WHEN THE DOCTOR TESTIFIED AS A PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXPERT TO ESTABLISH BIAS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">At a Rule 8 hearing, plaintiff offered the testimony of Dr. Philip Getson, a doctor of osteopathic medicine licensed in the State of New Jersey. This testimony was offered in support of the admission of a diagnosis of plaintiffs injuries based upon thermography and the admission of the resultant thermograms. In response to a question as to the acceptance of thermography in the relevant community, Dr. Getson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">I believe that the acceptance of thermography has grown dramatically in the past two years, that it is at present accepted by a <em>moderate </em>percentage of the medical community and I find that most of the people who are not utilizing the diagnostic tool at present are uninitiated into its purposes, goals and the part that it plays in the diagnostic armamentarium. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>At the conclusion of the Rule 8 hearing, the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the proffered evidence. The judge based his decision on our opinion in <em>Ferlise v. Eiler, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330 (App.Div.1985), where we concluded that a test or technique may be demonstrated to have a \u201csufficient scientific basis\u201d in any one of three ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">(1) expert testimony as to the <em>general </em>acceptance of the premise being advanced among those in the profession; (2) authoritative scientific and legal writing indicating that the premise enjoys <em>general </em>acceptance in the professional community; and (3) judicial opinions that indicate that the expert\u2019s premise has gained <em>general </em>acceptance. <em>See State v. Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>[178] at 210; <em>State v. Cavallo, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>[508] at 521. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">[202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Since the degree of acceptance must be \u201cgeneral\u201d and Dr. Getson testified to only a \u201cmoderate\u201d degree of acceptance, the trial judge concluded there was not a sufficient scientific basis upon which to admit the proffered thermography testimony. The judge observed that another of plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses, an orthopedist, had testified that \u201cthe jury was still out\u201d [on thermography] and he really wasn\u2019t personally in a position to attest favorably on the subject matter. The trial judge concluded: \u201cIt [thermography] is not shown to be generally accepted in the medical community as a reliable diagnostic technique.\u201d The determination of an expert\u2019s competency to testify and of the sufficiency, as distinguished from the weight of the testimony, is primarily for the discretion of the trial judge. An appellate court, however, will interfere where there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Fantini v. Alexander, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 109 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We recognize that evidence based upon thermography was admitted in a personal injury action, after a Rule 8 hearing, in the same courthouse where the instant case was tried. The opinion of the trial court in that case is reported in <em>Procida v. McLaughlin, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396 (Law Div.1984). In <em>Ferlise v. Eiler, supra, </em>we acknowledged the conclusion by the trial court in <em>Procida, </em>that a \u201cthermogram is a diagnostic tool with a sufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>reliable results.\u201d There, the expert testified that \u201cthermography is accepted by a substantial segment of the medical profession.\u201d 195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We also recognize there was no Rule 8 hearing prior to receipt of the evidence in <em>Ferlise v. Eiler. </em>There, we concluded: \u201cWe are unable to say from the record before us that thermography <em>per se </em>is sufficiently reliable and accepted in the medical community as to permit the admission of thermograms in evidence.\u201d 202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334-335. We further observed that no evidence was offered \u201cthat the procedure has been <em>generally </em>accepted in the medical community as a reliable diagnostic technique.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. [Emphasis supplied.] Recently our Supreme Court has reaffirmed acceptance of the rule announced in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 <em>F. </em>1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923), that \u201cgeneral acceptance in the field to which [the technique] belongs,\u201d is a crucial factor in finding that there is \u201csufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably reliable results.\u201d <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>373 (1987) (excluding voice-print evidence). In reliance upon our statement in <em>Ferlise v. Eiler </em>that the technique must be <em>generally </em>accepted, the trial judge here concluded that \u201cmoderate\u201d acceptance was inadequate and disallowed the evidence. We do not find such conclusion to be an abuse of his discretion. Future use of thermography as a reasonably reliable scientific method, however, may not be precluded if more thorough proofs as to its reliability are introduced in other litigation. Cf. <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Plaintiffs third point results from disclosure that one of his treating physicians had been convicted of mail fraud. In the course of cross-examining the treating physician as to his treatment of plaintiff, defense counsel asked him about the number of patients he sees per day. In the course of that cross-examination, the following testimony developed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">Q. Well, I guess it\u2019s not really that much because some of the time you were in jail, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">Q. Well, let\u2019s talk about that federal conviction now for a minute. In September, 1984 you were convicted of fraud; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">A. Mail fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Q. And that concerned one of your patients, one of your medical patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACH\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">Q. And that patient, what was his name or her name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">A. Patricia Haggerty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Q. And Patricia Haggerty was involved in a motor vehicle accident, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axa\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">Q. And came to you for treatment resulting from that accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">Q. And she was involved or at least attempting to be involved in a lawsuit because of that accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">A. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">Q. Personal injury lawsuit just like this case; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">A. Car opposed to a bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-17\">Q. Same kind of lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-19\">Q. Now, in the fraud case, that one was in Pennsylvania, right, or at least the claim was going to be in Pennsylvania?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-20\">A. The accident was in Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-21\">Q. And back at that time Pennsylvania had a law that said somebody couldn\u2019t sue for a car accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-22\">MR. REISER: Objection. I think this goes beyond the proper cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-23\">THE COURT: I think it\u2019s quite proper cross-examination, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-24\">MR. ZEEHANDELAAR: Thank you, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-25\">BY MR. ZEEHANDELAAR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-26\">Q. Back at that time, Doctor Wells, in Pennsylvania, you were aware that there was a rule, a law that said you couldn\u2019t sue someone unless you had $750.00 worth of medical bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-27\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-28\">Q. You were aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-29\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-30\">Q. And Patricia Haggerty didn\u2019t have $750.00 worth of medical bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-31\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-32\">Q. So you faked one for her; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-33\">A. I added visits where no visits existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-34\">Q. You made up a bill in order to help her with her lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-35\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-36\">Q. And you knew the reason for that bill was so that she could sue someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Q. And you wanted to help your patient with her lawsuit, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">Q. But you got caught?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">Q. Last year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">Q. The indictment was in the spring of 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">Q. And the conviction was in September of 1984, just 13 months ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">Q. And you went to the federal penitentiary for three months; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-17\">Q. When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-18\">A. October 1st of \u201984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">Plaintiff contends that the doctor\u2019s conviction was used to attack the credibility of plaintiff and went beyond that permitted by <em>Evidence Rules </em>20 and 55. No limiting instruction was sought by plaintiff, nor was any given by the trial judge, either at the time the evidence was received or in his charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">Even though this was a civil case, evidence of Dr. Wells\u2019 criminal conviction was clearly admissible for the purpose of attacking his credibility. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12; <em>see also Harvey v. Craw, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 75 (App.Div.1970), certif. den. 56 <em>N.J. 479 </em>(1970). While a limiting instruction would have been appropriate, no request was made for such an instruction. Plaintiff must be deemed to have waived such instruction as unnecessary for his protection. <em>See Gindin v. Baron, </em>16 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8 (App.Div.1951). Although the trial judge did not mention the doctor\u2019s criminal conviction in his jury charge, plaintiff\u2019s attorney said he had \u201cno exceptions to the charge.\u201d <em>See R. </em>1:7-2. We find no error relating to the evidence of Dr. Wells\u2019 criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">We have carefully examined defense counsel\u2019s summation in light of plaintiff\u2019s contention that counsel made improper comments. The statements made by defense counsel concerning Dr. Wells\u2019 conviction were based upon testimony in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and constituted fair comment. Defense counsel conceded that plaintiff suffered a back injury in the accident as evidenced by X-rays taken at the hospital. However, he argued from the evidence that the injuries were not of the serious and permanent nature alleged by plaintiff. It was plaintiffs counsel, in summation, who suggested that defendant was portraying plaintiff as a faker. We find no such contention expressed in defense counsel's summation, only a depreciation of the seriousness of the injuries alleged. We find no error in defense counsel\u2019s comments in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">On cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert physician, plaintiff\u2019s counsel sought to demonstrate through several patients\u2019 records and reports that when the doctor appeared as a plaintiff\u2019s expert \u201cthere was always a permanent psychiatric disability, no matter how trivial the injury,\u201d but when he appeared as a defense examiner, \u201cthere was never a permanent psychiatric disability, no matter how severe the injury was.\u201d It is appropriate under <em>Evidence Rule </em>22 to confront a witness with prior inconsistent statements to affect his credibility. However, plaintiff\u2019s counsel was not confronting the doctor with prior statements concerning the plaintiff in this case, but rather concerning other patients, with other injuries and under other circumstances. Whether the probative value of a particular piece of evidence is outweighed by the risk that its admission will either (a) necessitate undue consumption of time, or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice is a decision normally left to the discretion of the trial judge, and this discretion is a broad one. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 215 (1984); <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1978). Such a decision will not be disturbed in the absence of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">It is obvious that the attempt to confront the witness with records of some, but not all, of his patients was irrelevant to the issues before the court. Even assuming those cases would demonstrate that the doctor took a different position, substantial time would be necessary to develop the circumstances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>which that position was taken. Thus, under <em>Evidence Rule </em>4, even if relevant, the evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, although the trial judge expressed his understanding of plaintiff\u2019s chagrin in having his case affected by the criminal conviction of his treating physician, he concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">[T]he verdict of the jury, low though it be, doubtless is the result of this jury\u2019s impression of credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Although it does not shock the conscience of this court, I must concede, and for the benefit of an appeals review of this subject matter, I will concede and state on the record that I was surprised at the quantum of the verdict. However, the applicable rule, 4:49-l(a), states that the trial judge shall grant the motion if having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses it clearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law. I do not feel that I can justifiably make a finding that there was clearly and convincingly a miscarriage of justice under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">As to the verdict of zero dollars for Mrs. Tonsberg, the trial judge held \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any justification for me to disturb that verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\"><em>R. </em>4:49-l(a) provides that a trial judge shall grant a motion for a new trial \u201cif, having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, it clearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d A trial judge should not interfere with the quantum of damages assessed by a jury unless it is so disproportionate to the injuries and resulting disabilities shown as to shock his conscience and to convince him that to sustain the award would be manifestly unjust. <em>Taweel v. Starn\u2019s Shoprite Supermarket, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>227, 236 (1971). On review of the trial judge\u2019s action, the appellate court \u201cmust be concerned with the same norm of decision.\u201d <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 599 (1977). However, the appellate court must give due deference to the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146 (1964), Justice Hall described the \u201cwrongness\u201d needed to justify an appellate or trial judge undping a jury verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">While this feeling of \u2018wrongness\u2019 is difficult to define, because it involves the reaction of trained judges in the light of their judicial and human experience, it can well be said that that which must exist in the reviewing mind is a definite conviction that the judge went so wide of the mark, a mistake must have been made. This sense of \u2018wrongness\u2019 can arise in numerous ways\u2014from manifest lack of inherently credible evidence to support the finding, obvious overlooking or underevaluation of crucial evidence, a clearly unjust result, and many others. <em>[Id. </em>at 162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">After a thorough examination of the record in this case, we are convinced that there was no miscarriage of justice under the law. We cannot say the trial judge erred in sustaining the jury award.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Defendant Caesar\u2019s Broadway Regency Hotel &amp; Casino was granted summary judgment \"as to all claims.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
