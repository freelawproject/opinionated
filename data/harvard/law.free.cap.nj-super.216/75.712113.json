In an opinion reported at 212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 514 <em>A.</em>2d 873, the Law Division ordered a chief of police to issue Sbitani a firearms purchaser identification card. The chief had \u201cdisapproved\u201d the application because Sbitani had been convicted of a \u201cnarcotics/dangerous drug offense.\u201d The conviction occurred in Virginia and was based on Sbitani\u2019s possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana, a disorderly persons offense had the offense occurred in New Jersey. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-20a(4). The trial judge concluded that because a criminal conviction bars a person from obtaining a purchaser identification card, a disorderly persons conviction cannot be a bar. That would only be so if conviction of a crime were the only statutory bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c defines five categories of persons to whom a card may not be issued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Persons convicted of a crime constitute one category. Among the other four is one \u201cwhere the issuance would not be in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7, a person in one of several defined categories \u201cwho purchases, owns, possesses or controls any [weapon enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lr] is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.\u201d A \u201cweapon\u201d includes a \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lr. A \u201cfirearm\u201d includes a rifle and a shotgun. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf. One category of persons who under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:39-7 may not purchase, own or possess weapons is \u201cany person who has been convicted for the unlawful use, possession or sale of a controlled dangerous substance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>defined in ... [N.J.S.A.] 24:21-3 et seq.\u201d Marijuana is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-5(e)(10) as a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">It would obviously not be \u201cin the interest of the public health, safety or welfare\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5) to issue a firearms purchaser identification card to a person who would be committing a crime under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7 were he to use the card to purchase a rifle or a shotgun. It therefore follows that a person may not obtain a purchaser identification card if he \u201chas been convicted for the unlawful ... possession\u201d of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The Legislature expressly anticipated that a disorderly persons offense may be a bar to issuance of a purchaser identification card. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3e provides that an application for a card shall \u201cset forth ... whether [the applicant] has ever been convicted of a ... disorderly persons offense____\u201d An affirmative response to that question could not only disclose one or more disqualifying CDS convictions but also one or more convictions for such dangerous conduct as assault,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which may properly prompt a police chief to deny the applicant a firearms purchaser identification card because \u201cissuance would not be in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">No person of good character and good repute in the community in which he lives, and who is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in this section or other sections of this chapter, shall be denied a permit to purchase a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card, except as hereinafter set forth.
