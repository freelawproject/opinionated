After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-20\">On October 2, 2003, Griffey was convicted in Illinois state court of two counts of \u201cChild Pornography\u201d and one count of \u201cAggravated Criminal Sexual Abuse.\u201d He received sentences of two and three years, respectively, which ran concurrently. Griffey completed his sentences and was released from custody on May 23, 2006. He registered as a sex offender under Illinois law on May 24, 2006, the day after his release. Griffey was notified of his obligation under Illinois law to update his registration if he changed his address. In August 2007, Griffey moved from Illinois <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>to Spanish Fort, Alabama but did not update his registration in Illinois and did not register in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">On September 25, 2008, Griffey was indicted in federal court in Alabama for knowingly failing to register as a sex offender as required by SORNA after traveling in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). The indictment alleged that, \u201c[o]n or about May 24, 2007 continuing through May 2, 2008, in the Southern District of Alabama, Southern Division and elsewhere,\u201d Griffey knowingly failed to register as a sex offender as required by SORNA by reason of his Illinois conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">Griffey moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that (1) SORNA did not apply to him because Alabama had not implemented SORNA at the time he was alleged to have failed to register; (2) he was not notified by state or federal authorities of his duty to register under SORNA after his release from prison in Illinois on May 28, 2006; and (3) SORNA\u2019s registration requirements are unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. The district court denied Griffey\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">Griffey pled guilty. In his plea agreement, Griffey expressly reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. In the plea agreement, Griffey admitted that he \u201csigned an Illinois Sex Offender registration form advising him that he was required to register within five days of moving\u201d and that he \u201cadmitted that he knew he had failed to register as a sex offender and admitted to being a resident of Spanish Fort [Alabama] since August 2007.\u201d During the plea colloquy, Griffey also admitted that he knew that he was supposed to register as a sex offender in Alabama<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he knew he was supposed to have registered in Illinois. The district court accepted Griffey\u2019s plea, adjudicated him guilty, and sentenced him to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 10 years\u2019 supervised release. Griffey timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">On appeal, Griffey contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because (1) SORNA does not apply to him because Alabama had not implemented the statute at the time he failed to register as a sex offender; and (2) the government failed to give him notice of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court recently rejected similar claims in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1349 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, we review that decision in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-15\">The defendant in <em>Brown </em>was convicted of sex offenses in 1996 in North Carolina and signed a form requiring him to register upon his release from prison. In 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>Brown registered in North Carolina and was told to notify North Carolina within 30 days of changing his address. In June 2007, Brown moved from North Carolina to Alabama where he resided until June 12, 2008 without registering his address in Alabama. Brown pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) by knowingly failing to register in Alabama and to update his registration as required by SORNA. However, Brown, like Griffey, conditioned his guilty plea on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">In affirming Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2250(a) conviction, this Court first determined that as of February 28, 2007,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SORNA \u201cretroactively applies to sex offenders, like Brown, who were convicted before SORNA\u2019s enactment\u201d in July 2006. <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1348. The Court next rejected Brown\u2019s claim that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements do not apply to sex offenders with pre-SORNA convictions, such as himself, because Alabama had not yet implemented SORNA, and that any duty to register would arise only after Alabama implements SORNA. The <em>Brown </em>Court pointed out that Brown \u201cfail[ed] to appreciate the distinction between a jurisdiction\u2019s duty to implement SORNA and a sex offender\u2019s duty to register.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1348. Although Alabama had until July 27, 2009 to implement SORNA\u2019s requirements,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> SORNA \u201capplies to sex offenders regardless of whether the relevant jurisdiction has incorporated SORNA\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349. The <em>Broum </em>Court stressed that SORNA was not enacted in a vacuum and that every state had a sex offender registration law prior to 2006, <em>id., </em>and agreed with the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits that an individual \u201cmay therefore comply with SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by registering through the state\u2019s sex offender registry, even if that jurisdiction has not implemented SORNA\u2019s administrative procedures.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Gould, </em>568 F.3d 459, 464 (4th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Sep. 25, 2009) (No. 09-6742); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>551 F.3d 578, 582 (7th Cir.2008), <em>cert. granted, Carr v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 47, 174 L.Ed.2d 631 (2009); <em>United States v. Hinckley, </em>550 F.3d 926, 939 (10th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2383, 173 L.Ed.2d 1301 (2009)); <em>see also United States v. George, </em>579 F.3d 962, 965 (9th Cir.2009). Because Alabama maintained a sex offender registry during the relevant time, Brown \u201ccould have registered as a sex offender through Alabama\u2019s sex offender program,\u201d and thus SORNA applied to Brown. <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1349. Accordingly, our decision in <em>Brown </em>forecloses Griffey\u2019s argument that SORNA did not apply to him in 2007-08 because Alabama had not yet implemented SORNA\u2019s administrative requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-14\"><em>Brown </em>also addressed the statutory notice and due process arguments that Grif-fey makes. In <em>Brown, </em>this Court recognized that \u201c[pjursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16917(a), an appropriate official must notify a sex offender of his duty to register before the defendant\u2019s release from custody, or immediately after sentencing if the defendant is not in custody.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>Here, as in <em>Brown, </em>Griffey concedes the statutory notice requirement in \u00a7 16917(a) \u201cdoes not encompass sex offenders, like him, who have already served their sentences prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Id.. </em>For those pre-enactment sex offenders, such as Griffey, Congress delegated authority to the Attorney General, pursuant to \u00a7 16917(b), to prescribe rules for their notification. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16917(b). As <em>Brown </em>notes, the Attorney General issued those rules in July 2008, <em>see </em>73 Fed.Reg. at 38063-64, which was after defendant Brown\u2019s indictment. <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1350. Griffey was indicted in September 2008, shortly after the notification rules were enacted. <em>Brown </em>pointed out, however, that these rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-5\">[EJncourage jurisdictions to inform pre-SORNA sex offenders, such as Brown, \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d about SORNA\u2019s requirements. The National Guidelines recognize that \u201cit may not be feasible for a jurisdiction to do so immediately\u201d and therefore provide time frames within which a jurisdiction must register a sex offender <em>\u201cwhen </em>it implements the SOR-NA requirements in its system[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1350-51. (citing 73 Fed.Reg. at 38063-64) (internal citations omitted). The <em>Brown </em>Court concluded that because Alabama had not implemented SORNA\u2019s requirements into its registry program during the time period charged in the indictment, \u201cAlabama did not have a duty to notify Brown of his duty to register.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. The same holds for Griffey: Alabama had no duty to notify him of the duty to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">To the extent Griffey argues the federal government must notify him of his legal duty to register under SORNA, that argument fails too. Section 2250(a), which criminalizes a failure to register, does not contain an element that the government notify the offender that he or she has registration obligations under SORNA prior to a \u00a7 2250(a) prosecution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). Section 2250(a) does not require that Griffey specifically know that he was violating SORNA, but only that he \u201cknowingly\u201d violated a legal registration requirement upon relocating. <em>See Gould, </em>568 F.3d at 468 (\u201cIn 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a), \u2018knowingly\u2019 modifies \u2018fails to register.\u2019 There is no language requiring specific intent or a willful failure to register such that [a defendant] must know his failure to register violated federal law.\u201d); <em>Hinckley, </em>550 F.3d at 938 (rejecting argument that federal government had duty to notify defendant of his duty to register, where defendant acknowledged he knew of his duty to register under state law). Here, in his plea colloquy Griffey admitted that he knew he was required to register in Alabama upon moving but did not register, which is sufficient to violate \u00a7 2250(a). Griffey cites no authority for the proposition that a lack of notice by the federal government of his SORNA obligations is an element of, or a defense to, prosecution under \u00a7 2250(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\"><em>Brown </em>also impacts Griffey\u2019s due process claim. The Court in <em>Brown </em>pointed out that Brown had actual notice that under Alabama law he was required to register as a sex offender in Alabama, but Brown\u2019s \u201cplea agreement [did] not specify whether his duty to register fell under state law or SORNA.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1351. Nonetheless, in <em>Brown, </em>\u201cwe joinfed] our sister circuits in concluding that \u2018notice of a duty to register under state law is sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 262 (5th Cir.2009); citing <em>Gould, </em>568 F.3d at 468-69; <em>Dixon, </em>551 F.3d at 584; <em>Hinckley, </em>550 F.3d at 938; <em>United States v. May, </em>535 F.3d 912, 921 (8th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2431, 174 L.Ed.2d 229 (2009)). Like the defendant in <em>Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Griffey knew of his duty to register as a sex offender in Alabama, the state in which he is alleged to have failed to register under SORNA. <em>Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-16\"><em>Brown </em>also stressed that \u201c[i]n addition to actual notice, there were sufficient circumstances to prompt Brown to have inquired upon his duty to register.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. The circumstances identified by the <em>Brown </em>Court as prompting an individual duty to inquire are also present here: (1) Griffey was convicted in Illinois as a sex offender; (2) Griffey had notice of his duty to register under Illinois law in May 2006 and to inform authorities of a change of address; (3) Griffey complied with the Illinois registration requirements by registering in Illinois in May 2006; (4) the Jacob Wetterling Act was enacted in 1994, setting national standards for sex offender registration and notification; and (5) sex offender registration laws exist in every state and have \u201cgarnered national media attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. Therefore, in light of Griffey\u2019s admission that knew he was supposed to register in Alabama and the circumstances prompting a need to inquire into such a duty, we find no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-17\">In his final argument, Griffey asserts that SORNA\u2019s provisions making it a federal crime to register as a sex offender are unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. This issue, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Ambert, </em>561 F.3d at 1210-12, in which we concluded that Congress did not exceed its authority under the Commerce Clause in enacting SOR-NA\u2019s failure-to-register provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-18\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-19\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Griffey\u2019s motion to dismiss. We therefore affirm Grif-fey\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">. SORNA imposed upon all sex offenders convicted prior to July 27, 2006 an obligation to register beginning on February 28, 2007, the date the Attorney General promulgated the interim rule making SORNA retroactively applicable. <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1207 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Dumont, </em>555 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 66, 175 L.Ed.2d 49 (2009). Thus, SORNA applied to Griffey's indictment which alleged failure to register from May 24, 2007 to May 2, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">. Alabama law requires sex offenders residing within the state, even if convicted in another state, to register, and provides for community notification of released sex offenders. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-11-200, 15-20-22(a)(4), 15-20-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1391-17\">.We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seher, </em>562 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2009).
