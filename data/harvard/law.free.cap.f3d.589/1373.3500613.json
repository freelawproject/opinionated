This case presents an issue of first impression in our circuit\u2014 whether a defendant, who was convicted under the Assimilative Crimes Act (\u201cACA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, and who has served the state statutory maximum term of incarceration, may be sentenced to further imprisonment upon revocation of his supervised release. English was convicted under the ACA of a felony driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d). Because he already served Florida\u2019s statutory maximum of five years in prison, he contends that the ACA\u2019s \u201clike punishment\u201d clause prohibited the court from sentencing him to an additional 24 months of imprisonment for violating his supervised release. We disagree and AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-20\">In March 2004, English pled guilty to a felony DUI at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 316.193(2)(b) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 13. This was English\u2019s seventh DUI offense. Florida law prescribes that a conviction for a fourth or subsequent DUI is a felony in the third degree, subject to a maximum five-year term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 316.193(2)(b)3 and 775.083(3)(d) (2002). The district court sentenced English to the maximum term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. As part of his supervised release terms, English was prohibited from committing a federal, state, or local crime, and from consuming alcoholic beverages. He was also required to notify his probation officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>within 72 hours of being arrested by a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">In May 2009, English admitted violating his supervised release by: (1) committing a new violation of law; (2) failing to notify his probation officer within 72 hours of his arrest; and (3) consuming alcohol. At his revocation hearing, English acknowledged his alcohol problem and accepted responsibility for his actions. He asked that he be allowed to spend time with his mother, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. The government rebutted that this was English\u2019s eighth arrest for a DUI. The prosecutor also mentioned that English was under the influence of alcohol when he appeared in court in Alabama for the DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">Based on the parties\u2019 statements and the violation report, the court determined that English had violated the terms of his supervised release. The court stated that it had considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as well as the advisory guidelines. The court then imposed a sentence of 24 months of imprisonment with no supervision to follow. Despite his counsel\u2019s advice to the contrary, English objected to the sentence on grounds that the court did not have authority under the ACA to sentence him to any prison time since he had completed the state statutory maximum period of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">On appeal, English does <em>not </em>challenge the legality of his underlying 2004 sentence which imposed the three-year term of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, he focuses on the sanction imposed for violating his supervised release. He argues that the ACA bars federal courts from sentencing a defendant to imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release if that defendant has already served the maximum prison term authorized by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of the law to a sentence. <em>United States v. Cenna, </em>448 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). The ACA grants federal courts jurisdiction over state law violations that are not proscribed by any federal statute and that occur in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. <em>See United States v. Gaskell, </em>134 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.1998); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. \u201cProsecution under the ACA is for enforcement of federal law assimilating a state statute, not for enforcement of state law.\u201d <em>Gaskell, </em>134 F.3d at 1042. The \u201clike punishment\u201d clause at issue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2l\">(a) Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title, or on, above, or below any portion of the territorial sea of the United States not within the jurisdiction of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>act or omission, <em>shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a) (2009). According to English, the ACA\u2019s mandate of \u201clike punishment\u201d bars a court from imposing a term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release if that defendant has already served the state\u2019s statutory maximum punishment. The only case English cites in support of his argument is the unpublished 1994 Fourth Circuit case of <em>United States v. McCabe, </em>23 F.3d 404, 1994 WL 159455 (4th Cir. Apr. 29, 1994) (per curiam) (unpublished).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we must evaluate the ACA through the lens of our own precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">As a general matter, it is a \u201cwell-settled rule that a term of supervised release may be imposed <em>in addition to </em>the statutory maximum term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Cenna, </em>448 F.3d at 1281 (emphasis added). This is because federal policy dictates that the term of a defendant\u2019s supervised release is \u201can independent part of the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a) (granting courts the authority to include \u201cas a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">We have applied this general rule even in the context of an ACA conviction. <em>See United States v. Burke, </em>113 F.3d 211 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). In <em>Burke, </em>the defendant was sentenced to the statutory maximum of one year in prison followed by one year of supervised release for violating Maryland\u2019s DUI law under the ACA. <em>See id. </em>at 211. We agreed with the Fourth Circuit that the ACA does not limit the total term of imprisonment plus supervised release to the maximum term of incarceration authorized under the assimilated state law. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>75 F.3d 173, 178 (4th Cir.1996)). Moreover, we expressly adopted the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Pierce. See id. </em>The Fourth Circuit explained its rationale as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-9\">As previously noted, a federal court will not adopt provisions of state law that conflict with federal sentencing policy. If limited to the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by the state, a district court would not be able to impose an appropriate term of supervised release upon individuals it determined to be in need of postincarceration supervision, even though the crime was committed within an area of federal jurisdiction. Since under federal policy supervised release is considered distinct from incarceration and available in addition to any term of imprisonment, adopting Pierce\u2019s argument would create an ACA sentencing rule that conflicts with federal sentencing policy regarding the imposition of supervised release. We refuse to sanction such an exception for ACA defendants. Consequently, we hold that under the ACA, the total sentence \u2014 a term of incarceration followed by supervised release \u2014 properly may exceed the maximum term of incarceration provided for by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\"><em>Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-11\">As English points out, the defendant in <em>Burke </em>did not violate supervised release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>and was not sentenced to additional prison time that combined to exceed the assimilated statutory maximum period of incarceration. Consequently, <em>Burke </em>did not reach the exact issue presented in this case \u2014 whether a defendant, convicted under the ACA, can be sentenced upon revocation of supervised release to a term of imprisonment if the defendant has already served the statutory maximum incarceration period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">We have specifically addressed this issue in non-ACA cases. In <em>United States v. Proctor, </em>127 F.3d 1311, 1313 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam), we concluded that the district court had the authority to sentence a defendant to one year in prison for violating his supervised release terms despite the fact that he had already served the maximum statutory prison term. The court\u2019s authority stemmed from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which \u201cunambiguously grant[ed] the district court discretion in certain circumstances to revoke the term of supervised release and \u2018require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3)). Depriving the court of that authority \u201cwould impair the deterrent mechanism which we feel was obviously intended by Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, in <em>Cenna, </em>we rejected a federal prisoner\u2019s argument that her sentence was illegal because if she violated her supervised release, she would be subject to additional prison time beyond the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See Cenna, </em>448 F.3d at 1281. In affirming her sentence, we cited a Second Circuit case for the proposition that the \u201c \u2018well-settled rule [is] that punishment for a violation of supervised release, when combined with punishment for the original offense, may exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying substantive offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d 165, 170 n. 3 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">The rationale underlying these cases applies with equal force to a conviction under the ACA. Under <em>Burke, </em>courts have the authority to sentence a defendant convicted under the ACA to a combined term of imprisonment and supervised release that exceeds the maximum statutory term of incarceration. <em>See Burke, </em>113 F.3d at 211. The primary function of supervised release is to provide post-imprisonment supervision over the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. <em>See Gaskell, </em>134 F.3d at 1044. When a defendant violates the terms of his release, the court has the authority to revoke supervised release and sentence the defendant to further incarceration. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). It would be illogical to grant courts the power to impose supervised release in excess of the statutory maximum term of incarceration, as we have in <em>Burke, </em>yet deny courts their authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) to sanction a defendant\u2019s violation of his release terms by additional incarceration. Without such authority, supervised release would significantly lack \u201cthe deterrent mechanism which we feel was obviously intended by Congress.\u201d <em>Proctor, </em>127 F.3d at 1314 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">Moreover, adopting English\u2019s argument \u201cwould create an ACA sentencing rule that conflicts with federal sentencing policy regarding the imposition of supervised release.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 178. The ACA\u2019s \u201clike punishment\u201d clause does not require the assimilation of state law provisions when they conflict with federal policy. <em>See Gaskell, </em>134 F.3d at 1044 (\u201cWhen assimilated state law provisions conflict with federal policy, federal policy controls.\u201d); <em>accord United States v. Pate, </em>321 F.3d 1373, 1376 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cState law is not assimilated for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 if it conflicts with federal law.\u201d). Consequently, to the extent that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) conflicts with Flori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>da\u2019s statutory maximum term of incarceration, the federal law must trump. <em>See Gaskell, </em>134 F.3d at 1040 (holding that \u201cfederal judges sentencing under the ACA may exceed the state statutory maximum term for a sentence of probation when necessary to effectuate the policies behind the federal probation statutes\u201d); <em>Burke, </em>113 F.3d at 211 (affirming a sentence of imprisonment plus supervised release that exceeds the state maximum term); <em>Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 178 (emphasizing that, under the ACA, federal sentencing policy regarding supervised release overrides conflicting state law provisions regarding maximum terms of incarceration).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the ACA does not require an exception to the \u201cwell-settled rule that punishment for a violation of supervised release, when combined with punishment for the original offense, may exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying substantive offense.\u201d <em>Cenna, </em>448 F.3d at 1281 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the district court did not violate the ACA\u2019s \u201clike punishment\u201d clause when it sentenced English to 24 months of imprisonment, pursuant to his revocation of supervised release, even though he had already served the state statutory maximum term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">In sum, the district court possessed the authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) to sentence English to a 24-month prison term for violating his supervised release terms despite his having served the maximum statutory prison term for his assimilated crime. We therefore AFFIRM English\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1401-8\">. English previously challenged his 2004 sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. English, </em>Nos. 3:03cr126/LAC, 3:04cv454/LAC/MD, 2005 WL 5979630, at *1 (N.D.Fla. Oct. 27, 2005). One of the issues raised was whether the court had authority to impose a three-year period of supervised release that, when combined with the 60-month term of imprisonment, exceeded the five-year statutory maximum term of incarceration. <em>See id. </em>at *11. Following established precedent, the district court held that ''[t]he imposition of a term of supervised release to be served following the defendant\u2019s release from prison is not improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We denied a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v.

The Fourth Circuit confined its holding to the particular case before it: \"Without deciding the larger question of whether the statutory maximum may <em>ever </em>be exceeded in the context of revocation of supervised release, we are of the opinion that the ACA limited the court\u2019s authority in this case to sentence McCabe to no more than a <em>total </em>of one year in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. <em>McCabe </em>has not been subsequently cited by any <em>court.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
