The residuary estate is left to the executors in trust for the widow during her life. The will then proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-20\">\u201cAnd upon her death, I direct that my said entire estate, or as much thereof as shall remain, be divided among all my children in equal shares, and should any of my children die, leaving issue surviving such issue shall take the share the parent would have taken if living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The case has been argued as if the question involved were whether the appellant had a vested or contingent interest in the property. This is a common, but not strictly accurate, use of words'. Ever since the Revised Statutes, at least, all expectant estates have been alienable, whether vested or contingent. 1 Rev. St. p. 725, \u00a7 35 ; Real Property Law (Laws 1896, c. 547) \u00a7 49; Laws 1909, c. 52 (Consol. Laws, c. 50) \u00a7 11; Personal Property Law (Laws 1897, c. 417) \u00a7 2; Laws 1909, c. 45 (Consol. Laws, c. 41) \u00a7 11; Moore v. Littel, 41 N. Y. 66, 83-86; Dodge v. Stevens, 105 N. Y. 585, 588, 12 N. E. 759; Griffin v. Shepard, 124 N. Y. 70, 26 N. E. 339; Roosa v. Harrington, 171 N. Y. 341, 353, 64 N. E. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The real question is whether appellant has any present interest at all, whether vested or contingent. Upon this question we have the highest authority for saying that the cases are not at all in harmony. Connelly v. O\u2019Brien, 166 N. Y. 406, 409, 60 N. E. 20. We incline to the opinion that they preponderate in favor of the position that he has no present interest. \u2022 Matter of Crane, 164 N. Y. 71, 58 N. E. 47; Dougherty v. Thompson, 167 N. Y. 472, 60 N. E. 760; Matter of Keogh, 47 Misc. Rep. 37, 95 N. Y. Supp. 191; Id., 112 App. Div. 414, 98 N. Y. Supp. 433; Id., 186 N. Y. 544, 79 N. E. 1109. If this opinion is correct, he has no estate that is alienable, and therefore none that would pass to the receiver or trustee. In re Hoadley (D. C.) 101 Fed. 233, and cases cited; In re Gardner (D. C.) 106 Fed. 670. The testamentary provision under consideration in the latter case was closely similar to the one which we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
