The latter claim, although sought to be substantiated by proof, was withdrawn by plaintiff at the close of the case. The former issue is that which was submitted to the jury, and upon which a verdict was given in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $900.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">This case was before this Court upon an appeal from a judgment previously obtained, and it was then held that a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor must be reversed, not only because of errors committed at the \u2022trial, but because it was against the weight of evidence. 119 App. Div. 825, 104 N. Y. Supp. 887. The present record is free from the -errors then found; but the other objection, that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, is still applicable to this recovery. The \u25a0existence of the alleged contract of employment depends upon the testimony of the husband, for which there is no substantial corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The card, purporting to be dated August, 1901, which is claimed to \"have been seen by plaintiff\u2019s husband about August 11, 1901, affords -no corr.oboration of his testimony that an agreement for plaintiff\u2019s services was made as testified to by him. Nor does the card itself, assuming it to be genuinely dated, show anything more than a desire \u2022on the part of decedent to see plaintiff at his house. It is barren of any suggestion of a call for the services of a nurse or attendant. The \u2022courts have repeatedly called attention to the necessity for very satisfactory evidence in order to support verbal contracts of the kind here sued upon. Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s husband testified upon this trial that he and his wife \u201ckept house together,\u201d and that the money she -earned \u201cand what he earned\u201d were kept together and used for the \"household expenses and personal expenses for both himself and his wife. And he further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201cIn other words, we had just one fund. What was mine was hers, and what was hers was mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">There can be no doubt that under this testimony plaintiff\u2019s husband was a person interested in the event, within the meaning of section '829 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the refusal to strike out his 'testimony on the ground that he was interested, and that the Code -provision referred to had been violated, when a motion so to do was \u2022duly made at the close of his examination, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All -concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
