It is impossible to sustain it in that form. Davis v. Rosenzweig, 192 N. Y. 128, 84 N. E. 943, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s difficulty results from his attempt in one action to obtain a rescission of the contract for fraud and a judgment establishing a lien for the amount of his deposit on account of the vendor\u2019s inability to give a good title. The trial court found that the defendant, by certain false and fraudulent representations, induced the plaintiff to enter into the contract; also that certain objectiohs to the title, made by the plaintiff, were valid, to wit: (a) That certain unpaid water rents were a lien; (b) that the premises were incumbered by certain monthly tenancies; (c) that the premises were incumbered by rights acquired for the maintenance of an elevated railroad in an adjacent street; (d) that the premises encroached upon the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">It would seem to be a sufficient answer to the objections to the title that the plaintiff testified that he objected to taking title at the time of closing solely because the representations upon which he relied in making the contract were untrue. It is quite plain that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, at the time of closing, made all the technical objections to the title which he could think of, for the sole purpose of laying a foundation for a lawsuit. Moreover, it is undisputed that the defendant was willing to pay the unpaid water rents, and it can easily be inferred that the plaintiff knew of the presence of the elevated railroad in front of the premises and of the so-called monthly tenancies. To show fraud, he relies upon representations of the amount of rentals received. The only evidence to show the street encroachments was a' paper, purporting to be a survey made by a city surveyor; but no attempt was made to lay any foundation for its receipt in evidence, and proper objection and exception were taken to the admission of it. In view of the state of the record, thus outlined, we have no alternative for the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
