The action was brought by the plaintiff, an infant, through her guardian ad litem, to recover damages for personal injuries, alleged to have resulted from plaintiff tripping on a nail, which protruded from the upper part of the stairs in an apartment house, wherein plaintiff resided with her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The evidence shows that the accident happened about 9 :30 a. m.; that plaintiff was in the habit of going up and down the stairs four or five times a day; that at the time of the alleged accident she was looking carefully where she was going, but did not see the nail; that about two weeks before the accident the oilcloth had been removed from the stairs at the point in question, leaving a row of tacks, upon which various tenants had tripped during the course of said two <em>weeks; </em>that the plank at the top of the stairs was broken, and the stairway in a generally unsafe condition. No specific notice to the defendant as to the condition of the stairs was shown; but on all the evidence it was a question for the jury whether such unsafe condition had not existed for a sufficient length of time to charge the owner of the premises with implied notice. The question of defendant\u2019s negligence was, on all the evidence in the case, a question for the jury, and the court erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
