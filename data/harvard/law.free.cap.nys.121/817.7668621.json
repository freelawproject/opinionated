It was her right to be so brought in. Johnston v. Donvan, 106 N. Y. 269, 12 N. E. 594; Uhlfelder v. Tamsen, 15 App. Div. 436, 44 N. Y. Supp. 484; Earle v. Hart, 20 Hun, 75. Having been made a party, she was entitled to such usual service of papers as her notice of appearance demanded. The order of January 21st, making her a party, contained the condition that she appear generally, and serve her answer within three days of the date of the order, and proceed with the trial when reached. The order of January 29th contained \\ihe condition that sh\u00e9 appear and answer \u201cwithin three days after service of a copy of this order and notice of entry thereof, otherwise this motion is denied.\u201d Churchick had scant opportunity for presenting her defense, if such she had, and as the order was entered \u201con motion of Alfred A. Shlickerman, attorney for the plaintiff,\u201d the duty fell on him to make \u201cservice of a copy of this order and notice of entry thereof.\u201d He made no service, not even of the summons and complaint, so far as appears; but on April 16th he obtained an order\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">\u201cthat the order made and entered herein January 29, 1909, resettling the order dated January 15, 1909, and filed January 18, 1909, which was vacated by an order made January 21, 1909, be and the same is hereby vacated and set aside; and said Annie Churchick having failed to comply with the conditions upon which the motion to amend the summons and complaint by making her a party defendant was granted, contained in said order made January 21, 1909, and having failed to appeal- in the action or serve her answer within three days from January 21, 1909, * * * that the motion to amend the summons and complaint by making her a party defendant be and the same is hereby denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The petitioner, Churchick, was not in default; but the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had failed to perform the conditions of his own order. Nevertheless he obtained the order of April 16th, as if he were right and she were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The appeal from the earlier orders was not duly taken, and so far the appeal should be dismissed; but the order of April 16th should be reversed, and Churchick be brought in as a party defendant, upon the condition that she appear in the action and plead within 20 days after the entry of this order and service of a copy thereof, with notice of entry by the plaintiff upon defendant\u2019s attorney, without costs of this appeal to either party, and without prejudice to any proceeding already had in the action pending the determination of the issue raised by Churchick by answer or otherwise. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
